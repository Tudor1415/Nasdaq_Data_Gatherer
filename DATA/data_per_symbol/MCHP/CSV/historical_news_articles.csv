However, is there still value left on the table? That’s the question for those who bought at lower prices, as well as those looking at the stock today.The recent guidance raise could indicate that shares rally even higher from here. Yet, with investors pricing in a recovery, shares may pull back some more if results don’t line up with expectations.Yet, there are other positives to consider. Valuation remains low, leaving room for multiple expansion. Also, “megatrend” exposure could also boost the stock. Granted, there’s still some uncertainty. But, relative to other opportunities out there, MCHP stock may be a solid buy for cautious investors.Let’s dive in, and see why that’s the case.Shares have bounced back tremendously off their lows set in March. But it’s recent news that pushed the stock back to prior price levels.On June 3, the company  for this quarter (ending June 30). With global manufacturing in recovery mode, this makes perfect sense. As factories worldwide reopen, expect increased demand for the company’s integrated circuits.Following the news, investors bid up shares to their 52-week high ($113.28). However, in recent days, the stock has pulled back to around $100 per share.Even with the recent positive developments, the analyst community remains mixed on the company’s prospects.Some analysts, like  Craig Ellis, upgraded the stock and boosted their price targets. However, . The main concern is whether demand has truly improved. It’s possible recent strong results will cool once manufacturing normalizes.In other words, if manufacturing doesn’t see a V-shaped recovery, results could disappoint and send shares to lower levels.However, the stock has plenty of runway if results meet or beat expectations.  for this quarter’s earnings is around $1.39 per share. If the company can beat on earnings like it did last quarter, MCHP stock could move higher. In short, the recent pullback may be a strong buying opportunity.What’s also at play with Microchip Technology? Selling at a discount to peers, shares could move higher thanks to multiple expansion. Also, the company’s exposure to automotive technology “megatrends” is another solid reason to buy shares now.In a June 8 article, InvestorPlace’s Mark Hake included MCHP stock as  that could move higher. And looking at forward price-earnings (P/E) ratios, I agree it’s possible.Right now, Microchip Technology shares trade for a forward P/E of 18.4. That’s far below where peers like  (NASDAQ:) and  (NASDAQ:) trade. These rivals have forward P/E ratios of 27.9 and 28.9, respectively.In short, multiple expansion could happen. Add in the potential for the company to continue beating projections, and it seems likely this stock can catch up valuation-wise to its peers. Perhaps MCHP stock won’t won’t bridge the gap completely, but at least enough to move the needle.Also, shares have another potential mover in motion. That would be increased chip demand thanks to key automotive “megatrends.” As seen in a recent investor presentation,  to automated vehicles, increased connectivity and the pivot to electric vehicles.As cars and trucks become more tech than machinery, MCHP stock stands to benefit. Sure, the automotive end market only makes up 15% of current sales. But, this technological shift could boost demand from this end user market, helping to support long-term growth.Right now, it’s hard to find reasonably priced stocks with upside. With Wall Street banking on a V-shaped recovery, optimism has been more than priced into the market. However, with names like this one, there’s still strong buys out there for cautious investors.With two factors – valuation and “megatrend” exposure – that could help move the needle, this may be a buy-the-dip type of situation.In short, consider the recent pullback a solid entry point to buy MCHP stock.Thomas Niel, contributor to InvestorPlace, has written single-stock analysis since 2016.

"I wanted to find five cheap stocks that have huge price appreciation potential. For these stocks, the valuations are well below their peers.Here, the market is failing to recognize the growth potential of these cheap stocks. In effect, they are value stocks that should be growth stocks. The patient investor — who can withstand temporary dips –will do quite well with these investments.For example, the average price-earnings ratio of this group of cheap stocks is just 17 times earnings. But their peers have much higher P/E ratios. In addition, the same is true of their enterprise value-revenue valuations.The potential upside of each of these stocks is 30% to 50%, as a minimum, based on my target price for each one.Here are the names of this selective group of cheap stocks stocks:Source: Mark R. Hake, CFA
	$27.7 billion19.2x54.9%The first company on my list of cheap stocks is Microchip Technology. It is a large semiconductor product designer and manufacturer based in the U.S. The company makes advanced microcontrollers and microprocessors, as well as memory and flash DRAM products.Its earnings have waned as a result of the novel coronavirus, which has lowered demand. However, now that global restrictions are being lifted, the company expects a significant pickup in orders worldwide.Moreover, its move into selling products for data centers as well as curtailing manufacturing to line up with demand should increase profits.Three of its peers have significantly higher valuations, despite similar industry conditions. Therefore, I suspect the company is worth significantly more than its present price.For example, right now Microchip Technology trades with a forward price-earnings ratio of 20.1 times. This is well below its peers such as  (NASDAQ:), with its forward P/E ratio of 28.6 times. In addition,  (NASDAQ:) has a forward ratio of 27.1 times, and  (NASDAQ:) has a 50.5 times ratio.Using these peer ratios with Microchip Technology’s March 2021 expected earnings of $5.73 per share gives MCHP stock a target price of $170.43. This represents 54.9% upside for investors in the stock.Source: Mark R. Hake, CFA
	$13.1 billion17.2x218.4%GoDaddy is a U.S. domain registrar and web hosting company. It is a very profitable company with over a 23% return on equity in 2019.GoDaddy’s domain bookings and average revenue per user (ARPU) have been growing nicely over the past several years. Moreover, its free cash flow is very strong. Last year, it was over $635 million, and for the last 12 months to March 31, FCF rose to $685 million.Based on the GDDY stock $13.1 billion market value, the FCF yield is very high at over 5%.I like this stock for one simple reason. It is an arbitrage play on the valuations of some of its peers. For example, GDDY stock has a forward P/E of just 17.2 times expected earnings. But some of its peers have massively higher valuations.For example,  (NASDAQ:) has a forward P/E of 215.5 times.  (NYSE:) is at 186 times and  (NYSE:) is at 229 times.The average of these three forward P/E ratios is 210.2 times. I decided to discount these by 75%. The target P/E in my valuation is roughly 54.6 times.Even with that significantly lower P/E valuation, my target price for GDDY stock is $250. That implies potential upside of over 218% from its present price.Source: Mark R. Hake, CFA
	$11.7 billion14.1x57.8%OpenText is a Canadian software company that specializes in enterprise information management (EIM) applications. The company , which performs online backup for personal computers.The company is a serial acquirer of “bolt-on” companies in its space. Recently, it decided to institute a restructuring plan, which may reduce its operating profits in the short term.Nevertheless, its free cash flow in the last 12 months was very respectable. The company generated $904.1 million in cash flow from operations and spent just $68.4 million.That means it generated $835.7 million in FCF. Given its $11.7 billion market value, its FCF yield is very attractive at over 7%Using the same peer valuation method I used in the other stocks above, the average P/E ratio for OTEX stock should be 44.5 times earnings. However, the stock trades for just 14 times its forward earnings.Using a 50% discount factor, I set the price target at 22 times earnings. This means the stock is worth at least $68.06 per share. That represents a very respectable potential upside of 58% for OTEX stock.Source: Mark R. Hake, CFA
	$2.7 billion18.5x64.3%Cornerstone OnDemand is a California-based talent management and experience software provider. It helps companies with their recruiting, employee learning and performance management functions. The company is extremely profitable.For example, in the last 12 months ending March, it generated $114.2 million in CFFO. FCF in the last 12 months was $99.4 million. Moreover, some of the companies in this employment industry space are highly valued.Based on the relative P/E valuations of some of its peers, the company should be trading at a forward P/E multiple of over 60 times. However, CSOD stock trades for just 18.5 times its forward expected earnings for the year ending December 2021.I applied a 50% discount figure to that and derived a target price of $68.54 per share. This helps provide a margin of safety for the stock valuation. It also takes into account other factors. For example, this discount accounts for the fact that some of its higher-valued peers do not make money in employee software like Cornerstone.Nevertheless, this price target represents a potential gain of over 64% for investors in CSOD stock.Source: Mark R.

$77.7 million17.5x43.2%AudioEye is a software company that provides web accessibility software for existing corporate internet sites. For example, it helps blind people hear a reading of each page they search. Its software allows for a larger print of words on a site so people will have a clearer vision of the contents. Some people are color blind, so AudioEye’s software helps make some functions clearer to them.The company’s sales have been growing consistently over the past several years. Corporations allow AudioEye to modify software code on their sites, such that anyone who needs better accessibility can use it. Moreover, a number of legal cases requiring Americans with Disabilities Act compliance have propelled further sales.I have been following the company for a while. Here is why I think the AEYE stock is now worth looking at. Recently management indicated in its March earnings press release that .Moreover, the company produces consistent and recurring revenues. In fact, AudioEye regularly gives guidance on its monthly recurring revenues (MRR). Even more importantly, AudioEye is at the inflection point where operating leverage provides huge profit growth. Marginal increases in revenue, after variable expenses, go straight to profits as its overhead is covered by existing cash flow.Based on this, I estimate that earnings for the year ending 2021 will be at least 50 cents per share, if not higher.That puts AEYE stock on a forward P/E of just 19 times. For a company with this type of fast-growing revenue and recurring earnings, I deem it is worth at least 25 times earnings for 2021. That gives the stock a target price of $12.50 and an upside of at least 43%.As of this writing, Mark Hake, CFA holds a position in one of the aforementioned securities, AudioEye (AEYE).

Sometimes, it’s best to get your information straight from the experts. Needham’s 5-star analyst , an expert in the tech sector, has the lowdown on autonomous cars and the companies that will support them. He was part of Needham’s recent 4th Annual Virtual Automotive Tech Conference, and in a report this week he expounds on the highlights of the event.The conference focused on the impact of COVID-19 on the advent of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), and featured presentations from and about auto industry reps, semiconductor manufacturers, battery suppliers, software companies – even rideshare companies. Self-driving cars are on the way – the relevant questions are, how soon? and how will the public take to them.Gill sees the innovation hitting the industry in a series of steps. Level 0 is current non-autonomous, non-assistive manual driving technology (or just ‘cars,’ if you prefer). Moving up, Levels 1 and 2 include various forms of non-autonomous driver assistance – adaptive cruise control, lane drift warnings, and limited vehicle control over speed and/or steering. With Level 3, we start to see driver hands-free capability. Level 4 is full vehicle autonomy within geofenced areas, and Level 5 is unrestricted vehicle autonomy. Clearly, current tech is still perfected Level 3 – but higher levels are both conceivable and, likely, inevitable in the near future.And full autonomy brings us to AI. Artificial Intelligence is essential for the technology to work, and the companies that enable it are going to find themselves well positioned for takeoff when ADAS Levels 4 and 5 arrive. Gill points out three such companies, all in the semiconductor chip sector, that he gives Buy ratings, saying that investors can get in now on the ground floor. We’ve used the  to pull up the details on them.We’ll start with Microchip Technology, a major player in the industry. MCHP is ranked #6 globally by sales share, and boasts a $27 billion market cap. The company is heavily invested in the automotive sector, as its chips are widely used in power management apps and wireless connection devices.The company’s tech is heavily integrated into electric vehicles, as well as early innovation in Level 4/5 ASAD. Microchip produces SiC MOSFETs and diodes, which are used in electric powertrains and charging systems, while its connectivity chip enable the centralized computing and GPS location systems that will make autonomous vehicles ‘smart.’Needham's Rajvindra Gill particularly sees Microchip’s moves to micro-PNT as important for autonomous vehicles. This technology will enable cloud-based real-time mapping updates in the ‘urban canyons’ that resist traditional GPS locators. The company is engaged in test projects in three cities, and pending results will move toward the market.Gill rates MCHP a Buy, and gives the stock a $130 price target, indicating confidence in a 19% upside potential for the coming year. (To watch Gill’s track record, )Overall, Microchip’s Strong Buy analyst consensus rating is based on 20 reviews, which include no fewer than 17 Buys opposed to just 3 Holds. Shares are trading for $97.45, while the average price target of $113.40 suggests a 16% upside potential. ()Next up is Tower Semiconductor, a $2.2 billion fabricator in the chip industry. Fab is the vital segment for semiconductors – it is the actual manufacture of the chips. Tower produces a wide range of chips, used in dozens of applications, for some of the biggest names in the industry. The company’s customers include Broadcom, Intel, and Samsung, perennially among the top 5 in market share.From Tower’s perspective, the key about the increasing trend to greater autonomy in motor vehicles – and toward electric vehicles – is the ever-increasing share of electronic componentry in the vehicle systems. Tower sees a major opportunity here, as most automotive circuitry is analog, and Tower is a specialized analog chip foundry. TSEM is already heavily invested in automotive applications, and 10% of the company’s 2019 sales went to the car sector. Specifically, TSEM chips and platforms are essential to the image sensors and LiDAR apps that will allow self-driving cars to ‘see,’ while RF tech is used in connectivity and radar applications. EV vehicles depend on TSEM’s power management technology.In short, Tower has multiple paths toward increased sales and market share, as it will provide the manufacturing capabilities needed to produce the most essential pieces of vehicle AI. With fab facilities in the US, Tower also finds itself in a strong position as markets begin to prioritize US sourcing over Chinese in the wake of the trade war and the coronavirus.Looking at TSEM’s prospects, Gill backs his Buy rating with a $27 price target. His target shows confidence – it implies a 36% one-year upside potential to the stock. (To watch Gill’s track record, )TSEM shares have 3 recent analyst reviews, breaking down to 2 Buys and 1 Hold, giving the stock a Moderate Buy consensus rating. Shares are affordably priced, at $21.16, and the $24.33 average price target suggests the stock has room for 14% growth in the next 12 months. () Last up on today’s list is Nvidia, one of the best-known names in the semiconductor chip sector. Nvidia’s GPU chips are popular among gamers and graphic designers, and the company’s memory chips are widely used in data centers. As a maker of high-end processors, Nvidia’s connection to AI is obvious.About 7% of Nvidia’s business is in the automotive sector, and half of that is geared toward ADAS and autonomous vehicle tech. The company produces the DRIVE platform, a fully scalable architecture capable of functioning in the Level 2 ADAS environment or in Level 4 fully autonomous driving. Gill sees Nvidia’s moves toward L2 ADAS as a multi-year opportunity, as it will take time to reach the volumes anticipated. The DRIVE platform allows cloud-car-cloud data transfer, a model that will encourage machine learning at the higher levels of autonomy. It is important to note, as Gill does, that Nvidia’s competitors in the automotive sector are not shy about conducting simulations using NVDA data center tech.To this end, Gill backs his Buy rating on NVDA with a $400 price target, suggestive of a 14% upside potential. (To watch Gill’s track record, )The Street agrees that NVDA is a buying opportunity. The 31 reviews on this stock include 27 Buys, 3 Holds, and a single Sell, making the consensus view a Strong Buy. NVDA is the most expensive stock on today’s list, trading for $351.85. The average price target here, $379.58, suggests an 8% upside from current levels.

(To watch Gill’s track record, )Overall, Microchip’s Strong Buy analyst consensus rating is based on 20 reviews, which include no fewer than 17 Buys opposed to just 3 Holds. Shares are trading for $97.45, while the average price target of $113.40 suggests a 16% upside potential. ()Next up is Tower Semiconductor, a $2.2 billion fabricator in the chip industry. Fab is the vital segment for semiconductors – it is the actual manufacture of the chips. Tower produces a wide range of chips, used in dozens of applications, for some of the biggest names in the industry. The company’s customers include Broadcom, Intel, and Samsung, perennially among the top 5 in market share.From Tower’s perspective, the key about the increasing trend to greater autonomy in motor vehicles – and toward electric vehicles – is the ever-increasing share of electronic componentry in the vehicle systems. Tower sees a major opportunity here, as most automotive circuitry is analog, and Tower is a specialized analog chip foundry. TSEM is already heavily invested in automotive applications, and 10% of the company’s 2019 sales went to the car sector. Specifically, TSEM chips and platforms are essential to the image sensors and LiDAR apps that will allow self-driving cars to ‘see,’ while RF tech is used in connectivity and radar applications. EV vehicles depend on TSEM’s power management technology.In short, Tower has multiple paths toward increased sales and market share, as it will provide the manufacturing capabilities needed to produce the most essential pieces of vehicle AI. With fab facilities in the US, Tower also finds itself in a strong position as markets begin to prioritize US sourcing over Chinese in the wake of the trade war and the coronavirus.Looking at TSEM’s prospects, Gill backs his Buy rating with a $27 price target. His target shows confidence – it implies a 36% one-year upside potential to the stock. (To watch Gill’s track record, )TSEM shares have 3 recent analyst reviews, breaking down to 2 Buys and 1 Hold, giving the stock a Moderate Buy consensus rating. Shares are affordably priced, at $21.16, and the $24.33 average price target suggests the stock has room for 14% growth in the next 12 months. () Last up on today’s list is Nvidia, one of the best-known names in the semiconductor chip sector. Nvidia’s GPU chips are popular among gamers and graphic designers, and the company’s memory chips are widely used in data centers. As a maker of high-end processors, Nvidia’s connection to AI is obvious.About 7% of Nvidia’s business is in the automotive sector, and half of that is geared toward ADAS and autonomous vehicle tech. The company produces the DRIVE platform, a fully scalable architecture capable of functioning in the Level 2 ADAS environment or in Level 4 fully autonomous driving. Gill sees Nvidia’s moves toward L2 ADAS as a multi-year opportunity, as it will take time to reach the volumes anticipated. The DRIVE platform allows cloud-car-cloud data transfer, a model that will encourage machine learning at the higher levels of autonomy. It is important to note, as Gill does, that Nvidia’s competitors in the automotive sector are not shy about conducting simulations using NVDA data center tech.To this end, Gill backs his Buy rating on NVDA with a $400 price target, suggestive of a 14% upside potential. (To watch Gill’s track record, )The Street agrees that NVDA is a buying opportunity. The 31 reviews on this stock include 27 Buys, 3 Holds, and a single Sell, making the consensus view a Strong Buy. NVDA is the most expensive stock on today’s list, trading for $351.85. The average price target here, $379.58, suggests an 8% upside from current levels.

There are 15 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Microchip Technology Inc, but the average is just that — a mathematical average.  There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $81.00.  And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $120.00.  The standard deviation is $12.608.


But the whole reason to look at the average MCHP price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes.  And so with MCHP crossing above that average target price of $103.53/share, investors in MCHP have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $103.53 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?  Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Microchip Technology Inc:



The average rating presented in the last row of the above table above is from 1 to 5 where 1 is Strong Buy and 5 is Strong Sell.  This article used .  .

Last year Microsoft announced that it plans on increasing its payout by 11% and is conducting a whopping $40 billion buyback program.When you add this huge increase to its payout, Microsoft quickly becomes one of the best dividend stocks ever.

With service revenues driving the show, margins in the sector have never been higher.

Boring is beautiful when it comes to dividends and cash flows.As the world continues to modernize and lean on technology, demand for analog chips of all kinds has grown. That has benefited Microchip’s bottom line in a big way. Year-over-year sales clocked in 9.1% higher last quarter and over the longer term, MCHP has . That’s pretty much unheard of in the semiconductor sector which tends to have wild swings in profits and losses.That sort of consistency has made MCHP a dividend stalwart among tech stocks.

Thanks to some smart acquisitions, MCHP has started to pivot into more advanced semiconductors.

It doesn’t matter the technology trend (cloud computing, mobile commerce, big data, etc.) all require massive computing systems and storage.

Image source: The Motley Fool. Q4 2020 , Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Microchip's Q4 and fiscal year '20 financial results conference call. [Operator instructions] And please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator instructions] Now, I would like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Eric Bjornholt, Microchip Financial Officer.Sir, please go ahead. -- Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today, as well as, our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's chairman and CEO; and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's president and COO. I will comment on our fourth-quarter and full fiscal year 2020 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results and discuss the current business environment, as well as, our guidance. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. We are including information in our press release and on this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, , has tripled the market.* David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Microchip Technology wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing our GAAP and non-GAAP results. We have also posted a summary of our outstanding debt and leverage metrics on our website. I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin, and operating expenses. Other than net sales, I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis, which is based on expenses prior to the effects of acquisition activities, share-based compensation, and certain other adjustments as described in our press release.Net sales in the March quarter were $1.326 billion, which was up 3% sequentially and above our revised guidance from March 2nd, 2020, when net sales were expected to be about flat sequentially. We have posted a summary of our GAAP net sales, as well as, end market demand by product line and geography on our website for your reference. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were strong at 62%, operating expenses were at 25.4%, and operating income was 36.6% compared to 35.1% in the previous quarter. Non-GAAP net income was $375.5 million, non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.46, which was up significantly from $1.32 produced in the prior quarter.On a GAAP basis, in the March quarter, gross margins were 61.4% and include the impact of $5.1 million of share-based compensation, and $3.3 million of COVID-19 shelter-in-place restrictions on manufacturing activities. Total operating expenses were $653.2 million and include acquisition intangible amortization of $248.5 million, special charges of $17.2 million, $15.3 million of acquisition-related and other costs, and share-based compensation of $35.6 million. The GAAP net income was $99.9 million or $0.39 per diluted share. Our March quarter GAAP tax benefit was impacted by a variety of factors, including tax reserve releases associated with the statute limitations expiring, deferred tax adjustments related to intercompany movement of intellectual property, tax reserve releases associated with tax audits, and other matters.For fiscal year 2020, net sales were 5.7 -- excuse me, $5.274 billion. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were a record 61.9%, operating expenses were 25.7% of sales, and operating income was 36.2% of sales. Non-GAAP net income was $1.44 billion and EPS was $5.62 per diluted share. On a GAAP basis, gross margins were 61.5%, operating expenses were 49.2% of sales, and operating income was 12.3% of sales.Net income was $570.6 million, and EPS was $2.23 per diluted share. The non-GAAP cash tax rate was 7% in the March quarter and 6.3% for fiscal year 2020. We expect our non-GAAP cash tax rate for fiscal '21 to be between 6% and 7%, exclusive of the transition tax, any potential tax associated with the restructuring, with the Microsemi operations and the Microchip's global structure, and any tax audit settlements related to taxes accrued in prior fiscal years. We have many tax attributes and net operating losses, and tax credits, as well as, U.S.interest deductions that we believe will keep our cash tax payments low. The future cash tax payments associated with the transition tax are expected to be about $245 million and will be paid over the next six years. We posted a schedule of these projected transition tax payments on the IR page of our website. Our inventory balance at March 31, 2020, was $685.7 million.We had 122 days of inventory at the end of the March quarter, down seven days from the prior quarter's level. Inventory of our distributors in the March quarter were at 29 days compared to 28 days at the end of December. We believe distribution inventory levels for Microchip are still quite low compared to historical averages. In the March quarter, we exchanged cash and shares of our common stock to retire $615 million of principal plus accrued interest of our 2025 convertible senior subordinated notes.The cash used to pay the principal in this exchange was funded by a 364-day bridge loan. This exchange will significantly reduce share count dilution to the extent Microchip's stock price appreciates in the future. During the quarter, we also amended our credit facility. As disclosed in our March 21, 2020 press release, the total leverage and senior leverage covenants were favorably modified as part of the amendment, giving Microchip greater financial flexibility.The cash flow from operating activities was $371.7 million in the March quarter. As of March 31, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $403 million. We paid down $236 million of total debt in the March quarter. Over the last seven full quarters since we closed the Microsemi acquisition and incurred over $8 billion in debt to do so, we have paid down $2.222 billion of debt and continue to allocate substantially all of our excess cash beyond dividends to aggressively bring down the debt.We have accomplished this despite the adverse macro and market conditions during most of this period, which we feel is a testimony to the cash generation capabilities of our businesses, as well as, our ongoing operating discipline. We continue to expect our debt levels to reduce significantly over the next several years. Our adjusted EBITDA in the March quarter was $548.1 million, and our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was $2.129 billion. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA, excluding our very long-dated convertible debt that matures in 2037 and is more equity-like in nature, was 4.46 at March 31, 2020, and our dividend payment in the March quarter was $88 million.Capital expenditures were $11.9 million in the March quarter, and $67.6 million for fiscal year 2020. We expect between $12 million and $18 million in capital spending in the June quarter, and overall capital expenditures for fiscal '21 to be between $50 million and $70 million. We continue to add capital to maintain and operate our internal manufacturing operations, support the production capabilities for our new products and technologies, as well as, to selectively bring in-house some of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. We expect these capital investments will bring some gross margin improvement to our business, particularly for the outsourced Atmel and Microsemi manufacturing activities that we are bringing into our own factories.Depreciation expense in the March quarter was $41.8 million. I will now turn it over to Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the March quarter. Ganesh?  -- Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's start by taking a closer look at microcontrollers. On a GAAP basis, our microcontroller revenue was sequentially up 5.9% as compared to the December quarter. From an end market demand standpoint, our microcontroller business was sequentially up 2.9%.From an end market standpoint, 32-bit microcontrollers in the March quarter represented an all-time record of just over $340 million, or 47% of our microcontroller demand. We continue to introduce a steady stream of innovative new microcontrollers, including a new cryptography-enabled 32-bit microcontroller, designed to stop malware for systems that boot from external flash memory, as well, as a new high-end 8-bit microcontroller product family for improved designs in real-time control and connected applications. Microcontrollers overall represented 55.2% of our end market demand in the March quarter. Last month, Gartner released their microcontroller market share report for 2019.We are pleased to report that Microchip retained the No. 1 position for 8-bit microcontrollers. Once again, we gained market share as we grew faster than the overall APAC microcontroller market. In fact, we are now almost twice as big as the No.2 player. In the 16-bit microcontroller market, we remained in the No. 5 position, and continue to gain market share as we grew faster than the overall 16-bit microcontroller market. In the 32-bit microcontroller market, we remained in the No.6 position for the Gartner report and gained significant market share again as we grew faster than the overall 32-bit microcontroller market. These results are despite Gartner rolling up our 32-bit microcontroller revenue to be about $400 million lower than the $1.2 billion results we actually achieved in 2019. Had Gartner used our actual calendar year 2019 32-bit microcontroller results, we would have achieved the No. 4 ranking.And as I shared with you earlier, our 32-bit microcontroller business in the March quarter, ran at an approximately $1.36 billion annualized run rate based on end market demand. For microcontrollers overall, we remained in the No. 3 position despite Gartner rolling up our revenue to be about $400 million lower than our publicly reported results for calendar year 2019. Using our publicly reported results, we would be approximately 7.5% away from the No.2 player and 16.5% away from the No. 1 player ahead of us as we continue to relentlessly march toward No. 1 spot. Our microcontroller portfolio and road map had never been stronger.We believe we have the new product momentum and customer engagement to continue to gain even more share in 2020 as we further build the best-performing microcontroller franchise in the industry. Now moving to analog. On a GAAP basis, our analog revenue was sequentially up 1.1% as compared to the December quarter. From an end market standpoint, our analog business was sequentially down 1.8%.During the quarter, we continued to introduce a steady stream of innovative analog products, including the industry's first space-qualified, radiation-tolerant ethernet transceiver, as well as, an expanded silicon carbide family of power electronics to provide system-level improvements in efficiency, size and reliability at 700 volt, 1,200 volt and 1,700 volt power modules. Catalog represented 27.6% of our end market in the March quarter. Our FPGA revenue on a GAAP basis was up 4.6% sequentially as compared to the December quarter. From an end market demand standpoint, our FPGA business was sequentially up 1%.FPGA represented 7% of our end market demand in the March quarter. Our licensing, memory and other product lines, which we refer to as LMO, was sequentially down 10.7% as compared to the December quarter from an end market demand perspective. During the quarter, we introduced a new miniaturized rubidium at an atomic clock. The industry's highest performance atomic clock for size and power.LMO represented 10.1% of our end market demand in the March quarter. An update regarding coronavirus and its impact on our operations. Regrettably, we have had nine employees who tested positive for the virus. With over 18,000 employees worldwide, this was inevitable.But thankfully, they're all recovering nicely or have already recovered. Most of our nonfactory employee base is working from home as we rapidly transformed business processes to run remotely. Our global teams have been highly engaged, collaborative and productive under the circumstances resulting in enhanced customer engagement for new designs and high effectiveness in our product development programs. We would like to thank our worldwide team for rapidly adapting in the changing conditions, and making the best of what was not possible under difficult circumstances to continue delivering results.Our manufacturing operations had varying degrees of constraints last quarter as what started with China shutting down for several weeks expanded to many other locations that shut down at no notice. Our operations team literally adjusted the constraints as they emerged and implemented our contingency plans where needed to ensure that we continue to serve customer needs despite the challenges. In most of our manufacturing locations, we were able to get essential services designation as our products are quite ubiquitous in medical, work-from-home, defense, and communication infrastructure applications. Our Philippines operations had the largest impact with restriction on people movement being so strict that we have had a large number of our dedicated employees living in our two factories there since mid-March to support production and improve customer shipments.Our global teams also successfully worked through a myriad of ground and air logistics issues throughout the quarter as conditions change regionally over time. Our customers and our supply chain partners also endured constraints with their factories and logistics, have made the March quarter challenger. We are appreciative of our global team who engaged and worked through a rolling step of customer and supplier challenges, even as we work the challenges and constraints that was placed on our own factories. Pandemics are inherently unpredictable, and there may be yet other twists and turns to come in the days ahead.We continue to process the news daily, as well as, monitor information from the Center for Disease Control and the World Health Organization. And we will adapt our response as needed and focus on the things that we can control. Given the current market uncertainties, we are providing some qualitative insight into our principal end markets. The areas of strength we see are: data center, driven by continued strength from the exponential rate at which data is being created, and the consequent seemingly insatiable demand for data storage for computers, printers, monitors, and other accessories, enabled by the increased shift to working from home; for medical devices, COVID-19-related items like ventilators, respirators, oxygen monitors and ultrasound machines, but also a host of other hospital equipment needed for increased patient loads; for contact-free consumer and industrial products like hands-free dispensers or soap, water, paper, hand sanitizers; for infrared thermometers, as well as, barcode readers for retail shopping, all in an attempt to prevent the spread of COVID-19.And then for communication infrastructure, in part because of work-from-home-related network loading changes, but also in part due to stimulus investments in infrastructure, especially in China. The area of the weakness we see from an end market perspective are automotive, broad-based industrial, consumer and home appliances, and aviation or aerospace. Our defense and space business remains relatively even keel. Let me now pass it to Steve for some comments about our business and our guidance going forward.Steve? -- Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to first reflect on the results of the fiscal fourth quarter of 2020 and the whole fiscal year 2020, I will then provide guidance for the fiscal first quarter of 2021. The March quarter had unusual business challenges as the effects of COVID-19 pandemic unfolded in many dimensions. I am proud of how rapidly the Microchip team adapted to the new constraints we faced so that our employees would be safe, our customers will be well served, and our partners engaged to ensure mutual success despite the challenges we face.Despite the COVID-19 pandemic challenges, we delivered 3% sequential net sales growth as compared to our early March updated guidance, which was for net sales to be about flat. Our final March quarter GAAP net sales came in at $1.326 billion, up 3% sequentially and down just 0.3% from a year ago March quarter. Our end market demand based on sell-through was approximately $3.8 million lower than GAAP sales. After seven quarters of end market demand being higher than sell-in based net sales, March quarter was nearly even for end market demand versus sell-in net sales.We also delivered outstanding non-GAAP gross margin of 62%, just above the high end of our original guidance from February 4, 2020, and non-GAAP operating margin of 36.6%, near the high end of our original guidance. And we did all that while reducing our days of inventory from 129 days to 122 days. Our consolidated non-GAAP EPS was $1.46. We did not provide EPS guidance when we revised our net sales guidance on March 2, 2020.Our original non-GAAP EPS guidance provided with our earnings release on February 4, 2020 was $1.35 to $1.51 with a midpoint of $1.43, and we beat that original guidance by $0.03. On non-GAAP basis, this was also our 118th consecutive profitable quarter. In the March quarter, we paid down $236 million of our debt, our total debt payment since the end of June 2018 has been about $2.22 billion. The pace of debt payments has been strong despite the weak and uncertain business conditions underlying the strong cash generation characteristics of our business, as well as, our active efforts to continue to squeeze working capital efficiencies.On a full fiscal year 2020 basis, our net sales were $5.274 billion, down 1.4% over fiscal year 2019. Now I will discuss our guidance for the June quarter. Ganesh, in his prepared remarks, discussed the impact we are seeing on our supply chain, as well as, our customers. Ganesh also described the end markets where we are seeing strength, and those where we are seeing either current or expected weakness.Our March quarter bookings were up double-digit percentage over the December quarter bookings. The book-to-bill ratio for March quarter was very strong at 1.17. That resulted in our starting backlog for June quarter to be strong compared to the starting backlog for the March quarter. In our April 8, 2020, press release, we said that we believe that the strength in bookings may be a result of customer concerns about supply chain disruptions due to COVID-19 virus.With economies around the world contracting rapidly, with millions of people getting laid off, and with customer factory closures due to shelter-in-place ordinances in various countries, we believe that product demand is likely to weaken significantly. With another month under our belt now, we have seen some of the customer order push-outs and cancellations. Our backlog for the June quarter compared to the backlog from March today at the same point in time has now deteriorated somewhat in the last month. We believe the backlog position compared to March quarter will continue to deteriorate due to the combined effects of supply chain disruptions, customer factory closures and demand destruction.Taking all these factors into consideration, we expect our net sales for June quarter to be down 2% to 10% sequentially. The guidance ranges to help account for the uncertainty associated with the evolving coronavirus situation. We have no way to model how the rest of the quarter will play out for the coronavirus situation and what the consequent business impact may be. But we believe that our guidance range incorporates our best judgment for the possible scenarios.We have prepared the company for a downside scenario by putting the employees on a 10% salary cut and adjusting the factories by reduced work hours or rotating time-offs. We have also frozen all business travel and cut discretionary expenses. Regarding CAPEX, we finished fiscal year 2020 with a CAPEX of $67.6 million, a significant reduction from fiscal year '19 CAPEX of $229 million. This is consistent with what we have said before that our CAPEX is divided between growth capital, maintenance capital, and new products and technology capital.In a fiscal year like 2020 in which our net sales declined, the growth capital, which is the largest portion of CAPEX, declines to virtually nothing. And therefore, the total CAPEX declined significantly. We expect CAPEX for fiscal year '21 to remain low in the range of $50 million to $70 million. For June quarter, we expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 60.4% and 61.2% of sales.We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 24.4% and 25.2% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating profit to be between 35.2% and 36.8% of sales, and we expect our non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $1.25 per share to $1.45 per share. We believe that despite the near-term pandemic-driven challenges, we are confident in the strength and diversity of the businesses and end markets we are in to achieve long-term growth in excess of the average semiconductor market growth. Given all the complications of accounting for our acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges, and inventory write-up on acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on a non-GAAP basis except for net sales, which will be on a GAAP basis.We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters, and we request that the analysts continue to report their non-GAAP estimates to First Call. With that, operator, will you please poll for questions?[Operator instructions] -- Operator, you have no questions?Yes, there are no further questions at this time. You may continue. -- That's unusual. -- Yeah. I don't think that's possible. What's -- let's stay open here for a while. Our investor relations manager is just indicating that we're having quite a few problems here.So, let's hold and see if we can get to solve because I know there's questions to be asked. So I've been told we have 12 questions in queue. We just need to figure out how to get them available so those questions can be asked.Your first question is from the line of Chris Caso from Raymond James. Sir, please go ahead. -- Yes. Thank you. Appreciate that. Good afternoon.So I guess for the first question, Steve, if you could give us some thoughts about perhaps the magnitude of the downturn that, I guess, we're all expecting. I realize that's a difficult question with what's going on with the backlog here. But I guess compare to you know, -- some of your competitors have compared what we're seeing now to the 2009 cycle. I'm not sure that's the right way to look at it right now.But I guess, Microchip is also a different company as compared to 2009 and what you're guiding to is not quite as bad. As we put all that together, how are you thinking about things going forward? -- So, I think we're really unable to speak about anybody else's business, but our own. You mentioned some of the companies. I believe all companies have a different end market and customer exposure. We have been building this franchise for many years now through organic efforts, as well as, acquisitions and have compiled a very large number of very, very good assets.And then, deployed a program called TSS, Total System Solutions that we have discussed with you in which we are garnering larger and larger share of the customer's board with our products. So, the outperformance that you may be seeing from us in business today is really nothing to do with what we have done today or last year. It's been a result of really many years of effort in new products organically, as well as, through acquisitions and our customer support activities, our distributor relationships, and everything else over the past several years. I don't know if that helps you. -- OK. I guess, perhaps you could take us through what you've seen in the order rates and you put through some of that in your prepared remarks about what you've been seeing since March. I guess, what's interesting now is that the customers came in. The channel at least came into this crisis with very low inventory levels, and that's, I guess, unusual in a downturn in our industry.How does that affect things going forward? And what sort of visibility do you have on what customers may be doing with the inventory levels here? -- So this is a very unique cycle. We have -- this is the first time ever we are experiencing a demand shock and a supply shock. We have seen demand shocks before, like 2008, 2009 cycle you mentioned. You also saw a major demand shock during 2001 tech bust.And I think we saw a little mini demand shock really even during SARS in 2004 or three, whenever it was. And we have seen some supply shocks in the industry. The two that I remember, one was during tsunami in Japan, in Southeast Asia, where number of factories were closed down or shut down and there was a major demand shock. And the other demand shock, I recall, was during the major floods in Thailand a few years ago where many of our peers' factories were underwater.Microchip factory was OK, though. So we have seen really either a supply shock or a demand shock. This is the first time ever in my 40 years of experience that I'm seeing a simultaneous demand shock and supply shock. The supply shock is driven by just various shelter in place so ordinances and Ganesh talked about it extensively.Philippines being the worst and Malaysia being the second where we couldn't get our workers into the factory. And in some cases, the workers are living in the factory because they believe they will not be able to come back. And the number of our product lines that went in those factories produced limited output because the whole workforce wasn't working so that resulted into a supply shortage and supply shock and some of the lead times going out, and that kind of drove some of the demand further from customers and distributors. And on the demand side of it, our customers' factories shut down, the worst being in the automotive business where, I think, you guys keep track of star data.And if you look at the star data, you'll find that Europe has been the worst and U.S. is stuck and a lot of factories were shut down in Asia also, but those factories are coming back in automotive. So the automotive business is going through just a gut-wrenching demand shock and industrial cumber, and while on the other hand, like you look at a market like data centers where demand shock is in the upward direction with all the data and work from home, ordinances, that demand has gone up. And the other area which is really quite sleepy for us in general, I don't think it's a very large percentage of our business is medical.We meld that into industrial. The medical is really -- we count that in industrial about a month and a half ago, I wouldn't know what a ventilator was. And now, we found that all the ventilator designs around the world, everyone is using our product and the demand has gone up 100 times if not more. The hospital will have two to three ventilators only for emergency purposes.And now, a single hospital is requiring 1,000 to 2,000 ventilators. So that demand has gone up 50 times to 100 times. Same thing on digital thermometers, to automatic soap dispensers, and bathroom products, where you put your hand under, the soap falls down. They all use microcontrollers or sensors or many of our products.So that's kind of really the end market feel. So in certain markets, demand is very strong. Other markets demand is very weak. In some cases, the impact is because of supply chain disruption.In other cases, the impact is because of stronger demand. So, I think how do you make sense with all that? We started June quarter with a fairly strong backlog. And our backlog for June quarter is still higher than our backlog was for the March quarter at the same point in time, but it has deteriorated significantly compared to where it was on April 1. And at the rate we are seeing customer adjustments, push-outs, and cancellations where the customer may have ordered more product, really shows us that this deterioration in backlog in June compared to March will continue.We know how much we lost in one month, we got two more months to go. And putting all that into the equation, really, our crystal ball tells us the midpoint of minus six and a range of minus two to minus 10. Sorry for the long answer, but I think it -- kind of the answer the question deserved. -- I think that that's the discussion we're looking for. Thank you.Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava. Sir, your line is open. -- Hi. Thank you very much, Steve, lots of details there. Can you focus on the gross margin? And just help us understand the dynamics, it's more than hanging in despite you actually drawing down, lowering inventory on your balance sheet and distri inventory didn't really go up by that much. So, just kind of help us understand the factors.Distri should be a structural change and Chris asked a question about the difference between Microchip from 10 years ago and all of us have been following you for a while. But just talk us through the structural changes. And then, you mentioned that with some manufacturing -- the CAPEX, which enable you to bring more Microsemi and Atmel indoor, and that will have some positive and this is obviously a longer-term kind of question that I'm asking. Thank you. -- So let me ask Eric Bjornholt to answer that question and I'll add something needed at the end. Go ahead, Eric. -- OK. So I mean, gross margins held up extremely well in the March quarter. We posted 62% non-GAAP gross margins which were really outstanding. As you know, we've been running our factories at less than optimal levels and we recorded an underutilization charge in the quarter of about $14 million.That was actually $3 million better than the prior quarter as we were running our assembly and test factories harder than we have in the previous quarters when we were draining finished goods. So the strong gross margins are really driven by a variety of factors, including a favorable product mix, and then, just ongoing cost reduction and cost containment activities in our factories. So the current quarter we're guiding, the gross margins to be down at 60.8% at the midpoint. We expect higher underutilization charges in June, as compared to March due to some of the rotating time off that we're going to be doing in the factories and just lower production output.But we believe we're really well-positioned for the long-term for gross margin improvement in the future as we grow back into our factory capacity. So we're -- there's a number of things that influence that other than the factory capacity. We've been also doing a good job of really holding average selling prices flat with our customers and that has long-term gross margin benefits also. So that's the general summary there.Steve, what would you like to add? -- No, I think that's good. We started this down cycle -- -- The second piece of -- -- Let me add a couple of sentences. I think we started this down cycle with probably the lowest inventory we had, 122 days at the end of March. I recall prior down cycles when we started with fairly high inventory. And so, I think with such a low inventory and we're keeping it low by factory, rotating time offs, and others.So I think, when we get on the other side of it and start ramping our factories back up, and we're starting with the gross margin in the 60s, I think we'll be very, very well-positioned longer-term for a very good record gross margin. -- I think the second piece of Ambrish question related to CAPEX and we will still focus longer-term on bringing some more assembly and test in-house. But we really locked down capital pretty significantly. You see what our forecast is for fiscal '21 of between $50 million and $70 million. So, where there's benefits to be gained, we'll evaluate those, but we're being pretty conservative in our posture in terms of making adjustments right now. -- Thank you and [Inaudible] the fellows said, hey, guys.The next question comes from the line of Gary Mobley from Wells Fargo Securities. Sir, your line is open. -- Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. In the interest of time, I'll post both of my questions now. Steve, I'd be interested to get your opinion on the recent export -- recent change in export control rules and the impact this may have on the owner's process of applying for licenses to shift China customers? Or any sort of limitations on that? And then, I'm asking this question really on behalf of many different people, but I'm interested to get your perspective on how safe your dividend is.Thank you. -- Sure. So, I'll pass on to Ganesh to answer the question about export control, and then, I'll come back and answer the question on the dividend. Go ahead, Ganesh. -- Yeah. The recent announcement that was made, we're still sorting through what the commerce department's rules are. The specific item that we are paying attention to is possible military use of products and how we can provide confirmation that it is not going into those applications. We think it's fairly straightforward to be able to do it.We have time until the 29th of June to be able to implement it. But at this point in time, we do not expect that it has an issue in terms of Microchip's business. Go ahead, Steve. -- So regarding the dividend, your question was how safe is the dividend. Dividend is very, very safe. We were one company that did not cut our dividend back in 2009 when -- from peak to bottom, our revenue went down almost 36%. Today, we are so much more profitable on gross and operating margin level.We have done a stress test on our business. You can't find a number low enough, you could lose a very, very large amount of sales and still -- company still is cash flow positive. Plus we got $1.2 billion of money remaining on line of credit. So I think really, we are unable to model a scenario, a reasonable scenario where the dividend would be at risk.And if we felt that the dividend was at risk, we certainly would not be increasing the dividend, which we are a little bit every quarter. -- All right. Thank you, guys.The next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line is open. -- Yes. Thank you. Quick question for Steve, just on kind of the downturn playbook, and so, the employee cost cuts pay reductions in CAPEX. You've done this in prior cycles.As you mentioned, this is a very different cycle. So just trying to gauge how you're thinking about the depth of this cycle and some of the things you're doing to protect margins as it plays out? -- So I think, we learn a little bit through every cycle and one of our goal is to never let a cycle go to waste. What happened in 2008, 2009 was the cycle really hit in early part of October of 2008. And the business was down very substantially in that December quarter and down a lot more even in the March quarter, and we didn't implement pay cuts and all that until we were well into the cycle where the storm is already there and we were being badgered just [Inaudible]. So this time, what we have done is, understanding that with 33 million people, I think, already lost jobs in the U.S.alone, and I don't know how many around the world. These people are not going to be buying new cars and refrigerators and other stuff that really would have our product. So this time, we've batten down the hatches and boarded up the windows ahead of time before the storm really hit. So, we finished the March quarter actually sequentially up 3% and we implemented the pay cut starting April 20.And at that time, our business really hasn't even weakened. Where our June quarter was still backlog higher than the March quarter backlog at the same point in time. So, what we have really done is really out of abundance of caution, just thinking that this storm -- internally at Microchip, we have described that to be a Category 6 storm waiting in the wing, where Category 5 is the highest category. Because we have never seen this before, simultaneous demand and supply shock, the pandemic and no place to hide and 33 million people laid off in five weeks in the U.S.alone. So, we have prepared the company with a cost structure in the June guidance we have given you has the pay check now -- pay cuts for June quarter dialed in, but not for the whole quarter because you started in the middle of the quarter and September expansion will be down even slightly further from that. So, we essentially have positioned it for any extreme case that may materialize. It's a lot easy to give the money back, undo the cuts on the salary, change them from X percent to Y percent, lower them.It's much easier to do that. Than to spent all the money and then really fight the storm and you're out of supplier out of ammunition. So that's really how we're looking at it. We're looking at it as we don't know.I don't think anybody knows. Anybody says he knows their lying, they don't. So what we have done is really out of abundance of caution, prepared the company for a worst-case analysis and we'll give the money back if we didn't need it. -- Helpful color. Thank you. Just as a follow-up on the push-outs and cancellations. Is it pretty broad based? Or are there any certain products that are -- you're seeing it more than others? -- It's not by product. It is more by end market. The worst is automotive. The second would be industrial and general consumer like appliances and all that.And I think Ganesh described all those areas, where the strength is, the strongest area is data center. I would think the next is really 5G-related work-from-home related PCs, printers, computers and all that. Medical is extremely strong. So those are the areas we're not seeing push-outs and cancellations.We're seeing those in the automotive and some general industrial. -- Got it. Thank you.The next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Sir, your line is open. -- Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the questions. Steve, you said in your prepared comments that clearly, the June backlog is deteriorating, but at least through the month of April, it would still suggest the potential for sequential growth in the June quarter.So, I'm just kind of curious when you think about the range of revenue you've given for June, what's the expectation as we go into May and June? Does the rate of deterioration of the backlog needs to accelerate from here to kind of hit your midpoint? Or just kind of give us any sort of color you feel comfortable with, with helping us understand kind of what you're embedding in further deterioration of the backlog from here? -- Well, there isn't a way to model it. So there are two challenges, maybe three. One is that the existing backlog further cancels or pushes out in the following quarter. Second is we still need turns to take.If there is zero cancellation from here on, but we get no more turns for the quarter, that's not a good scenario either. Then -- so that would be fairly soft, too. And the third is the supply, depending on what products the demand comes on, there are products where if you place an order today, the easiest -- earliest I can give you is July, August. And those are from the most constrained areas, the factories that have had a six weeks -- for six weeks, they haven't been able to run full production.And now as they're coming back to production, we are so far behind in delinquency. We'll leave the June quarter with a fairly large amount of product delinquent. Same thing happened at the end of March quarter. So in a way, someday, when we catch up, all that product gets shipped, it's a good news.But for now, we're not going to be able to ship all the backlog in the June quarter, neither will be able to ship that all in March quarter. In fact, if just the supply side shock had not happened and our factories were running, for March quarter, we would have met or exceeded our original guidance, which was about 5%, 5.5%. We only did 3% and that was largely because we couldn't supply the product. -- That's helpful, Steve. And then, you also mentioned that some of the OPEX controls that you put in place this quarter, they're not in for the full quarter, so it will have a positive effect on OPEX declining again in September. I'm curious, are there more levers you can pull on OPEX? And should we take OPEX being down sequentially in September as a sign that you feel like revenue might be down again in September as well? -- So, the only reason that the September OPEX will be down below June would be because the pickup will be for the entire quarter. And the pickups didn't kick in until June 20 in U.S. and probably May 1 for some of the international geographies, depending on the various international laws. But the September quarter, we get the full quarter.If your question is, what if you didn't need it and the business is well, then, you remodel it and you change the pay cut from 10% to 6% or 5%? Or if you see growth, you make it zero. I mean, anything is possible. But I'm saying right now, in a staying prepared for a Category 6 storm, we are structured to take the June quarter expenses below the March quarter because of the full-quarter savings. And then December compared to September will be about the same if you don't make any changes and the pay cuts end at the end of December.That's currently the case. We have announced to the employees at the pay cuts ends at the end of December. So the March quarter OPEX will rise again. And hopefully, we are well out of the woods from the cycle.If we're not, then we will do something different. -- Helpful. Thanks, Steve.The next question comes from the line of Chris Danely from Citigroup. Sir, your line is open. -- Hey. Thanks, Steve. Can you just expand on I guess, what percentage of your revenue is dealing with these supply issues? And are the supply issues sort of worsening as we speak? Or do you think you got to handle on them and they should get better as the quarter progresses? -- Let me have Ganesh comment on it. I don't think we have quantitative numbers but Ganesh can talk qualitatively. -- So it's not our entire product line, right? So we build a lot of product in many countries, Thailand, Philippines, Malaysia, depending on if it's our factory or subcontracted factories. Our principal issues from a constraint standpoint were in the Philippines and in Malaysia. Malaysia, at this point, effectively has turned on 100%. They don't have -- it's running at 100%, but there are no restrictions and they are as fast as they can bring their direct label workforce, how they will catch up as we go through the quarter.Philippines is still operating under restrictions. We have been able to improve from March to the June quarter by having more people residing in our factory. So this is -- we've got 500, 600 employees living full-time inside the factory to be able to get the utilization to be higher. We expect that that will get turned -- those restrictions will come off as we go into the latter part of May, maybe in the middle of May, it's out of our control.And as that happens, we will have more output that come out of it. So, I believe the constrained -- manufacturing constraints are coming off and coming off rapidly. But there's catch up to what was left from when the constraints were there plus ongoing support that has to come through. -- Got it. Thanks, Ganesh. And for my follow-up. So Steve, you kind of called this weakness after a little bit of strength last quarter.What does your spider sense tell you on how long this weakness could last? I mean, do you think that some of these end markets that are very strong right now, like data center? Do they start getting weaker in the second half of the year? Any guess as to how long this weakness could last? Could it last into the next quarter? -- I don't currently expect data center to weaken. I think 90% of the world data has been created in the last two years. And any company that's related to data center, I just got off the board of Mellanox, you've got only the deal closed bought by NVIDIA on April 27 and they announced the prior quarter, the March quarter, just a couple of days before the deal closed. It was a very, very strong quarter.You're seeing it in the results of NVIDIA also. So, I just think data center market is very, very strong. And I think, how we are designing our print position on the customer's board. So that one looks very, very good.I think, as the automotive factories go back to work and people start buying cars again, that market is the most destroyed today. That market will show huge potential for getting back to normal and industrial would be the same way. -- OK. Thanks. -- Yeah.The next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities. Go ahead. Your line is open. -- Thanks for taking my question. I had two as well. Steve, when I look at your peak to trough sales declines from September last year, to hopefully, the trough in June. Or if I just take the midpoint of what you're guiding to in June or even take the low end of that, it's a reduction of 7% to 11%.That's actually much better than what we have seen at some of your analog and microcontroller peers that are down almost 25% in that same period. So the question to you is, what is helping you stay more resilient? And I appreciate the visibility is not there, but if, let's say, those competitors start to come back in September, is there anything that prevents Microchip sales to also rebound in September? -- Yes. So, I think I -- little bit answered that question earlier that we think what we're seeing is years worth of effort in building a stronger print position in customers' boards with total system solutions and also acquiring product lines with synergy with our products and what we have gotten from Atmel and Micrel and Microsemi with all the discrete product lines with various stuff that can go into a similar board as a microcontroller and much stronger distributor relationships. I think, some others have been tweaking their distribution policies, maybe to the detriment, maybe not, no time would tell, but I think, we are seeing a stronger effect of our stronger distributor relationships. And the effect of end markets like we discussed.So, I don't really know why anybody else is doing better or worse than us. I'm sure there are other companies doing better than us and a lot of our more closer competitors are doing worse than us. So, we're happy to be gaining share but I don't know we can totally allocate percentages, how much is because of what reason. -- OK. And for my follow-up, gross margin. So you're guiding down, I think about 120 basis points or so down to 61%. I understand there are supply chain disruptions, etc.But the last time your gross margins were under or around the 61-ish percent or below levels, your revenues were 20% lower, right? They were closer to $1 billion or so over two years ago, and at that time, you did not even have Microsemi, which has been accretive to margins since then. So I'm curious, why this conservatism in gross margins? Is it utilization? Is there anything else right? And then, how should gross margins behave, assuming that sales start to rebound in September? Thank you. -- Eric, you want to take that? -- Sure, I'll take it. So, the midpoint of our guidance this quarter is 60.8%, our long-term model is 63%. So quite honestly, I think the margins have held up extraordinarily well. If you look at the fall we had in gross margins back in 2008, 2009, margins went down significantly.Now, we've got a little more balance between what we do internally versus what we do externally from a production standpoint. But the bottom line is, with revenue being down, as you mentioned, you said 7% to 11% from peak to trough. We have to run our factories at a lower level. And I think, we've done a very good job of controlling inventory levels ending this last quarter at 122 days.That's a very good position to be in with what's in front of us. So, I think it just comes down to utilization of our factory footprint that we have. And as we grow back into it, we can be very cost effective. -- It's just the trough though. -- I think his question is, revenue is so much higher than -- last time, our revenue was -- last time, our margin was this kind of number. So why is margin not higher? I think, Vivek, I think that's your question. -- I think that's right. -- Going back over two years ago it was a different company. I mean we didn't have Microsemi, all of their factories around the world, the totally different cost structure. Some of those factories have low demand, some of those are OK. I mean, it's not a -- it's not the same company.Combined with Microsemi now, Microsemi was about between 40% to 50% of our revenue and the company has totally changed. -- Thank you.The next question comes from the line of William Stein from SunTrust. Sir, please go ahead. -- Great. Thanks for taking my question. Steve, I apologize if you've answered this already. It seems clear you're expecting some further order cancels or push-outs or downsizes.So I think we understand that, but when we think about the pace of cancellations, have you commented on that yet? Is that starting to slow down where maybe the daily reduction in backlog is getting to a point where those changes are smaller and smaller. -- I don't know if I can definitely say that. I think it's end market by end market and it's geography-by-geography. But overall, it may have slowed down somewhat but in some other geographies and in some other markets, it's continuing. So I don't think -- If the cancellations were over and the pushouts were over, our revenue would be higher than March quarter.That's not what we're guiding and that's not what we're thinking. -- OK. That helps. Next one, if I can. Perhaps for Eric but whoever wants to take it, if most semi companies in the past few months or past couple of months have taken to try to term out debt and sort of protect themselves on the balance sheet.Microchip's moves here have been a little bit more, I don't know, it looks like opportunistic or aggressive you might characterize by pulling down the revolver to pay off part of the convert. I'm wondering if you can walk us through what the thinking was that gave the company the courage to do that in this environment? -- Let me take that. So, we began the effort to want to buy some of our convert back when the stock to hit about $60, like, low $60s and that was down from about a peak of $110. The amount of dilution we get from these converts, when the stock goes from, let's say, $65 to $110 is so large because it has a hyper feature where the stock at least at 1.5 times the rate for every $1 increase in stock price, and it was just very, very dilutive. So when the stock price, because of the recession, went down from $110 into low $60s, we decided not to waste that recession and retire a portion of our convert.But to do so, we needed the money and you said we took the money out of the line of credit. We did not. We didn't take any money out of the line of credit. We first wanted to raise the money in the public market through a debt, but with extreme volatility, the debt markets closed for a period of time.And so, we went to the direction of getting a 364-day bridge. So, we've got $615 million of bridge at very, very low interest rates, same interest rates as the line of credit. And with that, we bought $615 million worth of face value convertible. And by the time we executed those convertibles, stock had already rebounded to about $70, $71 where we averaged, where we bought them.And where the stock is now at $85.50, you could just imagine how much dilution we have saved that we would have incurred. So, we think there was a very, very opportunistic, good move, and we didn't stress the credit line to do that. We got a separate bridge. So it was a brand-new money, a separate bridge that we have to pay out someday within a year. -- Got it. I didn't -- maybe I didn't appreciate the distinction. Thank you. -- I just would say, I wish I was able to raise more money than I would have bought even more. But it was a very, very difficult time. There were companies, there was a run on the banks, people who are drawing their credit lines completely, and banks were under a lot of stress. And in that environment, I was able to raise $615 million of new money.It sounded like miracle at that time. Next question.The next question comes from the line -- from Susguehanna. Sir, please go ahead.Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. I guess, first, maybe talk about cycle times and lead times some of our data suggests that your lead times are up a little bit. I think you did talk about the Philippines, Malaysia.Maybe just talk about lead times from that perspective. I know they're low historically but talk about where you are there with any increases? And then, I guess, balance that with inventory, it looks like you're not increasing any inventory so I guess you guys aren't super worried. But maybe talk about that lead times and then the balance with inventory as well. -- Ganesh, let me have you take the lead time question. -- So lead times for most of our products remain relatively stable. Lead times in the factories that have been constrained by shelves when placed have gone out and they've gone out by, I would say, on average, about a couple of weeks. And so, whatever you are hearing or seeing is on certain product lines, particularly the ones that go through in Philippines or Malaysia, where we've seen it. But for the most part, lead times outside of that are remaining stable.And we expect that lead times will catch back to normal by probably closer to the end of the quarter as we catch up once factories reopen and we're able to both ship normal but also do any catch-up shipments.Great. Steve, you're the big picture guy. And you touched on this a bit already, but looking forward, what do you think that the biggest risks are to your business here? And if you have to start pulling some contingencies to lessen the blow, what are you thinking you can -- what's in your control from here that you plan on doing? Thank you. -- Well, the biggest risk to the business is that COVID-19 is not contained. As we are talking about from state to state and even internationally -- no, nationally and internationally from Washington other places, as people go back to work here in the coming months, question is, do we see a second wave of COVID-19 cases starting to go back up as people begin to go back to work. I think as people go back to work, there will be all the precautions of masks and cleaning and others. And hopefully, we will not have a second wave.But if there's a second wave requiring to go back to shelter in place, then that would be the largest risk, I would think. Because it will prolong the time frame during which the factories will be shut down, the demand would be low. People won't be buying cars and other stuff. That I see is the biggest risk.Now in terms of what levers do we have? I think, we've already implemented those levers while our business in March quarter was not even in a lot of stress, we sequentially grew, but we implemented these measures to essentially fight a Category 6 storm. And those are the levels we already have implemented and we'll just continue with those and look for even cutting more discretionary expenses, and if the capital could go down further, and any other discretionary expenses could go down further. I mean Ganesh and I and others, are willing to take a larger pickup in the -- but usually, it's a volume of people taking the pick up, that helps. And I don't think we can ask the worldwide employees to take a larger pickup, but you all also have policies to play with and capital and other things.But like I mentioned, I think in answer to an earlier question, we try to model a scenario to try to see what -- how much of revenue has to go down before we become cash flow negative or dividend comes to a questionable, it's way too low and we're not going to get there. I think it's just -- our business is too strong today. The formation of the business is so good that we're not going to buy any cash and the dividend is not at risk. And I think, we're in a pretty good place.Thank you and congrats on buying that [Inaudible] bonds. Nice price. -- Thanks.The next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. -- Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Just more of a sort of geographical question. Back in March, when the -- when we saw the team downshift at that time, the downshift was driven by sort of a shortfall in China, right? As the country was starting to open back up but at a slower pace, but you also did point out at that time that orders in business activity, at that time in China were starting to pick back up.And since then, we've seen more opening up of activity in China. We've seen auto production picking up this quarter. Factories are starting to open up, consumers starting to spend. So, have you since follow-through of that China improvement trend as maybe versus the world demand is weakening into the June quarter? Or are you also seeing degradation and deterioration in China orders and bookings as well? -- So, I think depending on whether you look at monthly or you look at it by quarter. When you look at it by quarter, China was very weak for the March quarter because Chinese New Year, first of all, was extended to two to three weeks from one week, and then, all these factories were closed. So the China business was very good, if you really look at it for the quarter. But if you look at it on a monthly basis, as the COVID-19 situation got contained and people went back to work, China business almost seems like it's back to normal.However, the concern is it may look like back to normal because it's really kind of making up for some of the shortfall in all that it had. And once that demand is met, is that steady state demand in China back to normal or not? I think that answer needs to be answered in the month of May and June. But April, China was very strong and late part of March, China was very strong as if it would be normal or even better. -- Yes. OK. I appreciate the insights there, Stephen. And then just on the back end operations, you talked about Malaysia, you talked about Philippines, but you guys actually have a pretty large test facility in Thailand.They're on lockdown until the end of this month. So how has the team been able to manage quite nicely through the movement control in Thailand? And is Thailand running at full run rate? -- Yes. So Thailand did not really have any strong ordinances. Let me have Ganesh comment on that. Ganesh? -- Yeah. So the Thailand lockdowns are really a curfew at night from about 10:00 p.m. until 8:00 a.m. It doesn't affect our shifts, our ability to operate our plants and so -- and there's been no logistical other issues that we run into.So thankfully, Thailand through this entire episode has been running full steam, no issues. -- Great. Thank you.The next question comes from the line of Ari Shusterman from -- -- This is Ari Shusterman on behalf of Raji Gill. Thank you for taking my question. So I first want to talk about automotive. So with Pin auto, which products have shown the greatest strength? And can you talk about traction you have been seeing in silicon carbide? Thank you. -- Let me have Ganesh answer that. -- So, I think when you have such a large demand reduction in automotive, there is no segment I can call out and say this is strong. And so, automotive across the board, when we look at our many different product lines that go into automotive, they're all down in this thing. Now to your question on the silicon carbide, it's early days, right? And silicon carbide is predominantly a new technology that is aimed at electric cars from a high-volume standpoint. Electric cars, as a percentage of the total automobiles produced are sold, are -- it's 1% to 2%, and so, it's still a small percentage.We're making good inroads with our products to be new designs and new activities are taking place, but it's really not a factor in any revenue that is taking place for automotive today. But we're making very good progress because the silicon carbide solution for microchip are extremely robust. And in an automotive environment, which is very harsh from a voltage and temperature standpoint, robustness is one of the most important factors they take into account for using silicon carbide products. -- And as a quick follow-up, with regards to your FPGA business, what trends you've been seeing in it? And how would you say your FPGAs compared to Lattice [Inaudible] Altera? Thank you. -- Go ahead, Ganesh. -- So our FPGA business continues to be reasonably strong. It had a nice growth, as we showed you in the March quarter results that we announced. Our FPGA also has a reasonably good exposure into defense and space applications. Those end markets are not as badly affected as some of the other end markets that we have.And to be quite honest, we don't really see Lattice and some of the other names that frequently and what we run-up into the market. We play predominantly into the midrange and to the mid- to lower end of the FPGA market. We have some unique positioning relative to security, low power, robustness, and in those areas, we do extremely well. -- Any other question, operator?Yes. The next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis from B. Riley FBR. Sir, go ahead. -- Yeah. Thanks for taking the question and team, thanks for all of the information so far. Steve, I wanted to go back to a couple of comments that you made about how unique this environment is. And the fact that we've got multiple dynamics at play when in the past we haven't had to contend with those.And the question for you is given how dynamic things are, what's Microchip doing? What are you doing to kind of assess where we are as demand compresses overall and then potentially reaccelerates? And is it orders and backlog grew, have you expanded the things that you look at to see when we'll get to the turn? And do you have a view on when we would get that turn, whether it be June or September or some other time? -- Well, our management team, Ganesh and I and the other members of the management team really keep a very, very strong finger on the pulse of the business. We watch a very large number of indicators, internal and external, on a weekly basis and more often than that, if needed, on specific indicators. So to that large stack of indicators and graphs that we constantly monitor, we have added a few to really further assess that situation frequently. And some of the things we are looking at it much more frequently are things like dollars of pushouts and cancellation, number of coronavirus cases and various geographies where our factories are and customers are, whether they are peaking, they're stable, they're growing, they're coming down.We're also just watching a number of other indicators, employment related, first time unemployment claims and all that. So there is really a large amount of data that we are absorbing. And this proven will include the data we get from our own customers through our salespeople regularly with bookings and design wins and our customers -- kind of customers' comments on whether the business is growing or certain -- falling, where would it go and what's happening. So, there's so much more intelligence that goes into really before we come to you and we're even more focused on getting all that intelligence today. -- OK. And is that giving you any sense for when we could be at a bottom? -- No. I think that is too early to really have that kind of confidence with the bottom. -- That's fair. -- The numbers are so broad. I mean, just have a guidance of minus 2% to minus 10% is just so broad that we cannot yet say what September will bring. It will largely depend on whether as the people go back to work, does the coronavirus just kind of dies down or there's a second wave of coronavirus coming back, and we're dealing with it with a factory shutdown even in August and September, if that happens then the bottom isn't here yet? -- Certainly. If I could ask a follow-up just relating to some of the things that are happening inside of the business, given how dynamic things are, one, does it cause the team to think any differently about the level of inventory that should be stocked to properly fulfill customers? And two, given Ganesh's characterization of what's strong and what's weak? Does it cause the team to think any differently about where it's emphasizing incremental R&D on products and that kind of thing? Thank you very much. -- So our long-term target for inventory level is 115 to 120, and we finished the March quarter at 122. I don't know if you get any more precise in that. So inventory is really right exactly where we want the inventory to be and I want to regard a little bit high earlier during the U.S.-China trade related softness, and then, we have been bringing it down. So March quarter inventory was nearly perfect.And because of this coronavirus situation now, we didn't want an inventory to substantially grow. So therefore, we have put our factories on reduced workload, rotating time off or reduced over work or whatever you may want to call it, so that as the revenue in the June quarter is declining, we don't want the inventories to grow very substantially. So I think our inventory is in the right range and we're comfortable with it. In terms of R&D, Ganesh, you want to comment on that? -- Yeah. So I think no one should take short-term positives and negatives as the way in which we're investing from an R&D perspective, right? That's what we're seeing in this cycle at this point in time. R&D is really a longer-term view of where are the market's going, where are the opportunities. And we are guided there by the 6 megatrends that we have shared with you.We believe over the next five to 10 years, growth is going to be available at a faster level or a higher level in 5G, data centers, ADAS, autonomous driving, IoT, electric vehicles, and artificial intelligence and machine learning. And so, with many product lines that Microchip are working on how can they create complete solutions, total system solutions for the megatrends, and what may be strong today and maybe not so strong in six months or 12 months isn't how we do our R&D spending. -- Thanks, guys. -- Thank you.I'm showing no further questions at this time. Presenters, you may continue. -- OK. Thank you, operator, and thanks to all the investors and analysts who are on this call. The travel is really totally banned. So we will be attending some of the conferences this quarter, they will all be virtual conferences.We'll do it out of our home. So we'll talk to you -- some of you more at those conferences. So thank you very much. -- Bye-bye.[Operator sign-off] --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

"If you'd like to gauge the health of the technology market, there are a few large semiconductor companies that act as bellweathers for the industry. Three of the biggest and broadest are  ,  , and  .Microchip serves a broad array of industries with its analog chips and microcontrollers. Intel's processors are heavily concentrated in both PCs and data centers. Taiwan Semiconductor makes a broad array of chips for designers that don't own their own fabs, with particular emphasis on mobile phone modems, high-performance computing chips, and graphics chips.By observing these three companies, investors can get a sense of how chips are selling overall. That has implications for all kinds of technology companies, from the chip producers themselves, to the software and cloud companies that are their buyers.And even though a severe economic slowdown is upon us, each of the above companies reported a recent  in sales. Could the stay-at-home economy actually be benefiting this industry, as others collapse?Image source: Getty Images.Last week, Intel CEO Bob Swan said in an interview with Bloomberg that Intel had seen an increase in demand for its processors during the first quarter, and that the company was still meeting 90% of its orders despite some coronavirus-related disruption to its supply chain.  Intel still has a dominant market share in processors worldwide, including for laptops, desktops, and data centers. The current need for remote work and education is spurring demand for high-speed laptops, and it's also taxing the capacity of data centers, which have needed to add more and more processors to keep up with the demand. Meanwhile, Taiwan Semiconductor recently reported a big surge in March sales numbers, which rocketed higher by 42% over the prior year and 21.5% over February. It should be noted that Taiwan Semi was already seeing very strong year-over-year growth even back in January, growing 32% over 2019. That was due to last year's semiconductor recession, caused by the U.S.-China trade war, which later improved with the  adoption, which requires lots of leading-edge chips, an area where Taiwan Semi has leapfrogged ahead of the competition. Finally, Microchip just pre-announced its first-quarter sales results, with a positive surprise over the outlook it gave just one month ago. The company is now saying its sales grew 3% month over month in March, as opposed to the flat sequential growth it had predicted earlier in the month.However, the most interesting number Microchip gave was its backlog for the June quarter, which is now 9% higher than it was at this time during the March quarter.Could all of these results mean semiconductors are seeing accelerating growth?  Given the uncertainty in the economy, these companies aren't exactly celebrating. In fact, Microchip management clearly doesn't believe in its own sales growth, saying in a press release: ""Microchip ... believes that the strength in bookings may be a result of customer concerns about supply chain disruptions due to the COVID-19 virus. With economies around the world contracting rapidly, with millions of people getting laid off and with customer factory closures due to 'shelter in place' ordinances in various countries, we believe that product demand is likely to weaken significantly."" As a consequence, CEO Steve Sanghi, other top managers, and Microchip directors are taking 20% pay cuts immediately. Non-factory workers will take a 10% salary cut, and factory workers have been asked to take rotating time off. Microchip will also be lowering its capital expenditures to between $50 million and $70 million. Meanwhile, while Intel is currently reporting increased demand, it suspended its share repurchase program on March 24. Intel described the share repurchase suspension as ""conservative,"" but the very next day, the company tapped the debt markets, raising $8 billion in senior notes with maturities between 2025 and 2060. TSMC hasn't given an outlook beyond its current reported numbers.Two leading technology firms, IDC and  , both have some different predictions for the semiconductor market in 2020. Prior to the COVID-19 updates, IDC predicted 2% growth and Gartner had predicted a much more robust 12.5% growth in 2020. Now, IDC is predicting a 3% to 6% decline in semi revenues, with Gartner only predicting a 0.9% decrease. In order to get to those numbers, things will have to fall off in a big way in the second half of the year from these solid first-half numbers. Certainly, there has been a near-term rush to buy chips, for fear of supply disruptions later in the year. That could mean the buying dries up later, especially if demand goes down and customers are sitting on lots of inventory.Still, there's likely to be a big difference in chip growth in 2020, .Assuming we will have to continue social distancing measures for the next few months or quarters, I can see data center chips holding up, especially for memory, storage, and processing power. Video game graphics chips, memory, and semi-custom chips for video consoles could also get a boost, as people play more video games at home, and with the new Xbox and PlayStation consoles scheduled for release this winter.However, mobile phone, industrial, and automotive applications, all of which are levered to consumer buying and economic growth, are likely to take big hits. That could be why Microchip is the most pessimistic. It has much broader exposure to industrial, automotive, and consumer appliances than the other two companies above.Thus, I think technology investors need to pick their spots and focus on chip stocks with exposure to data centers, gaming, and perhaps laptops going forward in 2020. The more broad chipmakers with exposure to industrial and automotive segments, like Microchip, are likely to have much weaker sales in the second half.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, , has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.  The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Semiconductor Sales Are Booming, But Will It Last?@2020-04-13@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/semiconductor-sales-are-booming-but-will-it-last-2020-04-13

Finding a reliable stock strategy is a key to sanity in this Age of Coronavirus. The pandemic has pushed governments to impost extreme economic shutdown orders, as part of a larger society ‘stay at home’ policy. The result has been a stoppage of business, a decline in earnings, and a sudden sharp turn from steady economic growth to a deep recessionary event, perhaps even a Depression. And so, for investors, a reliable stock strategy is both necessary and hard to find.One strategy is to follow the insiders. Insiders are the corporate officers and board members charged with running and overseeing public companies. Their positions give them access to information that’s not always available to the general public. To keep the playing field honest, Federal regulators require that insiders publish their trades – and that information can be used by the general public for trading purposes.When the insiders make large purchases, laying down large sums for hefty blocs of shares, it can be taken as a clear sign of confidence. So following their purchases is a viable strategy for finding potentially profitable stock plays.TipRanks has the tools to help you do just that. The  page shows which stocks top insiders are most active on, for both purchases and sales. You can sort insider trades by a variety of filters, including trading strategy. We’ve done some of the legwork for you, and pulled up three stocks with recent informative buy-side transactions. Here are the results.We’ll start in the semiconductor chip industry. Microchip is a major name in the industry, boasting a market cap of $21.5 billion and the sixth largest sales share among its peers. The company’s focus is on microcontroller and microprocessor chips for memory solutions, power managements apps, and wireless connection devices. These are essential components in today’s digital world – Microchip never has a problem finding customers.Two important company officers have bought up large blocs of shares in recent days. First up was Steve Sanghi, CEO and Chairman, who put down $3.1 million to buy 37,000 shares. Also buying shares was Senior VP Richard Simoncic, who bought over 6,000 shares for more than $501K. This is a substantial fraction of his total $4.8 million holding.The calendar Q1 performance shows the company’s quality. MCHP reported strong EPS, of $1.46, beating the forecast by over 6%. Revenues, while missing the estimates, did grow over 3% sequentially, to $1.33 billion. Management attributed the mixed results to the impact of coronavirus on demand – weak demand in the automotive, industrial, and consumer segments meant that those manufacturers in turn had weak demand for Microchip’s products. At the same time, communication and data center demand grew, as a direct result of the move toward remote office work and customer service.Writing on the stock for Piper Sandler, 5-star analyst  notes that Microchip’s forward guidance was squarely in line with expectations, and that the company is taking a cautious approach to the 2020 sales environment. Kumar writes, “Looking to the mid and long-term, we continue to like Microchip, as it remains one of the best positioned and most profitable semiconductor companies. Even in the current environment, free cash flow and debt pay down were both exceptional.”Kumar places a Buy rating on MCHP shares, and that backs that with a $120 price target suggesting a 36% upside potential for the coming 12 months. (To watch Kumar’s track record, )The Strong Buy analyst consensus rating on this stock is based on 16 reviews, including 13 Buys and 3 Holds. Shares are priced at $87.81, while the average target of $102.56 implies a 16% upside potential. ()  Last on today’s list is Arconic, a name you may not have heard of in its current incarnation. This company is a spin-off from the aluminum giant Alcoa. Arconic became an independent entity, controlling the parent company’s bauxite and aluminum operations, last November. The new company’s focus is lightweight metals engineering and precision manufacturing. Arconic’s products are used in the aerospace, automotive, commercial transport, defense, electronics, and oil and gas fields. Arconic is particularly well-known for turbine blades. ARNC shares started trading this past March. Since it opened trading less than three months ago, ARCN shares are up 46%.In recent days, no fewer than 5 of Arconic’s insiders have bought up blocs of shares. The prices paid ranged from $114,000 to $346,000. The two largest purchases were by directors: William Austen bought 17,620 shares for $202,000, and Frederick Henderson bought 33,200 shares for $346,000. These purchases are a clear indicator for investors that this company’s officers are confident in its future.Also confident is Credit Suisse analyst , who writes, “ARNC is a high-quality producer of aluminum alloy rolled products with significant leverage to secular growth in automotive and packaging, and a LT recovery in aerospace. We see 3Q as a major inflection point as Ford and GM truck / SUV production sharply accelerates and OEMs need to restock heat-treat plate, which has limited shelf life.”Woodworth puts a $22 price target on ARNC shares, implying a strong 71% upside as he initiates coverage on this new industrial stock. (To watch Woodworth’s track record, )While ARNC has only two recent reviews (it is a new stock, after all), they combine to a Moderate Buy rating. Shares are selling for $12.84, after two months of solid gains, and the average price target of $19.50 suggests the stock has room for a 51% upside this year. ()Next up is a real estate investment trust (REIT). These companies typically offer investors a solid combination of firm financial and reliable dividends. Clipper Realty owns, manages and operates commercial properties and multi-family residential (that’s apartments) properties, in and around the New York City area.Two insiders have made informative buys here in the past 7 days. The larger purchase was by David Bistricer, a director of the company. He bought up 106,666 shares for $611,000. His Board colleague, Sam Levinson, made a smaller purchase of 14,334 shares, paying over $82,000. CLPR showed $30.9 million in revenue for Q1 2020, up more than 11% from the year before. Net operating income, at $17.1 million, was a company record – but better for investors, was also up 16% year-over-year. The strong income supported a dividend of 9.5 cents per share for the quarter. CLPR’s dividend has been steady for the past three years, and the current payout ratio, of 73%, is a clear attraction for investors interested in an income stock. The yield, at 5.6%, is almost triple the average yield among financial sector peers.The stock has only one recent analyst review, by B. Riley FBR analyst , but he wears his bullishness on his sleeve. His Buy rating is backed up with a $14 price target – which implies a robust 107% one-year upside potential. (To watch Kucera’s track record, )Kucera writes of CLPR, “1Q20 results were ahead of expectations, and April cash rent collections from CLPR's diversified portfolio of residential, office, and retail assets located in the greater NYC metro were at 94%... we believe CLPR's decision to significantly increase its liquidity during a challenging NYC commercial real estate environment related to COVID-19 was prudent.”The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Solid Insider Buying Puts These 3 Stocks in Focus@2020-05-26@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/solid-insider-buying-puts-these-3-stocks-in-focus-2020-05-26

There's one good thing about a major market downturn. It creates opportunities to buy stocks at more attractive prices. Sometimes, market downturns provide the chance to buy stocks at really great prices.Of course, not every stock that's cheaper is necessarily a smart pick. But some are. Here are three bargain stocks you can buy right now that should be winners over the long term.Image source: Getty Images.  is one of the biggest companies in the pharmaceutical industry with a wide range of products on the market. Its stock has regained most of the loss experienced in the stock market sell-off caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, BMS shares still trade at less than 10 times expected earnings.The drugmaker's current lineup includes several blockbuster drugs for which sales continue to grow briskly. Blood thinner Eliquis, cancer immunotherapy Opdivo, and rheumatoid arthritis drug Orencia are on that list. So are three cancer drugs that BMS gained with its acquisition of Celgene late last year -- Revlimid, Pomalyst, and Abraxane.BMS also now has some promising new drugs and pipeline candidates thanks to the Celgene deal. It recently won FDA approval for Zeposia in treating multiple sclerosis. Reblozyl has picked up two FDA approvals, one for treating anemia in adults with beta-thalassemia and another for treating anemia in adults with myelodysplastic syndromes. BMS's pipeline features two cell therapies that have blockbuster potential, ide-cel and liso-cel.These current products and candidates that could be on the way should fuel double-digit earnings growth for BMS over the next five years. The company also pays a dividend that yields close to 3%. I think that the combination of an attractive valuation, strong growth, and a solid dividend  right now.'s  name gives away what it does. The company develops and sells microchips and embedded control technology used across multiple industries. Its shares are down more than 20% from the highs earlier this year and trade at around 14 times expected earnings, which is a low level historically for Microchip.To be sure, Microchip could feel some short-term pain from the COVID-19 crisis and the resulting economic impact. Although the company recently reported that its sales for the quarter ending on March 31, 2020, will likely be higher than expected, it's taking actions to prepare for an economic downturn, including cutting executive salaries by 20%, cutting non-factory employees' salaries by 10%, and reducing capital expenditures.But there are six megatrends that should enable Microchip to achieve strong growth over the next decade. Perhaps the most important of these is the rollout of 5G infrastructure.

"Looking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. 	For the iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (Symbol: SOXX), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $278.38 per unit.


With SOXX trading at a recent price near $236.05 per unit, that means that analysts see 17.93% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings.   Three of SOXX's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Silicon Laboratories Inc (Symbol: SLAB), Microchip Technology Inc (Symbol: MCHP), and ON Semiconductor Corp (Symbol: ON). Although SLAB has traded at a recent price of $90.97/share, the average analyst target is 38.14% higher at $125.67/share. Similarly, MCHP has 32.61% upside from the recent share price of $88.68 if the average analyst target price of $117.60/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting ON to reach a target price of $23.47/share, which is 31.63% above the recent price of $17.83. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of SLAB, MCHP, and ON:  

   Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:

Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

"The longest bull market in history came to a crashing end on Feb. 19 as panic over the global spread of COVID-19 sent stocks into a tailspin. The S&P 500, the most common benchmark for the U.S. equity market, plunged 30% in only a month.The outlook for stocks has arguably never been more uncertain. The situation under which we live is subject to change not just by the day, but by the hour. Although there are few places for equity investors to hide these days, Wall Street analysts are pinning their hopes on a select group of dividend stocks.Dividends are known for adding some defensive characteristics to stocks, and so it makes sense at this time to single them out. To that end, we scoured the S&P 500 for dividend stocks with yields of more than 2%, excluding a number of extremely high yielders because of excessive current risk (such as certain energy stocks). Sometimes, a too-high yield can be a warning sign that a stock is in deep trouble. From that pool, we focused on stocks with an average broker recommendation of Buy or better. S&P  Intelligence surveys analysts' stock ratings and scores them on a five-point scale, where 1.0 equals Strong Buy and 5.0 means Strong Sell. Any score of 2.0 or lower means that analysts, on average, rate the stock a Buy. The closer the score gets to 1.0, the stronger the Buy call.Lastly, we dug into research and analysts' estimates on the top-scoring names.That led us to these top 25 dividend stocks, by virtue of their high analyst ratings, at this unprecedented moment in American history.Market value: $65.2 billionDividend yield: 2.5%Analysts' average rating: 1.91Shares in Mondelez International (, $45.47) are down a painful 28% since the bull market top of Feb. 19 to lag the S&P 500 by about 5 percentage points. But the company was showing strong sales growth before the coronavirus hit, and Americans holed up in their homes should only increase demand for long-lived edibles.If there was a knock on Mondelez, it was the valuation. For instance, in January, Stifel rated MDLZ at Hold because it was already trading at a significant premium to peers. Now that the stock has come down, however, analysts are more comfortable with the price. The yield, which still isn't great compared to the other top 25 dividend stocks on this list, has at least come up as a result of those declines, too.It also helps that in late February, Mondelez bought a majority stake in Give & Go, which sells sweet baked goods in supermarkets and other retailers. Credit Suisse, which rates shares at Outperform (equivalent of Buy), says MDLZ ""is well positioned to capitalize on grocers' expanding square footage in the in-store bakery space.""Analysts surveyed by S&P  Intelligence expect the company to deliver average annual earnings growth of 8% over the next five years.Market value: $29.8 billionDividend yield: 4.0%Analysts' average rating: 1.88Eaton (, $72.45), which sells a vast portfolio of electrical and industrial components, is a popular stock in the industrials sector. Thirteen analysts polled by S&P  Intelligence rate the stock at Strong Buy, and another four say Buy. That compares to nine Holds and zero analysts saying to ditch the stock. notes that Eaton's stock gained interest from the so-called  in the fourth quarter. Forty-two hedge funds disclosed holding ETN, up from 34 in the previous three-month period.""Eaton's strong balance sheet and sharply increased liquidity following completion of the sale of its Lighting business early Monday, March 2, are notably reassuring for investors during uncertain times along with its increasingly less cyclical business mix,"" says William Blair Equity Research, which rates the stock at Hold.Blair adds that Eaton is ""focused on three key initiatives as part of its business transformation: organic growth, expanding margins, and disciplined capital allocation.""Market value: $13.3 billionDividend yield: 4.6%Analysts' average rating: 1.87 tend to be solid equity income plays. That's because they are required to pay out at least 90% of their taxable earnings as dividends in exchange for certain tax benefits. As such, REITs often carry higher yields than other dividend stocks.Boston Properties (, $85.57) is one of a few REITs that analysts have remained bullish on so far in this bear market. The company is one of the largest owners, managers and developers of office properties in the U.S. Its main markets include the pricey cities of Boston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco and Washington, D.C.A hefty dividend yield well above 4% allows BXP to fulfill its role as an equity income investment. Zacks  says the REIT is a great dividend stock right now. ""Boston Properties has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 10.91%,"" Zacks says.Stifel upgraded the REIT from Hold to Buy on March 10, citing diving interest rates as a reason to ""get more positive on quality REITs,"" and believing BXP to be a more defensive play going forward.Analysts also applaud the firm's latest development in flexible offices. The 35,000-square-foot space in Boston features an apartment tower, a CitizenM Hotel, restaurants such as Guy Fieri Tequila Cocina, Banners Kitchen & Tap, an Arclight Cinemas movie theater and a Star Market Grocery Store.Naturally, exposure to those kinds of tenants is part of why BXP is off 40% during the past month. But the pros appear to believe in the company's ability to bounce back once coronavirus precautions are rolled back.Market value: $19.3 billionDividend yield: 4.5%Analysts' average rating: 1.87EOG Resources (, $33.22), the largest oil-and-gas driller in South Texas, is among a few energy stocks that counterintuitively made this top 25 list of dividend stocks. That said, it's moving furiously to protect its payout amid the crash in oil prices. EOG said it's cutting projected annual spending by 31% to direct cash back to shareholders.""Our first priority is to generate high returns with every dollar we spend even at low oil prices,"" CEO Bill Thomas said in a statement. ""With oil around $30, our 2020 premium drilling program is expected to generate more than 30% direct after-tax rate of return.""Analysts were relieved to hear the news, as a number of energy stocks have been either forced to reduce their payouts or at least consider doing so. But EOG is getting out in front of such concerns.""EOG noted that this is not an environment to take a wait-and- see approach,"" writes RBC Capital Markets analysts. ""The dividend remains its priority and will cut activity to maintain its payout.""Thirteen analysts call EOG a Strong Buy at the moment, while nine say it's a Buy. Eight call it a Hold, and one has it at Strong Sell.Market value: $72.2 billionDividend yield: 3.6%Analysts' average rating: 1.86CVS Health (, $55.38), like a number of other , is outperforming the S&P 500 since the market top. Yes, it's still off about 24% during the bear market. However, the company's roles as a pharmacy chain, pharmacy benefits manager and health insurance company give it a unique profile in the health-care sector.CVS also is one of the relatively few companies getting a boost from the COVID-19 outbreak.""CVS is seeing a lift in its front store in general healthcare products, as well as cleaning supplies, general household merchandise, sanitizers, etc."" writes Credit Suisse, which rates shares at Neutral (equivalent of Hold).Investors looking for dividend stocks should just note that while CVS has a strong payment history, it ended its 14-year streak of dividend hikes in 2018. The company kept its payout level, choosing instead to divert cash toward paying off its debt, which ballooned when it assumed $8 billion of Aetna's debt after it acquired the insurer in 2018.But you're getting a stronger balance sheet as a result. Analysts write that CVS Health has paid down $8 billion since the close of the Aetna transaction, and it plans to pay down roughly $3.8 billion in debt in 2020.Market value: $72.6 billionDividend yield: 3.5%Analysts' average rating: 1.85There are a lot of moving parts at United Technologies (, $83.76) these days, but analysts still mostly like what they see.The industrial conglomerate in November closed its $30 billion acquisition of defense contractor Rockwell Collins. However, it will soon split apart into three separate companies. UTX will spin off its Otis elevator unit and the Carrier heating-and-cooling-systems division later this year to focus on aerospace.But the really big news came in June 2019, when United Technologies announced a merger with defense contractor Raytheon (). The deal, pending approval, would create a company with a market value of more than $100 billion after its spinoffs. Only Boeing would be a bigger aerospace-and-defense company by revenue.Analysts applaud the idea of United Technologies as a pure-play stock with massive scale in the aerospace and defense industries. At the end of January, Benchmark Securities initiated coverage of UTX at Buy ahead of ""its historic split.""Shares have plunged about 45% since the market top, and they're back to levels last seen eight years ago, but a plurality of analysts are sticking by their bull cases. JPMorgan Chase, for instance, recently reiterated its Overweight rating, saying it thinks the stock has ""pulled back too much.""Market value: $84.1 billionDividend yield: 3.0%Analysts' average rating: 1.84Honeywell (, $118.96), a multinational industrial conglomerate, has tumbled with the rest of the market, but some analysts say this defense contractor has defensive properties.""The fear for investors now is that COVID-19 appears to be the 'black swan' event that is finally ending the commercial aerospace cycle,"" writes Canaccord Genuity. ""We believe the risks around COVID-19 and uncertainty in the commercial aerospace sector will favor defense stocks.""Of the analysts covering Honeywell stock, 12 have it at Strong Buy, six say Buy and seven say Hold. Their average annual growth forecast is 8.5% for the next three to five years. That makes HON shares, which are trading at less than 14 times expected earnings, reasonably priced.A decent dividend yield of 3% - about 50% better than the S&P 500 - adds to the appeal.Market value: $31.6 billionDividend yield: 4.7%Analysts' average rating: 1.84Plunging long-term interest rates are making sectors flush with higher-yielding dividend stocks (such as ) more attractive.With the yield on the 10-year Treasury note setting record lows in mid-March, Exelon (, $32.41) looks pretty attractive to analysts and income investors alike. The nation's largest utility company by revenue offers a generous 4.7% yield on its dividend.BMO Capital Markets initiated coverage of EXC in February at Outperform (equivalent of Buy), noting that Illinois clean energy legislation has the potential to ""materially move investor perception"" of Exelon.Of the 19 analysts covering Exelon tracked by S&P Global Market Intelligence, seven rate the stock at Strong Buy, eight say it's a Buy and four call EXC a Hold. While analysts have been lowering their price targets to keep up with the sharp decline in EXC and the rest of the market, the consensus price target of $52.06 implies more than 60% of upside from current levels.Market value: $53.6 billionDividend yield: 3.2%Analysts' average rating: 1.84When it comes to home improvement chains, Home Depot (), a member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, gets all the glory.But rival Lowe's (, $69.87) has Home Depot beat when it comes to longtime dividend growth.Lowe's has paid a cash distribution every quarter since going public in 1961, and that dividend has increased annually for more than half a century. Most recently, in May 2019, Lowe's announced that it would lift its quarterly payout by 14.5% to 55 cents a share.While Lowe's easily makes the top 25 of analyst-favored dividend stocks, there's still some room for concern. Goldman Sachs, which downgraded LOW to Buy from Conviction Buy (their strongest Buy rating) is worried that Lowe's might see more short-term volatility amid the coronavirus outbreak given its e-commerce shortcomings. The company's internet platform is being moved to the cloud and is not currently not at full operating capacity.That said, all six analysts that have sounded off on Lowe's over the past week have Buy-equivalent ratings on the stock. That's in part because further out, the pros are projecting average annual earnings growth of more than 15%.Market value: $61.5 billionDividend yield: 3.7%Analysts' average rating: 1.83Analysts see outsize upside in shares of BlackRock (, $397.36) over the next 12 months or so. Wall Street's average price target stands at $514.89. That gives shares in the world's largest asset manager - responsible for BlackRock mutual and closed-end funds, as well as iShares exchange-traded funds - implied upside of almost 30%.Meanwhile, earnings are forecast to grow at an average annual pace of more than 10%, and the stock trades at a forward-looking price-to-earnings ratio of 12.7. It's clear Wall Street thinks BlackRock is a bargain at current levels; seven analysts rate BLK at Strong Buy, seven call it a Buy and four say it's a Hold.Wells Fargo () in March lowered its price target on BlackRock to $490 from $590 due to plunging global equity markets. But the bank reaffirmed its Overweight (equivalent of Buy) rating on BLK.Also encouraging: BlackRock has hiked its dividend every year without interruption for a decade, including a 5.4% improvement announced back in January.Market value: $110.1 billionDividend yield: 3.7%Analysts' average rating: 1.83Bristol-Myers Squibb (, $48.79) works well for investors looking for income and defense. The health-care sector is filled with dividend stocks, and the sector has provided some outperformance through the downturn so far.BMY shares, in specific, have beaten the S&P 500 by about 3 percentage points in the decline, and they've lost only about 2% over the past 52 weeks vs. a decline of 14% for the index.Analysts look forward to the company's new-found strength now that it completed its $74 billion merger with fellow pharmaceutical giant Celgene (). Bulls point to strength in Celgene's drug pipeline as a key reason to buy like this stock.Acquisitions have served BMY well since Bristol-Myers merged with Squibb three decades ago. A long track record of successful acquisitions has kept the pharma company's pipeline primed with big-name drugs over the years. Among the better-known names today are Coumadin, a blood thinner, and Glucophage, for Type 2 diabetes.Bank of America Merrill Lynch rates shares at Buy, citing the stock's ""particularly attractive."" More importantly, BofA says shares are oversold in the midst of coronavirus panic.Market value: $111.4 billionDividend yield: 3.3%Analysts' average rating: 1.8The world's largest hamburger chain also happens to be a dividend stalwart. Changing consumer tastes will always be a risk, but McDonald's (, $149.50) dividend dates back to 1976 and has gone up every year since. That's the power of being a consumer giant that has been able to adjust itself to changing consumer tastes without losing its core.McDonald's has closed its dining rooms to customers because of the coronavirus outbreak, but continues to offer take-out, drive-thru and delivery services.""(Hold-rated) McDonald's is enjoying sales momentum in domestic and international markets, and has essentially completed a business model transformation that should produce more predictable earnings and higher cash flow conversion,"" Stifel wrote on March 6.And again, you can't beat MCD for dividend reliability. McDonald's is one of 64 S&P 500 dividend stocks that have raised their payouts every year for at least a quarter-century. MCD last improved its dividend by 8%, to $1.25 per share, in September. That marked its 43rd consecutive annual increase.Market value: $106.2 billionDividend yield: 2.7%Analysts' average rating: 1.79Medtronic (, $79.22) is one of a few coronavirus plays among these top 25 dividend stocks, and it has gone into overdrive as the world battles the spread of COVID-19.The company is one of the world's largest makers of medical devices, holding more than 4,600 patents on products ranging from insulin pumps for diabetics to stents used by cardiac surgeons. Look around a hospital or doctor's office - in the U.S. or in about 160 other countries - and there's a good chance you'll see Medtronic's products.Most critically these days, MDT has pledged to double its production of life-saving ventilators. Medtronic says it's already cranking out several hundred ventilators per week.MDT is focused on the health of its shareholders as well as its patients: Medtronic has been steadily increasing its dividend every year for more than four decades, making it a member of the S&P Dividend Aristocrats.Credit Suisse maintains its Outperform rating despite the virus disrupting elective surgery and other procedures. Analysts expect average annual earnings growth of 9% over the next five years.Market value: $19.8 billionDividend yield: 3.1%Analysts' average rating: 1.79Tyson Foods (, $54.21) is another company experiencing a huge surge in demand because of the outbreak. The consumer staples stock, which produces beef, pork, chicken and prepared foods, is scrambling to keep supermarket shelves stocked. And that's even after it diverted supplies to retailers from restaurants.Tyson CEO Noel White said the company is up to the challenge.""Once we are able to replenish supplies ... then I think that we'll be back in better equilibrium between supply and demand,"" the CEO  on March 19.It's hard to find stocks that Wall Street feels good about these days, but Tyson is one of the few. Six analysts surveyed by S&P Global Market Intelligence rate the stock at Strong Buy, five say Buy and three call it a Hold. They expect average annual growth of 11% over the next five years, which compares well to a thin forward-looking P/E of just 10.Market value: $5.7 billionDividend yield: 5.6%Analysts' average rating: 1.79Federal Realty Investment Trust (, $75.53) is a REIT that owns retail and mixed-use real estate across 12 states, as well as the District of Columbia. Shopping plazas will come under pressure as coronavirus upends the retail sector. However, mixed-use properties should fare better.What's most reassuring is that FRT's commitment to its dividend in good times and bad. The REIT has hiked its payout every year for more than half a century. Federal Realty Investment Trust has registered roughly 59% dividend growth over the past decade, including a 2.9% improvement to the cash distribution announced in June 2019.A couple of analysts have lowered their price targets on the stock, but they remain largely bullish, at 10 Strong Buys, 3 Buys, 6 Holds and no bearish calls.Market value: $5.0 billionDividend yield: 3.0%Analysts' average rating: 1.75Assurant (, $83.44) missed Wall Street estimates when it reported fourth-quarter earnings in February, but it still posted an impressive bottom-line result. Net income spiked 192% from the year-ago quarter.Fewer catastrophes helped boost the insurance company's bottom line. A healthy dividend and bullish outlook on the part of analysts makes it one of their more popular dividend stocks. Two analysts call it a Strong Buy, one says Buy and one says Hold.Their average target price of $144.50 gives Assurant shares implied upside of about 66% in the next 12 to 18 months. Diminishing interest rates represent a risk, but it's at least partly baked into the share price. AIZ trades for just 7.8 times 2021 earnings.Market value: $16.2 billionDividend yield: 3.1%Analysts' average rating: 1.73Alexandria Real Estate Equities (, $132.00) specializes in urban office space - specifically, life science, technology and agricultural technology ""clusters,"" which might be less at risk than other types of tenants. That could explain why shares have outperformed the S&P 500 by 7 percentage points throughout this bear run.Dividends at least appear safe in the short-term. The company announced a $1.03-per-share dividend at the beginning of March, payable April 15, to shareholders of record as of March 31. So at least for now, it sees no reason to back down from its income payouts.Of the 11 analysts covering the stock tracked by S&P Global Market Intelligence, six have it at Strong Buy, two say Buy and three rate it at Hold. Their compound annual growth forecast comes to 5.1% over the next three to five years. Better still, a price target of $177.18 gives ARE implied upside of almost 35% over the next 52 weeks or so.Market value: $19.5 billionDividend yield: 4.3%Analysts' average rating: 1.71FirstEnergy (, $35.99), an electric utility with 6 million customers in the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions, took a promising step last year. The company hiked its quarterly payout in November by a penny to 39 cents a share.Why highlight such a modest dividend hike?Because the dividend had been stuck at 36 cents per share for five years. In 2014, FirstEnergy clipped its payout by more than a third amid declining power prices. In late 2018, FirstEnergy management claimed that the company would be returning to growth and implied that higher dividends were a goal going forward.Argus analyst Jacob Kilstein recently upgraded FE to Buy from Hold. BofA also thinks more highly of FirstEnergy than it once did, upgrading it from Buy to Neutral amid continued weakness in shares.Utilities, while reliable dividend stocks, aren't known for rapid growth; the Street expects average annual earnings growth of only about 3% for the next five years. However, the dividend yield of more than 4% makes FE shares more palatable.Market value: $179.4 billionDividend yield: 3.5%Analysts' average rating: 1.7Health-care stocks are a classically defensive sector, the thinking being that consumers spend on their health in both good times and bad. Merck (, $70.73), a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, has suffered limited losses as it brings it considerable firepower to the pandemic fight.The dividend stock is off just 13% since the market peak vs. the 29% decline in the blue-chip index. The gargantuan drugmaker is just one of many  scrambling to develop vaccines and treatments for COVID-19. Wall Street analysts see more upside ahead. Of the 20 analysts covering the stock tracked by S&P Global Market Intelligence, 11 rate it at Strong Buy, four say Buy and five call it a Hold.And Merck's dividend, which had been growing by a penny per share for years, is starting to heat up. MRK upgraded its payouts by 14.6% in 2019, then followed that up with a nearly 11% improvement for 2020, with the next quarterly dividend scheduled to be paid April 7.Market value: $47.2 billionDividend yield: 3.6%Analysts' average rating: 1.68Prologis (, $63.91), a real estate investment trust specializing in industrial properties and assets, is popular among Wall Street's pros thanks to its global footprint and favorable economics.A quick snapshot: Prologis owns more than 960 million square feet of logistics real estate (think warehouses and distribution centers) across 19 countries on four continents. PLD is well situated to take advantage of the evolving retail economy, in which companies increasingly must distribute directly to consumers rather than brick-and-mortar retail stores.Stifel, which has shares at Buy, notes that ""industrial fundamentals within the U.S. and internationally remain strong,"" and ""as the largest industrial REIT globally and with a deep team in the U.S. and abroad, it is well positioned to execute on all fronts with a high degree of selectivity.""Analysts expect Prologis, which recently completed its $12.6 billion acquisition of competitor Liberty Property Trust (), to grow its profits by an average of 5.2% annually over the next three to five years.""A successful track record of integrating large acquisitions is another core competency of this best-in-class management team and gives us confidence in reiterating our Buy rating,"" Deutsche Bank analysts write.Market value: $163.6 billionDividend yield: 2.6%Analysts' average rating: 1.67Cable, broadband and media giant Comcast (, $35.94) has 20 Strong Buy ratings from Wall Street analysts, putting it high among these top 25 dividend stocks.But that might not last long.So far, the Olympics are still on. But if they're canceled by August, that will really hurt revenue. The shortened NHL season is also hurting the top line. Analysts figure that Comcast's Universal Studios parks in the U.S. will be closed for at least a month. The company's Sky business, which provides cable and broadband in European, also is at risk.Credit Suisse recently maintained its Outperform rating on the cable giant, but reduced its target price by $4 per share to $51 based on projected hits to earnings.""While our new assumptions carry a high degree of uncertainty given the rapidly changing backdrop, we felt the Parks closures, sporting event suspensions, Hollywood production delays and likely impacts on advertising needed to be addressed,"" Credit Suisse writes.More optimistically, Credit Suisse notes that ""Comcast is fortunate to be able to invest through this uncertainty, and at this time we expect its businesses will have recovered by 2021 or 2022.""Market value: $20.9 billionDividend yield: 10.0%Analysts' average rating: 1.67Dow (, $28.12) gained a place in the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 2017. That's when the specialty chemicals company merged with DuPont (). Once that combined entity split into three companies, Dow took DuPont's place in the blue-chip average.Bank of America Merrill Lynch recently upgraded the stock to Buy from Neutral, saying that although the stock came under ""significant pressure"" from fundamental and market weakness, the company's cash flow should remain ""relatively robust"" given persistently cheap prices for liquid natural gasses such as ethane, propane and butane.Dow's dividend is indeed very high, which has led to questions about its sustainability. But CEO Jim Fitterling , ""It's an artificially high dividend yield. We're in a much, much different financial position than we've been, and we did it deliberately to be ready to go into a down cycle after about a 10- to 11-year bull run in this market.""Of the 18 analysts covering the stock tracked by S&P Global Market Intelligence, six rate it at Strong Buy, two say Buy, nine call it a Hold and one says Sell. Their average price target of $39.76 gives Dow implied upside of more than 40% over the next 12 months.Market value: $6.0 billionDividend yield: 5.0%Analysts' average rating: 1.64Not all utility stocks have been a safe haven during the current market crash. NRG Energy (, $23.95) is among them, having dropped 39% since the start of the bear market.But NRG nonetheless is popular among the analyst crowd. The electric company gets six Strong Buy recommendations, three Buys and two Holds, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.Their current target price of $44.95 gives shares implied upside of 88% in the next year or so, although that's subject to change as analysts get more visibility into current economic conditions. However, on March 12, Morgan Stanley analysts raised their price target to $55 per share, from $54.Wall Street expects annual average earnings growth of just 3.5% over the next five years out of NRG Energy, which makes sense given the low-growth nature of the utility sector. However, the stock adequately reflects that low growth rate, trading at less than times 2020 earnings.Market value: $14.5 billionDividend yield: 2.4%Analysts' average rating: 1.61It's not yet clear where semiconductor stocks like Microchip Technology (, $60.56) are headed. Rosenblatt Securities recently cut its price target on MCHP to $120 from $132 after the company gave a downbeat outlook for the March-quarter revenue due to impacts from the COVID-19 outbreak.Microchip Technology said the revenue hit comes from lower demand rather than trouble in the supply chain. Rosenblatt said the roughly 5% cut to expectations for the March quarter was about what it expected. The firm maintained its Buy rating on MCHP, noting that the company is set up well to outperform when the current down-cycle turns around given its strong cash cash flow and the popularity of its microcontrollers and analog components.Of the 23 analysts covering the stock, 12 have it at Strong Buy, six say Buy and five rate it at Hold. They forecast average annual earnings growth of more than 12% over the next five years. More impressive still is the potential upside of nearly 84% implied by an average price target of $111.68. That's high praise for a company that belongs to Wall Street's hardest-hit sector right now.Market value: $10.0 billionDividend yield: 3.6%Analysts' average rating: 1.53Analysts remain bullish on Pioneer Natural Resources (, $60.37) as the oil and gas company cut capital expenditures for this year by 45%. Even better, it expects to generate $500 million in free cash flow, which can be used to fund the dividend. PXD was actually cash-flow negative last year.""PXD offers investors a defensive-oriented investment,"" says Stifel, which rates the stock at Buy. ""(Its) unmatched depth of low-cost inventory and balance sheet allow it to compete favorably in both mild and moderate recovery case scenarios.""Stifel adds that PXD has the best debt profile of its all its competitors operating in Texas's Permian Basin. ""Successful cost management and execution in 2019 lay the foundation for a strong 2020.""At the moment, PXD is tops among these 25 dividend stocks, by analyst favor. Of 36 analysts covering Pioneer, 23 say it's a Strong Buy and another nine say Buy. That's versus just three Holds and one Strong Sell.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@25 Dividend Stocks the Analysts Love the Most@2020-03-20@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/25-dividend-stocks-the-analysts-love-the-most-2020-03-20

"The  formula at  ranks a coverage universe of thousands of dividend stocks, according to a proprietary formula designed to identify those stocks that combine two important characteristics — strong fundamentals and a valuation that looks inexpensive.  Microchip Technology Inc (Symbol: MCHP) presently has an above average rank, in the top 50% of the coverage universe, which suggests it is among the top most ""interesting"" ideas that merit further research by investors.


But making Microchip Technology Inc an even more interesting and timely stock to look at, is the fact that in trading on Thursday, shares of MCHP entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $90.23 per share.  We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100.  A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.  

In the case of Microchip Technology Inc, the RSI reading has hit 28.3 — by comparison, the universe of dividend stocks covered by  currently has an average RSI of 30.4.  A falling stock price — all else being equal — creates a better opportunity for dividend investors to capture a higher yield.  Indeed, MCHP's recent annualized dividend of 1.468/share (currently paid in quarterly installments) works out to an annual yield of 1.55% based upon the recent $94.77 share price.


A bullish investor could look at MCHP's 28.3 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.  Among the fundamental datapoints dividend investors should investigate to decide if they are bullish on MCHP is its dividend history.  

In general, dividends are not always predictable; but, looking at the history chart below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue.

"Investors in Microchip Technology Inc (Symbol: MCHP) saw new options become available this week, for the October 16th expiration.  One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 232 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the MCHP options chain for the new October 16th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $90.00 strike price has a current bid of $10.20.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $90.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $79.80 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of MCHP, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $91.00/share today.

Because the $90.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 57%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 11.33% return on the cash commitment, or 17.83% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.


Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Microchip Technology Inc, and highlighting in green where the $90.00 strike is located relative to that history:


   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $92.50 strike price has a current bid of $10.10.  If an investor was to purchase shares of MCHP stock at the current price level of $91.00/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $92.50.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 12.75% if the stock gets called away at the October 16th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if MCHP shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Microchip Technology Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing MCHP's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $92.50 strike highlighted in red:



   
Considering the fact that the $92.50 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 48%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 11.10% boost of extra return to the investor, or 17.46% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.


The implied volatility in the put contract example is 40%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 38%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $91.00) to be 34%.

And LockheedaEURtms still going at a strong rate of nearly 10% annually over the past half a decade, which is the rate you need for a .Better still, as I recently discussed, this stock checks off .My only concern right now is valuation. You can clearly see that LMT is starting to aEURoego vertical,aEUR and stocks typically need to digest these kind of moves.

But the current year looks like a aEURoeresetaEUR; analysts are projecting a top-line contraction before rebounding in the upcoming fiscal year.Profits, on the other hand, are quite turbulent from year-to-year:This Chart Might Cause Motion SicknessNow MCHP has extremely conservative management that, while improving the payout every quarter, does so by microscopic slivers. Its last payout hike took the dividend from 36.65 cents per share to 36.70 cents. In other words, a mere 20th of a penny.Dividend Growth, Just BarelyBrown & Brown (BRO)Dividend Yield: 0.7%Dividend Growth Streak: 19 yearsBrown & Brown (BRO) is the sixth largest independent insurance brokerage in the nation, providing everything from property & casualty and general liability to workersaEURtm comp and employee benefits. It has a National Programs division that includes things like specialty programs (flood and earthquake insurance), professional liability products and public entity programs for the likes of cities, school boards and special taxing districts.Between organic growth and Brown & BrownaEURtms seemingly unquenchable thirst for new blood, the insurer has logged uninterrupted revenue growth for a decade (including a 19% pop last year) and net income that has been pointed in the right direction for most of that time. That has fueled a generous dividend program that has grown by an average of 9.1% annually over the past five years.BRO Is a Clear Powerhouse Among Its PeersBut, like Lockheed, Brown & Brown the stock may have gotten ahead of itself. A 20% return in just six weeks, and a forward P/E in the high 20s, is a bit much for an insurer.Yours Now: 7 Recession-Proof aEURoeHidden YieldaEUR Stocks for 2020Are you licking your chops thinking about stuffing some of these dividend growers into your portfolio?Good.

Additionally, the use of technical indicators and fundamentals can point the direction of a stock’s near-term trajectory. Another way, though, is to gauge the sentiment amongst fellow investors. As the old saying goes, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.TipRanks’  has a set of filters which allows you to search out a stock according to your needs, be it by market cap, analyst consensus or various other metrics. In our case, we searched for three tickers boasting “very positive” sentiment from top TipRanks investors – a readout of individual investor portfolios tracked by TipRanks on its .What’s more, in addition to piquing investors’ interest, all 3 have a further characteristic in common; all currently score a Strong Buy consensus rating from the Street. Let’s explore, then, why investors and analysts alike, are finding these names so compelling right now.With a market-cap of $38 billion, Centene has established itself as a major player in healthcare services. The large cap has more than 33,000 employees across the country, has health plans that serve 12.3 million members in 29 states and offers health insurance to other healthcare and commercial organizations. With roughly 22 million members, Centene is the largest provider of government-sponsored health plans.The company’s recent earnings results were a mixed affair. Centene’s Q4 revenue came in at $18.9 billion, 14% up from last year’s $16.6 billion, while also beating the analysts' estimate of $18.43 billion. The company’s higher-than-expected medical benefit ratio (the percentage of health insurance premiums paid out in claims), though, was a disappointment for investors. At 88.4%, the figure came in higher than the Street’s estimate of 87.6% and impacted the company’s medical costs.Nevertheless, J.P. Morgan’s  believes CNC trades at a discount to its group. Multiple overhangs including the election, block grant and public charge, according to the analyst, “will all likely prove immaterial.” Taylor also believes Centene’s acquisition of WellCare for $17 billion in March of last year will lead to further long -term value creation.The 4-star analyst further said, “We believe that CNC remains a long-term growth story as managed care penetration of Medicaid grows from ~68% of spending towards 75-80% over the next decade. We believe CNC’s organic opportunity (primarily fueled by its Medicaid and Medicare exposure) certainly remains above-average for the sector.”Bottom line, then? Taylor reboots his rating on Centene with an Overweight along with a price target of $88. Should the target be met, investors stand to take home a 33% gain over the next year. (To watch Taylor’s track record, )Overall, the healthcare service specialist is getting a lot of healthy love from the Street right now. 13 Buys and a single Hold converge to a Strong Buy consensus rating. At $80.54, the average target implies possible upside of 24%.CNC has a ‘Very Positive’ investor sentiment with the number of portfolios holding CNC rising on both a 1 week and 1-month basis. ()Next up is a fellow large cap, though from an entirely different sector. Semi-conductor company Applied Materials makes integrated circuit chips for a wide range of electronics, including TVs, smartphones and flat panel display screens. The $61 billion heavyweight’s robust start to 2020 is a direct continuation of 2019’s stellar performance; last year’s gains of 90% have been boosted by a further 9% year-to-date.As per expectations, AMAT’s latest earnings results delivered a strong quarter and guidance. F1Q20’s revenue of $4.16 billion indicated a quarter-over-quarter increase of 11% and beat the Street’s estimate of $4.11 billionAt $0.98, EPS came in above the high end of the company's $0.87-0.95 guidance and above the Street’s call for $0.93. Looking ahead, galvanized by a continued robust foundry/logic business and the return of some memory spending, AMAT expects to see ""strong double-digit"" growth in its semiconductor business this year.Deutsche bank’s  applauded the print and notes the guide would have been even stronger without the estimated $300 million impact of the coronavirus on its operations. Ho said, “AMAT continues to benefit from a robust foundry/logic environment and with this strength expected to continue throughout CY20, early signs of a memory recovery, and expectations for continued share gains, the company appears well positioned for a strong CY20… Post earnings, we remain encouraged by AMAT's near and long-term outlook and believe that the risk-reward for AMAT, which trades at ~12x (including pending acquisition) vs. its large cap peers at 1415x, is favorable.”The 5-star analyst, therefore, keeps his Buy rating intact, while raising his price target up from the previous $72 to $75. The new figure implies possible upside of 15% from current levels. (To watch Ho’s track record, )It turns out that the rest of the Street wholeheartedly agrees with the Deutsche bank analyst. With 19 ""buy"" ratings vs. 1 ""sell"" and 1 ""hols,"" the message is clear: AMAT is a Strong Buy. Possible gains of 17% could be heading investors’ way should the average price target of $75.71 be met over the coming months.In addition, based on top investor portfolios in TipRanks’ database, 6.9% hold AMAT stock. On average, top investors allocate 3.7% of their portfolios to AMAT. This gives the stock its ‘Very Positive’ investor sentiment score. ()Staying in the semi-conductor field, we come across another big player in the shape of Microchip. This company does what it says on the tin: Sells microcontrollers, analog, and field-programmable gate array [FPGA] chips to a wide array of customers.With earnings season in full swing, Microchip has been posting results, too. The solid quarter exhibited a beat on revenue and earnings: MCHP reported sales of $1.29 billion, compared to the $1.26 billion estimated by the street. NonGAAP EPS came in at $1.32, above the street’s estimate of $1.26. For the current quarter, MCHP expects revenue of $1.36 billion, guiding above the street’s call for $1.33 billion.Needham’s  sees “multiple inflection points in MCHP's business.” The 5-star analyst notes the company has seen a continuation of strong backlog and bookings trends. Additionally, Gill notes MCHP’s ongoing strength in data center and industrial and auto, all recovering from a bottom, with the trends expected to continue in 2HCY20.Gill summarized, “We could envision an optimistic scenario where we see an inventory restocking, given the historical low levels of distribution inventory, combined with genuine demand pull through driven by data center, ADAS, industrial IoT and 5G. While lead times may extend, we do think MCHP has built enough capacity to support a return in demand. In that environment, we believe revenue could return to pre-downturn levels and grow from there. Moreover, we believe MCHP is on track to hit its LT GM target of 63% (vs. 61.7% MRQ) as the $16MM underutilization charges roll-off the P&L. Net, we see upside at current levels as we roll out our new FY22 Non-GAAP estimates.""As a result Gill reiterated a Buy rating on MCHP shares, while raising his price target to $140 (from $130). The implication for investors? Potential upside movement of 30%. (To watch Gill’s track record, )The consensus breakdown provides further cheer; 15 Buys and 2 Holds coalesce to a Strong Buy consensus rating. With an average price target of $123.13, analysts expect an additional 15% to be added to the share price over the next year.Furthermore, 2.4% of all portfolios hold MCHP, with 0.2% being added in the last month alone. Top investors allocate, on average, 1.7% of their portfolio to the chipmaker’s stock.

After a relatively soft performance in 2018, semiconductor companies delivered significantly better results in 2019 and might be poised to extend that uptrend into 2020, especially semiconductor dividend stocks with above-average yields.In addition to the normal expansion of the recent demand for additional computing power driven by cloud computing, business automation and autonomous transportation, semiconductor dividend stocks could get another boost from the wider implementation of 5G networks.This new generation of mobile communication technology should deliver data transmission rates 10 to 100 times faster than the current 4G networks. The exponential increase in data transmission speeds should offer significant improvements in delivering voice, gaming and video streaming services. More importantly, in addition to improving the existing streaming services, the faster data transfer rates and reduced latency of the new 5G networks should also reduce some of the still existing barriers to a wider penetration of the Internet of Things (IoT).With 5G, some of the new technologies that have been delayed by the old network’s data flow bottlenecks, such as autonomous cars, “smart” homes, instant medical diagnostics, etc., could be unleashed to deliver significant advances, as well as become less costly, which will further drive wider implementation.While investors have hundreds of semiconductor stocks from which to choose, the stocks listed below meet several specific criteria to ensure best chances for long-term returns. With the smallest market capitalization of more than $21 billion, the five semiconductor dividend stocks below qualify as large-cap stocks. The largest market capitalization exceeds $263 billion for an average of nearly $110 billion.In the technology sector known traditionally for lower-than-average dividend yields, all five stocks below exceed the sectors current 1.11% simple average yield. Additionally, three of the five companies also outperformed the 1.63% yield average of the semiconductor industry sub-segment. The yields range from 1.34% on the low end to the 4.15% on the top of the range for a simple average yield of 2.32% for all five companies.In addition to offering large capitalizations and above-average yields, all five stocks listed below offer positive returns over the past 12 months in a sector where one third of stocks delivered losses over the past year.Sorted in ascending order by their current dividend yield, below are the five semiconductor dividend stocks you should consider for your portfolio in 2020. Headquartered in Chandler, Arizona, and founded in 1989, Microchip Technology develops, manufactures and sells semiconductor products for various embedded control applications in the American, European and Asian markets. After beginning dividend distributions in 2002, the company advanced its annual payouts rapidly. Growing at an average rate of nearly 60% per year, the annual dividend had grown 17-fold by 2008.In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, the dividend payout continued to rise, albeit at significantly lower average rate of approximately 1% per year. However, the overall average growth year since the initial dividend distribution is nearly 19% per year. The most recent $0.367 payout in the fourth quarter of 2019 corresponds to a $1.468 annualized distribution and 1.34% forward dividend yield which is still 21% higher than the 1.11% yield average of the overall technology sector.Driven by the overall market correction in late 2018, the share price dropped 40% in the year’s last quarter, which erased two years of capital gains. However, the share price reversed trend and advanced at twice the pace of that decline to recover all those losses by December 2019. The share price breached the previous high from mid-2018 and began 2020 in all-time high  territory. The Jan. 22 closing price of $109.34 was only 1.7% below the most recent all-time high of $111.21 just 10 days earlier. The rising dividend income pushed the 45%-plus asset appreciation to a total gain of 47.4% over the trailing 12-month period. The company also delivered a 70% total gain over the last three years. Furthermore, the shareholders more than doubled their investment with a total return of more than 150% over the past five years. Headquartered in Irvine, California, and founded in 1962, Skyworks Solutions develops and manufactures semiconductor products, including amplifiers, antenna tuners, receivers and wireless radio integrated circuits. After peaking in March 2018, the share price lost half its value by the end of that year. After bottoming out in late-218, the share price assumed a slow general uptrend with some volatility. After taking nearly a full year to recover, the share price surged ahead in late-2019 and advanced to its new all-time high of $124.90 on Jan. 22. This closing price marked an 83% gain above the 52-week low from one year earlier.Skyworks Solutions did not start paying dividends until 2014. However, since introducing the income payouts, the company has boosted its annual dividend distribution every year. Over the past five years, the annual dividend payout advanced nearly four-fold, which corresponds ton average growth rate of more than 30% per year. The most recent hike for the December round of payouts increased the quarterly amount nearly 16% to $0.44 per share. This quarterly distribution converts to a $1.76 annualized payout and yields 1.41%. The 2018 share price decline limited total returns over the past three and five years to 44% and 68%, respectively. However, the timing of the 52-week low and the subsequent share price resurgence delivered a total return of nearly 80% over the past 12 months. Based in Santa Clara, California, and founded in 1968, the Intel Corporation (INTC) designs and manufactures microprocessors and chipsets that send data between the microprocessor and various peripherals and accessories, as well as computer, networking and communications platforms. Despite a slight increase in volatility that included two minor declines over the last year, Intel’s stock advanced more than 25% over the trailing 12-month period.Intel has been distributing dividend income payments to shareholders since 1992. Over the past two decades, the company failed to hike its annual dividend only three times. Despite these three misses, the total annual payout amount rose 21-fold over the past 20 years, which is equivalent to and average annual dividend growth rate of 16.4%. The current $0.315 quarterly payout and its $1.26 annual equivalent correspond to a 2% forward dividend yield.This dividend yield combined with the capital gains to deliver a 28% total return over the past year. The total returns have been 73% and 81% over the past three and five years, respectively. Headquartered in San Diego and founded in 1985, Qualcomm Incorporated designs, develops, manufactures, and markets digital communication products worldwide.Qualcomm’s current $0.62 quarterly dividend distribution corresponds to a $2.48 annualized payout amount that yields 2.7%. This current yield is more than twice the 1.11% simple yield average of the overall technology sector and 63% higher than the 1.63% yield average of the semiconductors industry segment. Since beginning dividend payouts in 2003, Qualcomm has enhanced its annual dividend amount more than 20-fold through the end of 2019, which corresponds to a 19.5% average annual growth rate over the past 17 years.After losing nearly a third of its value in the last quarter of 2018, Qualcomm’s share price reversed direction in January 2019. After recovering all late-2018 losses by mid-year, the share price continued to rise. The new all-time high of $95.91 in January 2020 was nearly twice the 52-week low from late-January one year earlier. The total one-year asset appreciation of more than 71% combined with dividend income payouts for a total one-year return of 76%. Based in San Jose and founded in 2005 as Avago Technologies, Broadcom, Inc. designs, develops and produces a range of semiconductor devices with a focus on digital and mixed signal semiconductor based devices worldwide through four business segments — Wired Infrastructure, Wireless Communications, Enterprise Storage and Industrial & Other.The company’s most recent dividend hike for the December 2019 distribution boosted the quarterly payout from $2.65 in the previous period to the current $3.25 distribution amount. This new payout a $13.00 annualized dividend and a 4.15% forward dividend yield. Broadcom enhanced its annual payout mount more than eight-fold over the past five years, which corresponds to an average dividend growth rate of more than 50% per year.After a minor cooling off period in 2018, the share resumed its recent uptrend trajectory and gained more than 20% over the trailing 12 months. This asset appreciation and the high-yield dividend combined to reward the company’s shareholders with 25.5% total one-year returns. The share price pullback in 2018 limited the three-year returns to 74%. However, the company managed to deliver total returns of nearly 220% over the past five years. Dividend increases and dividend decreases, new dividend announcements, dividend suspensions and other dividend changes occur daily.

[EditorÃ¢ÂÂs note: Ã¢ÂÂ5 Tech Dividend Stocks to Buy That ArenÃ¢ÂÂt MicrosoftÃ¢ÂÂ was previously published in September 2019. It has since been updated to include the most relevant information available.]The best place to find  could the tech sector. Need an example? Just take a look at  (NASDAQ:) recent wins on the shareholder rewards front. Last year Microsoft announced that it plans on increasing its payout by 11% and is conducting a whopping $40 billion buyback program.When you add this huge increase to its payout, Microsoft quickly becomes one of the best dividend stocks ever. In fact, MSFT raises its quarterly dividend every year since it began paying one in 2004. And MSFT isnÃ¢ÂÂt alone when it comes to tech-sector dividend stocks.Like Mr. Softy, there are countless others that have become cash flow and profit machines. With service revenues driving the show, margins in the sector have never been higher. This has only filled tech stocks coffers to the brim.With so much cash now overflowing their balance sheets, they canÃ¢ÂÂt help but return it. In turn, the sector has become fertile ground for finding dividend stocks. And while initial  or consumer staples names, the sector canÃ¢ÂÂt be beaten when it comes to dividend growth. MSFTÃ¢ÂÂs big quarterly jump is a testament to that.Which tech stocks are rewarding their shareholders just like Microsoft? Here are five dividend stocks to consider in the sector.   You may not realize it, but your coffee pot and the most complex supercomputer have something in common with each other. They both are able to operate courtesy of semiconductors.Given that the modern world runs on this important backbone, the semiconductor sector has long been a great place to comb for tech dividend stocks. And one of the best and earliest payers in the sector could be  (NASDAQ:).MCHP produces what are known as analog and microcontroller semiconductors. Truth be told, thereÃ¢ÂÂs nothing too special about analog chips, but modern society wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt function if it wasnÃ¢ÂÂt for these boring chips. Boring is beautiful when it comes to dividends and cash flows.As the world continues to modernize and lean on technology, demand for analog chips of all kinds have grown. That has benefited MicrochipÃ¢ÂÂs bottom line in a big way. Year-over-year sales clocked in 9.1% higher last quarter and over the longer term, MCHP has . ThatÃ¢ÂÂs pretty much unheard of in the semiconductor sector which tends to have wild swings in profits and losses.That sort of consistency has made MCHP a dividend stalwart among tech stocks. Since its initial payout in 2002, Microchip has managed to More could be in store for investors as well. Thanks to some smart acquisitions, MCHP has started to pivot into more advanced semiconductors. Chips like automotive power units, battery and green technologies and networking semis all come with bigger margins. These could help boost its 1.62% yield much further.   Thanks to the rise of smartphones, (NASDAQ:, NASDAQ:) Google Maps and other GPS applications, GRMNÃ¢ÂÂs perceived main bread-and-butter in automotive navigation was dying a quick death. However, the reality is that GRMN is much more than a GPS.The firm makes a host of marine and aviation GPS navigation equipment that is the standard for many end-users. This includes consumers and industrial applications. Meanwhile, its line of wearable devices has also become one of the standard brands for serious athletes and runners.The truth is, Garmin continues to succeed in these other markets. With revenues jumping 7% overall and aviation, marine, fitness and outdoor sales growing by 12% last quarter, management at GRMN have been able to raise its .The best part is that profits at Garmin continue to jump as these divisions come with higher profit margins. A recent pivot to include more services and reoccurring revenues hasnÃ¢ÂÂt hurt either.This has allowed Garmin to generate plenty of free cash flows. After holding onto that extra cash for a bit in order to reinvest and overcome its auto woes, GRMN is back on the . It never actually cut its payout, it just held it steady for a bit.

And thanks to the birth of cloud computing, OTEXÃ¢ÂÂs services continue to be in hot demand.The firm counts more than 74,000 customers Ã¢ÂÂ both big and small. And those customers continue to drive new revenues into OpenTextÃ¢ÂÂs coffers.

There are 15 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Microchip Technology Inc, but the average is just that — a mathematical average.  There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $89.00.  And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $119.00.  The standard deviation is $7.898.


But the whole reason to look at the average MCHP price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes.  And so with MCHP crossing above that average target price of $108.67/share, investors in MCHP have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $108.67 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?  Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Microchip Technology Inc:

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''.  These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand.  Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).  Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

Image source: The Motley Fool. Q3 2020 , Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Microchip's third-quarter fiscal 2020 financial results conference call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Eric Bjornholt, chief financial officer.Sir, please begin. -- Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions, and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's chairman and CEO; and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's president and COO. I will comment on our third-quarter fiscal year 2020 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results and discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. We are including information in our press release in this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, , has tripled the market.* David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Microchip Technology wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the investor relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing our GAAP and non-GAAP results. We have also posted a summary of our outstanding debt and our leverage metrics on our website. I want to remind investors that during the June quarter of 2018, we adopted the new GAAP revenue recognition standard, which requires revenue to be recognized at the time products are sold to distributors versus our historical revenue recognition policy, where revenue on such transactions were deferred until the product was sold by our distributors to an end customer. As discussed in previous , we continue to track and measure our performance internally based on direct revenue plus distribution sell-through activity.And each quarter, we'll provide a metric for this called end-market demand in our earnings release. Therefore, along with our GAAP and non-GAAP results, based on distribution sell in, we will also provide investors with our end-market demand based on distribution sell out, but will not provide a P&L based on end-market demand. End-market demand in the December 2019 quarter was $1.324 billion, end-market demand was about $36.1 million more than our GAAP revenue in the December 2019 quarter. I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses.I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis, which is based on expenses prior to the effects of our acquisition activities, share-based compensation and certain other adjustments as described in our press release. Net sales in the December quarter were $1.287 billion, which was down 3.76% sequentially and near the high end of our updated revenue guidance provided on January 6, 2020. We have posted a summary of our GAAP net sales and end-market demand by product line and geography on our website for your reference. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 61.5%, operating expenses were 26.4%, and operating income was 35.1% and above the high end of our guidance.Non-GAAP net income was $340.8 million. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $1.32, which was above the high end of our last provided non-GAAP EPS guidance from December 3, 2019 of $1.30. On a GAAP basis, gross margins were 61% and include the impact of $5.7 million of share-based compensation expense. Total operating expenses were $654.3 million and include acquisition intangible amortization of $248.7 million, special charges of $17.8 million, $10.9 million of acquisition related and other costs and share-based compensation of $37.8 million.The GAAP net income was $311.1 million or $1.20 per diluted share. Our December quarter of GAAP tax benefit was significantly positively impacted by the tax benefit related to the intra-group transfer of certain intellectual property rights. The non-GAAP cash tax rate was 6% in the December quarter. We expect our non-GAAP cash tax rate for fiscal '20 to be about 6%, exclusive of any transition tax, any potential tax associated with the restructuring of the Microsemi operations and the Microchip's global structure and any tax audit settlements related to taxes accrued in prior fiscal years.We have many tax attributes and net operating losses and tax credits as well as U.S. interest deductions that we believe will keep our cash tax payments low. The future cash tax payments associated with the transition tax is expected to be about $245 million and will be paid over the next six years. We have posted a schedule of our projected transition tax payments on the investor relations page of our website.Our inventory balance at December 31, 2019, was $708.8 million. We had 129 days of inventory at the end of the December quarter, down two days from the prior quarter's level. Inventory at our distributors in the December quarter were at 28 days compared to 30 days at the end of September. We've only had one quarter in the past 15 years, which was Q3 of fiscal year 2013, where our days of inventory at distribution have been at lower than the current levels.The cash flow from operating activities was $395.5 million in the December quarter. As of December 31, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $402.3 million. We paid down $257 million of total debt in the December quarter, and the net debt on the balance sheet was reduced by $254.2 million. Over the last six full quarters since we closed the Microsemi acquisition and incurred over $8 billion in debt to do so, we have paid down $1.986 billion of the debt and continue to allocate substantially all of our excess cash generation beyond dividends to aggressively bring down this debt.We have accomplished this despite the adverse macro and market conditions during most of this period, which we feel is a testimony to the cash generation capabilities of our business. We expect our debt levels to reduce significantly over the next several years. Our adjusted EBITDA in the December quarter was $503.4 million, and our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was $2.125 billion. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA, excluding our very long-dated convertible debt that matures in 2037 and is more equity like in nature, was 4.58 at December 31, 2019.Our dividend payment in the December quarter was $87.7 million. Capital expenditures were $14.1 million in the December 2019 quarter. We expect between $20 million and $25 million in capital spending in the March quarter, and overall capital expenditures for fiscal 2020 to be between $76 million and $81 million. We continue to add capital to support the growth of our production capabilities for our new products and technologies and to bring in house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced.We expect these capital investments will bring some gross margin improvement to our business, particularly for the outsourced Atmel and Microsemi manufacturing activities that we are bringing into our own factories. Depreciation expense in the December quarter was $41.4 million. I will now turn it over to Ganesh to give us comments on the performance of the business in the December quarter. Ganesh?  -- Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I get started, I'd like to remind you that the product line comparisons I will be sharing with you today are based on end-market demand, which is how Microchip measures its performance internally. Let's start by taking a closer look at microcontrollers. Our microcontroller business was sequentially down 1.1% as compared to the September quarter.We continue to introduce a steady stream of innovative new microcontrollers, including next-generation Bluetooth 5.0 dual-mode audio solutions, production-ready open source tools for managing our Adaptec Smart Storage offerings and industry support for development of the Open Compute Project's Accelerator Infrastructure through our PCIe switches. Microcontrollers represented 53.6% of our end-market demand in the December quarter. Moving to analog. Our analog business was sequentially down 3.6% as compared to the September quarter.During the quarter, we continued to introduce a steady stream of innovative analog products, including the IEEE 802.3bt-compliant power over Ethernet injectors and midspans that enable up to 90 watts of power without changing switches or cable. Analog represented 28.1% of our end-market demand in the December quarter. Our FPGA business was sequentially flat as compared to the September quarter. During the quarter, we introduced a radiation-tolerant Polarfire FPGA for space and other high-reliability applications as well as the early access program for the Polarfire system-on-chip FPGA, offering the world's first hardened real-time Linux-capable, risk-five based microprocessor subsystem.Design wins for the Polarfire family continued to grow strongly, and we remain optimistic about the prospects for this product family. FPGA represented 6.9% for end-market demand in the December quarter. Our licensing, memory and other product line, which we refer to as LMO, was sequentially down 0.7% as compared to the September quarter. During the quarter, we enable -- we delivered a new family of electrically erasable RAM products, providing cost-effective alternatives to nonvolatile RAM solutions and a number of memory densities.LMO represented 11.3% of our end-market demand in the December quarter. An update regarding coronavirus and what we're seeing. First, all our employees are safe, and that remains our highest priority. We implemented travel bans in and out of China, Hong Kong and Taiwan two weeks ago.We also implemented self-quarantine requirements for anyone who may have traveled to these countries, mandatory medical assessment and clearance for anyone who may have symptoms, a screening questionnaire for all external visitors to any Microchip facility and common-sense preventive sanitizing steps on a continuous basis in all our facilities worldwide. As you well know, most provinces in China have extended the Chinese New Year holidays to February 9, Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, has extended the holidays to February 13. Our manufacturing footprint in China is small, and we expect little impact to our operations from this extension. Also at this time, we do not anticipate any significant supply chain issues for materials sourced from China.Some of our customers could be affected by the extended Chinese New Year holidays. It is too early to determine what impact there may be as most are not yet back from the extended holidays. Because Chinese New Year this year was early in the quarter, there is more time for our customers to catch up lost production within the quarter. We also believe there is slack in manufacturing capacity, which can be of help while recovering lost production.These outbreaks are unpredictable, and there may yet be other twists and turns to come in the days ahead. We continue to process the news daily as well as monitor information from the center for disease control and the World Health Organization. We will adapt our response as needed and focus on the things that we can control. Finally, over the last few months, we started to share six megatrends that we believe provide significant growth opportunities for Microchip over the next five to 10 years, and I'd like to summarize them.First, the 5G infrastructure rollout, which is just getting started and has a decade ahead of it. Each prior generation of wireless infrastructure deployment, 2G, 3G and 4G, lasted for about 10 years. The Internet of Things comprised of smart, connected and secured end nodes is picking up steam, especially for industrial IOT, when there are compelling business models for customers to make money, save money and mitigate risk. Third, for data centers.The data center demand, the store and process data is exploding as data is created at a hyper-exponential rate. To put this in perspective, estimates are that 90% of the world's data was created in just the last two years, and that trend continues unabated. Fourth, electric and hybrid vehicles are writing a wave of consumer and regulatory forces, which are driving substantial investment in technology and capacity. Fifth is the Advanced Driver Assist, which is already a growth application and its proliferation to more car models and its natural progression to increasing levels of autonomous driving.Sixth is finally the artificial intelligence and machine learning, which we see as another explosive growth area, not only in the cloud, but even more so at the edge. These megatrends cut across the diverse end markets we serve and guide our product development priorities. We believe these megatrends, in conjunction with our total system solutions go-to-market approach, will provide key opportunities for organic growth in the coming years. With that, let me pass it to Steve for some comments about our business and our guidance going forward.Steve? -- Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to first reflect on the results of the fiscal third quarter of 2020, I will then provide guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2020. Our December quarter was an interesting one in which we revised the midpoint of our guidance upwards twice. Once on December 3, 2019, prior to the Credit Suisse conference and second on January 6, 2020, prior to JPMorgan conference.Our final December quarter GAAP net sales were on the high end of our latest guidance and came in at $1.287 billion, down 3.76% sequentially. Our end-market demand based on sell through was $36 million higher than GAAP sales, which we believe shows that the channel was continuing to manage their working capital conservatively by reducing inventory due to uncertainty. December was the seventh consecutive quarter where our sell-through revenue was higher than our sell-in revenue. Our consolidated non-GAAP gross margin of 61.5% was just above the high end of our guidance.Our consolidated non-GAAP operating margin of 35.1% was also just above the high end of our guidance. Our consolidated non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.32, which was also above the high end of our revised guidance. So overall, December quarter turned out to be a lot better than originally guided. On non-GAAP basis, this was also our 117th consecutive profitable quarter.In the December quarter, we paid down $257 million of our debt. Our total debt payment since the end of June 2018 has been about $2 billion. The pace of debt payments has been strong despite the weakened uncertain business conditions, underlining the strong cash-generation characteristics of our business as well as our active efforts to continue to squeeze working capital efficiencies. Now before I provide you guidance for the March quarter, let me comment on some of the inflection points that we saw during the December quarter.Our December quarter bookings were up double-digit percentage over the September quarter bookings that resulted in our starting backlog for March quarter to be up double-digit percentage over the starting backlog for the December quarter. Our starting backlog was up in each of the geographies of North America, Europe and Asia. From an end-market perspective, we saw strength in data centers and start of a recovery in industrial and automotive. Continuing on the inflection points, the book-to-bill ratio for December quarter was well above one after multiple quarters of book-to-bill being below one.Our distributor inventory at the end of September was already at a low level and lowest in 15 years, except one quarter in fiscal year '13. In December quarter, the distribution inventory went even lower. During December quarter, we saw increased level of customer-requested pull ins, many of its required factory expedite. Seeing these multiple signs of inflection point, we call the December quarter to be a bottom for Microchip for this cycle, barring any negative developments on the U.S.-China trade front or the impact of coronavirus.Now I turn to guidance for March quarter. The backlog from March quarter that started out quite strong continue to fill in during the month of January. Taking all these factors into consideration and after rolling up revenue expectations from sales regions as well as business units, we expect GAAP net sales, based on sell-in revenue recognition for our products, to be up between 2% to 9% sequentially in the March 2020 quarter. The midpoint of our guidance for the March 2020 quarter reflects what we believe our business can deliver, assuming no extraordinary events.However, the wider-than-normal guidance range is to help account for the uncertainty associated with the evolving coronavirus situation. We are still in the early days of how this situation is playing out. We have no way to model how the rest of the quarter will play out for the coronavirus situation, and what the consequent business impact may be. But we believe that our guidance range incorporates our best judgment for the possible scenarios.Regarding capex, we expect to finish fiscal year 2020 with a capex of between $76 million and $81 million, a significant reduction from fiscal year '19 capex of $229 million. This is consistent with what we have said before that our capex is divided between growth capital, maintenance capital and new products and technology capital in a fiscal year, like 2020, in which our net sales declined, the growth capital, which is the largest portion of the capex, declines to virtually nothing. And therefore, the total capex declined significantly. For December quarter, it should be for March quarter.For March quarter, we expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 61.5% and 61.9% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 25% and 26.2% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating profit percentage to be between 35.3% and 36.9% of sales, and we expect our non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $1.35 per share to $1.51 per share. Given all the complications of accounting for our acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory write up on acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its reserves on a non-GAAP basis, except for net sales, which will be on a GAAP basis.We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters, and we request that the analysts continue to report their non-GAAP estimates to first call. With this, operator, will you please poll for questions?[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. -- Thank you. Steve, just a question on the expedite activity. Can you just maybe put that into context with currently kind of where your lead times are and things you're looking to do to maybe kind of address that as business improves? -- So during this down cycle, we built a substantial amount of inventory that is held in the die bank. So when an order comes in, it's really taking the die from the die bank and processing it through, which can be anywhere to as low as three weeks to as much as six, seven weeks, depending on where it has to go inside or outside or what difficult package or assembly test it might be. What we are finding is that customers stationed a fair amount of backlog just outside the quarter. And then when they need the product, they expedite into the quarter.This way, they kind of have both choices. They could not take it in the quarter and leave it out or push it out further. Or if they need it, ask us to pull it in. We've been seeing this strange phenomenon now, not only this quarter, we've been seeing it for some time, but it really became even more accentuated.So there's a fair amount of backlog sitting outside the quarter in April, and customers are expediting it into the quarter. Does that answer your question? -- Yes. Thank you.Our next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. -- Thank you for taking my question. Steve, I'm curious, what are you expecting your distributors to do in the March quarter? I think you're giving a net sales outlook. So any color on sell-in and sell-out trends would be helpful. And in general, what are they saying to you? Why are they taking down Microchip inventory to such low levels because it's such an outlier, and we don't hear of any of your other peers, their inventory is being taken down to similarly low levels. -- Well, I don't really know if as we speak, distributors are taking down inventory further, but they have in the last seven quarters or so through December. We don't really have a guidance for the March quarter on sell through. We can't really provide both ends of the guidance. It's just too much work.So we're providing the sell-in guidance that we have given you. And in the December quarter, when we provided the guidance, we expected that distributors will reverse the trend and will start to build some inventory toward normalization. It did not happen in December. We're expecting it would happen again in March, but there's no guarantee.Distributors will do what they will do. I think part of the reason is, for 30 years, a culture at Microchip, in our business unit, sales organization up and down to the change with the distribution. Our conversations with the distributors are winning designs, creating a large funnel and pulling those designs to production and creating sales well. That's how we pay our salespeople, that's how we pay our business units, that's how all the bonuses are structured.And we don't really have a whole lot of conversations regarding what we give into the distribution. That has always been less important to us because we manage our business based on sell-through. So distributors take the inventory what they want to run their business and based on getting returns for their business. In contrast, I think we see many of our peers and competitors are more focused on sell-in revenue recognition, where they may make deals to put more product into distribution and arresting the fall of the inventory that way. -- I would add one more thing. We've always had low lead times on our products. And I think that gives distributors an opportunity to run the inventory to whatever the lowest level they think they can get away with, while continuing to focus on sell through. So short lead times give them the opportunity to carry less inventory as well. -- I would also add that sometime we charge expedite charges for expediting the product. So sometime expedite charges require us to spend weekends, pay overtime or pay expedites for shipping, going through hand-carry products and all sorts of charging can incur. And we often pass those to the customers. It doesn't move the needle in terms of revenue.But if somebody wants to expedite the parts, it's not always free. -- But you're not assuming any restocking benefit, any major restocking benefit in March. -- We have no way to model it. -- OK. Thank you.Our next question comes from Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo. -- Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. I want to ask about your relative performance in the microcontroller segment. It looks like for the full calendar year 2019, you outperformed the microcontroller market in terms of sales growth.If you believe in the SIA sales metrics. But in the second half of the year, it looks like -- in particular, in the fourth calendar quarter, it looks like you might have underperformed the market. To what should we attribute that to? This is just sort of a short-term disruption or anything to look into their long term? -- I'm not sure what data is that you are referring to. So we were sequentially down 1.1% on microcontrollers, September to December. If you look at the year-over-year numbers, on microcontrollers, we're down about 5%, 5.5%, somewhere in that neighborhood. The story is not written.We don't see any annualized numbers that are out yet, maybe SIA has some early numbers. We'll get that by March, April, and we'll, at the next conference call, have the typical Gartner 2019 numbers. There's nothing in our business that has any indication that something was better in the first half and got worse in the second half. -- I think if you look at the third-quarter results sequentially and compared it to a very large competitor, I think we substantially outgrew them. So... -- Either on quarter or by year over year. -- Yes. -- Thank you.Our next question comes from Chris Caso with Raymond James. -- Yes. Thank you. Good evening. A question with regard to gross margins, and assuming we are -- have started recovery, we'd hope to see some gross margin improvement as a result.Perhaps you could answer it in terms of production utilization levels with some of the better order rates, has that caused you to change any production levels? And then from a cost standpoint, as we go forward, I think you still have some integration benefits still to come. Could you help to quantify those, and when they kick in and how it helps leverage, if indeed we're in a recovery? -- Sure. This is Eric. So in the December quarter, we incurred about a $16 million factory underutilization charge that was reflected in our cost of sales. That was up about $7 million quarter on quarter.We expect that charge to be lower in the March quarter, particularly in our back-end assembly and test operation, we're running the factories higher. Steve talked about in an earlier response that our die bank is pretty healthy. But back-end operations, we've been training, finished goods and looking to run the factories harder this quarter, which should help on the gross margin and the guidance that we're giving. So that's a piece of it.We continue to run our factories as efficiently as we can. We're continuing to invest to bring some of the outsourced assembly and test in house at a moderate rate, and all those things are going to benefit gross margin long term and lead us to our long-term guidance, which is to get to about 63% non-GAAP gross margins as a long-term model versus the 61.7% we're guiding to at the midpoint of guidance for the current quarter. -- All right. Thank you.Our next question will come from William Stein with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. -- Similar topic, only not just gross on operating as well. Maybe, Eric, you can take a step back and frame up relative to where you are now? And contemplating your longer-term goals, what's the path to getting there? Is it just a modest amount of revenue recovery is mix part of the equation, is there still restructuring for Microsemi? I know you're still bringing capacity in house. It seems to us that it seems fairly likely that you'll be able to exceed these long-term targets, given the revenue level that you're achieving today relative to what the next peak could be, for example. -- OK. Thank you. So I think I've kind of touched on gross margin so far, and we've been told by others that they think that's a conservative forecast, but we're not going to update that model until we get to the target. And on opex, we're guiding the current quarter to be between 25% and 26.2% of sales, and our long-term model is 22.5%.I would say we have been pretty conservative in how we've been managing the business during this current cycle. And with that, we need to make sure that we're making the appropriate investment, whether it's in R&D, support functions, technical sales, outreach to the customers to make sure we drive the long-term health of the business and some of our variable compensation programs too will kick back in as revenue grows. So we have confidence in the long-term model, which is just above 40% operating margins, and we've got ways to go when we're guiding the current quarter at the midpoint of guidance to about 36.1%. So I'd say be patient, we do need revenue growth to get there.But I think we're well positioned with the investments that we've made to drive to higher levels than what we're seeing today.[Operator instructions] Our next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Financial Group. -- Hi. Thanks very much Steve. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more detail on the source of strength in bookings, whether end markets or geos. I believe last earnings call, you had indicated that China was stronger in terms of geos.So any updates on that front would be helpful. Thank you. -- So I think from an end-market perspective, we said that data center has been strong all along, and we are seeing a start of a recovery in the industrial market and the automotive market. The communication market remains weak, and the appliance market remains weak. And aerospace and defense is going to always lumpy and it's hard to call. From a geographical perspective, yes, we saw strength in the China market last quarter, but you would see the weakness in China market this quarter driven by the Lunar New Year.And nobody knows what is going to happen with the coronavirus. So this quarter, you would see stronger U.S. and Europe and weaker China. -- Thank you.Our next question comes from Raji Gill with Needham & Company. -- Yes. Thank you. If we think about the seasonality in the business now that we have some time. How do we think about it coming out of the bottom of the cycle and kind of perhaps entering into mid-cycle recovery, excluding the impact of the coronavirus? I'm just trying to get a sense of the seasonality, acquisitions post the bottom of the cycle. -- I think Raji, seasonality is still hard to measure where all of the acquisitions that we have completed. The events that have happened in the last couple of years, the -- all the trade tension situation, general economic conditions, now the coronavirus. Prior to that, we had a significant inventory correction event on, especially the Microsemi inventory. We really haven't finished enough quarters in a healthy business environment to peg a seasonality.So, I would think it still remains difficult. -- Thank you.Our next question will come from Craig Ellis with B. Riley FBR. -- Yes. Thanks for taking the question. Congratulations on the good execution. I wanted to go back to some of the comments around the performance on debt reduction, which, over the last six quarters at almost $2 billion, is very strong.The question is, perhaps, both to you, Eric, and you, Steve. As you look ahead and given the trajectory you're on, it seems like you could be at a three times net debt-to-EBITDA level and as soon as four quarters or so. So how do you think about deploying the cash to create value for shareholders when you get to that level, would a vast majority of available cash will go to debt pay down? Or would you start looking at other things, and what would the priorities be at that point? Thank you. -- Let me take that, and Eric can add to it. First of all, I don't think I have looked at a model, which will take the leverage down to three times in four quarters. That seems awfully aggressive. Although I don't know what assumption you are making in the revenue growth of the recovery, it will largely depend on that.But basically, yes, we need to bring the debt leverage below three handle, kind of have it somewhere in the high twos. Once we get there, then we'll still be generating somewhere of the order of well over $1 billion of free cash per quarter, and we need to figure out what we do. I mean we haven't been in that situation in quite a long time. You have obvious choices.You could pay down more debt and bring leverage down further. But more preferably, you could increase the dividend. You can start a buyback program. And that all, assuming that there is not a further M&A possibility.We have said before that we think by the time we come up for air, majority of the company is the smaller companies that we would like to buy, probably would have been bought. And there isn't as much more opportunity there, but there could be one more possibly. But secondly, we think that the remaining assets are very expensive. There is a large amount of M&A bid on them already because every small companies really on sale.And we don't really pay that kind of multiple that we have seen paid in the recent deals, Cyprus as well as some of the deals. Those multiples were way, way too high for our tests. So if we cannot find a reasonable other acquisition, then our focus will switch to other uses of cash, including higher dividend, more stock buyback and possibly some more debt pay down. -- I think what I am going to add to that is just kind of a short-term view here is because I know we will get this question a lot is what do we expect for that pay down in the current quarter, the March quarter. And really, we expect that to be somewhere between $225 million and $250 million. Last quarter, it was $257 million. But our starting accounts receivable balance is lower just because revenue was down last quarter.So really to get some tailwinds behind us. From a revenue perspective, as the top line grows, I think EBITDA will start growing nicely. And that is going to help with the leverage metrics coming down, but it kind of depends on what the environment is going to be over the course of the next year if we were able to get to that three times number that you mentioned. I think we need some pretty good revenue growth. -- Thanks guys.[Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Chris Danely with Citi. -- Thanks. Steve, you mentioned that some customers were expediting orders out of the June quarter into this quarter. So do you think that the June quarter could be at risk of a little bit of a disappointment, like we're routing from the June quarter to pay the March quarter? And then further to that, you talked a little bit about lead times. Do you think that there is risk of extended lead times if this expediting continues? -- The lead times are not at-risk short term because we have a fair amount of die inventory, and there's a fair amount of capacity slack in the system since the revenues are down year over year. The backlog bottomed out some time ago, and the total extended backlog is really growing nicely. So when people are taking backlog from June quarter moving into March quarter, that's not putting June quarter at risk. There is a higher and higher backlog.The overall backlog is growing. Book-to-bill was strongly positive. So it put a very large amount of total backlog in the system. -- Chris, we had expedited in the December quarter, where people have placed backlog in the March quarter and pulled it in. You're seeing a stronger March quarter despite that. So as you go into an up an upward trend in the business, it is not unnatural. We've seen it in other cycles where customers start to see their business recovering and wanting to have products sooner than they had originally planned for. -- Yes. And in addition to those orders that are being pulled in by customers requesting them into the current quarter, we're also receiving orders that are just within our normal published lead times, and that can create some expedite activity also. -- Often with short lead times. -- Yes. And Chris, this phenomenon is not a new one. We've seen it before in prior cycles, and we've been seeing it in this cycle. It's -- I kind of call it, have your cake and eat it too.So customers will place an order, where they are still in the cancellation or push-out window. And if they don't want it, if the business is not strong, they can push it out or leave it out. But if their business is stronger than they needed, then they ask us to expedite it, kind of have their cake and eat it too. It's not a new phenomenon.But we are seeing it quite accentuated right now, and that's why I called it out. -- OK. Thanks a lot guys.Our next question comes from Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler. -- Yes. Hey Steve, I was curious with the sudden pickup in China. Are you aware of any areas of shortages, not just in your business, but in the industry overall? -- I'm not seeing any shortages. I mean, China right now is shutdown. So you really wouldn't get any data, and they were shut down for the Chinese New Year. They're just about coming back, but most provinces have extended until February 9.But prior to going for the Chinese New Year, no, we were not experiencing any shortages. -- Thanks guys.Our next question comes from Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna International Group. -- Thanks for the question. Eric, perhaps asked another way. If you could talk about Atmel and Microsemi, bringing them in house. Remind us kind of where we are front end and back end? And then also the gross margin benefits that you would get there? Also, how you're able to do this in such a small capex envelope as well? Thanks. -- OK. So there's a couple of pieces to that. So we did tighten our investment criteria in terms of making those capital investments over the course of the last year when business was difficult. And so we shorten the window, the payback window from a cash flow perspective from two years down to a year.And we really haven't changed that at this point in time. So that's one of the reasons it's been lower. And this is a very detailed work. So it's package by package, part by part.And none of these investments are needle movers. But in aggregate, they do help gross margins slowly over time. So I think that's responsive to your question, unless these guys have anything else they'd like to add. -- I think there's then the percentage we haven't said and outside for fab, assembly and tests. -- Yes. So fab is 39% internal, assembly is 45% and test is 54%. -- That's useful. -- And we would expect those assembly and test percentages to increase over time as we gradually make these investments.Our next question will come from Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. -- Good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the strong start to 2020. I know lead times are still pretty short.But given the strong bookings trends coming off of the depressed September quarter, strong bookings thus far here in the March quarter and maybe some backlog build for June, existing out the potential issues for coronavirus. But do you think you're setting up given the backlog that you're seeing, at least for a seasonal June quarter, which is typically one of your seasonally strongest quarters. -- We are not giving guidance or commenting on the June quarter, especially in the light of significant uncertainty because of the coronavirus. Remove those uncertainties and let's say there's no impact and business comes back and the virus is contained rapidly and all that, then your assessment for the June quarter would be correct. -- Yes. And I think I would just add that we are very well positioned from a capacity perspective to be able to respond quickly to upside if that develops. -- Got it. And then, I guess, on that note, back in early January when you did your update, it didn't sound like you were going to be increasing front-end utilizations near term just because you guys have pretty substantial die bank. But let's say, as the much quarter progresses and the backlog is indicating the potential for normal seasonal growth for June and September, I assume the team would start to ramp capacity utilization, say, in the back half of this quarter. Is that kind of the right way to think about the potential timing of utilizations going up? -- So this is Steve. Let me take that. I think let's start from the back end first then we'll come to the front end. The back-end utilization is going up as we speak.And as we ramp, it will continue to go up because we depleted the finished goods. And when the orders are strong, we've got to take the die bank and finish them. So that will continue to have a positive effect on gross margin, pretty much starting now. When you look at the front end, the front end still has a fair amount of die bank, but there also you got to separate it on the production we do inside versus the production we buy from outside.The inventory and the products we buy from outside was depleted to a lower level. And there, we are increasing the buy as we speak. But there's not a utilization impact of that because that was being done outside. What we were doing inside, that's where we have the substantial die bank.And I think it will at least take it a few more quarters before we have to start increasing the production in our fabs. -- Got it. OK. But then the lower end, the underutilization charges here in the March quarter is simply because you are filling out your packaging and test assembly utilizations are going up, right? Is that the primary driver for the lower underutilization charges? -- Yes. There's always lots of moving parts, mix and all that. But yes, there is a new phenomenon where even in the December quarter, we were depleting finished goods. We were a quarter back-end utilization was lower than the September quarter.And the March quarter will be up significantly from the December quarter. I wanted to add one more comment on the question you asked regarding the June quarter seasonality, how it would be? And the comment was made that June quarter will at least be seasonal. I would say, I hope that one of these quarters, current quarter as well as June quarter and September quarter are well above seasonal because the inventories are so low. And if I take any Qs from any prior recoveries, whether it was from SaaS or the recovery from 2009 cycle or any other cycle recovery, usually, you got two or three quarters of well above seasonal recovery that takes the business back to the old heights and then goes from there.So I'd like to think that any kind of forecast here becomes very conservative. -- Yes. I thought that's a fair point, Steve. -- Thank you.Our next question will come from the Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho Securities. -- I was wondering, as you look at your business, I was wondering if you can give us some color by markets, in markets, automotive, industrial, how do you see that playing out to the rest of the year? -- Thanks. So as Steve mentioned, we're starting to see automotive and industrial picking up from the bottom that they were at. They had pretty bad years in 2019. And our expectation is that barring any outside events as we go through 2020, both those end markets should see continued improvement. -- Got it. And on the industrial and other end markets, do you see a similar trend into the back half? Or do you see a stronger first half year or... -- So my comment was for both automotive and industrial. We've talked about data center. It was strong. It remains strong.We don't see anything that suggests it's different. There may be some communication market changes that are driven by what happens with coronavirus. We don't know. But there is a large 5G investment cycle that is starting.And then as far as defense and aerospace tends to be pretty steady and how it goes. It remained steady with where it's at. And then the consumer cycle, we have yet to see if we'll see some benefits. It needs further trade resolution for it to see any significant benefits, but nothing new to report on that, on the consumer end of the market. -- Right. Great. Thanks.Our last question will come from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse Group. -- Yes. Thanks for letting me get in. I've been jumping around calls, so I apologize if this is a repeat. But Steve, if you kind of look at the operating model for the business.Historically, you guys have always made good progress and then kind of taking a step back as you've made acquisitions to then kind of move forward again. I'm just kind of curious, if we go to an extended period where you're not sort of in the acquisition game. How should we be thinking about operating margin targets and incremental gross and op margins for the business over time? -- So John, no, you are very correct that we make substantial progress in gross and operating margin after an acquisition. And then when we do another acquisition, most times, we're not buying businesses that are over 60% gross margin and 40% operating margins. So our overall company margin, gross and operating, drop. And then we work back up few steps only to take a fall again when we buy the next acquisition.Now if you make the assumption that for an extended period of time, we were to not do another acquisition, then first thing that would happen is that we will reach our operating model. So our operating model to remind everyone is 63% gross margin and 22.5% operating expenses, leading to a 40.5% operating profit. So two ends of it. First, the gross margin.We're guiding 61.7% gross margin this quarter. So it's 130 basis points away. If you just take the underutilization charge of $16 million, that pretty much gets you there, almost. The second issue is the operating expense.So operating expense, basically, we're guiding 25% to 26.2%. And there is a huge leverage there with the revenue increase. The current revenue I think, were a couple of hundred million dollars behind that past record, very round number. So once you gain that, you have a significant leverage with the operating expense comes down.Some leverage still remains in integration of Microsemi, with all these go-lives and all that, that are happening, which will take another nine months. But once we get all that done, then you have achieved gross margin as well as the operating expense and you have reached the model. Now if your question is, where does the model go? Do we continue to go higher in gross margin and continue to grow higher in operating margin? For that, get in line, and we'll talk about it when we get there. -- That's helpful. And then just secondly, on Microsemi. With an acquisition, you kind of made as the industry was going into a correction, and you're talking a little bit about kind of the expense leverage there. I'm just kind of curious from a revenue leverage.I mean, one of the things you guys have always done well as you bought these assets is going and kind of apply a better pricing discipline to the business. Is there still more to go with the Microsemi acquisition? Or has that mostly played out? -- First of all, I don't think we had the same pricing discipline issues in Microsemi as we did at Atmel. Microsemi, just to remind you, was gross margins that were right around 60% when we did the acquisition. The product lines at Microsemi are extremely sticky products, and many of them have very long-life cycles. And to that extent, those margins will stay high.The product line revenues will stay high. Now in the time we have owned Microsemi started to work on, so how are we going to take advantage of Microsemi's position in the end markets they were strong in, data center communications and aerospace and defense, to be able to sell a more complete portfolio? And that work is well under way and reverse how can we take Microsemi products into the end market that Microchip was strong in prior to the acquisition, automotive, industrial and home appliances. And that work is going in. Now we have a six , seven-quarter window, where the environment has been weak.And as we emerge from a weak environment and we go into a more normal environment, all the hard work that has been done will begin to play itself out. And so I think there are revenue synergies yet to come. But in part, it's work to be done, and a lot of that is under way and has been for some time. But a lot of it has to come as the environment strengthens. -- And John, I think if you study some of the past cycles, I know you and other analysts are very good studying the past cycles. What really happens is nobody believes the depth of the downturn. And the estimates always stay high and they get cut multiple times. In this cycle, the estimates fully have been cut four times not only for Microchip, but for the industry and various other players, could be more than four times.And then when the reverse happens, the estimates always go higher. We can raise, we can raise, we can raise for many quarters. I have seen this in prior cycles because nobody has the confidence to get the revenue or guide the revenue to be higher than seasonal, and it continues for many quarters in the other direction. That's what I'm hoping for, but not guiding to.And at this time, there are no further questions in the queue. So I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Steve Sanghi for any closing remarks. -- Well, we want to thank everyone for attending this call, and we're going to about three different conferences, I think, this quarter. So we'll see some of you at those conferences. Thank you.[Operator signoff] --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

"re you looking for a tip on the next hot investment? Goldman Sachs has an interesting idea… Move toward US companies with high exposure to international sales. Goldman points out that such companies are on an upswing in 2H19, and that a basket of such stocks has been outperforming both the firm’s other portfolios and the broader S&P 500. For comparison, the firm notes that its ‘international sales exposure’ basket is up 29% this year, compared to the S&P gain of 23%.Stephanie Cohen, Goldman Sachs’ chief strategy officer, in an interview last week talked down fears that the US-China trade tensions are unwinding long-established economic cooperation between the two countries. She said, after a visit to Chinese tech companies in Shenzen, “It’s not that we’re decoupling. If you sit on the ground and you’re talking to companies, people are continuing to talk about ways that they can do business together.”Goldman Sachs has a decades-long record pursuing investment and business openings in China. The firm has partnerships with Chinese banks, and has taken the time to learn the facts on the ground. And now they see opportunity in the US companies that are most exposed to the international scene, where China is working hard to throw its weight around.Looking into Goldman’s basket of stocks with international exposure, we’ve chosen three that  reveals have shown recent strong gains, a healthy upside potential, and recent Buy ratings from 5-star analysts. This company services the semiconductor chip industry, providing essential process control and management systems for manufacturers of silicon wafers and integrated circuits, along with quality control and precision metrology. As the industry shifts to new, higher performance chips, and to 5G networks, the need to maintain quality tolerances becomes more important, and KLA, with operations across the US, Europe, and the Asia/Pacific regions is well-positioned to benefit. KLA shares have brought in a disproportionate 97% year-to-date return to the Goldman’s international exposure basket.Looking at the numbers, KLA’s revenue growth over the last few years confirms the company’s importance to the industry. It brought in $2.98 billion in 2016, and has seen that number grow to $4.6 billion in fiscal 2019. In its fiscal Q1 2020 report, the company showed that revenue is still growing, with quarterly sales gaining 12% year-over-year to $1.41 billion.KLA has been active in the past several years making relevant acquisitions. The most recent, metrology tool-maker Capres A/S, was purchased in March of this year for an undisclosed amount. Last year, in a deal worth $3.4 billion, KLA acquired Orbotech, a major producer of circuit boards and flat-panel displays. The deal was completed in February of this year, after clearing regulatory hurdles in China.Writing from JPMorgan, top analyst  sees KLAC shares in a boom period. He writes, “We believe semiconductor capital spending is in the midst of a technology-driven cycle for 7nm/5nm Foundry/Logic, sub-20nm DRAM, and high layer count 3D NAND. As device manufacturing complexities increase, the need to analyze defects and metrology issues at critical points in the IC manufacturing processes increases significantly… [KLA] has diversified end-market exposure through the acquisition of Orbotech."" Sur gives KLAC a $200 price target, implying an upside of 13%. (To watch Sur's track record, )KLA stock has a resounding “yes” on Wall Street. TipRanks analytics show that out of 12 analysts, 10 are bullish, while 2 remain sidelined. The average price target of $191 shows a potential upside of about 8%. ()With a market cap of $22.3 billion, Microchip is the sixth largest semiconductor manufacturer in the US. The company produces chips for the microcontroller and microprocessor industry, power management applications, memory solutions, and wireless connection devices. In the 2019 fiscal year, ending this past March, Microchip brought in $5.35 billion in total revenues. Last year, the company acquired competitor Microsemi in a deal with $10 billion.The US-China trade war has hurt Microchip, depressing sales through much of this year. Until this past September, the stock showed high volatility. Even with that, the MCHP is up 30% year-to-date, a solid performance based on the quality and necessity of its products. The company’s first and second quarter fiscal 2020 reports have also helped to allay investor fears. Microchip earnings beat or met expectations in both quarters, while revenues were up year-over-year.Even with the two good quarters, Microchip’s sales are down year-over-year, and the company has revised its full-year guidance downward. In a way, this may be a case of lowering expectations to set up a positive financial report – BMO's top analyst  points out.“Unlike the better guidance/commentary we got for December from companies last week, Microchip's guidance is for lower revenues than expectations, and calling for yet another double-digit y-y decline in sales,” Srivastava noted. In his bottom line, however, Srivastava says, “We like Microchip's operating model. We like the valuation, we like the two rounds of estimate cuts we have already seen. We see the company as among the higher rungs of diversified businesses we would like to recommend in our coverage.” His $110 price target implies a 16% upside for the stock. (To watch Srivastava's track record, ), 5-star analyst from Rosenblatt Securities, also sees management’s performance as key to MCHP’s share price prospects. He writes, “MCHP's environment remains uncertain, as the trade war and broad-based macroeconomic weakness hinder visibility. Management continues to execute well, however, and has managed the down-cycle with low channel inventory going forward... We continue to believe mid-to-longer term investors will have increasing confidence in management's ability to execute, as the company looks to exit this down-cycle gaining market share in secular MCU/analog markets and increase operating margins.” Mosesmann puts a $115 price target on the stock, for a 22% upside potential. (To watch Mosesmann's track record, )Wall Street’s analysts are sanguine about this stock’s ability to gain going forward. Microchip’s Strong Buy consensus rating is based on 12 Buys and 2 Holds. It doesn’t hurt that its $109.31 average price target puts the potential twelve-month rise at 16%. () And now we move away from the semiconductor sector and into the internet. We all know Alphabet; the parent company of Google, with a market cap of $893 billion, is the world’s fourth-largest publicly traded company. With over $136 billion in annual revenue, and $30 billion in net income, there is no doubt that Alphabet will hold its position near the top.GOOGL shares are up 24% year-to-date, just slightly outperforming the S&P 500, after an earnings miss in the Q3 report. While revenues were up, at $40.5 billion, the EPS of $10.12 missed the forecast by 18.5%. The earnings slip came as the company increased capital expenditures from $5.28 billion one year ago to $6.73 billion in the current report. The company is increasing spending on its cloud sales force, and has just made a $2.1 billion offer to acquire smartwatch company Fitbit. The acquisition, if approved, will put Google in a direct position to compete against Apple in the smartwatch and wearable niche.Fitbit will make an interesting addition to Alphabet’s ‘other revenue’ category, which includes both cloud systems and hardware. This category saw quarterly revenue of $6.43 billion, beating the forecast of $6.32 and coming in 38.5% above the year-ago quarter.So GOOGL has a firm foundation in its core search engine business, strong ad revenue, and rising revenues in its other endeavors. It’s a solid picture, and explains why the stock makes up 2.26% of Goldman’s ‘international exposure’ basket. Google’s global reach and profitability are undisputed.5-star JMP analyst  is enthusiastic about the Fitbit acquisition, putting a $1,450 price target on GOOGL and writing, “We believe Fitbit is a natural fit with Google’s current hardware brands that include its Pixel phones, Nest connected home products, and Google home smart speakers under its Made By Google brand, along with its Android OS… we believe Google is investing in developing the hardware and touchpoints that will enable its ambient computing strategy…” Josey’s price target suggests an upside for 12% for GOOGL shares. (To watch Josey's track record, )5-star analyst , of Credit Suisse, focused more on Alphabet’s free cash flow position in his comments, saying, “Google in our view is a controlled outcome, with management looking to drive consistent revenue and FCF growth through the amassing and creation of a portfolio of assets even as the law of large numbers begin to result in deceleration for some of the largest businesses… overall revenue growth has once again settled into a managed ~20%+ range… Google has resumed free cash flow growth this year after two years of investments.” Ju puts a $1,700 price target on the stock, showing confidence in a bullish 31% upside.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''.  These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand.  Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).  Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

Image source: The Motley Fool. Q2 2020 , Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Microchip second-quarter fiscal 2020 financial results conference call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Microchip's chief financial officer, Mr. Eric Bjornholt.Please go ahead, sir. -- Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's chairman and CEO; and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's president and COO. I will comment on our second-quarter fiscal year 2020 financial performance and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance and provide an update on the ongoing integration activities associated with the Microsemi acquisition. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. We are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, , has quadrupled the market.* David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Microchip Technology wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing our GAAP and non-GAAP results. We've also posted a summary of our outstanding debt and our leverage metrics on our website. I want to remind investors that during the June quarter of 2018, we adopted the new GAAP revenue recognition standard, which requires revenue to be recognized at the time products are sold to distributors versus our historical revenue recognition policy where revenue on such transactions was deferred until the product was sold by our distributor to an end customer. As discussed in previous earnings conference calls, we continue to track and measure our performance internally based on direct revenue plus distribution sell-through activity, and each quarter, we'll provide a metric for this called end market demand in our earnings release.Therefore, along with our GAAP and non-GAAP results based on distribution sell-in, we'll also provide investors with our end market demand based on distribution sell-out, but will not provide a P&L based on end market demand. End market demand in the September 2019 quarter was $1.346 billion. End market demand was about $8.6 million more than our GAAP revenue in the quarter. I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses.I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis, which is based on expenses prior to the effects of our acquisition activities, share-based compensation and certain other adjustments as described in our press release. Net sales in the September quarter were $1.338 billion, which was up 1.15% sequentially and modestly below the midpoint of our guidance of $1.349 billion. We have posted a summary of our GAAP net sales and end market demand by product line and geography on our website for your reference. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were near all-time highs at 62.24%, operating expenses were at 25.56% and operating income was 36.7%.Non-GAAP net income was $365.7 million. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $1.43, which was in line with the midpoint of our guidance. On a GAAP basis, gross margins were 61.9% and included the impact of $5.2 million of share-based compensation. Total operating expenses were $643.9 million and include acquisition intangible amortization of $248.2 million, special charges of $3.6 million, $10.1 million of acquisition-related and other costs and share-based compensation of $40.1 million.The GAAP net income was $108.9 million or $0.43 per diluted share. Our September quarter GAAP tax benefit included $12.7 million of net discrete income tax benefits related to tax reserve releases due to statute of limitations expiring, partially offset by a foreign tax assessment. The non-GAAP cash tax rate was 6.5% in the September quarter and was negatively impacted by a foreign tax assessment that Microchip will pay in fiscal year 2020, but defend its position and seek a refund of these taxes in the future. We expect our non-GAAP cash tax rate for fiscal '20 to be between 6% and 7%.Exclusive of the transition tax, any potential tax associated with restructuring the Microsemi operations into the Microchip global tax structure and any tax audit settlements related to taxes accrued in prior fiscal years. We have many tax attributes and net operating losses and tax credits as well as U.S. interest deductions that we believe will keep our cash tax payments low. The future cash tax payments associated with the transition tax is expected to be about $236 million and will be paid over the next six years.We have posted a schedule of our projected transition tax payments on the Investor Relations page of our website. Our inventory balance at September 30, 2019, was $734.2 million. We had 131 days of inventory at the end of the September quarter, down one day from the prior-quarter's level. Inventory at our distributors in the September quarter were at 30 days compared to 32 days at the end of June.We have only had one quarter in the past 15 years, which was Q3 of fiscal year 2013, where days of inventory and distribution have been lower than the current levels. The cash flow from operating activities was $396 million in the September quarter. As of September 30, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $405.1 million. We paid down $315.5 million of total debt in the September quarter, and the net debt on the balance sheet was reduced by $283.5 million.Over the last full five quarters since we closed the Microsemi acquisition and incurred over $8 billion in debt to do so, we have paid down $1.729 billion of the debt and continue to allocate substantially all of our excess cash beyond dividends to aggressively bring down this debt. We have accomplished this despite the adverse macro and market conditions during most of this period, which is a testimony to the cash generation capabilities of our business. We expect our debt levels to reduce significantly over the next several years. Our adjusted EBITDA on the September -- in the September quarter was $540.2 million and our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was $2.178 billion.Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA, excluding our very long-dated convertible debt that matures in 2037 and is more equity-like in nature, was 4.59 at September 30, 2019. Our dividend payment in the September quarter was $87.3 million. Capital expenditures were $17.7 million in the September quarter. We expect between $20 million and $25 million in capital spending in the December quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal 2020 to be between $90 million and $100 million, a $25 million reduction from the forecast we provided last quarter.We continue to add capital to support the growth of our production capabilities of our new products and technologies and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. We expect these capital investments will bring some gross margin improvement to our business, particularly for the outsourced Atmel and Microsemi manufacturing activities that we are bringing into our own factories. Depreciation expense in the September quarter was $39.5 million. I will now turn it over to Ganesh to give us comments on the performance of the business in the September quarter and provide an update on some of our ongoing Microsemi integration activities.Ganesh?  -- Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I get started, I would like to remind you that the product line comparisons I will be sharing with you today are based on end market demand, which is how Microchip measures its performance internally. Also, as I go through the product line reports, they will reflect continued broad macro weakness in the markets we serve. This broad weakness was further accentuated in the month of September.Let's start by taking a closer look at microcontrollers. Our microcontroller business was sequentially down 1.3% as compared to the June quarter. We continued to introduce a steady stream of innovative new microcontrollers, including the industry's first commercially available serial memory solid-state drive controller, which won the best-of-show award in the 2019 Flash Memory Summit, as well as two different USB Type-C Power Delivery controllers, which enable fast device charging and simplifies implementation of this functionality. Microcontrollers represented 53.3% of our end market demand in the September quarter.Now moving to analog. Our analog business was sequentially up 0.2% as compared to the June quarter. During the quarter, we continued to introduce a steady stream of innovative analog products, including the introduction of the Trust Platform for CryptoAuthentication, the industry's first pre-provisioned solution providing secure key storage for small and large volumes. Analog represented 28.7% of our end market demand in the September quarter.Our FPGA business was sequentially down 8.9% as compared to the June quarter. As we have mentioned in prior conference calls, the FPGA business does have some lumpiness because of our significant exposure to space, aviation and defense markets where procurement timing can be a function of programs and their shifting priorities, schedules and budgets. During the quarter, we announced our Smart Embedded Vision initiative, providing for designing intelligent machine vision systems with our low-power PolarFire FPGAs. Design wins for the PolarFire family continued to grow strongly, and we remain optimistic about the prospects for this product family.FPGA represented 6.8% of our end market demand in the September quarter. Our licensing, memory and other product line, which we refer to as LMO, was sequentially up 10.5% in the September quarter as compared to the June quarter. Strength in our licensing business as well as our timing systems business outpaced the broader macro weakness we experienced. LMO represented 11.2% of our end market demand in the September quarter.In September, we completed the acquisition of two small, early stage private companies. The first acquisition enables low power embedded computing solutions for machine learning inference and Smart Embedded Vision applications for our FPGA product families. This acquisition also adds domain knowledge depth in the areas of machine learning algorithms and vector processing. The second acquisition provides digital gate driver solutions for wide-bandgap MOSFET and IGBT technologies.The acquisition complements our silicon carbide discrete and modular power conversion offerings and enables us to provide more comprehensive total system solutions. These two acquisitions were very small and more akin to acquiring intellectual property along with domain experts to help us accelerate our business agenda in specific laser-focused areas. The combined cash outflow was less than $6 million, and hence, not material to the rate at which we're paying down our debt. Finally, a quick update about the ongoing Microsemi integration.We continue to plow forward with the business systems and operations integrations. On the business systems front, we went live with a few more systems on November 1. And as I have mentioned on prior conference calls, this is a tedious and time-consuming effort and we estimate that we're about 50% of the way to completion and have about another year of work ahead of us. We are pleased with the synergies we have achieved since we closed the transaction despite the weaker macro environment, and we expect continued synergy gains for many quarters to come.Let me now pass it to Steve for his comments about our business and our guidance going forward. Steve? -- Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to first reflect on the results of the fiscal second quarter of 2020. I will then provide guidance for the fiscal third quarter of 2020. Our September quarter GAAP net sales based on sell-in revenue recognition was $1.338 billion, up 1.15% sequentially versus a guidance of flat to up 4%.So we missed the GAAP sales guidance slightly at the midpoint. Our end market demand based on sell-through was $8.6 million higher than GAAP sales, which we believe shows that the channel is continuing to manage their working capital conservatively by reducing inventory due to uncertainty. Recall that we called the bottom of this cycle back in February of 2019, contingent on resolution of the U.S.-China trade dispute. This trade settlement did not happen and remains unresolved.Since then, our end market demand has been flat at $1.34 billion, $1.35 billion and $1.346 billion for March, June and September quarters, respectively, due to multitude of headwinds from trade tensions and resulting impact on automotive, industrial and consumer appliance end markets. Our consolidated non-GAAP gross margin of 62.24% was just above the high end of our guidance and was near a record high. Our consolidated non-GAAP operating margin of 36.7% was also higher than the midpoint of our guidance of 36.2%. The integration of Microsemi continues to proceed very nicely.Since the closing of the acquisition, we are continuing to see strong synergies and improvements in gross and operating margins for Microsemi products. Our consolidated non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.43, right at the midpoint of our guidance. On non-GAAP basis, this was also our 116th consecutive profitable quarter. In the September quarter, we paid down $315.5 million of our debt.Our total debt payment since the end of June 2018 has been $1.73 billion. The pace of debt payments has been strong despite the weak and uncertain business conditions as we continue to squeeze working capital. Now before I provide you guidance for the December quarter, let me comment on geographical and end market sales. While the uncertainty begin with U.S.-China trade friction, the uncertainty has become global.The weak business conditions can be seen in all geographies. Our Americas business in September quarter based on end market demand was down 6.1% over the year-ago quarter, Europe was down 12.9% and Asia was down 12.6%. We did experience our business being weaker in September than we had expected in the month of September. This weakness was also reflected in the lower starting backlog for the December quarter as well as the unusually low distribution inventory exiting the September quarter.From an end market standpoint, industrial, automotive and consumer appliances end markets are down significantly; aerospace and defense and communication markets have been flattish; and data center market has been strong. The uncertainty in all geographies is continuing. In this environment, direct customers, and especially the distributors, are continuing to manage their working capital by reducing inventory. However, there are some signs of inflection point too.In the September quarter, distributor inventory was down to 29.6 days. We have had only one quarter in the past 15 years, which was the third quarter of fiscal year '13, where our days of inventory at distribution have been lower than the current levels. Secondly, bookings for the month of October were the highest bookings achieved since June of 2018. While the backlog for December quarter is much lower than the backlog for September quarter at the same point in the quarter, the slope of the backlog fill for the current quarter is much steeper.With steeper backlog fill where the backlog and shipments end up is a guessing game, especially with the holidays coming, our judgment is that the net sales based on sell-in revenue recognition will take another leg down this quarter. But with several indicators showing inflection point, we may see the forming of a bottom here even though we saw a false bottom back in the March of this year when trade dispute was not resolved. We expect GAAP net sales based on sell-in revenue recognition for our products to be between minus 2% to minus 10% sequentially in the December quarter. Due to the sharp reduction in GAAP sales at the midpoint of the guidance, we are taking steps to reduce our manufacturing capacity, capital expenditures as well as expenses.We are planning to reduce the clean room footprint in our Colorado six-inch fab that we acquired with Atmel acquisition. At six-inch wafer size, the fab is no longer competitive with our other high-volume eight-inch fabs. Therefore, we will be turning the six-inch fab into a discrete and specialty fab doing silicon carbide, field effect transistors, FETs, the transistors, MEMS and other discrete devices. We will be transferring high-volume Atmel products from the six-inch Colorado fab to our eight-inch fabs in Arizona and Oregon.This transfer will take about 12 months to complete largely because we brought up the highest volume process in eight-inch fabs for dual sourcing earlier. In addition, we will be transferring some of the discrete products from Microsemi four-inch fabs to the six-inch fab in Colorado. These actions will create about $65 million in cost of goods savings per year when completed. The first phase of this transfer will take about one year to complete and will achieve about two-third of the savings.The balance of the transfers have a long tail and will take another two years after the first phase. Regarding capital expenditures, we are reducing our capex for fiscal year 2020 to be between $90 million and $100 million for the year, a reduction of $25 million from our guidance on capex last quarter. Regarding the reduction of opex, we're doing three things, some of those are continuation of what we have been doing. First, we are approving new and replacement acquisitions very sparingly.Second, we will be managing discretionary spending very tightly. And third, our bonus program will yield a lower payout with the reduction in net sales. For December quarter, we expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 61% to 61% of sales -- gross margin to be between 61% and 61.4% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 26.2% and 28% of sales.We expect non-GAAP operating profit to be between 33% and 35.2% of sales. And we expect our non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $1.12 per share to $1.32 per share. Given all the complications of accounting for our acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory write-up on acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on non-GAAP basis except for net sales, which will be on a GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters, and we request that the analysts continue to report their non-GAAP estimates to first call.With this, operator, will you please poll for questions?[Operator instructions] We'll take our first question from Chris Caso from Raymond James. Please go ahead. -- Yes, thank you. Good evening. I guess, the first question, Steve, is the expectations for sell-in versus sell-through in the December quarter. You've already said that the distribution channel inventory is at a record low.So is this guidance for December suggesting that that end demand is actually declining in December? Could you explain the difference there? -- The end demand is declining. There has been some destruction of end demand in various end markets. Automotive, clearly, where the number of units built in automotive are much lower in U.S., Europe and China, the industrial market end demand has been weaker because of all the impact of tariffs and increased costs. And similar thing we're seeing in the home appliances market.So yes, the end demand is weaker. And sell-in, we're guiding down. We do not know what the net to distribution inventory will be in terms of increasing or decreasing, whether end market demand will be higher than GAAP sales or lower slightly, but we think they could be roughly in the same range and could go either way. -- Right. OK. As a follow-up then, maybe you can reconcile that with your comments of the potential of this inflection point. I guess, what I understand you're saying is the opening backlog coming into the quarter was lower, but you're seeing stronger fill as you go through the quarter.How are you reconciling that better order fill with the prospect of end demand perhaps a bit weaker? -- So how we are reconciling it is the starting backlog in the quarter was significantly more weaker than the minus 6% guidance at the midpoint, significantly weaker. So some of that -- fair amount of that has closed in the last five weeks because the curve of backlog fill is much steeper. And we're expecting that that kind of curve will continue and will end up really close to the guidance we're providing, but where we end up would still be lower than the last quarter. It will require significantly more steeper curve to be even with the last quarter.So we are expecting improvement because of steeper curve, but it doesn't get us to a flat compared to last quarter. -- Yeah, and it probably is worth repeating what Steve has already said that our October 2019 bookings were the strongest month of bookings we've seen since June 2018. -- Right. All right. Thank you. -- There are kind a lot of mixed messages, weaker backlog, but some inflection points and Chile's very hard to read in this environment. We said back in February there could be a bottom, but it was very much tied to the trade settlement. We didn't get it. So this time, we're just being cautious in giving you all the puts and takes. -- Right. Got it. Thank you.Thank you. Next we'll go with Gary Mobley from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. -- Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. You've mentioned that sort of the retooling of your Colorado facility could bring on maybe a 50-basis-point positive impact to gross margin long-term, but the near-term, it looks like we're contemplating 100-basis-point sequential decrease. How much of that degradation in the gross margin near-term is due to underutilization? And how much is due to mix? -- So I can address that and Steve or Ganesh could add on to it. So this quarter we just completed, we had an underutilization charge of about $8.9 million. That charge will be higher in the December quarter, so that is having an impact on gross margins that we're seeing on a sequential basis. There's always things like product mix that factor into it also.And then with demand down, it's likely that we'll have some accounting charges related to obsolescence. It doesn't mean that the product isn't good anymore, but we'll have some obsolescence charges that will also impact the gross margins that we produced this quarter. -- OK. And just -- I know it's very early to call, but could you give us some sense of seasonal trends in the March quarter based on past history and perhaps how you're feeling about the linearity of bookings as we sit here today? -- Well, seasonality is the hardest one to talk about because of various acquisitions that we have completed. Prior to the Microsemi acquisition, for example, our end market mix was dominated by industrial, automotive and consumer appliances. With the addition of Microsemi now, we have added three other significant end markets: Aerospace and defense, data center and communication where we had very little exposure. And the last year or five quarters since we have had Microsemi, the environment hasn't been normal.First, a significant inventory correction in the last June and September of last year, and then subsequently, fighting through the U.S.-China trade sanctions and all the other issues. So we haven't really seen a combined company normal environment for a year or longer to be able to figure out what the seasonality with the current mix is. So I think that would be my answer that we -- at the minus 6% at the midpoint, clearly, that is below seasonal. We're not defending that it is seasonal.Prior to any of this acquisition, I think seasonality for December quarter used to be about minus 3%, if I remember. We don't know where it is today. -- All right. Thank you, guys.We'll next go with Vivek Arya from the Bank of America. -- Thanks for taking my question. Steve, I was hoping you could help us understand the chronology here because back in August, you gave some guidance. Then in September, you kind of confirmed the midpoint of that guidance. And at that time, the hope was that September would be a normal month.And since then, the results are about $11-ish million, somewhat below, so not bad, but somewhat below. And since that time, we have just heard such a wide range of views from here. One of your peer was very weak, but then most others have kind of been in line. And now you were saying that October bookings are very strong, but backlog is very weak.I think investors are just horribly confused as to what's really going on. What is driving such a weak backlog? And what is now driving this upside? What is causing all this? -- Well, Vivek, in terms of confusion, join the party. I mean this has been a very, very confusing environment. On one hand, there have been fits and starts on the trade front and the three largest of our markets, which are industrial, automotive and consumer appliances, are heavily hit with large amount of tariffs, and therefore, there has been a lot of demand destruction. And any time you make any kind of guess with some resolution of the trade dispute, it really hasn't happened.And then you have had multitude of other issues with ZTE about a year ago then Huawei, you can ship it, not ship it, then Hikvision and many other customers added. So there has been a lot of confusion. And every company -- I think if you look at the number year over year, you will see that our performance year over year is pretty reasonable, but quarter over quarter, it just depends on when somebody went into inventory correction, how long the inventory correction lasted. We measured our September performance to the September performance of last year.However, September last year, we were still reporting numbers based on sell-through revenue recognition as a non-GAAP. If you compare the numbers GAAP to GAAP, September quarter to September quarter, we were actually up because last September quarter, there was a substantial reduction in distribution inventory. I don't know if it's exactly correct. -- Yeah. No, we were not up, but we had about an $80 million reduction last September in distribution inventory in that quarter. -- Yeah. So if you compare to that, the numbers get very confusing. So in parallel with all these other confusions, last year, we also went through change of revenue recognition. So I would say simply lay out the numbers for various companies and you will find that our year-over-year performance is better than the other large competitor you talked about. -- Vivek, in terms of the chronology, the other thing to keep in mind is, if you remember, I think it was in early August, there were additional tariffs that were announced and were going to be taking place at various points in time. I think that creates more uncertainty in the market. And I think what happened was September ended up being a lot weaker as people were trying to sort out -- customers are trying to sort out what are they going to do. And that was reflected in distribution inventory going down, the overall results being less than what we had expected at the midpoint, and then beginning to reverse as we went into October and then reflected in the guidance you are seeing today. -- Got it. And for my follow-up, Steve, how much do you think distributors will be willing to take down inventory? Like you mentioned, this is the lowest that you have seen in the last, I think, 15 years or so that you mentioned, so definitely far below historical trends. What are you hearing from them? I understand the uncertainty, but at some point, do you think you'll see the benefits of perhaps, say, a TI retrenching from the distribution channel? Or is it too early to give a sense for -- or what does a normalized distribution level look for you? -- I think the macro trends and the demand destruction by the tariffs and all this confusion created are much larger impacts than the other secular trends of -- impact of -- in other competitors in distribution and distribution putting more focus on us. Those things happen over two, three years and the effect of a trade friction and all that is really much more immediate and much more severe. So we've been telling you now for a few quarters that the distribution inventory went down. The sell-through in several quarters now, I would say at least five quarters, have been better than sell-in.And one would think with distribution inventory now lowest since 15 years except one strange quarter in FY '13, it wouldn't go down further, but we don't -- we can't be sure of it. Distributors don't have confidence. They are seeing the same issues we are seeing. Weakness in industrial market and automotive market and consumer appliance market, aerospace and defense and communications are kind of flattish.If distributors can manage their business by even lower inventory, they probably would. -- Right. They're going to leverage our generally short lead times to their advantage. -- Despite reporting GAAP numbers based on sell-in, you're very well aware of our stance. We manage our business to sell-through and we do not go and request any distributor to take any kind of inventory to stock the shelves. So we are focused on sell-through. And sell-through is weak, and therefore, the sell-in is weak. -- All right. Thanks for the color.Thank you. We're taking our next question from Harsh Kumar from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. -- Yeah. Hey, thanks. Thanks Steve, for all the color so far. I'm trying to square some of your comments.So you're taking some steps in opex and capex, but October is suggesting, from your commentary, some sort of an inflection point upward. So should we just read into it as, OK, maybe we're not going to go down from the current guidance that you gave for December, that's sort of a new base should we look at, and you're just adjusting your business to kind of, I guess, be more profitable and more cash flow and just optimizing a little bit? Or is there something else I can read into it? -- Well, I think what I'm reading into it is that we started the December quarter with much lower backlog on October 1 than it was on July 1 and if that had continued in the last five weeks, the guidance would be double-digit negative. But we have made up significant gap by the fill being much stronger. And if that strength of that fill continues, then the results could be reasonably good. But there are also holidays coming, short month in November, short month of December, Europe shuts off in the middle of December.So by all those puts and takes, our guess is that the December quarter still ends up about 6% lower than September quarter and that minus 6% is a huge makeup from how low the backlog was on October 1. And then with the strength of the bookings, October was strong bookings, November, so far, looks like good, strong bookings. If the bookings continue, then hopefully, the January 1 backlog for the March quarter could be better than what we experienced as a backlog on October 1. And with continued strength of bookings, hopefully, we have some sort of recovery, but I'm not really giving any guidance for March yet. -- Understood. Thanks for the color, Steve. And I think earlier you mentioned that the classic Microchip as you call your core business from some acquisitions, they go typically down about 3% in December. Do you think some of that and maybe the Chinese New Year stacked kind of closer to Christmas this time has some effect on some small portion of your consumer business? You think part of that is going on, perhaps impacting September and then coming back up in October? -- I think earlier a gentlemen asked that we gave guidance in early September that we reconfirmed our midpoint of our guidance, so kind of what happened. Ganesh mentioned and I mentioned also the month of September was quite weak, weaker than what we had expected, causing us to miss the sales by about $10 million, $11 million. The month of October was much stronger and November is continuing much stronger. So could it be because of some sort of light at the end of the tunnel on first phase of settlement with China? Could it be the inventory has gone low enough? There are all these puts and takes and we really have put them all on the table, the good points, the bad points, and then we give you a judgment and you could make your own judgment or agree or disagree with ours, but that's where it is.Numbers are very hard to call in this uncertain environment. -- Understood, Steve. Thank you for the color.Thank you. We will be taking next Shawn Harrison from Longbow Research. Please go ahead. -- Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess my first would be is there any way to quantify, I know you've talked about it a lot so far, just how much September disappointed in terms of either the backlog or actual sales? Would you have been tracking toward the higher end of guidance otherwise? -- No. I mean we -- when we reconfirmed our guidance, we were essentially tracking toward the midpoint. And September was weak, causing us to miss by $11 million, am I correct? Yeah? -- And that's the amount that we should consider what the shortfall was also in kind of general backlog as well? -- No, the backlog was much, much weaker. -- Remember, backlog crosses over into the December quarter and to succeeding quarters as well. -- No. Earlier, I mentioned that the backlog started -- on October 1, the backlog was down in double-digits compared to July 1. And if we're giving minus 6% guidance now, even if 4% change, would be $52 million, right, on a revenue number. And the backlog on October 1 started much worse than minus 10%, significantly worse than minus 10%.So we have made up a huge amount of gap with significantly steeper slope. -- That's very helpful. And just as a follow-up... -- Put a ruler on the floor and get to a number and tell you that's the number. Unfortunately, we have seen that when the backlog starts so low, it can be a steeper slope, but then the slope can change and it could end early in the middle of December and not filled during the holidays. So you've got to account for all that. And that's why I've been keep -- I keep stressing that there are lots of puts and takes.And putting them all into consideration, we're giving you a guidance that we believe is where we are headed. -- That's very helpful, Stephen. If I may, a follow-up, just the incremental weakness you saw in the backlog, was it more on the analog side of the portfolio or the microcontroller side? -- It was largely pretty much across the board. -- Yeah. There's no product-specific backlog that was weaker than the other. -- Understood. Thank you.Thank you. We're next going to William Stein from SunTrust. Please go ahead. -- Great. Thanks for takin my question. Steve, you've already told us that the weakness was very broad-based by markets and by geo. I wonder if the strength or the very recent strong recovery in bookings trends could be attributed to anything in particular, any geo, any end market, any event? -- So I would say if you have to pick a geography that is -- that has shown strength, it would be China. -- And not -- but nothing by end market there? We've heard about China auto recovering significantly. Are you seeing that as well? -- Yeah. I mean we manage our business by product line, as you know. So we have rough end market commentary where we believe that the only stronger end market has been data centers. Communication and aerospace and defense were flattish.And automotive, industrial and consumer appliances were the weakest markets. With a one-month booking in October, we can't really tell you a change in that tone. We just don't track it that way. -- Thanks. And one more, if I can, with regard to the Microsemi system, their ERP integrations that you're doing. Can you remind us of the timing to complete these? And I just forget whether there is a step function cost savings that happens at the end of it all? Or is it more linear as we go? And remind us of the size of that, please? Thank you. -- So if you recall, we began this a year ago and have had a number of transitions we make every quarter. We just did the most recent of that on November 1 of this year. In my prepared remarks, I said we have at least another four quarters to get to substantially complete. We're about halfway through at this point in time.And the savings are more over time rather than a step function change. And as we get through enough of the systems, we take the savings and that becomes the synergies that we add to what we've doneAll right. Thank you. We're next going with Harlan Sur from JP Morgan. -- Good afternoon and thanks for takin my question. I know it's always tricky to reconcile the SIA data with your results. But if I look at the SIA data for calendar Q3, the overall general MCU market grew about 5% sequentially, but almost all of that growth came from 32-bit while 8-bit declined, 16-bit was relatively flattish sequentially. You've grown the size of your 32-bit pretty strongly, but I think it's still about a third of your overall MCU business, so mix adjusted because you still have more 8- and 16-bit exposure.Is this the potential reason why your MCU business slightly underperformed the general industry in the September quarter? -- We have not analyzed the numbers again for SIA. So I'd rather not guess and make any comments. I think our -- you mentioned our end market demand base for microcontroller business was down 1.3%? -- Yeah. -- I think many of the results we have heard from various companies wouldn't lead us to believe that the business in September quarter was up 5%. I don't know how SIA comes up with the numbers. If you add up the numbers from TI and others, I don't know whether I can construct that number. -- Nor would I -- our 32-bit business is doing much stronger than the 8 and the 16. I think these are businesses that are not as much 8, 16, 32-bit-focused. They are broad market trends in automotive, in industrial, in consumer appliances, and they affect all segments of the 32 -- of the microcontroller market. -- Our belief is, in history, that SIA, especially during turbulent times like this, they revise the numbers and there's significant changes reported, and it easily causes confusion like it's causing right now. If I look at -- add up the results of most companies that make microcontrollers, I don't really think I can get to the SIA numbers. -- Yeah, a that's a fair point. OK. And then my follow-up, we've been through a couple of quarters of cloud data center spending digestion, but it looks like spending is picking up back here in the second half of this year. It looks like you guys are seeing that as well.I think via the Microsemi acquisition, you guys have a relatively strong position in NVMe enterprise SSD controllers. You've got a strong platform for PCIe switching products. And then you've got some of your core products, right, like secure MCUs and Ethernet products that go into the cloud as well. Roughly, how big is cloud data center as an end market for the team? I assume it's probably a bit easier to track given that these products are purpose-designed for data center applications? -- So the product lines that address data center are more than just the Microsemi product line that came to data center. Clearly, that is a big position that we have, some of what you mentioned relative to the strength in storage, the strength in the SSDs and all that is good. But I don't know if I have a good way to break out exactly what our data center -- it's in the mid-teens is what my guess would be based on where we had seen the combined company, but that's from several quarters ago. -- We also sell products into data center from the classic Microchip business prior to the Microsemi. And some of those products go into power supplies, they go into other I/O control and various different areas. So we had some data center exposure before, but obviously the big one can with Microsemi. -- Yeah. OK. Thank you.[Operator instructions] We'll take our next question from Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs. -- Yes. Good afternoon and thanks for taking the question. I'll keep it to one. The October bookings strength that the company spoke to, are those primarily bookings that are for shipments in the December quarter? Or are some of those bookings for shipment in the March quarter and maybe giving you a good start on your backlog for the March quarter? Thanks. -- Those bookings are aged every month from hereon and into the future, six, eight months out. So some are for December quarter, some are for March quarter, some of it even still beyond the March quarter.Thank you. We'll next take our next question from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. -- Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Steve, the entire December quarter, you've been pretty clear that your assumptions for turns are higher.I'm just kind of curious, given the strength you've seen quarter to date, from here on out, what's the expectations for turns relative to trend? Do you expect you need that steepness to continue to hit the midpoint? Or are you embedding kind of a more normal turns business in the second half of the quarter to hit the midpoint of guidance? -- So I will speak qualitatively rather than quantitatively because we haven't disclosed what the backlog was, where it is now and all that. If the current slope of backlog fill continues, then the results would be very good. We're not expecting this slope to continue. So we, in our judgment, have moderated that slope, current slope, some just because the backlog started very low and then people place the order, slope is high.As backlog starts to fill up, the slope will moderate. And the other is effect of holidays because you don't do a lot of bookings over the Thanksgiving week. And then December, Europe is the weakest. Usually, U.S.is the second; and then Asia usually continues to work over the holidays. So we have, based on our experience from our history, we have modeled that in, but I will admit that we have moderated that slope because we think the slope is not sustainable. -- And I think I'll also point out to you that we give a broad range of guidance. -- And we have given a pretty broad range of guidance to account for all those puts and takes.Thank you. We're taking our next question from Chris Danely from Citigroup. -- Hey, thanks guys. I'll try and behave here and just stick to one question. Steve, as this, I guess, sluggish type of environment continues into the March quarter, theoretically, what would you be looking to do as far as opex goes in your own inventory? -- Well, if the sluggish environment were to continue, the opex would be basically in the range. We will keep on controlling any headcount additions, sparingly approve any replacement acquisitions. Bonus will continue to be lower than the target type of bonuses. capex will continue to tighten because if there's no growth, we will need capacity.And a lot of the capital we are investing is just incremental here and there. There's no big capital needed for growth in this environment. So those are the things we would do if the environment continues to be sluggish. If the environment were to accelerate, I would think we still have sufficient capacity and sufficient inventory to ship the upside.So you wouldn't see a growth in capex immediately and you wouldn't see growth in expenses either. So if the upside in revenue were to come through, I think that will be a pretty good leverage for the earnings to go to the bottom. -- Great. Thanks guys.Thank you. We'll next go with Vijay Rakesh from the Mizuho Group. Please go ahead. -- Thanks. And just Steve and Eric, just briefly, you talked about just the inventory has come down quite a bit. I was just wondering if your visibility extended to the end customer also. Have you seen the end customers stock up ahead of the tariffs? Or do you think inventories going out to the end customers have come down as well? -- We really have no meaningful visibility into end customers and what they're doing with their inventory. They don't report to us. We don't see the change from week to week as we do in the case of distribution. So they are, we presume, doing what they think is the right thing for their business, but we have no color one way or the other. -- Got it. And I know you mentioned October, you saw a nice snapback or pickup in backlog, mostly from China. Given that Steve mentioned auto and industrial were the weakest, would you expect those to snap back faster than others if we see some rebound or -- that's it. Thanks. -- No, it's really hard to call future by end markets. It's easier to talk about the past. Yes, if there's some sort of trade settlement, there was to be clear rules where overnight through another tweak, the duties will not go higher or something, then you will see some stability and return to normal on the industrial market and appliance market. Automotive, there is a settlement with GM -- in GM now and so you should see some impact there.So I think those are the things that would show strength, yes. -- Got it. Thanks.We'll next go with Christopher Rolland from the Susquehanna International Group. -- Thanks for the question. Steve, thanks for all those big picture stuff. In your experience, maybe you can talk about how this cycle has been different from prior ones, kind of what most surprised you this time around? And then how do you feel about this being more of a semiconductor-specific-driven cycle versus an economic cycle? And do you have any thoughts on an economic cycle, given how long this economic cycle has lasted? -- Well, that's a tough ball that you have served. That's -- I'm not an economist and that's not my field. So I'll give you some feel for really how I'm thinking. Many of the cycles our industry have seen are the cycles created by our own industry through long lead times, excessive inventory build and then the bubble bursting and going the other way and companies shipping below demand for a while, and then the cycle correcting.So those are semiconductor industry and its customer-caused cycles by successively under-shipping demand and over-shipping demand. This cycle hasn't been caused by the industry. This cycle has been caused by the much larger economic forces. And if I were to name a single one, it will be the U.S.-China trade.It's really been caused by that. I tried to explain it before and let me take another shot at it. The world economy runs on manufacturers building the product and pulling in the inventory with a forecast that the customers will come and buy that product. And I'd give an example of a grocery store or an electronics store.You can go into these stores, there's lots of inventory and you can come out with bags full of your grocery. You do not order your grocery a week ahead of time and then go pick up the delivery. In fact, if you were to go into the grocery store and what you wanted isn't there, you'll go to another store and buy it. So world economy largely runs on inventory.Now enter the tariff uncertainty. Imagine a customer building the product in China, and let's say, there were no tariffs on it and bringing it to U.S. -- I'm sorry, there were tariffs on it, let's say, there is 25% tariff on it. So they bring the product to U.S.with 25% tariff on it and having them the uncertainty to be able to pass on that tariff to their end customer, they don't know whether they can or they can't. And the second risk is they bring the inventory to U.S. and then there is settlement announced. Once a settlement is announced, no end customer will pay that 25% tariff because the manufacturer brought it here with tariff at their own risk.So what it does is it makes everybody stop in their tracks. They cut down the inventory on the loading dock, to the manufacturing lines, to the raw materials, to the finished goods, to the transportation hubs, everywhere. People draw down the inventory because they do not know what the landed cost is and what they can pass to their customers. That is the impact we have seen in many, many of the markets.And when there is a clarity on the tariff front, then you will see rebuilding of that supply chain inventory, which will have a very positive effect on us. -- Got it. Thank you for that extra insight. Very helpful. -- Hopefully, that helps. -- Yeah. That's great. Thank you, Steve.Thank you. We're going next with Gil Alexandre from the Darphil Associates. Please go ahead. -- I assume, as you look at your long-term model, that you still have gross margins at 63% and operating margins at 40 and a half once we get over these problems? -- Yes, Gil. We have not changed our longer-term model. In fact, the changes we announced today on the restructuring of our Colorado fab and bringing some of those six-inch products to our two high-volume eight-inch fabs and really creating $65 million in savings in the process, what we have done is we have lowered the revenue at which we achieve our target model. So prior to that, it required a certain amount of revenue to fill up our factories and remove the underutilization to achieve our 63% target margin.By making those changes, we have not dollarized for you how much, but we have lowered the revenue we need to achieve to achieve the target margin because we've taken so much cost out of the system. -- Thank you. May I just ask one question on China? And you can skip it. -- Go ahead. -- You talked of this 25% tariff. Have you seen any talk that they may -- that people will want to reduce that tariff? Or is that all open-ended? -- You have some information you were sharing? -- Are you talking about the trade discussion between the U.S. and China? Because I think that is the entire point. The 25% tariff is creating uncertainty on both sides of the ocean. It's creating uncertainty in other regions of the world as well. -- In Phase 1 settlement that has been touted by the administration, the 25% tariff doesn't go away. They only agreed to not increase the tariff from 25% to 30%. But there is some talk, whether it's in Phase 2 or gets done in Phase 1, where certain -- on $100 million, $1 billion worth of goods, that tariff will go down, but those are just talks so far. -- Yeah, I think we see different news reports that come out. We don't have any direct insight into the discussions and decisions. I think there is a in good faith effort to try to deescalate from where we are, and it may take more than one phase, but the rate at which it comes down and the time when it impacts the products that we are designed into and our customers are impacted by is unclear to us. -- Even if there is a settlement which creates a finality that tariffs are not zeroed, tariffs -- some number, 10%, 15%, but their current stand, and there's not going to be another tweet which is going to increase those tariffs, once the customers, distributors, contract manufacturers, everybody has that finality and they can run the business in a normal way and the inventories will get replenished. It is the uncertainty which causes it because they don't know what the landed cost will be. -- I want thank you. Good luck. -- Thank you, Gil. Anything else, operator?We'll take our next question from Craig Ellis from B. Riley FBR. -- Hey, guys. This is Carlin Lynch on for Craig. Just wanted to ask a question on the cross-selling opportunities with Microsemi. I think last quarter, you had said that the muted environment had kind of slowed down some of that progress.If we were to get to a normalized environment next year, could we see those cross-selling opportunities kind of springboard? Is the design activity going on and we're just seeing muted demand everywhere? Or any kind of qualitative color you could give on the cross-selling opportunities would be great. -- So as you note, the cross-selling opportunities are all at the design-in stage. So these are platforms that get designed and then go to production over 18, 24 months of time. The design-in activity is going extremely well. And across the board, the combined sales teams, combined business unit teams of Microchip, are all highly focused on enabling that on new designs.The environment today is really for products that were designed back in time, and that muted environment doesn't change, but the seeds that are being planted, new designs and the increased total system solutions we're able to address clearly will pay off in time at the current -- as the new designs go to production in 12, 18, 24 months of time. -- So just if I could clarify there, so we would expect some of that cross-selling opportunity to start to manifest next year even if the demand environment kind of just skips along the bottom here? -- Yeah, and you got to take it over time. This is not a single application, single customer that drives it one way or another. There's hundreds of applications, customers over which this would happen. But clearly, that is a multiplier that comes from cross-selling, from selling a more complete solution to the customer.And as that ramps in, I don't know if it is exactly first half of next year, second half, but in time, as the environment improves, as new designs go to production, we will see the benefits that come from it. -- All right. Thanks guys.Thank you. We're going next to Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley. -- A question for Steve. One of the secondary impacts of the trade war is just the acceleration of China to try to move to more of a localization effort. Can you talk about just maybe parts of your portfolio where you see maybe some overlap of -- to that versus other parts that you think a lot more immune to what China might be trying to do from a development perspective? -- So we hear a lot of talk and we don't see a lot of action on that front. There may be action on certain product lines. I think they're really maybe trying to build processors and graphic processors and others. We do not really see that kind of impact today on our data center products, on our FPGA products, on our discrete and other products or microcontroller and analog.We hear a lot of talk about it. And longer term, there could be an issue where they want to either design their own product or not prefer to design with Americans. I think, in a short period of time, less than a year of this trade war, you can't really design a massive portfolio that Microchip has to make a meaningful impact on that. So we're really not seeing that on revenue today, but we're seeing it in sentiment. -- And I would add to it. The threat from local suppliers in China is nothing new. It's been there for many years. It's a question that do they have the types of products, the quality of the product, the capability to support the designs, the wide range of applications and customers that you need to be able to serve with it.That is a very large task. And they may be more in an environment today that says you should consider more of a local supplier, but the task is very, very large for anybody who wants to do it. And if they could, they would have been doing it for several years before. -- Got it. Thanks.Thank you. We're going to Vivek Arya from Bank of America. -- Thanks for the very quick follow up. Actually, on those same lines in terms of competition and substitution, Steve, have you seen any design shifts to your -- perhaps your European or Japanese competitors who have been in the market for a longer period of time? Does that become a factor going forward? -- Like I said, first, we have very, very broad customer base. We serve over 120,000-plus customers, so it's very, very hard to track. We're not seeing any preponderance of evidence to see there is any design shift. We're hitting in sentiment the so-called non-A sentiment.You may have heard that kind of language where government is saying design with Chinese customers first, design with Taiwanese or Asians second, design with the Europeans third and Americans the last, but 95%, 97% of products we build are all proprietary in nature with no pin compatible part available. So in a short period of time, we really haven't seen any of that shift. The shift will first become visible at the design-in phase, if it does, and I don't think we have strong evidence today that that's happening. We're not losing designs like crazy.Our funnel size is still very, very large and we're able to leverage a lot of our more commodity-like products with more advanced products with the total system solution if they're on the same board. -- Thank you. -- It's cause for concern. We are watching and we are making the products better, finding other sales mechanisms to bundle it and all that. So negative sentiment in China is definitely there, but it's not really being seen in bookings and revenue dollars today.Thank you. It appears that there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Sanghi, I'd like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks. -- Well, I want to thank everyone. This has been a difficult year with all the uncertainty. Please continue to bear with us. And we'll see some of you on the road as we go to various conferences.Thank you very much.[Operator signoff] --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. 	For the First Trust NASDAQ-100 Equal Weighted Index Fund ETF (Symbol: QQEW), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $76.87 per unit.


With QQEW trading at a recent price near $70.09 per unit, that means that analysts see 9.67% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings.   Three of QQEW's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Hasbro, Inc. (Symbol: HAS), Facebook Inc (Symbol: FB), and Microchip Technology Inc (Symbol: MCHP). Although HAS has traded at a recent price of $99.23/share, the average analyst target is 17.32% higher at $116.42/share. Similarly, FB has 17.27% upside from the recent share price of $198.82 if the average analyst target price of $233.16/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting MCHP to reach a target price of $106.60/share, which is 16.03% above the recent price of $91.87. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of HAS, FB, and MCHP:  

   Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:

Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

espite concerns that problematic inventory levels as well as flaring trade tensions would weigh down the semiconductor industry, the sector has still been able to grow with the VanEck Semiconductor ETF up 40% year-to-date. Adding to the good news for investors, one of the best-performing analysts believes that several catalysts could drive even more gains for semiconductor stocks.“Our prevailing takeaway is that the multi-quarter inventory correction, which started in earnest in July 2018, is largely over and inventory levels have bottomed. Despite the near-term macroeconomic volatility, we believe there will be a number of catalysts in 2020 that will have a positive impact the semiconductor industry,” Needham’s  wrote in a note to clients on September 11.Bearing this in mind, we used the TipRanks  tool to take a closer look at how a few of the stocks in this space stack up against each other. Our comparison was based not only on yearly gain, but also analyst consensus and average analyst price target.Here’s what we found out.  Despite widespread volatility throughout the semiconductor space, shares of memory chip provider Micron (- ) have climbed 59% year-to-date, the highest out of the stocks on the list. Based on the improved outlook for the sector, even more gains could be on the way.According to Gill, the primary catalyst expected to drive growth for MU is an improvement in the memory cycle. Recently, MU experienced issues related to weaker DRAM and NAND demand and pricing as a result of higher inventories. DRAM, dynamic random-access memory, is used in desktop computers and servers, while NAND is flash memory that’s typically found in smartphones and solid-state hard drives.It should be noted that Needham’s research suggests that while NAND and DRAM supply levels remain higher than normal, the memory cycle is improving. Additionally, while price declines are slowing down, the deceleration hasn’t bottomed out with a normal supply and demand balance mostly likely expected through the first half of 2020. That being said, investors can expect a turnaround in 2020 thanks to several demand catalysts such as normalized hyperscaler spending, specifically at Microsoft () and Amazon Web Services (), with the most notable driver being 5G.5G smartphones represent a major upgrade cycle in 2020. According to Gill, the amount of 5G smartphones could reach 120 million to 140 million units at the mid-point in 2020. With every original equipment manufacturer (OEM) looking to get in on the trend, 5G creates several growth opportunities for MU.   While some investors have expressed concerns regarding MU’s dependence on Huawei, Gill believes MU has “de-risked” its exposure going into Q3. As a result of all of the above factors, the five-star analyst kept his Buy rating and $50 price target.All in all, the Street takes a cautiously optimistic stance on MU. With 14 Buy ratings vs 5 Holds and 2 Sells assigned in the last three months, MU is a ‘Moderate Buy’. It has an average price target of $51, suggesting 0.04% upside. The low upside potential makes sense given the fact that share prices have soared year-to-date.  Skyworks (- ) designs semiconductors for cellular infrastructure as well as for radio frequency applications. With shares already up 23% year-to-date, Gill has high hopes for SWKS thanks to 5G.Similar to MU, Skyworks is expected to get a significant boost in 2020 with the 5G smartphone rollout. The fact that the minimum requirement for every 5G phone is 6GB of DRAM bodes well for the company. However, Gill points out that 5G infrastructure could be an even bigger driver of growth.In order to make 5G a reality, mobile broad brand will need to be upgraded in order to enable higher data transmissions for portable devices. Networks also require very low latency as well as smart manufacturing.Telecommunication providers have ramped up efforts to get ready for 5G, with this especially apparent in China. In 2019, three major Chinese mobile operators increased their year-end base station deployments. Adding to the good news, 5G licenses were approved in June, earlier than previously expected. As a result, China bumped up its 5G base station deployments for 2020, with its overall target now at 500,000.“As operators are aggressively expanding the power supplies to meet requirements (5x increase in MOSFET usage in 5G radios and the expected 3-5x increase in the number of 5G base stations compared to those in 4G), SWKS stands to reap the benefits,” Gill noted. He adds that investors should take comfort in that fact that the company has also reduced its Huawei exposure. As a result, the Needham analyst maintained his Buy rating and $95 price target. He tells investors that SWKS could see a 16% gain in the next twelve months.The word on the Street is more mixed. 6 Buy ratings and 7 Holds received in the last three months add up to a ‘Moderate Buy’ analyst consensus. Its $87 average price target indicates 6% upside potential.The last semiconductor stock on our list develops chips for many applications including displays, computing, wireless connectivity as well as several others. Despite being the target of recent negative media attention, Microchip (- ) could see its 32% year-to-date gain surge even more.Investors were not happy to learn on September 3 that the company maintained its lackluster guidance for second quarter fiscal 2020. Management stated that as a result of the U.S.-China trade war, it expects to see quarterly revenue fall between $1.323 billion and $1.375 billion. This was incredibly disappointing as it represents zero to 4% growth.That being said, Gill believes a turnaround could be on the way as shares are trading at a multi-year P/E discount based on its computer vision products and advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS). The organic light-emitting diode (OLED) market could see a major investment cycle in the next two to three years. While OLED does cost about 5% to 10% more than LCD displays and takes slightly longer to manufacture, these costs are expected to narrow very soon.The flexibility of OLED displays makes the technology especially useful in touch IC applications. Based on this, Gill believes OLED will take over the industry which is good news for MCHP. “We think OLED will account for over 50% of the smartphone market. Our conversations point to rapid OLED adoption at the major OEMs and expanding OLED formats (flexible, rigid and foldable) across the high-end and mid-range portfolio,” he explained.As a result, Gill maintained his Buy rating and $100 price target on MCHP. He is confident that shares have the potential to gain 5% in the next twelve months.The rest of Wall Street mirrors the analyst’s sentiment. MCHP boasts a ‘Strong Buy’ analyst consensus as well as a $108 average price target, suggesting 14% upside potential, beating out both MU and SWKS in terms of each of these factors.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Buy These 3 Semiconductor Stocks on Positive 2020 Catalysts@2019-09-16@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/buy-these-3-semiconductor-stocks-on-positive-2020-catalysts-2019-09-16
"As we , the best place to find dividend stocks could the tech sector. Need an example? Just take a look at  (NASDAQ:) recent wins on the shareholder rewards front. MSFT just announced that it plans on increasing its payout by 11% and is conducting a whopping $40 billion buyback program.When you add this huge increase to its payout, Microsoft quickly becomes one of the best dividend stocks ever. In fact, MSFT raises its quarterly dividend every year since it began paying one in 2004. And MSFT isn’t alone when it comes to tech-sector dividend stocks.Like Mr. Softy, there are countless others that have become cash flow and profit machines. With service revenues driving the show, margins in the sector have never been higher. This has only filled tech stocks coffers to the brim. With so much cash now overflowing their balance sheets, they can’t help but return it. In turn, the sector has become fertile ground for finding dividend stocks. And while initial  or consumer staples names, the sector can’t be beaten when it comes to dividend growth. MSFT’s big quarterly jump is a testament to that.Which tech stocks are rewarding their shareholders just like Microsoft? Here are five dividend stocks to consider in the sector.: 1.62%   You may not realize it, but your coffee pot and the most complex supercomputer do have something in common with each other. They both are able to operate courtesy of semiconductors. Given that the modern world runs on this important backbone, the semiconductor sector has long been a great place to comb for tech dividend stocks. And one of the best and earliest payers in the sector could be  (NASDAQ:).MCHP produces what are known as analog and microcontroller semiconductors. Truth be told, there’s nothing too special about analog chips. But if it wasn’t for these boring chips, modern society wouldn’t function. But boring is beautiful when it comes to dividends and cash flows.As the world continues to modernize and lean on technology, demand for analog chips of all kinds have grown. That has benefited Microchip’s bottom line in a big way. Year-over-year sales clocked in 9.1% higher last quarter and over the longer term, MCHP has . That’s pretty much unheard of in the semiconductor sector which tends to have wild swings in profits and losses.That sort of consistency has made MCHP a dividend stalwart among tech stocks. Since its initial payout in 2002, Microchip has managed to More could be in store for investors as well. Thanks to some smart acquisitions, MCHP has started to pivot into more advanced semiconductors. Chips like automotive power units, battery and green technologies and networking semis all come with bigger margins. These could help boost its 1.62% yield much further.: 2.72%   A few years ago,  (NASDAQ:) was knocking on heaven’s door. Not really, but that was the perception. Thanks to the rise of smartphones, (NASDAQ:, NASDAQ:) Google Maps and other GPS applications, GRMN’s perceived main bread-and-butter in automotive navigation was dying a quick death. However, the reality is that GRMN is much more than a GPS.The firm makes a host of marine and aviation GPS navigation equipment that is the standard for many end-users. This includes consumers and industrial applications. Meanwhile, its line of wearable devices has also become one of the standard brands for serious athletes and runners. The truth is, Garmin continues to succeed in these other markets — with the proof in the pudding. With revenues jumping 7% overall and aviation, marine, fitness and outdoor sales growing by 12% last quarter, management at GRMN have been able to raise its .The best part is that profits at Garmin continue to jump as these divisions come with higher profit margins. A recent pivot to include more services and reoccurring revenues hasn’t hurt either.This has allowed Garmin to generate plenty of free cash flows. After holding onto that extra cash for a bit in order to reinvest and overcome its auto woes, GRMN is back on the . It never actually cut its payout, it just held it steady for a bit. With a 2.72% yield and new product launches coming down the line, GRMN stock makes a compelling stock for dividend seekers.: 1.70%   Because it’s excluded from many international indexes, most ignore our neighbors in the Great White North. But Canada has long been a great place to find technology firms and dividend stocks. Take (NASDAQ:), for example.The firm has been around for more than a decade and provides enterprise information management software and solutions. Basically, it’s digging into a firm’s data and coming up with insights into that information. Companies can use this in a variety of ways to make decisions, design new products, cut costs, etc.The win is that OTEX’s platform is able to mine all varieties of data together — from HR and CRM to security and supply chain metrics. And thanks to the birth of cloud computing, OTEX’s services continue to be in hot demand.The firm counts more than 74,000 customers — both big and small. And those customers continue to drive new revenues into OpenText’s coffers. Overall sales jumped by 3.8% last quarter. The real star was cloud computing revenues, gaining 10.2%. OTEX itself has started to offer plenty of cloud solutions for its own products. Because of this and the popularity of its products, What all of this has done is make OTEX stock a cash flow and dividend machine.

	Talk about a transition. Looking at  (NASDAQ:) history of buyouts, spin-offs, and mergers is enough to make your head spin. This continues with its last two major deals: its acquisition of CA Technologies and its recent buyout proposal of security firm  (NASDAQ:).But the focus is the same and that’s “connecting everything.” Today, AVGO is a provider of both semiconductors and infrastructure software products. Its collection of products puts it right in the crosshairs of some big trends — this includes data center networking, home connectivity, smartphones, factory automation, broadband access, you name it.

"Investors' focus has locked in on semiconductor stocks following news of a potential ""phase one"" trade deal between the U.S. and China. Many chipmakers do production work in China and/or distribute products to Chinese companies, so the industry has suffered a nasty case of whiplash throughout the two or so years of the two countries' tariff spat.The upside is that the volatility still is coming out on their side. The iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF () has soared nearly 40% year-to-date, doubling the already better-than-average returns for the S&P 500. While trade enthusiasm has helped, the industry also is recovering from inflated inventory levels that have weighed heavily on the space.SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst William Stein wrote in October, ""Looking through any tactical correction (due to tariffs), the big move is still to the upside. We believe patient investors will be rewarded for being long semis."" And Goldman Sachs' Toshiya Hari wrote in July that chipmaking equipment companies' fundamentals could improve ""sooner than previously expected.""Here are five semiconductor stocks to buy to take advantage of an improving outlook for the industry. We took advantage of TipRanks'  tool to pinpoint five chip stocks that have recently accumulated bullish sentiment from Wall Street analysts. Let's take a look.
Market value: $22.9 billionTipRanks consensus price target: $108.11 (13% upside potential)TipRanks consensus rating: Microchip Technology (, $96.08) is a semiconductor company that manufacturer of microcontrollers, analog chips and other products. These products are used to power everything from home appliances to medical devices to space travel.MCHP recently got a shot in the arm thanks to an Oct. 1 vote of confidence from KeyBanc's Weston Twigg. The analyst believes the demand-and-inventory issues that bogged semiconductor stocks down last year are subsiding for a few companies, namely MCHP. ""We were encouraged to find inventories beginning to normalize and expectations for normal seasonality in 4Q,"" he writes.Twigg upgraded Microchip from Sector Weight (equivalent of Hold) to Overweight (equivalent of Buy) and set a $110 price target, implying 14% upside over the next 12 months.Twigg isn't alone. Over the past three months, Microchip has received eight Buy ratings versus just one Hold. Among the Buys is B. Riley FBR's Craig Ellis, who highlighted Microchip's ability to manage inventory levels. ""MCHP was characteristically early in flagging a correction in August 2018 and then responding with assertive inventory management thereafter."" Ellis has a Buy rating and a $120 price target on Microchip shares, implying 25% upside. .
Market value: $7.8 billionTipRanks consensus price target: $23.46 (24% upside potential)TipRanks consensus rating: ON Semiconductor (, $18.97) produces a wide variety of custom, discrete and logic semiconductors across several continents. It gets about a third of its revenues from automotive clients, though its products are used in a variety of industries, from communications to computers to aerospace and defense.ON shares are up 17% year-to-date, which is only a little behind the market but significantly behind the SOXX. Nonetheless, its positioning in the ""fastest growing semiconductor end-markets,"" as CFO Bernard Gutmann said in the most recent , has several Wall Street analysts keeping ON among their top semiconductor stocks to buy.Benchmark's Ruben Roy is among the analysts singing ON's praises. ""Many of ON's focus market design wins are single-sourced as opposed to being multi-sourced in the computing and consumer markets, which ultimately should lead to more stability in top-line performance,"" he writes. Roy, who also expects the company's shift toward higher-end markets to drive margin improvements, rates ON a Buy with a $26 price target (37% upside).Raymond James analyst Chris Caso is optimistic, too. While he points out that the company is exposed to trade war and macro-economic threats, he believes investors should buy the stock for its ""reasonable"" valuation. He raised ON from Market Perform (equivalent of Hold) to Strong Buy and set a $21 price target, implying another 11% upside potential from current prices. .
Market value: $40.9 billionTipRanks consensus price target: $123.43 (12% upside potential)TipRanks consensus rating: Analog Devices (, $110.59) is another analog producer that also offers mixed-signal and DSP integrated circuits. Shares are up 29% year-to-date, and analysts see further upside in part because of the promise of its multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology.MIMO, and ""massive MIMO,"" use groups of antennas to allow devices to transmit more data, making wireless spectrum more efficient. Among other things, telecoms see massive MIMO as important to unlocking the true potential of the 5G technology they're rolling out.According to Barclays' Blayne Curtis, the massive MIMO and millimeter wave (mmWave) silicon market could double to $6 billion by 2022. He believes Analog Devices is best positioned to benefit from this emerging space, calling ADI the ""clearest winner in Massive MIMO."" Curtis upgraded ADI to Overweight in September and lifted his price target from $105 to $130, which is 18% better than current prices.Loop Capital analyst Cody Acree (Buy) delivered a smaller price-target update, from $120 per share to $125, in September. He believes 2020 will be a ""stronger environment"" for semiconductor stocks, and that Analog Devices will get a boost from its hyper-scale datacenter products. He also thinks the inventory correction will help out ADI's industrial business, which makes up about half of sales. .
Market value: $33.9 billionTipRanks consensus price target: $33.29 (8% upside potential)TipRanks consensus rating: Advanced Micro Devices (, $30.81) is a semiconductor company that develops graphic processors, motherboards and microprocessors. But it has really made a name for itself in recent years with its Ryzen CPU that has given  Intel () a run for its money.In fact, AMD recently scored another win against its larger rival: Microsoft's () new Surface Laptop 3 and Surface Pro X will be powered not by Intel, but by AMD Ryzen processors.To be clear, analysts aren't gushing about AMD at the moment. The ""smart money's"" sentiment is more bullish than it isn't - it has 8 Buys versus 1 Sell over the past three months - but 12 analysts are sitting on the sidelines, maintaining Hold ratings as they wait for more clarity.Still, Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann argues that the Microsoft collaboration is an impressive victory for AMD. ""Huge win for AMD with a semi custom APU with integrated graphics (aka APUs) for the new Microsoft device (first time at 15-inch),"" he writes, adding, ""This is just the beginning of the relationship with AMD, as next year AMD rolls out even higher performance 7nm CPUs and APUs.""""Note that the street is reluctant to believe Intel would allow AMD to take leadership in desktops, much less laptops or servers,"" continues Mosesmann, who reiterated a Buy rating and $42 price target, or 36% upside. ""This is a multi-year AMD cycle.""Nomura's David Wong sees more upside on top of AMD's 67% year-to-date run, too. Wong reiterated his Buy rating Oct. 1, shortly after the company announced the availability of a pair of professional desktop processors built on its groundbreaking 7-nanometer technology. That follows its launch of the first 7nm CPU, the Epyc Rome, in August.""We think that AMD is doing an excellent job of executing on its 7nm product roadmap and that this lineup of new products will help it continue to drive desktop processor market share gains in the coming quarters,"" writes Wong, who reiterated a Buy rating and $37 price target (20% upside).

Market value: $118.3 billionTipRanks consensus price target: $191.59 (1% downside potential)TipRanks consensus rating: Nvidia (, $194.21) actually rates among many analysts' top semiconductor stocks to buy, despite its price target implying a small amount of downside from current prices. NVDA has garnered 20 Buys versus just five Holds and two Sells over the past three months. Nvidia's shares have shot up a quick 16% over the past three months, however,  reaching those price targets more quickly than some analysts expected.What's important to watch out for next is whether analysts start upgrading those price targets in response.According to Evercore ISI analyst C.J. Muse, investors should also pay close attention to the growing demand for gaming notebooks that feature Nvidia's GPUs. Muse said earlier this month that Nvidia could start enjoying a boost  this year that continues will into 2020. He believes the company's Gaming division could experience at least 15% annual growth through 2022 - and that's before considering business wins for its cloud gaming products. Muse has an Outperform rating (equivalent of Buy) on the stock, but more importantly, he raised his price target from $185, which NVDA has surpassed, to $225, which adds another 16% upside.RBC Capital's Mitch Steves is on the same page, predicting in October that Nvidia will be the ""best-performing large cap in our universe over the next six to nine months"" thanks to its datacenter, gaming and auto segments. Indeed, Steves thinks the datacenter business could double in the near term. He also bumped up his price target from $190 to $217 (12% upside). .Maya Sasson is a content writer at TipRanks, a comprehensive investing tool that tracks more than 5,000 Wall Street analysts as well as hedge funds and insiders.

 (NASDAQ: TXN) stock has risen from about $69 in August 2016 to around $120 in August 2019. The rise was primarily driven by a steady growth in revenues and net income margins, accompanied by a drop in shares outstanding, and a slightly higher P/E multiple. We expect growth to stagnate in 2019, due to lower consumer electronics demand and trade tensions. However, the advent of 5G could help somewhat offset this cooling demand.

re you ready for another round of earnings reports? We’re looking at three Strong Buy stocks which are reporting on Tuesday, and investors should be excited. The Q3 earnings season has been better than was anticipated, with 60% of S&P listed companies beating forecasts on revenues, and 74% beating on EPS. It’s a good end to a rough summer in the markets.We found these top stocks through TipRanks’ , by setting the filters to sort for ‘strong buy’ ratings, any upside, and dividend payouts. The results are stocks that investors can expect to show solid returns in the coming months.Based in Texas, Diamondback Energy engages in ‘hydrocarbon exploration,’ or to put it layman’s terms, oil drilling. Diamondback operates in the Permian Basin, of the richest oil regions in Texas and a driver of the fracking boom in the oil and gas industry that has bumped the US to the #1 spot as the world’s largest oil producer. The company is a mid-size player in the industry, with a market-cap of $14 billion, annual revenues exceeding $2.18 billion, and net profits in the range of $940 million – based on a daily production greater than 130,000 barrels of oil equivalent.A product that the modern world cannot do without, along with smart management, has kept FANG profitable despite a 6% drop in share value this year. The company makes up for the lack of share appreciation with a modest dividend of 0.8% yield, or roughly half the sector average. The quarterly payout is 4.75 cents per share.Looking ahead, the markets expect to see FANG report an earnings increase year-over-year, along with higher quarterly revenues Diamondback’s EPS has been rising steadily since Q1 of this year, although the company did miss the forecast last quarter by 2%. In the last eight quarters, Diamondback has beaten the earnings forecasts five times.Putting this into raw numbers, analysts expect FANG to show $1.73 in the Q3 report, based on $1.05 billion in revenues. This represents an earnings beat of 3.6%, and a revenue beat of an impressive 95.3%.Speaking of analysts, Roth Capital’s  sees reason for optimism in FANG’s low debt load. As he points out, the company operates with low leverage, allowing it to focus on drilling activities and production. White writes, “Our rationale is that FANG does not receive proper credit for its lower leverage… In our view FANG is one of the premier Permian focused companies as it has displayed through its strong record of successful drilling and completion results over a multi-year period and capital return initiatives.”White rates FANG a Buy along with $147 price target, which implies an upside potential of about 60% for the stock. (To watch White's track record, ), of JPMorgan, is also bullish on this oil producer. He points out the company’s expanding oil drilling activity, high free cash flow, and acquisitions of new drilling exploration areas. In a report dated October 9, Glick writes, “Diamondback is uniquely positioned in that it should have the highest growth rate among peers while delivering industry leading returns. We model the company growing oil ~16% in 2020Ey/y at a ~5.9% post-dividend FCF yield, and free cash flow continues to expand, particularly in the out-years. Late 2018 acquisitions doubled the size of the company…” Like White, Glick sets a high price target on this stock: $139, suggesting an upside of 60%.All in all, FANG’s Strong Buy consensus rating is unanimous – 15 analysts have given this stock an up-check. The average price target is $138, which indicates a 53% upside from the share price of $86. ()Even at $5.35 billion in annual revenues, Microchip is considered a second-tier player in the semiconductor chip industry. The top-ten companies all exceed $12 billion annual revenues; add in the next five, and annual revenues are still above $8 billion. But just because it’s smaller than the competition doesn’t mean MCHP isn’t high-end; the company is a leader in its segment, producing microcontrollers, mixed-signal, and Flash-IP integrated circuits, among other products. Based in Arizona, the Microchip has three wafer fabrication facilities in the Western US, and assembly/test facilities in Thailand and the Philippines.The company will report earnings for Q2 fiscal 2020 tomorrow. Microchip is still feeling the effects of the 2H18 slowdown, and analysts expect that the company’s results will show significant declines from one year ago. Conventional wisdom says the company will report $1.43 EPS based on quarterly revenues of $1.35 billion. This is a 21% earnings decline and a 10% revenue drop. On the positive side, just meeting the expectation will mean a 14% EPS sequential gain – and MCHP has a history of beating the earnings forecasts, having done so in 7 of the last 8 quarters.So, Microchip is well positioned in its industry, occupying a solid position in a clear niche. This, plus the company’s proven track record of product success has B. Riley’s 5-star analyst  reiterating his Buy rating along with a $120 price target. (To watch Ellis' track record, )The analyst says of the stock, “We expect another quarter of robust execution validate our thesis. We believe the company’s operational excellence will become even more visible when macro pressures subside, or at a minimum when channel inventory reduction pressure eases from acute to a more neutral factor, as we believe is starting to happen.”Wall Street is on the same page. This ‘Strong Buy’ stock received 8 Buy ratings vs 1 Hold over the last three months. Its $108 average price target suggests about 8% upside potential from current levels. () The last stock on our list today is FIS, Fidelity National Information Services. This Florida-based company is a major provider of technology and outsourcing to the financial services industry. FIS brings in over $12 billion in annual revenue, and realized more than $825 million annual net income. The company has strongly outperformed the broader markets this year, gaining over 30% in so far in calendar 2019.The fintech sector is a known money-maker, and FIS is widely expected to report a year-over-year gain for Q3. Analysts are forecasting an EPS of $1.35, or 1.5% higher than one year ago. Revenues are also expected to show a yearly gain, of 34%. Market watchers expect the company to report $2.8 billion in revenues for the quarter. Over the last month, analysts have increased their EPS forecast by a modest 0.11%; this is taken a signal that the company is likely to meet expectations.Major research firms – and some 5-star analysts – are showing FIS some love in the lead-up to the earnings release. Writing from Canaccord,  sets a $150 price target on the stock, writing of the stock’s near- to mid-term prospects, “We think the new FIS, fueled by material cost and revenue synergies… can achieve enough accretion to drive earnings growth towards twenty percent in a couple of years… realistic synergies could drive mid-teens EPS growth in 2021 and 2022; but we believe a more optimistic scenario is achievable, driving EPS growth closer to 20%. Of course, strong cash flow conversion here could also drive additional shareholder initiatives, in boosted buybacks and dividends.” Vafi’s price target suggests an upside of 12.5%. (To watch Vafi's track record, )Wolfe Research analyst  is also optimistic about FIS’ profit outlook. He writes, “The company sales/backlog up >30%/7% in 2Q and WP/VNTV’s cross-sell wins now totaling 56 should enable a continuation of its organic growth story.” He added, “…we model organic, constant currency growth of 5.5%. That said, we see our estimate as conservative given 2Q’s pro-forma growth of nearly 6%...” Like Vafi, Peller gives FIS a $150 price target.FIS has built its Strong Buy consensus rating on solid performance which has attracted 14 buys in the last three months, as opposed to only 4 holds. This stock is selling for $133, so the $152 average  implies an upside of 16%.

"Image source: The Motley Fool. Q1 2020 , Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Microchip's first-quarter fiscal 2020 financial results conference call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Microchip's chief financial officer, Mr. Eric Bjornholt.Please go ahead, sir. -- Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of the day, as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's chairman and CEO; and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's president and COO. I will comment on our first-quarter fiscal year 2020 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment, as well as our guidance and provide an update on our ongoing integration activities associated with the Microsemi acquisition. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. We are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, , has quadrupled the market.* David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Microchip Technology wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the investor relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing our GAAP and non-GAAP results. We have also posted a summary of our outstanding debt and leverage metrics on our website, and I understand that those schedules aren't showing up right away, but we should have that issue corrected very shortly here for all of you. I want to remind investors that during the June quarter of 2018, we adopted the new GAAP revenue recognition standard, which requires revenue to be recognized at the time products are sold to distributors versus our historical revenue recognition policy, where revenue on such transactions was deferred until the product was sold by our distributor to an end customer. As discussed in previous earnings conference calls, we continue to track and measure our performance internally based on direct revenue plus distribution sell-through activity, and each quarter, we override a metric for this called end market demand in our earnings release.Therefore, along with our GAAP and non-GAAP results based on distribution sell-in, we will also provide investors with our end market demand based on distribution sellout, but will not provide a P&L based on end market demand. End market demand in the June 2019 quarter was 1.35 billion, which was up 0.7% sequentially from the March 2019 quarter. End market demand was about $27 million more than our GAAP revenue in the June quarter. I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses.I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis, which is based on expenses, priority effects of our acquisition activities, share-based compensation and certain other adjustments as described in our press release. Net sales in the June quarter were 1.323 billion, which was down 0.5% sequentially and slightly below the midpoint of our guidance of 1.33 billion. I'll remind you that our guidance for the quarter was made prior to the ban on shipments to Huawei, which has historically been between a 1% and 2% revenue customer for us. We have posted a summary of our GAAP net sales and end market demand by product line and geography on our website for your reference.On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 62%, operating expenses were 25.8% of sales, and operating income was 36.2% of sales. Non-GAAP net income was 357.6 million. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $1.41, which was $0.035 above the midpoint of our guidance of $1.375. On a GAAP basis, gross margins were 61.6% and include the impact of 4.9 million of share-based compensation.Total operating expenses were 643.6 million and include acquisition intangible amortization of 248.5 million, special charges of 8.1 million, 9.6 million of acquisition-related, and other cost and share-based compensation of 35.8 million. The GAAP net income was 50.7 million or $0.20 per diluted share. Our June quarter GAAP tax benefit included 12.6 million of discrete income tax benefits primarily related to a tax reserve release due to a statute of limitation expiring. The non-GAAP cash tax rate was 5.5% in the June quarter.We expect our non-GAAP cash tax rate for fiscal '20 to be between 5% and 6%, exclusive of the transition tax, any potential tax associated with restructuring the Microsemi operations into the Microchip global structure and any tax audit settlements related to taxes accrued in prior fiscal years. We have many tax attributes and net operating losses and tax credits, as well as U.S. interest deductions that will -- that we believe will keep our cash tax payments low. The future cash tax payments associated with the transition tax is expected to be about $246 million and will be paid over seven years, with 10 million of that being paid this quarter.We have posted a schedule of our projected transition tax payments on the investor relations page of our website. Our inventory balance at June 30th 2019 was 733.1 million. We had 132 days of inventory at the end of June, up four days from the prior quarter's level. Inventory at our distributors in the June quarter were up 32 days, compared to 35 days at the end of March.We believe that barring any negative developments on the U.S.-China trade front, our distributors are holding a reasonable albeit lower-than-normal level of inventory to support end market demand. The cash flow from operating activities was 380.6 million in the June quarter. As of June 30th, the consolidated cash and total investment position was 437.1 million. We paid down $257.5 million of total debt in the June quarter, and the net debt on the balance sheet was reduced by 263.7 million.Our EBITDA in the June quarter was 537.1 million, and our trailing 12-month EBITDA was 2.212 billion. Our net debt-to-EBITDA, excluding our very long-dated convertible debt that matures in 2037 and is more equity-like in nature, was 4.65 at June 30, 2019. We are committed to using substantially all of our excess cash generation beyond our dividend payments to reduce our debt levels, and we expect our debt levels to reduce significantly over the next several years. Our dividend payment in the June quarter was 87.1 million.Capital expenditures were 23.9 million in the June quarter. We expect about 30 million in capital spending in the September quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal 2020 to be between 110 and $130 million. We continue to add capital to support the growth of our production capabilities of our new products and technologies and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. We expect these capital investments will bring some gross margin improvement to our business, particularly for the outsourced Atmel and Microsemi manufacturing activities that we are bringing into our own factories.Depreciation expense in the June quarter was 46.2 million. I will now turn it over to Ganesh to give us comments on the performance of the business in the June quarter and provide an update on some of our ongoing Microsemi integration activities. Ganesh?  -- Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I get started, I'd like to clarify that the product line comparisons I will be sharing with you today are based on end market demand, which is how Microchip measures its performance internally. Also, with the start of a new fiscal year and a full year of Microsemi results under our belt, we are making an adjustment to our product line reporting for our conference calls. We will continue to provide product line reporting for microcontrollers, analog and FPGA, which make up almost 90% of our revenue.We will report licensing, memory and MMO, or multimarket and other, as a fourth category called LMO, which stands for licensing memory and other, which is about 10% of our revenue. Let's start by taking a closer look at microcontrollers. Our microcontroller business was sequentially up 1.8% compared to the March quarter, reflecting some strength in what otherwise continues to be broad macro weakness in the markets we serve. During the quarter, we shipped our 25 billionth microcontroller, a milestone in our rich heritage as a microcontroller solutions provider.We also continue to introduce a steady stream of innovative new microcontrollers, including several new touchscreen microcontrollers with industry-leading noise immunity, with screen sizes of nine to 20 inches, the industry's first commercially available enhanced serial peripheral interface known as E-spy, to low pin count known as LPC bridge product for industrial computers, the addition of a single port solution to our USB smart hub family target at entry-level automotive applications and last but not least, we unveiled our Meta DX1 family of ethernet devices, the industry's first terabit-scale ethernet device that enables high-density 400-gigabit ethernet and flexible rate ethernet connectivity. Microcontrollers represented 53.8% of our end market demand in the June quarter. Now moving to analog. Our analog business was sequentially down 0.7% compared to the March quarter, reflecting the broad macro weakness Microchip and others in the industry are experiencing.During the quarter, we continued to introduce a steady stream of innovative analog products, including the production release of our 700-volt silicon carbide MOSFETs, as well as our 700-volt and 1200-volt silicon carbide Schottky Barrier Diodes, high-precision 16-bit and 24-bit analog-to-digital converters, an IEEE 802.3-compliant power over ethernet switch and the industry's first clock buffers that meet PCIe Generation 4 and Generation 5 specifications. Analog represented 28.5% of our end market demand in the June quarter. Our FPGA end market demand reached an all-time record even after going back through the Microsemi and Actel history, with 7% sequential growth compared to the March quarter coming in at almost $101 million. The FPGA business does have some lumpiness because of our significant exposure to space, aviation and defense markets, where procurement timing can be a function of programs and their shifting priorities schedules and budgets.Designments on our new low-power mid-range PolarFire family continue to grow strongly, and we remain optimistic about this product family adding another leg of growth for the future. FPGA represented 7.5% of our end market demand in the June quarter. Our licensing, memory and other product line, which we refer to as LMO, was sequentially down 4.9% in the June quarter as compared to the March quarter, reflecting the broad macro weakness that Microchip and others in the industry are experiencing. Collectively, LMO represented 10.2% of our end market demand.A quick update about the ongoing Microsemi integration. Business units and sales have substantially completed their integration activity. We are pleased with the synergies we have achieved since we closed the transaction despite the weaker macro environment over the last four quarters. As we said before, business systems and operations integration will take the longest time to complete as we execute this transition in phases.We expect the overall business and operational integration will take about another 12 months to complete, and we expect continued synergy gains for many quarters to come. Finally, a short update about the Huawei situation from our perspective. We estimated that our exposure to Huawei to be approximately 1% to 2% of our end market demand. Our revenue with Huawei is a combination of what we ship to them directly, as well as what we ship indirectly to their subcontractors and in some cases, through distributors.We stopped all shipments of Huawei when the Department of Commerce issued an Export Administration Regulation, or EAR, in May. About a month after that, based on further analysis of the EAR, we began allowing shipments of Huawei for several products that were permissible to ship under the EAR. However, the benefit for the June quarter was limited as Huawei, in many cases, did not want the product since they could not complete their bill of materials. There remains continued uncertainty as to whether Huawei will want all that we can ship this quarter as they may or may not be able to complete their bill of materials.Let me now pass it to Steve for some comments about our business and our guidance going forward. Steve? -- Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to first reflect on the results of the fiscal first quarter of 2020. I will then provide guidance for the fiscal second quarter of 2020. Before I analyze our June quarter results, I want to remind everyone that our guidance for June quarter was provided before the ban on shipments to Huawei was announced.The midpoint of our guidance was flat sequentially. Huawei is approximately 1% to 2% of our revenue and about half the quarter was impacted. Our June quarter GAAP net sales based on sell-in revenue recognition was down 0.5% sequentially, and without the Huawei ban, it would have been slightly positive. Our end market demand based on sell-through was 0.7% up sequentially and will have been higher without the Huawei ban.The end market demand was stronger than sell-in revenue, which is consistent with the thesis that the channel is continuing to manage their working capital conservatively by reducing inventory due to uncertainty. As we stated on our February conference call, our review that the March quarter would mark the bottom for this cycle based on end market demand is proving to be correct. This statement is also proving to be correct for GAAP revenue after excluding the impact of the Huawei ban. So given very difficult and uncertain market conditions, we are pleased with the net sales result that we have delivered.Our consolidated non-GAAP gross margin at 62% was right at the midpoint of our guidance. Our consolidated non-GAAP operating margin of 36.2% also was at the midpoint of our guidance. The integration of Microsemi continues to proceed very nicely. Since the closing of the acquisition, we are continuing to see strong synergies and improvements in gross and operating margins for Microsemi products.Our consolidated non-GAAP EPS was $1.41 and exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by $0.035 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, this was also our 115th consecutive profitable quarter, a tribute to the employees of Microchip, including employees from all of our acquisitions for their contribution to our success. In the June quarter, we paid down $257.5 million of our debt. Our total debt payment since the end of June 2018 has been $1.414 billion.The pace of debt payments has been strong despite the weak and uncertain business conditions that we have experienced. With some of the inventory correction quarters rolling off from four-quarter rolling calculations, we're optimistic that the peak of our debt-to-EBITDA leverage is behind us and we should see meaningful continuing reduction in leverage in future periods. Now I will provide you guidance for the September quarter. While the uncertainty began with U.S.-China trade friction, the uncertainty has become global.Europe was the weakest geography for us during the June quarter. Our customers and distributors are blaming the weak business conditions in Europe, to the effect of very weak exports to China, as well as uncertainty due to Brexit. The largest economy in Europe, Germany, is near recessionary levels with auto production down significantly. Our China business was actually up, recovering from the Chinese New Year with more shipping days as we expected.While there is this continued uncertainty in Europe, as well as in U.S.-China trade relations, given the multi-quarter inventory correction we have seen at the distributors' end customers, we expect net sales for our products in the September quarter to be between flat to up 4% sequentially. We expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 61.8% and 62.2% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 25.3% and 26.3% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating profit percentage to be between 35.5% and 36.9% of sales.And we expect our non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $1.37 to $1.49 per share. Given all the complications of accounting for acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory write-up on acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on a non-GAAP basis, except for net sales, which will be on a GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide for more meaningful comparison to prior quarters and we request that the analysts continue to report their non-GAAP estimates to first call. With this, operator, will you please poll for questions?[Operator instructions] And we'll now take a question from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. -- Great, thank you. Steve, thanks for the color by geography. As you look into the September quarter. Do you expect similar trends in terms of the recent stabilization in China, Europe weak, and any thoughts on just North America, how that's holding up into September? -- So I think it should be reasonably similar. The September quarter is usually a good quarter in Asia, and that should continue in Asia and China. But Europe should continue to be the weakest geography, and America is sort of normal. -- Got it, thank you.We'll now take a question with Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. -- Thanks for taking my question. So Steve, over the last few quarters, we have seen distributors reduce inventory, I think in the last two quarters, that were on 36 days, to 35, now 32 days. Is this kind of the bottom? And can you give us some historical context that outside of, say, the financial crisis, what's the lowest that the distributors have gone to in terms of holding inventory? -- OK. So this is Eric Bjornholt. So I mean, if you look at the last 10 years, our distribution inventory days have ranged between 27 and 47. At 32 days, that's the lowest that we've definitely seen in several years, and we don't really think that it's going to go much lower than this.So I think it's probably relatively stable here, but our distributors are definitely managing their working capital requirements given the uncertainty of the environment. Last quarter, we had made similar commentary that we didn't think it would go much lower and it went down by about three days. But we think this is likely the bottom, but could it fluctuate by a day or two in either direction, that's definitely possible. -- Thank you.We'll now take a question from Harsh Kumar with Piper Jaffray. -- Hey, guys. A quick question, Steve. It seems like you sound a little bit more bullish than you have in the past three or four calls. Curious if you can share specifics.You talked a little bit about specifics and maybe what you're seeing within China that might give you some optimism or why you might have been up. Any color on product segments? And you think we can go back to normal growth from here, including seasonality, or we're going to kind of chug along the bottom a little bit? -- Well, Harsh, it's always the same saga in every cycle. We usually see the cycles coming ahead of everybody else and you sort of see it ending ahead of everybody else, and we get a large amount of disbelief from the audience on both sides of the cycle. So we have -- we first experienced the downcycle starting in about July, August last year. So we've been in it for a year and have been reducing inventory in distribution, in channel, in major OEM customers and inside.And after a multi-quarter inventory correction, we are actually seeing the backlog is up from prior quarter and we are seeing some strength coming back. So that's really kind of what I'm reflecting while you're hearing some of the other people in the industry talking about multi-quarter inventory correction ahead of them because they either went into it much later or they continued to, sort of, I would say, based on selling revenue recognition, continue to have strong shipments into the channel, which we did not do. So I think that's really what I'm reflecting. Other than that, I think there's significant uncertainty in the U.S.-China trade relations, as well as Brexit deadline coming in three months, and I'll only know what will transpire there. -- Appreciate it, Steve. Thank you.We'll now take your question from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. -- Hi, guys. This is Jamison calling in for Ambrish. So I was hoping you guys could talk to me about some of your receivables. And also, they're up about 6% quarter on quarter on a dollar basis and five days sequentially.And I understand that there was some classification -- reclassification in the receivables last quarter, but can you talk about what is the play here? It is just a timing thing, and do you expect them to come down in the upcoming quarters? -- OK. It's a good question. So there's no reclassification that's occurring this quarter. That was something that we did as part of our year-end process in March.So this is really just based on the shipment linearity in the quarter, one quarter to the next that drove that to be a little bit higher, and we would expect that to really kind of correct itself over time and kind of be more in line with what the revenue curve is going to be in the future. So hopefully, that answers your question, but there's nothing unusual going on in receivables. There's no receivables. We're in good shape.We don't have any significant bad debts or anything like that, so all that should come to cash here over time. -- OK. And then my follow-up is regarding capex. It looks like your 2020 guidance is reduced toward 120 million, which I believe is around, give or take, 2% capital intensity and lower than last several years. So I was wondering what is driving these reductions.Is it just lower demand, and do you expect capex to stay around these levels in the near term or tick back up toward the more historical 4% to 5% in the future? -- OK. So we were, in last fiscal year, fiscal '19, we were putting capital in place at least early in the year for an expansion environment, which then had come to fruition. So we're very well-positioned from a capex perspective of what's in place. We've reduced the capex in the current year by about $20 million when we last talked to the street and just managing the business appropriately in that environment.So we tend to go through peaks and valleys in capex, but I'd say, over time, you should expect capex to be in the range of 3% to 4% of sales. -- OK, great. Thank you very much. -- Welcome.We'll now take your question from Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo Securities. -- Thanks, guys. Eric, I had a couple of questions for you on the gross margin in opex. I believe you were guiding for the June quarter for underutilization to impact gross margin by 70 basis points. Was that the case? And were you sort of discounting in your September quarter outlook? And then with respect to the opex, non-GAAP opex, your -- I think, I mean, for a $10 million sequential increase, based on the midpoint of the guidance, that's the first increase in five quarters.I'm just wondering what's behind that. -- OK. So we'll take it one at a time. So on the gross margin side, we did have underutilization charge again this quarter. It was pretty much in line with what it was in the previous quarter.It was $7.3 million. I think that's up 200k quarter on quarter. We're running our factories kind of at an attrition level, in most cases, at this point in time. So production has been coming down.Our inventory is higher than kind of our normal operating levels of 115 to 120. And at this point in the cycle, that is not unusual. But over time, we do want to bring that inventory balance down. So that's really hit on gross margin.On opex, you're right, we are guiding to an increase. And we have managed operating expenses very tightly, really since the September 2018 quarter and have really kind of beaten our guidance on opex and September, December and March quite significantly and came in kind of at the target in the current quarter and running the business conservatively. But there are investments that we feel we need to continue to make in this business to drive the ongoing health of our business and future growth opportunities. So we view that change as relatively small in the current quarter.As a percentage of revenue, it is targeted to be flat at the midpoint of guidance at 25.8%. -- OK, thanks guys.We'll now take a question from William Stein with SunTrust. -- Great. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the good results considering such a tough demand environment. I'm hoping you can quantify the dollar savings or the synergies that are remaining with regard to the Microsemi acquisition and your anticipated timing on achieving those? -- Well, so I think we can order it genetically because we're really not, at this point in time, breaking results out. We had guided at the end of first year our synergy to be at a rate of $0.75 per share on an annualized basis. We can tell you that we are ahead of it. After one year, we have really exceeded those targets.And then the longer-term three-year synergy targets that we had identified were $1.75, which were -- and you can pick the second-year number somewhere in between, $0.75 and $1.75. And the $1.75 number was consisting of three items, although we didn't provide a breakdown of those three items. One was the opex synergy. The second one was the COGS synergy, where we're bringing stuff inside and improving gross margin.And the third one was the -- is the benefit coming from sales, incremental sales growth and all that. There was actually a fourth item, which was tax, although we originally did not mention tax. So as we look at it about a year and a quarter after, we are ahead of our synergy targets from the expenses, we are ahead of our synergy targets from the COGS side, and we are ahead of our synergy targets on the tax side. So three out of four are ahead, and one we are behind, which is the revenue largely driven by the environment that we have faced.So that's kind of where we are. -- Thank you.We'll now take your question from Chris Caso with Raymond James. -- Yeah, thank you. Good evening. I guess a question on some of the ongoing trade tensions and specifically, some of the new tariffs that are going to come into place. I know, Steve, you have been watching this closely with respect to your business.And I guess, with this next round, do you expect any activity from the channel, kind of pull-forwards, push out as a result of that? Or this has been going on long enough now, that maybe there's some exhaustion in the channel and it's having less of an effect. I appreciate your perspective. -- Well, I think first thing I would say is that this is a second quarter in a row where there has been a significant tweak between the time, we prepared our guidance and prepared our notes, to the time we delivered our guidance and delivered our notes. And a quarter ago, I said the same thing in the conference call that, based on that tweak, we had to nudge the middle of our guidance down. We had done the exact same thing this time, where we had to nudge the middle of our guidance slightly down because of the tweak and the extra tariffs to go into effect on September 1, whether that will happen or not. I think this is a whole lot of uncertainty.Nobody really knows what will happen, whatnot. In terms of the tariff that Microchip pays, the effect of this additional $300 million is virtually nothing. There could be a small amount of our development tools or something. We're talking thousands of dollars, not millions of dollars.So that is not the effect. The effect really is how will a Chinese customer behave in terms of buying our products, the processors that are being exported back to China. Will the customers prefer to buy it from somewhere outside of China? And if they choose a brand outside of China, does that have also our parts designed in or if not, I think it's always some and some. In some cases, we will gain business because the outside brand outside of China has more of the parts, and sometimes, we'll lose because the given brand outside of China has more of the parts from Japan or Europe or somewhere.This is very, very hard to figure out especially when you're dealing with 120,000-plus customers. So hopefully, we have navigated this well in the last one year. I think when you write the history of this last one year, I'm not sure how you would conclude that we were not correct. And hopefully, we have navigated it correctly and have guided you correctly, and all that wisdom, we have tried to put it in our guidance.That's the best I can say. -- Thank you.We'll now take a question from Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. -- Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Lots of recent consolidation, maybe if you want to call it land grab for wireless connectivity assets, especially WiFi, maybe you guys can just remind us on Microchip's connectivity portfolio. I believe it's pretty comprehensive.I know you guys have Bluetooth, ZigBee, LoRa. I believe you guys also have WiFi capability, but if you could just clarify that. And if you can maybe qualitatively sort of quantify the attach rates of your connectivity solutions with your microcontroller platforms and opportunities that do require this type of connectivity capability. -- OK. So you're right. We do have a pretty broad portfolio of WiFis and Bluetooth and other solutions. So just about all the major requirements that are standards-based and even many that are proprietary-based wireless solutions, we have in our portfolio.They have come through organic work, and they've come through several of the acquisitions that we have done over time. So we don't have a particular glaring issue with a particular wireless requirement that we're not able to meet in the marketplace today. It doesn't mean we don't have new products, new innovations coming, those are the normal parts of doing the business itself. As far as attach rates go, we don't track as closely what is the attach rate of wireless.We think of systems, our customer systems, needing to have smart, connected and secure capabilities in them, and we provide the building blocks of many different types of smart capabilities with our microcontrollers, processors, analog and other products. Many different connectivity options, not just wireless, wireless and wired, and we have very leading portfolio of wired analog, have wired connected resolutions as well. And then finally, security itself. So that's how we go to market, looking at how do we enable smart, connected and secure solutions.But we don't have to have a close tracking of how many of them have connected and of those that are connected, how many of those are wireless and if they're wireless, what exactly is the standard that goes behind them. But we're very happy with the portfolio we have and are able to prosecute the markets and the businesses we want to be able to go after. -- Thank you.[Operator instructions] We'll take our next question from Matt Ramsay with Cowen. -- Hi. This is Josh Buchalter on behalf of Matt. And congrats on the results in a tough environment. With gross margins hanging in pretty nicely, I was hoping you can provide an update on the overall pricing environment.You've seen through this downcycle. It seems like things have hung in there pretty well, all things considered, and it would be helpful to hear your view, particularly how it compares to prior downcycles. -- So I think when we talk about pricing, I would say that the pricing has held up in this environment better than really it has held up in any business cycle before. Microchip pricing in general held up in the prior business cycle also because so many of our products are proprietary. But as you talk about this particular business cycle, I would say 95% of what we make today across various the different business units is proprietary, where you cannot take our part out and plug somebody else's part in. So therefore, we really have never competed for pricing at the buyer's desk.We often compete with pricing at the designer's desk, which is usually two years ahead of time and the part is going to go to production. And whatever quotation you're making at the designer's desk, you have the time to achieve and do cost reduction or achieve the results you need to achieve when the part goes into production. Now especially in this cycle, I think it could be somewhat driven by the consolidation industry we have seen, somewhat driven by the players who have been taken out, were the weaker players in price management, and some of them, we ourselves, took them out. I think the result of all that is that the pricing has held up.Our record all-time high record gross margin, I believe, was 62.23% that we made two or three quarters ago. And the quarter we just announced, our gross margin was 62.2%. That's 23 bps below the record, and we're sitting at the bottom of the cycle. So I think that's good news.As the cycle improves and as factories get further full and as we complete the rest of the Microsemi integration and as we bring more of the stuff from outside to inside, remaining stuff from Atmel and some from Microsemi, it's really interesting to think about where this whole business model goes. -- Very helpful, thank you. -- Thank you.We'll now take a question from Craig Ellis with B. Riley FBR. -- Thanks for taking the question. And like many others, congratulations on the good execution, guys. Steve, I wanted to follow up on your remarks regarding an earlier synergies question. You mentioned that the difficult macro environment has made it tough to realize revenue synergies, which is understandable.But the question is this, do you still think there's the same degree of revenue synergies that's possible from the combination, or is there something about what's happened over the last year that would cause you to lower your view of longer-term synergies' potential with revenues? -- Yeah. So the opportunity for revenue synergies is the same. And some of the earliest piece of revenue synergy, where we have gathered enough parts around Microsemi sockets and their part around the Microchip socket, is kind of already beginning to happen. But the starting point is lower.The whole industry has lost a significant amount from the top line as a starting point. So even though we may be adding a little bit of the revenue synergy already, the total revenue is still below where we started. And that's the more difficult part. But the longer term, as the industry recovers from the cycle, there is a -- the funnel is very healthy.The indicator we track internally, which is the number of Microchip products per customer design, an extremely proprietary indicator, is continuing to increase. And as the baseline business goes up, I think this should be working pretty well. So no, we have not lowered the long-term target at all. -- That's helpful. And then if I could ask a follow-up to Eric. Eric, I recall when the Microsemi transaction was announced, that there was an element of the debt burden that was variable-rate. Can you confirm how much that is at present? And given the decline in interest rates that we've seen, especially over the last three to four years when would that be expected to benefit the interest burden that exists on that debt? -- OK. Sure. So we have two pieces of variable-rate debt in the portfolio. We've got a revolving line of credit and then a term loan b.The revolving line of credit had a balance of 3.197 billion at the end of June, and the term loan was 1.724 billion. So you're roughly $4.9 billion of floating rate debt. And we are seeing the fed cutting interest rates, so we are getting a benefit of that today, and that's reflected in our guidance for the other expense that we've guided to the street. That is the debt that we are paying down though still.We are paying down the variable-rate debt, and when that come down, we should see the benefit in the overall operating results. Does that address your question? -- Yeah, it does. Thanks, guys. -- So that variable debt was $1.414 billion higher a year ago. Everything we have paid has been variable so far. So that's what we have paid down in the last year. -- Got it. Thanks, Steve. Thanks, Eric.And we'll now take your question from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. -- Yeah, good afternoon guys. Steve, thanks. Let me ask the question. Steve, I think one of the challenges that all the M&A you guys have done over the last several years has been both for the industry and analyst.And I think, internally for you guys, it's just getting a better understanding of how seasonality is in your business. I'm kind of curious if you could give us some insights. When you look at the September guide, you just gave a flat-out four. How would you peg that against sort of ""normal seasonality?"" And I guess, more importantly, as you look into the December quarter, are you guys any closer to helping us understand what normal seasonality might look like in December? -- So I think, John, it's a very, very good question. We always try to figure out the same thing. However, seasonality is very hard to measure, No.1, with all the acquisitions that keep changing that seasonality because different acquired businesses work differently. But also, in the current environment with trade tensions and general economic conditions, the variability on the business caused by the U.S.-China trade friction and general economic conditions is much larger than any impact of seasonality.So we can't truly compare this to any kind of seasonality. Seasonality also -- is also driven by kind of how somebody was measuring the revenue. Historically, we measure the business based on sell-through revenue recognition. And now, based on the GAAP standard, we're having to report the numbers based on sell-in, and sell-in and sell-through work differently.We have much more cycles and learning on a sell-through revenue recognition on seasonality than we have on sell-in. So I think what changed in revenue recognition, totally different seasonality for our Microsemi business, with defense and aerospace and FPGA and discrete parts and uncertainty of China, U.S., Brexit and general economic conditions. I think this one remains a very, very good question with no real answer today. -- That's helpful, Steve. If I could sneak one in. You did a very good job quantifying the impact of Huawei in the June quarter. I'm just kind of curious, and I apologize if I missed this, what's embedded in the September guide? It is a similar dollar magnitude, or would it be more given that you're taking a view of the entire quarter instead of just half the quarter? -- It's a -- it's not that easy to answer. It's not only a function of what is it that we're allowed to ship or what is it that Huawei is able to use. And that is changing day-by-day as they get inputs from their various suppliers of what they can and cannot ship as well. So what we have built in is less than what a full boat would be for a quarter, but it's a conservative estimate that we have put in with our best judgment of what we think Huawei is likely to take and that changes day to day as we go along. -- Helpful. Thanks, guys.We'll now take your question from Christopher Rolland with SIG. -- Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. Any early feedback so far from your silicon carbide products? And then also, do you guys have any plans or have you thought about expanding into other compound semis out there or perhaps, even vertically integrating like guys like on wanted to do? And then, Eric, just one for you. The IT security remediation that you guys referenced in non-GAAP expenses, just any details on that? -- So with respect to our silicon carbide products, the customer reaction has been extremely positive. I think that is driven by, one, we are a known provider into some of the markets that care most about our silicon carbide, automotive in particular. But second, what differentiates our silicon carbide solutions is a robustness of the product line, and that robustness is measured in different ways that we've been able to demonstrate through test results. And in this area, where there's very high voltages that are involved in the application techniques, silicon carbide robustness is highly valued in what we've done.So the discussions with customers are going well. There's a high interest in the product line. It's early days as we are launching and starting to go into designing activities with them. With respect to any other compounds that we might be looking at, there's really nothing exotic at this point to talk about, and we need to really harvest the places where we have investments and make sure they go into production.And in time, there may be other things we would do, but nothing to report on at the moment. Eric? -- OK. And then on the security matter, I mean, we kind of fully disclosed this in our 10-K, which was filed in late May, that we had a security incident that we are in the process of remediating and it did cause a weakness in our internal controls. So we are working hard on remediating that issue, and that's really what those costs are associated that we are excluding from the non-GAAP results. -- Thanks, guys.We'll now take your question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. -- Steve, I had a longer-term question. Do you think because of this U.S.-China trade conflict, there is the possibility of market share shifting onto non-U.S. microcontroller companies? I understand that, obviously, nothing near term, but do you think that becomes a risk factor longer-term? -- That certainly becomes a risk factor if the Chinese were to think that designing parts from suppliers outside the U.S. is safer, although they have similarly strained relationships with Japan. I'm not sure if they like those people either. The other thing is you have to look at the complexity of the product.So commodity products probably would be more subject to risks than many of our advanced products and the data center business, communication business, FPGAs, 32-bit microcontrollers, networking products, USB, ethernet, automotive and others, but some of the commodity products will be more vulnerable. So -- but I think what is happening right now is that we are seeing a large number of customers starting to move their production outside of China. They're going to Malaysia, they're going to Thailand, they're going to Vietnam, they're going wherever, some may come to Mexico. So I think we're likely to pick up share in that part of the business than move outside of China because in the local competition, it kind of disappears.They largely sell in China. In many times, parts are not very high-quality, and they may be OK for the local Chinese market, but not really OK internationally. So there could be some longer-term impact from that, but I think it's largely going to be a wash. Every decade or so, another country appears that seems to threaten the world.Back in the '80s, Japan was going to take everything and the U.S. semiconductor industry was going to die. In the '90s, it was Korea, then it was Japan -- Taiwan, and now, it seems to be China. I think this industry is still pretty innovative and it will survive in the world. -- OK. If I could sneak in a quick follow-up. Gross margins, if I add back the underutilization charges, you're getting close to your longer-term 63% target. Is that the upper limit? Is there something in the portfolio that kind of limits you to those kinds of gross margins? Or do you think there is a potential to do better over time? -- Well, we haven't hit it yet. Once we hit it and then we'll take a look at it. But yes, as I mentioned earlier, that the gross margins we have today are I think 600 basis points or so better than the bottom of the last cycle. So there is a significant accretion usually from the bottom of the cycle to the capital cycle, so there is a significant opportunity here.I'm not willing to talk about another target yet, but I think your question is a good one. -- Thanks, Steve.We'll now take your question from Hans Mosesmann with Rosenblatt Securities. -- Great. Thanks for squeezing me in. Congrats, guys, on a tough environment, your execution there. Ganesh, maybe this is one for you.For the FPGA business, how much of that is coming from aerospace, defense and aviation? -- So we don't break it out by segment, but suffice to say, based on whatever data has been provided previously through Microsemi or Actel, it is a significant portion of the business. That's where many of the differentiation of the FPGA product line was built, around low power, around security, around robustness, reliability, etc., which are highly valued there. But it is a pretty significant amount that is also in non-aerospace and defense business, and it's growing in those areas quite a bit more as well. So as time goes on, we will retain the strength we have in defense and aerospace, but we will also gain in many new areas as you might see in the most recent announcement we made of a smart embedded vision solution using the PolarFire FPGA solution. -- OK. And then as a follow-up, Ganesh, is there a, on the non-aerospace FPGA business, is there a 5G angle to that business over the next several years? -- There is, and it's being worked on. The -- I would call it an emerging opportunity for where it's not the same place as just some of the high-performance players are playing in today, but yes. As the 5G rolls out, there are going to be opportunities, and it isn't how intelligence is embedded into the edge and less than, too, where it is in the core. And again, some of the smart embedded vision solutions, that type of opportunity will show up on the 5G side as well.But it's more on the edge side, not in the core network. -- Great. Thanks again.We'll go next to Raji Gill with Needham & Company. -- Yeah, thanks, and congrats as well, in a precarious environment, good results. And forgive me if this question was already answered, but I wanted to get a sense as some of the other players in the space noted the inventory correction in the China automotive market is coming to a completion, and that that particular segment, which had been affected pretty significantly than the first two quarters, is starting to perhaps recover, the same thing with China industrial. And again, if you asked this before, forgive me, but I wonder if you have any thoughts there in terms of kind of China auto and China industrial and going to the second half. -- So I think automotive and China continues to have pretty significant year-over-year declines. I think what we may have seen or maybe the data you saw was in the month of June, there were stronger sales that took place. In part, that was driven because there was an emissions change that was happening on July 1, and cars that were sold before the end of June qualified under the old requirement and then the new requirements went into being. So I don't believe that, fundamentally, the China automotive market has strengthened in any recent time frame.It will obviously -- has more probability to bottom and go up, given how far it's come down, but I wouldn't say there's anything in the short term that has shown up in China automotive. -- And let me add to it. Raji, you began with talking about inventory correction in the China automotive. I don't know if that is the case. I don't think we have seen an inventory issue in China automotive that inventory needed to be blown out.We have seen a reduction in demand driven by just duties and problems and China economy, therefore, a lot of the luxury car manufacturers are building much, much less. So we're seeing demand destruction. I don't really think there was a -- at least from a Microchip standpoint, there was not a high inventory in China automotive. -- With respect to your question on industrial, I think industrial weakness is not limited to just China alone. I think industrial in Europe, in the Americas, in China, across the board, have seen weakness. I think you've seen that in some of our competitors' releases as well. Some of it has been initiated from the trade and tariffs and impact from about a year ago, but industrial remains a weak segment. -- And just for my follow-up, also a question on the silicon carbide offering. So your -- my understanding is you're targeting 700-volt, 1200-volt diodes and MOSFETs. I'm wondering how we think -- should think about the revenue opportunity for SIC. I believe you got this technology, you inherited it from Microsemi.I just wanted to get some details on kind of the history of that and how you think about the revenue stream? -- So yeah, the technology did come from Microsemi. It was being incubated inside Microsemi. I think what Microchip has been able to do is use our automotive strength, where we have substantial market position with automotive Tier 1s and OEMs, to liberate what was a technology that was starting to come into fruition inside Microsemi but didn't have as much customer access. And that's what we have done over the last year, is been able to take that technology, showcase it, demonstrate it and also internally work on what does it take to be automotive-ready, what does it take to be qualified for automotive.And that work is for what we could bring to the Microsemi businesses that we're working on silicon carbide. I think from a revenue standpoint, this isn't a market -- predominantly, automotive has a large demand requirement that we believe will show up in time. It is an area that requires time to win designs, ramp into production, so it's not near-term revenue, but it's sowing the seeds for mid- to long-term revenue. -- Thank you.We'll now take your question from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. -- Yeah, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. A question on the direct business. I appreciate all the commentary about what Microchip is seeing through distribution, which I know is in a poor-end channel for you, but hoping to better understand what you may be seeing with your direct business in terms of orders.And I realize it's harder to gauge inventory levels at your direct customers, but any anecdotal commentary you can provide us about how inventory may be at those direct customers. -- I would say our direct business by channel is -- by geography is really no different than our distribution business by geography. Europe was weak and China saw a recovery from the Chinese New Year, and America was somewhere in the middle. So I don't think the customers who buy from distribution have behaved any differently than the customers who buy from us direct. -- OK, thank you.We'll now take your question from William Stein with SunTrust. -- Great, thanks for taking my follow-up. It's actually sort of similar to the last question. But some companies -- some semiconductor companies have specifically called out the possibility that there were customers, in particular in China, that may have been pulling forward demand in the fear that either -- well, some trade friction, either a tariff or a ban, would influence their business going forward. Are you seeing this to any degree in your customer base? Do you believe that you're able to see it? Or any sort of comment or update in that regard would help. -- So one thing you have to remember is that Microchip does business with a long tail of the customers. Our average customer is relatively small. And when they're small, they're usually underfunded with very -- not as healthy a balance sheet. So we have not really seen this pulling phenomena as much as we read and listen to other people's commentaries.If you saw a little bit from the larger customers, it was kind of last year, I think that has kind of run its course. Every two, three months, the rules are changing. You have an equal amount of risk by bringing a lot of the buying it ahead and then have tariffs abruptly go with the settlement, and then you get stuck with a large amount of inventory that you have paid a lower amount of tariff on that you can't get it back from your customers. And let me say that one more time to explain.Let's say, tariff on a given line of product is supposed to go from 10% to 25%. To avoid that, you bring in a lot of inventory at 10% tariff. And then it results into a settlement where the tariff goes to zero. Now with the large amount of inventory you brought at a 10% tariff, you cannot recover those 10% tariff.None of your customers will pay for it because the current rules of tariffs are zero. So this is an equal risk-reward gain, and some people may have done push-pull, but I don't think it has affected our revenue at all. -- That's helpful. Thank you. -- You're welcome.We'll now take your question from Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. -- Yeah, hey, thanks for taking my follow-up. Content gain for opportunities is a strong driver of the business. Obviously, it's part of the Microchip 2.0 strategy. The last you guys updated us; you were driving about 20% year-over-year increase in number of Microchip products per customer program.You've got a plethora of analog interface connectivity solutions alongside MCU, FPGAs. Are you guys still driving that type of content growth on new opportunities? -- We are. And then I think the last time we measured was about a quarter or so ago. Leading up to some of the conferences we go in September, we will try to add another data point on it. I don't have the number right now, but I think with all we see through the reviews, our total system solution trust, with more and more of Microsemi business is integrated with Microchip, that only gets stronger, not weaker.So I think, yes, we will be seeing that kind of content growth. But remember, the base water level has gone down. So when the base water level has gone down on Microsemi business, as well as Microchip business because of those uncertainties, the goodness you're getting through total system solutions is not showing up. It's very hard to measure because that should be accelerating our growth, and so far, it is not because we're fighting the downturn.But an indicator will look like it's healthy when we look at it. -- Yeah, thanks for the insights. -- You're welcome.[Operator instructions] We'll go next to Craig Ellis with B. Riley FBR. -- Thank you very much for taking the follow-up. I just wanted to reconcile what I thought were two comments that were in conflict a bit. So Ganesh, I thought I heard you note that with respect to Microsemi synergies, there were still some business systems and operational synergies benefits to be realized and that those would have economic benefit. And then, Eric, you noted that opex would be up 10 million quarter on quarter.So I would have expected that the synergies would offset incremental expenses. So is there just a timing issue there? And then just further clarifying the opex point you made, Eric, if opex is up in the quarter, are we seeing the full benefit of whatever initiatives the management team is executing in the quarter? Is there some follow-on effect to a subsequent quarter? -- So Craig, it is correct that we have continuing synergies coming from operations and business systems are being combined into the Microchip systems or bringing them down from the numbers up there. If you remember, we started with 22 systems, 21 from what we inherited from Microsemi, one from Microchip. We're about a little more than a third of the way through bringing that down. We still have a fair number to go through in the next four quarters.And that takes time because it's not a quarter to quarter you're going to get instantaneously all of that benefit that comes out. There are support costs that go into these things. There are system costs that go into these things. So on a quarter-to-quarter basis, I would not draw a conclusion that when expenses as a percentage are flat, that somehow we have no longer got any more synergies coming.They will come. They will take time. There could be more in a certain quarter. There could be less in a certain quarter.Do you want to add to that, Eric? -- Yeah. I think that's absolutely right. So we are essentially driving opex to be flat in percentage of sales in the current quarter. And I talked a little bit in my first response to the question that we drove opex down very, very significantly over the last four quarters.And we do have some investments that are needed to be made in the business, we're making those. We consider those modest, but absolutely believe as we get some consistent revenue growth behind us that the opex as a percentage of sales is going to go down as we work toward our long-term target of 22.5%. And we will get some dollar savings, as Ganesh is referring to, as we continue to go through these business integrations over the course of the next year. -- I would add that if -- this is Steve. If we hadn't beaten the opex in the last for quarters, you won't see this as much of an increase. But we got the opex synergies very aggressively early on, that established a lower mark, and some of the investments we delayed and now, we're having to make those investments, a number of very advanced technology tape-outs in the coming quarter and you know that those tape-outs are very expensive. And I think that's leading to some of the increase quarter over quarter.But I think the main issue is that we got the opex synergy much faster and not having to make some investments. -- And it's actually about a $6 million increase quarter on quarter, not $10 million. -- Appreciate the color, guys. Thank you.We'll now take a question from Harsh Kumar with Piper Jaffray. -- Yeah, hey guys. I'm surprised nobody asked this, but in the September quarter, Eric and Steve and Ganesh, as you guys look out, it sounds like from your commentary, correct me if I'm wrong, FPGAs are doing really well, so I would expect that to grow better than the, like, 0.2%. But any thoughts on microcontroller and the analog business, that one will outperform the other, or just kind of think about the 2% kind of a growth rate on average for those? -- We don't break out by product line segments on our forward-looking guidance. So I would just look at the forward-looking guidance, the 2% midpoint as for the company overall. -- I mean, I think trying to divide 2%, breaking that really is tough, I guess. -- OK, fair enough. Thanks, guys.And there appears there are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back to Steve Sanghi for any additional or closing remarks. -- OK. Thank you very much for everybody attending this call. I think I'd like to reemphasize that we've been providing you guidance in managing this business through very turbulent times. We, in fact, started talking about these tariffs and all that before anybody else last year, and I think our guidance has been kind of right on.We guided the March quarter to be the bottom, and I think we have largely delivered that. Without the Huawei ban, we would have delivered that both on end market demand, as well as sell-in. Current quarter, we're guiding up a little bit, 2% up on the midpoint, and we'll go from there. We'll see you at some of the conferences coming up in early September. -- And even before that. So next week, we'll be at the Keybanc conference; we're at the Jefferies conference; we're at the citi conference in September; and the Raymond James conference. So four conferences and a couple of other investor outings this quarter. -- So heavy schedule. So we'll see you -- some of you on the road. Thank you very much.[Operator signoff] --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''.  These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand.  Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).  Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. 	For the First Trust Technology AlphaDEX Fund ETF (Symbol: FXL), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $74.60 per unit.


With FXL trading at a recent price near $67.25 per unit, that means that analysts see 10.93% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings.   Three of FXL's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Salesforce.com Inc (Symbol: CRM), Microchip Technology Inc (Symbol: MCHP), and Micron Technology Inc. (Symbol: MU). Although CRM has traded at a recent price of $143.37/share, the average analyst target is 26.52% higher at $181.39/share. Similarly, MCHP has 18.10% upside from the recent share price of $87.85 if the average analyst target price of $103.75/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting MU to reach a target price of $46.18/share, which is 11.23% above the recent price of $41.52.

Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

"s an alternative to third-party research, certain large semiconductor companies can also provide  of information on the broader technology industry. That's especially important now that tensions between the U.S. and China have escalated. President Trump tweeted last Sunday that tariffs would be going up on $200 billion of Chinese goods, with the potential for another $325 billion ""shortly."" The tweet caused a tech sell-off last week as investors became far more uncertain about global growth.Two such companies are   and  , which have large, broad-based products and customer bases across the globe. In a somewhat fortunate instance of timing, Microchip Technology came out with its quarterly earnings release and  just a couple days after the tariff-hike announcement.Here's what Microchip management had to say about the trade war escalation and how it could affect demand.Image source: Getty Images.First, Sanghi is fairly confident in his take on industry demand, pointing to predictions made last summer as evidence. Microchip was one of the first companies to predict an industry slowdown, resulting from the heightened trade tensions that began around one year ago. Sanghi said, ""The guidance we provided for the September quarter of last year, which reflected our caution on business conditions, turned out in retrospect to be spot on and was a harbinger for broader industry weakness through the last several quarters.""Sanghi also stuck to his guns in saying that the quarter ending in March was the bottom of the cycle. However, before semiconductor investors go out and celebrate, he also didn't say exactly how the recovery would take shape. ""We said that last quarter we did not know the shape of the recovery, whether it is V, U or L shaped, and it would depend somewhat on the outcome of the trade talks. Towards that end, we did not get a settlement on the trade front.""Many chip stocks have exhibited a strong recovery since the beginning of the year on hopes for a demand recovery. However, as Sanghi says, the timing and magnitude of the recovery are still highly uncertain, and the recent deterioration in trade talks is likely to make the shape of that recovery a bit flatter.One might wonder why it is that trade war uncertainty -- even perhaps more than a definitive, negative outcome -- affects semiconductor demand so much. In the conference call, Sanghi gave a comprehensive answer:The world economy largely runs on people building to forecast. Every manufacturer builds a large amount of their products on forecast from electronic stores to grocery stores to furniture stores. You go to a store, a grocery store is full of grocery. And you put it in the bags and you go home. If the manufacturers did not put the grocery store inventory, you would go there and just place your order and come back in two days to pick it up. So in an uncertain environment, when our customers are not able to figure out the demand for their products because they do not know whether they will be able to pass a 25% tariff to their end customers in their environment, they stop building to a forecast and they largely want to build to hard orders where they can negotiate the price increase. ... So in that environment, the ecosystem squeezes down the inventory, from end customer inventory to loading docks to intermediate hubs to stores to everywhere else. And that creates a negative impact on our ability to supply chips, which then eventually go into parts. And you have seen that phenomena experienced by every other semiconductor manufacturer.Sanghi went on to say that even if there is a breakdown in the trade deal or a less-than-ideal trade deal, where some tariffs remain, that would probably be even better for chip demand than not knowing what the rules are.As long as there's a finality on the settlement where the people know what the rules are, then the manufacturers can adjust to those rules and can negotiate with their customers to pass the additional cost, whether it's 5%, 10% duty cost. As long as there's a finality I think will be positive for the business. ... But even if it is not the ultimate best but there's some sort of finality, I think that would be better than the uncertainty we're dealing with.On the positive side, it looked as if things were getting better for Microchip's business -- at least prior to the trade war escalation. Microchip noted that April's bookings were stronger than January's, so the current quarter was tracking ahead of last quarter, giving credence to the assertion that the quarter ending in March was the bottom. Sanghi noted that Chinese stimulus measures during the first quarter had improved activity in that important market.Yet Microchip also guided to flat sequential revenues for the current quarter but with a wide range of plus or minus 5%. Sanghi explained that Microchip's guidance was affected by Trump's tweet, which had occurred just three days prior. Piper Jaffray analyst Harsh Kumar asked whether Microchip  have given much better guidance had it reported earnings in the prior week, before the president's tweet.Sanghi responded, ""Yes, that's a fair assumption.""When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"Flowers are starting to bloom. The sound of lawn mowers is beginning to fill the air. And the weather is getting warmer. That means it’s time to start hearing about how we should “sell in May and go away.” But that old adage continues to be a load of baloney. The truth is, the calendar has little to do with the actual outcome for the markets. Fundamentals matter more. And the right now, the fundamental picture is bullish with a side of caution.Which means dividend stocks could be the best plays of the summer.Thanks to their steady payouts, dividends stocks are naturally less volatile than their non-paying peers. Moreover, if the old market adage holds true this summer, getting a 2% to 4% return in cash is better than no return at all. The combination of these two factors can make dividend stocks some of the best places to park your money as the spring sets in and the weather heats up.But which dividend stocks? Here are five top-notch stocks to buy that should provide a whole summer full of gains.Source: Shutterstock
	6.8%Data. From companies to individuals, we make a ton of it these days. And storing it, in both physical and digital forms, happens to be one of the best dividend stocks around in  (NYSE:).IRM is the largest records storage provider in the world and operates more than 1,400 facilities around the world. This is more 85 million square feet of space dedicated to document storage. This includes its irreplaceable wholly owned salt caverns used for critical document storage to smaller safe-like facilities. Key customers include nearly everyone in the Fortune 1000 as well as various government organizations. With retention rates as high as 98%, IRM is able to pull in some hefty cash flows from the “rent” it charges these customers.Even better is that Iron Mountain has continued to adapt with the times.While physical document storage is still required, today’s digital age requires a different set of storage. To that end, IRM has  access for its clients.  In fact, the firm has now moved into the top ten in terms of capacity. Given its leadership position in storage, it’s easy for firms to make the pivot into these digital offerings from IRM and growth remains brisk. Even better is that these digital storage offerings often come with heftier margins for Iron Mountain.All of this has done wonders for IRM’s dividend which currently stands at 6.8%.Source: 
	3. 8%There’s power in a bowl of Cheerios … well, at least enough for those investors looking at dividend stocks. Packaged food manufacturer  (NYSE:) has used brands like Totino’s, Lucky Charms and Yoplait to power its dividend for decades. In fact, it managed to raise that  for the last 15 years straight. And it looks like GIS will keep the streak going throughout the summer and far into the future.Thanks to a smart turnaround plan, GIS has regained its mojo in a big way.First, the firm has used its top brands to add extensions into new products. Secondly, General Mills has leaned heavily on organic/natural brands for additional growth. Blue Buffalo pet food, Annie’s organic and Cascadian Farm are now leading drivers at the food firm. Finally, if couldn’t develop its own, General Mills has been a smart acquirer of smaller and scalable food brands in key niche markets. A hefty dose of price increases for these premium products has hurt either.All of this has helped boost the firm’s bottom line. Adjusted EPS for the  jumped by more than 6% in constant currency, while free cash flows have surged. With these continued improvements, GIS has upped its guidance for the rest for the year and management has pledged to reward shareholders.Given its recent wins and steadfast nature, GIS could be one of the best dividend stocks to buy for summer.Source: 
	1.2%It’s no secret that retail is a bloodbath these days, as online shopping and kingpins like  (NASDAQ:) have hurt smaller competitors. But there are plenty of retailers operating in strong niches immune from Amazon’s wraith. To find one of the best examples, head west into big sky country. (NASDAQ:) operates more than 1,700 stores serving farmers and more rural Americans. The beauty is that many of TSCO’s offerings aren’t the sort of thing you log into Amazon.com to buy. Farm gates, barbed wire and tractor attachments aren’t easily shippable and often, customers need these items today. Because of this, Tractor Supply continues to see a steady and rising base of sales. Last year, TSCO pulled in more than $7.9 billion in revenues.That profitable niche has made TSCO one heck of a dividend stock as well. Since 2010, Tractor Supply has managed to grow its dividend payout by a .And that growth will continue. TSCO plans on opening more stores to meet the needs of rural customers. Meanwhile, its newly acquired PetSense brand of stores has quickly seen plenty of growth. Like Tractor Supply, PetSense focuses on the rural marketplace- a niche that is often ignored from other major pet retailers. Together, the two stores form an interesting and Amazon-proof play.A play that will pay plenty of dividends going forward.Source: Shutterstock
	1.5%Technology is everywhere these days, from your car and phone to even your toaster. And most modern tech, no matter how complex, is built on the backbone of semiconductors.  (NASDAQ:) has been building those chips and paying a dividend for years.MCHP produces a host of analog and microcontroller semiconductors. These are the boring building blocks of the modern world. But boring is beautiful when it comes to dividends and cash flows. Microchip sells a ton of these to a variety of end-users. And it continues to sell more as the world modernizes. , revenues jumped 18.1% sequentially and 41.5% from the year-ago period. This was another record quarter for the firm. Meanwhile, profits continue to rise as well.Part of that comes from MCHP’s continued pivots into more advanced semiconductors. These include new automotive power, battery/green technologies and networking chips. The extra boosts here plus the firm’s steady cash flows from its analog business has continued to make it a dividend champion.MCHP has been paying a dividend since 2003 and with its , Microchip has raised its dividend 58 times by a total of 1,725%At the end, when it comes to dividend stocks, MCHP has the goods to keep the payouts rolling.Source: Shutterstock
	3.8%Perhaps the best way to score some great dividend stocks is to own them all. A great to do that is through the Invesco High Yield Equity Dividend Achievers ETF (NYSE:).PEY tracks the NASDAQ US Dividend Achievers 50 Index. This index holds fifty U.S. stocks that have not only high initial yields, but also show consistent growth in their dividend payouts. This eliminates those stocks that have high yields because of problems. You get both a good yield today and income that grows tomorrow. Top holdings include stalwarts like  (NYSE:) and  (NASDAQ:). The combination of stocks produces a decent 3.8% dividend yield. An added bonus for retirees is that PEY pays its dividend monthly.Even better is that PEY has been a  other ETFs tracking dividend stocks.PEY has managed to best the more popular (NYSE:) and its underlying index — the Dow Jones US Select Dividend Index — by about two basis points over the last decade.In the end, those investors looking to load up on dividend stocks for the summer, PEY could be a great all-in-one solution.

"ne of the more hotly debated stocks in the market is  , a leading producer of DRAM and NAND flash memory chips. Memory chips are subject to dramatic , and after DRAM prices spiked in 2017 and 2018, DRAM prices are cratering in 2019.In fact, DRAM prices -- where Micron earns a vast majority of its profits -- fell over 20% just in the first recent quarter, after falling in the high single digits during the prior quarter. Not only that, but research site DRAMeXchange projects DRAM price declines will continue, with a further 15%-20% drop in the current quarter and another 10% in the third quarter. If those projections are correct, DRAM prices will have fallen about 60% in . DRAM declines are decimating Micron's profits, which fell 46.4% in its most recent quarter. Yet for all the gloom and doom, Micron's stock has risen 36.5% this year, though it's still 33% below the all-time highs reached last June.The partial recovery is likely due to investor perception that the memory cycle is bottoming. However, there's considerable debate on this issue: Analyst EPS estimates for Micron's fiscal 2020 year range from $1.93 to $8.02 -- just about the widest gap one will see for a large-cap stock.So, will Micron's earnings remain in the doldrums, or will the company see a big recovery next year?Image source: Getty Images.Micron's current troubles shouldn't be brushed off. During the rise in memory prices in 2017-2018, large customers became worried about further price spikes, and purchased more inventory than needed. Over that period, the three major DRAM players -- Micron,  , and   -- increased  to crank out more output to meet demand.However, once DRAM prices began falling, the opposite occurred. Customer buying plummeted, and the overhang of the lingering trade war made memory customers even more cautious about buying more chips than absolutely necessary. Stocked with extra inventory, demand has been even lower than already-low expectations.Worse yet, memory producers can't just switch off production without underutilizing their factories. That's caused Micron's days of inventory to surge to its highest level in 10 years: data by .Since memory prices are falling, older inventory will likely get sold at a much lower price, which could hurt earnings in the quarters ahead, even if Micron sells more units. Things definitely look challenging for Micron right now. However, as we've seen over the past year, things can change dramatically over a 12-month period. Here are a few reasons Micron's results could surge within a year: Though the trade war between the U.S. and China began in early 2018, the first big tariffs on electronic equipment weren't implemented until September. As negotiations between the U.S. and China have dragged on into the spring, the cautious stance has continued, denting memory demand.However, if a trade deal is reached, companies may finally feel encouraged buy more aggressively. In fact, another tech CEO, Steve Sanghi of  , said in February that "" [a] settlement of trade would be a bonanza. Our customers and distributors are so cautious, there is low visibility... nobody wants to get stuck with anything depending on what happens."" Therefore, the entire chip space -- Micron included -- could see a big demand bounce back if and when a trade deal is consummated. Just as the memory producers all overspent during the last memory upturn, all three players are now cutting back on capital spending in 2019. In addition to lowering its spending target from $10.5 billion to $9-$9.5 billion, Micron said it also plans to shut down 5% of its wafer production starting in the current quarter. In addition, both Samsung and SK Hynix are also set to decrease memory capital spending this year. SK Hynix even anticipates its memory equipment spending to fall around 40%. A refresh in demand combined with a cutback in supply would be a much better setup for memory producers next year. Just as the last boom set the stage for today's bust, today's bust could lead to the next boom.In addition to a better-balanced memory market in 2020, Micron will also take control of their 3D Xpoint fab in Lehi, Utah, later this year. Jointly developed with  , 3D Xpoint is a new memory technology that is nonvolatile, like NAND flash, but faster. In October, Micron exercised its option to take full control of the 3D Xpoint joint venture.Micron has been investing heavily in this technology, but won't begin selling 3D Xpoint until late 2019, with meaningful volumes coming in 2020. Micron's margins have been under extra pressure because of this, including 160 basis points of underutilization last quarter. However, this time next year, Micron will be selling product, and should be able to get those margin points back.Micron will be only one of two companies to have 3D Xpoint, which will have applications in high-growth sectors such as artificial intelligence and data analytics. While its contribution will not be that meaningful compared with DRAM or NAND in the near term, investor optimism around 3D Xpoint could also help boost Micron's stock in 2020.While the timing of the next upturn may be in question, it will eventually happen, and perhaps as soon as next year. That's why Micron's share price has surged lately, in spite of declining results. However, with the stock only regaining a portion of last year's slump, Micron still has room to move higher in the year ahead.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the US Equity Dividend Select ETF (Symbol: RNDV), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $24.10 per unit.With RNDV trading at a recent price near $21.44 per unit, that means that analysts see 12.42% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of RNDV's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Microchip Technology Inc (Symbol: MCHP), M & T Bank Corp (Symbol: MTB), and KKR & Co Inc (Symbol: KKR). Although MCHP has traded at a recent price of $83.82/share, the average analyst target is 19.30% higher at $100.00/share. Similarly, MTB has 17.53% upside from the recent share price of $153.29 if the average analyst target price of $180.17/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting KKR to reach a target price of $27.57/share, which is 17.02% above the recent price of $23.56.

" month has gone by since the las  report for Microchip Technology (MCHP). Shares have lost about 3.2% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Microchip Tech due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recen  in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Microchip Technology delivered third-quarter fiscal 2019 non-GAAP earnings of $1.66 per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $1.57 per share. The figure was also above the higher end of management's guided range of $1.49-$1.64 per share and surged from $1.36 per shares reported in the year-ago quarter.The year-over-year upside was driven by higher net sales, which increased 42.4% from the year-ago quarter to $1.416 billion on a non-GAAP basis. The figure also marginally surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.402 billion and was toward the higher end of management's guided range of $1.362-$1.438 billion.In terms of product line, microcontroller business (52.9% of non-GAAP net sales) decreased 8.7% sequentially to $748.4 million. However, revenues from microcontroller went up 13.2% on a year-over-year basis.Analog net sales came in at $411.8 million (29.1%), down 6.2% sequentially but surged 77.9% on a year-over-year basis. Synergies from Microsemi buyout aided growth across both the domains on a year-over-year basis. Notably, the sequential decline can be attributed to macroeconomic weakness.We believe Microchip is well poised to capitalize on Microsemi's growth catalysts. Apart from a robust portfolio, the buyout is likely to expand Microchip's total addressable markets. Strong demand for Microsemi's solutions in Data Center, Communications, Defense & Aerospace markets is likely to aid Microchip's long-term growth prospects.FPGA revenues (7%) came in at $99.2 million and surged 8.7% sequentially. Robust adoption of company's low power PolarFire solutions was noteworthy.Licensing segment (2.8%) reported non-GAAP revenues of $40.1 million, increasing 7.9% sequentially, primarily on account of patent license sale and strength in royalty revenues.Memory business (2.8%) declined 15% sequentially to $40.1 million.MMO or multi-market and other business unit revenues (5.4%) were down 3% from the previous quarter.Geographically, revenues from Americas, Europe and Asia contributed 25.4%, 20.4% and 54.2% of total revenues, respectively.Portfolio expansion across majority of the operating domains bode well. The company recently partnered Google Cloud to launch the latest AVR-IoT WG Development Board with a fully certified Wi-Fi network controller to provide a simple and effective way to connect embedded applications.Recently, Microchip announced availability of the SAM R34/35 which integrates ultra-low-power 32-bit MCU, sub-GHz RF LoRa transceiver and software stack.Microchip unveiled the first RISC-V SoC Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) architecture.

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (Symbol: RSP), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $114.43 per unit.With RSP trading at a recent price near $103.82 per unit, that means that analysts see 10.22% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of RSP's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Microchip Technology Inc (Symbol: MCHP), Sempra Energy (Symbol: SRE), and Southwest Airlines Co (Symbol: LUV). Although MCHP has traded at a recent price of $91.10/share, the average analyst target is 10.68% higher at $100.83/share. Similarly, SRE has 10.40% upside from the recent share price of $115.26 if the average analyst target price of $127.25/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting LUV to reach a target price of $63.62/share, which is 10.27% above the recent price of $57.70. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of MCHP, SRE, and LUV:Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
  
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Analysts Forecast 10% Gains Ahead For RSP@2019-02-19@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/analysts-forecast-10-gains-ahead-rsp-2019-02-19
"nvestors eyeing a purchase of Microchip Technology Inc (Symbol: MCHP) shares, but cautious about paying the going market price of $98.38/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal.  One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2021 put at the $75 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $5.80.  Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 7.7% return against the $75 commitment, or a 4.5% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost).



Selling a put does not give an investor access to MCHP's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised.  And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $75 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price.  ().  So unless Microchip Technology Inc sees its shares decline 23.6% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $69.20 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $5.80 from $75), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 4.5% annualized rate of return.


				Worth considering, is that the annualized 4.5% figure actually exceeds the 1.5% annualized dividend paid by Microchip Technology Inc by 3%, based on the current share price of $98.38.  And yet, if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downside because the stock would have to fall 23.58% to reach the $75 strike price.  
				
Always important when discussing dividends is the fact that, in general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company.  In the case of Microchip Technology Inc, looking at the dividend history chart for MCHP below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 1.5% annualized dividend yield.


   Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Microchip Technology Inc, and highlighting in green where the $75 strike is located relative to that history:
  

   
The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2021 put at the $75 strike for the 4.5% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks.  We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Microchip Technology Inc (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $98.38) to be 35%.

Image source: The Motley Fool. (NASDAQ: MCHP)Q3 2019 Feb. 05, 2019 , Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Microchip's Third Quarter Fiscal 2019 Financial Results Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Eric Bjornholt. Please go ahead, sir. -- Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the Company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Chairman and CEO; and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and COO. I will comment on our third quarter fiscal year 2019 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance, and provide an update on our integration activities associated with the Microsemi acquisition. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results.I want to remind investors that during the quarter ending June 30th, 2018, we adopted a new GAAP revenue recognition standard which requires revenue to be recognized at the time products are sold to distributors versus our historical revenue recognition policy where revenue on such transactions were deferred until the product was sold by our distributors to an end customer. We recently went through a comment letter process with the SEC regarding our non-GAAP reporting.As a result of this process, we will now be referring to what we used to call non-GAAP revenue as a metric called end market demand and will provide this metric in our earnings release each quarter. End market demand is the net dollar amount of our products licensing revenue and other services delivered to our direct customers, non-distributors, and by our distributors to their customers. We are able to calculate end market demand by our distributors based on information that our distributors provide to us about their product shipments to their customers and inventory holdings.The value of end market demand from our distributors is calculated as the net transaction value of these shipments. We will continue to manage our business and distributor relationships based on creating and fulfilling end market demand. All of Microchip's bonus programs will continue to put to work based on end market demand. Therefore, along with our GAAP and non-GAAP results based on distributions sell-in, we will also provide investors with our end market demand based on distributions sell-out but will not provide the P&L based on end market demand.Even though we are changing our guidance practice going forward, for transition purposes today we will provide a review of our Q2 results compared to our non-GAAP guidance provided on November 7th, 2018 using our historical non-GAAP nomenclature. Our guidance going forward will reflect the outcome of the SEC comment letter process, which Steve will also comment on during his remarks about our guidance for the March 2019 quarter.I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis using end market demand metric as expenses and expenses prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation. End market demand in the December quarter was $1.416 billion, above the midpoint of our guidance, which was $1.4 billion and down 6.4% sequentially from end market demand of $1.513 billion in the immediately preceding quarter. We have posted a summary of our end market demand and GAAP net sales by product line and geography on our website for your reference. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were a record 62.2%, operating expenses were 24.8% of end market demand and operating income was $530 million and 37.4% of end market demand.Non-GAAP net income was $405.6 million and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $1.66 and was $0.095 above the midpoint of our guidance of $1.565. On a GAAP basis, net sales in the December quarter were $1.375 billion, GAAP gross margins were 56.7% and include the impact of $3.4 million of share-based compensation, $74.3 million of acquired inventory valuation cost and $23.8 million impact from the differences in GAAP revenue and end market demand. Total operating expenses were $584.9 million and include acquisition intangible amortization of $193.7 million, special income of $1.3 million, $5.4 million of acquisition-related and other costs, and share-based compensation of $36 million.The GAAP net income was $49.2 million or $0.20 per diluted share and includes one-time tax expense of $0.4 million related to a variety of matters, including tax reserve releases due to audit settlements, statute of limitations expiring, tax reform and transition tax refinements, and fiscal 2018 tax provision to tax return adjustments. The non-GAAP cash tax rate was 3.5% in the December quarter and we expect a similar rate for all of fiscal year 2019. We expect our non-GAAP cash tax rate for fiscal '20 and fiscal '21 to be 5% or less, exclusive of the transition tax, any potential tax associated with the restructuring of the Microsemi operations into the Microchip global structure and any tax audit settlements related to taxes accrued in prior fiscal years.We have many tax attributes and net operating losses and tax credits, as well as US interest deductions that we believe will keep our cash tax payments low. The cash tax payments associated with the transition tax for the combined Microchip-Microsemi group is expected to be about $293 million and will be paid over eight years. We have posted a schedule of our projected transition tax payments on the Investor Relations page of our website. For GAAP purposes, we had a significant tax benefit in the current quarter for a variety of reasons discussed earlier.Moving on to the balance sheet, our inventory balance at December 31st, 2018 was $702.5 million, although the inventory mark up from Microsemi required for GAAP purchase accounting has now been sold through and is no longer reflected in the ending inventory balance. We had a 123 days of inventory at the end of December quarter, up six days from the prior quarter's levels. Inventory at our distributors in the December quarter were 36 days compared to 37 days at the end of September. We believe that our distributors are holding an appropriate level of inventory to support end market demand.The cash flow from operating activities was $481.5 million in the December quarter. As of December 31st, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $436.2 million. We paid down $377.5 million of total debt in the December quarter and the net debt on the balance sheet reduced by $349.4 million. At December 31st, our debt outstanding includes $2.743 billion of borrowings under our line credit, $2.713 billion of Term Loan B, $2 billion in high-grade bonds and $4.481 billion of convertible debt. Our net debt-to-EBITDA, excluding our very long-dated convertible debt that matures in 2037 and is more equity like in nature, was 4.8 at December 31st.Our net leverage metrics are based on 12-month trailing EBITDA which will continue to provide some headwinds due to the significant distribution inventory reductions that were made in the June and September quarter for Microsemi which caused our shipment activity to be significantly less than end market demand during these periods. The weak economic environment also has negatively impacted our EBITDA in the December 2018 quarter and will continue to do so in the March 2019 quarter. We are committed to using substantially all of our excess cash generation beyond our dividend payments to reduce our debt levels and we expect our debt levels to reduce significantly over the next several years.Our dividend payment in the December quarter was $86.3 million. Capital expenditures were $27.4 million in the December quarter. We expect about $45 million in capital spending in the March quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2019 to be about $235 million. We continue to add capital to support the growth of our production capabilities for our new products and technologies and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. These capital investments will bring some gross margin improvement to our business, particularly for the outsource to Atmel and Microsemi manufacturing activities that we are bringing into our own factories. Depreciation expense in the December quarter was $47 million.I will now turn it over to Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the December quarter and provide an update on some of the Microsemi integration activities. Ganesh? -- Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon everyone. Before I get started, I'd like to clarify that the product line comparisons I will be sharing with you are based on end market demand metric, which is how Microchip measures its performance internally. Let's start by taking a closer look at microcontrollers. Our microcontroller business was sequentially down 8.7% compared to the September quarter, reflecting a broad macro weakness in the markets we serve.Microcontrollers, however, were up 13.2% from the year-ago quarter. Microcontrollers represented 52.9% of our revenue in the December quarter. During the quarter, we continued to introduce a steady stream of innovative new microcontrollers ranging from the industry's lowest-power LoRa System-in-Package family to single chip maxTouch touchscreen controllers for screens up to 20 inches in size through Intelligent's Network Interface Controller technology, the industry's most efficient automotive infotainment networking solution that supports all data types, including audio, video, control and Ethernet over a single cable.In my prepared remarks last quarter, I mentioned that our microcontroller business was annualizing at over $3 billion in end market revenue. Through our subsequent investor meetings, there seem to be the perception that our 32-bit microcontroller business was not very big. To address this perception gap, we'd like to share with you that over the last two quarters our 32-bit microcontroller business is annualizing at over $1.2 billion in end market revenue. The 2018 microcontroller rankings from Gartner are normally available in April and as we have seen in prior year's results, we expect to see significant market share gains again. We will report on these results during our next conference call.Now moving to analog, our analog business was sequentially down 6.2% compared to the September quarter, reflecting the same broad macro weakness our microcontroller business experienced. Analog, however, was up 77.9% from the year-ago quarter. Analog represented 29.1% of our revenue in the December quarter and during the quarter we continued to introduce a steady stream of innovative analog products as well, including the industry's smallest multi-output MEMS clock generator, the industry's smallest fivechannel channel temperature sensor and the most robust silicon carbide diodes and MOSFETs in the industry.Our FPGA revenue hit another all-time record even after going back to the Microsemi and Atmel history, with 8.7% sequential growth compared to the September quarter. Our low-power mid-range PolarFire family continues to garner strong market acceptance while the prior generations continued to demonstrate consistent growth even in the current market environment. We also unveiled the industry's first RISC-V system-on-a-chip FPGA architecture, combining the industry's lowest power mid-range our PolarFire FPGA family with a complete microprocessor subsystem based on the open royalty free RISC-V instruction set architecture. FPGA represented 7% of our revenue in the December quarter.Next, moving to our licensing business, this business was sequentially up 7.9% as compared to the September quarter. Our results reflect the sale of another patent license for a specific set of patents that can be used in non-competitive fields of use. We anticipated this patent license to close in the December quarter and include it in our guidance. We continue to retain indefinite rights to these patents for the fields of use that are of interest to us. Our patent licensing strategy is to monetize portions of the substantial patent portfolio we inherited through acquisitions by licensing select patents to players in noncompetitive fields of use. In all cases, we retain rights to use these patents in our products as well.We had meaningful patent license transactions in September and December quarters. Investors should expect that the revenue contribution in the future from this effort will be lumpy from quarter to quarter. We do not expect meaningful contribution from the patent licensing in the March quarter.Our memory business was sequentially down 15% in the December quarter as compared to the September quarter. And finally, our multi-market and other business was down 3% sequentially compared to the September quarter.A quick update about the Microsemi integration. Business units, sales, operations and support groups are all making rapid progress. Our thanks and kudos go out to the combined company employees who're working hand-in-hand to achieve the accelerated synergy results. Overall, we are ahead of our synergy targets and expect continued synergy gains for many quarters to come. What will take us a the longest is the business systems and operations integration which has been done in phases. The first phase for one of the business units went live on November 1st, 2018. The second phase just went live on February 1st and involve three more business units and more phase releases are planned with a steady cadence. We expect the overall business and operational integration will take about 15 to 18 more months to complete.Let me now pass it to Steve for some comments about our business and our guidance going forward. Steve? -- Thank you. Ganesh, and good afternoon everyone. Today I would like to first reflect on the results of the fiscal third quarter of 2019, I will then provide update on our progress at Microsemi, I will then provide guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2019. Our December quarter non-GAAP financial results based on end market demand exceeded our guidance for net sales, gross margin percentage, operating margin percentage and earnings per share.Our consolidated non-GAAP gross margin reached an all-time record at 62.2% of net sales and exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by about 100 basis points. Our consolidated non-GAAP operating margins were strong at 37.4% of sales and exceeded the midpoint of guidance by about 130 basis points. Our consolidated non-GAAP EPS exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by $0.095 per share. We are pleased with the financial results despite a very unfavorable business environment with tariffs, slowdown in China, European automotive issues, higher interest rates and under absorption charges from some of our factories.Let me also touch on the performance of Microsemi. Microsemi's non-GAAP operating profit reached a record. We're systematically improving Microsemi's financial performance and realizing significant synergies. At the time of our announcement of Microsemi acquisition, we had guided to $0.75 accretion run rate after the first year. After nearly seven months, we are well ahead of the $0.75 run rate for attrition from Microsemi. On non-GAAP basis, this was also our 113th consecutive profitable quarter, I want to thank all employees of Microchip, including employees from our acquisitions for their contribution.Now let me provide you some further update on the progress we have made with the Microsemi integration. First, distribution inventory; after reducing the inventory in distribution channel in the September quarter, Microsemi distribution inventory remained stable at 2.6 months in the December quarter. We believe that at the current levels, distribution is holding the amount of inventory it needs to support the end market demand. In last quarter's  , we discussed moving several Microsemi customers back to being serviced directly that Microsemi had transferred to distribution. We completed this transition during the December quarter.Microsemi internal inventory; Microsemi is internal inventories are still high as we continue to maintain lower loadings in Microsemi's internal factories as well as sub contractors until the inventory comes in line. As we said from the beginning, Microsemi has very good engineering teams and very good products. The customers' sockets are sticky and we continue to believe there are very good end market opportunities for the combined company. Our strategy for the better part of this decade has been to buy businesses and turn them into world-class performers in the likes of Microchip.Here we started with excellent products, excellent gross margins and excellent engineering teams. With distributor and contract manufacturing inventory reduced and with Microchip's operating expense approach, we are optimistic about achieving our long-term targets for attrition from Microsemi. So far we are ahead of our original target.Now regarding guidance going forward, beginning with this March quarter, as Eric mentioned, we are changing the information included in our financial guidance in response to comments and discussions with the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission. After the GAAP standard change to sell-in revenue recognition, we continue to provide guidance and track our results based on sell-through revenue recognition and refer to the sell-through revenue as non-GAAP net sales.After the adoption of ASC 606, the feedback we received from investors and sell-side analysts has been very positive on our continuing use of sell-through revenue recognition in our reporting of non-GAAP net sales. We continue to strongly believe that managing our business on a sell-through basis in the appropriate way to run Microchip. Therefore, we would have preferred to continue to use our end market demand as our non-GAAP sale. However, after receiving an SEC comment letter and discussing with the SEC, we have decided to provide net sales guidance based on sell-in revenue recognition under the new GAAP standard.We will continue to provide non-GAAP guidance for gross margin percentage, operating expense percentage, operating profit percentage and earnings per share, but we will use sell-in based GAAP revenue for these calculations. When we report our results, we will also provide information on end market demand so that investors can understand the consumption of our product in the marketplace, but we will not use the end market demand for calculation of the non-GAAP P&L.Now, I will provide you guidance for the March quarter. The guidance we provided for the September and December quarters which reflected our caution on business conditions turned out in retrospect to be spot on and was the harbinger for broader industry weakness. We continue to be cautious about the outlook for the March quarter. We see a very uncertain business environment with tariffs, slowdown in China, European automotive issues, higher interest rates potentially causing US GDP to slow down, any lingering effect of US government shutdown and potential for further US government shutdown. With all this commentary, we expect our total GAAP net sales based on sell-in revenue recognition for March quarter to be up 2% to down 9% sequentially.We expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 61.2% and 61.8% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 25.8% and 26.5% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating profit percentage to be between 34.7% and 36% of sales. We expect our non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $1.26 per share to $1.53 per share. Again, all these ranges for non-GAAP gross margin percentage, operating expense percentage, operating profit percentage and earnings per share are based on GAAP revenue and sell-in revenue recognition.We also want to give the investors and analysts a sense of how we see the Microchip business past the March quarter. As you know, there is a substantial pending date of March 1, 2019 when if there is no settlement between US and China, a 25% tariff would kick in for about $200 billion of Chinese goods shipped into US. We think that the two governments will make some progress, but it is likely that the date of March 1, 2019 will be extended further out.Barring any material negatives development on the trade front, we see the March 2019 quarter to mark the bottom of this cycle for Microchip. We cannot yet say what the shape of the recovery would be, will the recovery be a V-shaped to U-shaped or L-Shaped, that will depend somewhat on the outcome of the trade talks, but we do see a bottom forming and believe that the March quarter will mark the bottom for this cycle for Microchip.Given all the complications of accounting for our acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory write-up on acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on non-GAAP basis, except for net sales, which will be on GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters and we request that the analysts continue to report their non-GAAP estimates to First Call.With this, operator, will you please poll for questions?Thank you. (Operator Instructions) We'll go now to Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. -- Yes. Thank you so much. Steve, I appreciate the color around kind of tariffs and how you are thinking about things kind of post-March. Just any signals that you're looking at in terms of calling the bottom here whether it's kind of run rate of business, inventory at distribution, or customers just how you're seeing kind of the business evolve kind of beyond the March quarter? -- Well, we look at a variety of factors including bookings and billings activity, discussion with our direct and distribution customers, distribution sell-through activity, customer cancellations, customer pull-ins, delivery pushouts, and pull-ins. With 120,000 plus customers that we service in a vast range of end-markets and applications, we really believe that we get a very broad perspective of what is happening in our business. Today these indicators are telling us that the environment is still very uncertain driven by a variety of factors, including the trade situation. However, we don't see things getting worse at this point, unless something more negative occurs on the trade front. Based on the vast amount of data that we get, we're really seeing a framework for the formation of a bottom for this cycle in the March quarter. -- Got it. And then just as a follow-up, can you talk about so far this quarter to-date kind of January into February, you know, what type of linearity you're seeing and how the business has been? -- So, business is tracking well to the guidance we're providing. We have seen the bookings stabilize and even increased somewhat very recently, but I would say, it's a very short duration indicator and it's really not enough for long enough time to give you making calls based on that. -- Appreciate it. Thanks.We'll go next to Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. -- Yes, good afternoon and thanks very much for taking the question. Steve, I was hoping first if you could give us a better sense as you think about the March quarter, if you think sell-through will be above or below or similar to the sell-in revenue that you're giving guidance for? -- Yes, so we are -- we did not really have a good process for forecasting what the change in distribution inventory is going to be. That's not how we run our business historically. You know that. That's why we've given the sell-through information or end market demand consumption, historically. We really feel, as we said, kind of in our prepared remarks that distribution inventory is in a good position to support what end market consumption is. So I think at this point in time we've given a pretty broad range of guidance for the quarter of plus 2% to down 9%. So that's probably the broadest range of guidance you've seen from Microchip in a long time and some of that is the unpredictability of what the sell-in versus sell-through is going to be. -- That's helpful. My follow-up question, on the completed quarter revenue and gross margins were above your guidance. Can you just give us a better sense for what enabled the Company to exceed its guidance on those financial metrics? -- Well...you want to take that, Eric? -- sure, I mean revenue was roughly 1%, little more than a 1% better than our guidance was. And I think that's just kind of the puts and takes that we saw in the quarter but it was good that we came in above the midpoint. And then on the gross margin side, we had a very favorable product mix in the quarter. We continue to really focus on cost reductions out of manufacturing area. You know that we made quite a bit of changes in terms of any discounts that were previously given for the Microsemi portion of the business on sales to distributors or contract manufacturers and we're really seeing the benefit reflect itself in the gross margin today. -- Thank you.We'll now take a question from Ambrish Srivastava from Bank of Montreal. -- Hi, thank you very much. Maybe you could just stick to the gross margin side, your guidance is on a Q-over-Q, that's a pretty big delta, but yet your margins are coming in much stronger than what I would have modeled it for. Can you just help us understand the dynamics there in the guided two quarter, especially in light of your inventory came down as well and I'm expecting you're not building inventory in the quarter. And then I have a quick follow-up. -- Is your question that the gross margins are coming down, but the operating margins are not as much? -- No, my question is gross margin is coming in stronger than what I would have modeled given your shortfall in the revenues versus what the Street was expecting. -- So I think the same reason where the gross margins were strong this quarter. We are getting an uplift from lot of the discounts that were given to the distribution channel and contract manufacturers and others and lot of the business that was moved to distribution from the Microsemi business, we have completed the conversion back to direct and therefore you take out the distribution margin hit. So all that is having a positive effect on ASPs and our margins. We are continuing to reduce cost in all of our factories. That is still lot of Atmel product which was outside. Every quarter more and more of it is coming in. There is also some Microsemi product we're starting to bring in. Some of the expenses have been taken out from the manufacturing overhead in synergies. So, there are lot of moving parts and the product mix is very healthy. -- Okay, good then my quick follow-up, Steve, usually things don't turn around that quickly and it's a small piece of the business FPGA, but if memory serves me correct, it was kind of the $320 million, $325 million run rate annual and you posted $100 million quarter. What's going on, is there -- hopefully not a last time buy, but some design wins that are ramping? Thank you. -- Yes, there are no last time buys in FPGA that are driving that revenue. There has been seeds sown for many quarters on some of the new products, the fourth and fifth generation of the FPGA products. There's some of the FPGA which is exposed to markets like defense and aerospace. They have some quarter ending budget that needs to be spent. But it's a stable solid business and we see many, many good characteristics for how that can be continued to be built on. Quarter-to-quarter, we may have small changes, but overall, if you look at annualized revenue, it's on a nice -- good growth path for us. -- Yes, truly. Thank you.We'll take our next question comes Vivek Arya with Bank of America. -- Thanks for taking my question. -- Hello, Vivek, -- Hello, Steve. So, Steve, can you give us some color by end market, whether it's industrial or auto or consumer or communications where you are perhaps seeing better or worse trends than what the midpoint of your March outlook would suggest? -- Ganesh? -- Rather than going segment by segment, I think we have previously indicated that the automotive, industrial and consumer home appliance markets were weaker. In the last quarter, especially as we look at this -- in the guidance for this quarter, we're seeing the addition to that, the data center market, the communication markets have also started to have some softening that goes with that. So at this point in time I can't pick any one of them to say this is the main reason why the strength is coming or the weakness is coming. I think we're seeing a broad-based weakness and even some which were stronger last quarter are less strong at this point in time. Defense and aerospace has continued to be strong. It could have some impact this quarter from the government shutdown and what impact that may have, but that's all built into our guidance at this point. -- I think aerospace and defense is a market in its own space and it doesn't really follow the usual what happens in industrial, consumer and other, it's a very different business. We did see some impact from the government shutdown we couldn't get certain export licenses processed and some programs were not released, but we kind of expect it to square up in the quarter, not really have any significant impact going out of the quarter. There is some impact of budget flush and there's a lot of budget flush in September and December quarters where all these large customers, they have government budgets and they need to spend it otherwise you use it or lose it. And so March quarter is sequentially down in that segment because of the budget flush. -- And so on my follow-up, Steve, is the -- let's say, do have a trade resolution in the next few weeks, do you think there is a potential for an inventory refill or do you think the industry is shipping to consumption right now, so we should not be modeling any better than seasonal quarters going forward? -- I don't know about how everybody else is doing. So I will just speak for Microchip rather than the industry. A settlement of trade would be a bonanza. Our customers and distributors are so cautious, there is low visibility, they're building their bonds what the need for the backlog from their customers, nobody wants to get stuck with anything depending on what happens. If the trade talks are federal (ph) prior to March 1, this will be a big bonanza. -- Yes, I think I'd just add to that is you can tell from our last two quarters of actual results where our end market demand was higher than what the sell-in revenue was, there's definitely a bleed down of the distribution inventory and we don't think that the end customer is probably any different although we don't get real data points on that. -- Yes. So we are not shipping to consumption, as you said. We're shipping well below consumption. -- Okay. Bonanza sounds good. Thank you.We'll take our next question from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. -- Yes, good afternoon guys. Thanks for letting me ask some questions. I guess, Eric, you said in your prepared comments you made the comment that the guide for the March quarter on the revenue is wider than normal. Can me help me understand to what extent is that just a reflection of how uncertain this environment is and to what extent is that just a reflection of having now to guide to sort of the sell-in revenue. And as we think about future quarters, is this now the right range of guidance around the midpoint you're going to give us or is this just a wider because of uncertainty? -- I believe it is a combination of both, right. I mean, we haven't given guidance historically based on sell-in. So this is new to Microchip and we don't feel that we have a good way to understand if distribution inventory is going to increase or decrease in the period. So that as a factor, but obviously the environment is very uncertain. So I can't parse it out in terms of what percentage is each but this is a pretty broad range of guidance... -- Yes. So I think I would just say maybe sticking my neck out a little bit that, you know, over time I think we will learn to have the guidance narrower. We have a very broad distribution. We do business with over 100 distributors around the world, which is not the case with many other semiconductor players that do business with largely three or four large distributors. As you know, in the past we have large distributors which we call global distributors. We have catalog houses and we have nearly 80 to 100 distributors in China alone. So our distribution network is very, very broad and to really figure out what everybody is going to buy, those are not the processes we've worked on in the past.We don't really care what distributor buys, we care about what distributor sells out and our processes that care of that. So we will get better at it very rapidly. We're not saying years, we're saying quarters. We'll get better at it and the guidance will narrow. And the other impact is the uncertain environment, once the environment gets more certain I think we will narrow it also. -- I think another contributing factor is that lead times are very, very short today, right. So backlog visibility is not great. -- That's helpful. Then maybe my follow-up guys. I just wanted to go back to the gross margin. A couple of other questions were asked around that. I'm just kind of curious, given that, Steve, you mentioned you are under shipping demand today in conjunction with sort of the slowdown, the industry level, you are also working through some excesses that the Microsemi business had when you bought it. I'm just kind of curious, how should we be thinking about utilization now, have you done all the utilization adjustments you needed to and I guess more importantly, as business comes back and you benefit from increasing utilization and some of the more in-sourcing activity you're doing, how do we think about kind of that long-term target gross margin because relative to that 63% you've talked about, you're not too far away in what's really, you know, rather a lackluster business environment. Is 63% the right margin to think about or could it be higher? -- Good question, as always. You know, just keep that question on the back of your mind and I think as we get further, as we establish 63% then we will assess further. Right now, especially Microsemi factories are significantly under-loaded because we first corrected the distribution inventory and then the internal inventories were much higher. The internal inventories from Microsemi that we inherited are lot higher than really the level of inventory at Microchip. So we have a number of factories running at 50% capacity, number of them are running something higher than that. So, overall utilization is very low.But -- and I made this point last quarter, you know, I think only about 10% to 20% of -- 15% of Microsemi business is done in the internal factories, the rest come from the foundries. So from foundries we have aggressively cut the starts and assembly and test loading to really bring that down rapidly at subcontractors. Internal, we have carried in the factories are running below capacity and when the business comes back, we get some improvement from utilization from the internal factories, but they were only 15% of Microsemi business, they are only probably 5% of our business, total Microchip, so just be careful. -- Thank you.We'll take our next question from Harsh Kumar with Piper Jaffray. -- Hi, one for Steve and one for Eric. Steve, I wanted to ask about your comment about marking the bottom in March. Couple of other broad companies have said the same thing. But they're usually talking about either some sort of stabilization in backlog or some kind of metric that they're watching and monitoring. I'm also -- when you make that statement, I'm also hearing sort of Ganesh in response to a question said things are still getting worse in some of the markets. So I'm curious if you have any kind of tangible data in terms of either backlog or orders or something else you could point to and do you think the China industry is sort of flushed at this point in time and that's where we are basically shipping to true demand and maybe under-shipping and that's the reason why you feel better about it? And then I've got a follow-up for Eric. -- So I would say some of the data center and other business you are talking about, they are also down somewhat seasonally and they are weaker seasonally because March quarter is weak compared to September and December quarters in which year-end shipments happen. But I think the question you're really asking is what gives us the confidence that the March quarter will mark the bottom. Is that the question? -- Yes. -- Okay. So I think I would say we really can't present to you enough data to convince you and we're not going to try. What we can tell you is that our current backlog for June quarter is about flat with the backlog we had for the March quarter on November 5. Okay? So, that may look flat, but then you have to look at after November 5th, we had a bunch of holidays, you know, Thanksgiving, Christmas and then Chinese New Year in the March quarter. There are no major holidays for June quarter. So, starting with a flat backlog and going into the stronger quarters without the holidays, that's why we say barring any significantly negative developments from the trade negotiations with China, you know, we believe the June quarter will strengthen or we are confident that it should not be sequentially down again.But the second point I would say, Harsh, is and I don't mean this for all the analysts and for all the investors. There are lots of them that have followed us for a long time and believe the calls we make, but there is -- there are lot of the others who don't. We have made numerous calls in the last 15 years or so for the business environment to turn negative and then turn positive. When we first make a negative call, first it is not believed, it's even ridiculed few times. Then three to fourth months later, what we say gets confirmed and everybody goes down.Then comes a recovery part of the call, it is not believed either. As we go on the road over and over and over, we get the question, what gives you the confidence and we answer it. That is not believed either. So to my recollection, we have not been wrong in 15 plus years in calling the downturn and we have not been wrong in the same time frame calling the upturn, and that's what gives us the confidence. As you say in your business, past performance is no guarantee of the future results. So we don't guarantee anything. So, of course our confidence is subject to some number of risks, but I think that's the narrative I like to explain. -- That's very helpful actually. And then question for Eric was, how much free cash flow do you expect by your calculation to be available for debt payment in March? And if that's the base level number and we expect business to better so we can get an idea of what you're kind of going to be able to do hopefully going forward if nothing macro changes? -- Sure. So we expect somewhere between say $175 million and $200 million of debt pay down in the current quarter. The last two quarters were significantly higher than that. I would say that we obviously are coming off where our accounts receivable is down quarter-over-quarter. We had some very good help from some of our customers and some of our vendors in terms of payment terms and negotiating that and really making significant progress compared to what our guidance was in the December quarter, but we don't really have those levers to pull in the current quarter. So I don't think I'd use that $175 million to $200 million as kind of an ongoing run rate. We do expect that it will get significantly better from this point forward, but we'll continue to focus really all of our excess cash generation outside of the dividend on paying down debt. -- Thanks guys. Thank you for the color.We'll go to William Stein with SunTrust for our next question. -- Hi, thanks for taking my question. Steve. I'd like to maybe take a different approach to the sort of cycle and recovery question. Acknowledging that you've tended to call these turns early and correct. I just want to understand what's giving you the confidence from the perspective of trade? We have this March 1 deadline hanging over us and it sounds like you're providing us with some, not guidance, but some sense of demand post March quarter that implies this gets resolved constructively and I'm just wondering why you're -- why you feel confident to do that? And then I have a follow-up, please. -- I don't know if that's what I'm saying. Actually I'm seeing very clearly that barring any significant negative developments on the trade front, there was a caveat in what I said. What I also said was that I think with a month to go to March 1, I think the governments are making progress, the positive signal is coming out of the White House. You recall how negatively signals were coming out regarding Canada during one of the conferences I think and then all of sudden a week later it all came out good. So, Trump has used that strategy in a way and then not those negative signals coming about China. So I think the progress must be good, but it's a lot of work to get done and I'm simply saying it's most likely that there is some positive announcement, but the actual settlement gets pushed out further. If settlement gets pushed out further, the environment we're seeing remains. Our guidance assumes a fairly current environment continuing and if that current environment continues, then June quarter is still greater than March quarter. -- Okay, thanks for that. One other question on the Microsemi integration. I know that -- I recall they acquired Vectron lower margin business right before you acquired the whole company and that was a -- they never even reported a quarter with that asset and there were some other things in their portfolio that might not have met Microchip's, I don't know, view of a great business to be in. I'm wondering if you've made any portfolio adjustments, if you've closed any of their businesses so that we can think about it maybe a different margin profile or growth profile when demand normalizes and all the inventory adjustments are made? Thank you. -- We have not. We have not sold any of the businesses. We have not closed any of the Vectron factories. We're running the business. You are correct that the business is at a lower gross margin. By using our usual techniques, we are trying to improve the gross margin through ASP management. They also -- Microsemi had cut some expenses and we have cut some. So the contribution to EBITDA is actually much higher than really where it was originally. But the gross margins, if you only focus on that, then the gross margins are lower.We have other businesses at Microchip where the gross margins are lower than our corporate margin. There are also many businesses that are higher in 70s and 80s. So at the end of the day, it's a mix. -- There's a question (inaudible) Vectron. In the last two conference calls, we've also mentioned as part of our integration efforts, we have reviewed every single business. And while there are many, many excellent businesses, there were some that needed improvement and we have made adjustments in terms of level of investment we're making in those businesses to be better overall results for us as well. So, but that's all largely behind us at this point. As Steve mentioned, on Vectron and all the other businesses, we are working on improving what we inherited and making significant progress toward it. -- And when the factories come back to full production as we take out this excess inventories, the Vectron business will see substantial cost reduction through higher utilization in that factory, their numbers are going to start looking much better. -- Great, thank you.We'll now take a question from Chris Caso with Raymond James. -- Yes, thank you. Good evening. Just wanted to ask a question about revenue geographically. And I guess that we probably anticipate some of the weakness that you've seen in Asia that you talked about before, it look like from the results that you saw a downtick in Europe also. Can you talk about that and if there's anything specific geographically, you're anticipating as you go into the March quarter? -- I can take that. So I mean, all geographies were down, we posted this on our website. So it's available for everybody to see and it will be in our 10-Q filing, but all geographies were down. It is not unusual, all four of the Americas and Europe to be down in the December quarter just because of all the holidays and typically we see strength from Asia in that time period prior to leading into the Chinese New Year in the current quarter. But I think all geographies were weak. This weakness was not just a China issue, it's kind of spread across the globe. And in terms of forecast for the next quarter, the current quarter that we're in, we don't really break out the forecast by product line or geography. -- Well, I think directionally in the March quarter usually our European business is strong. Our China business is weak because of Chinese New Year, even in a normal time, we're also dealing with trade here and the US business is kind of normal. So I think directionally you can have that. -- Okay. Just as a follow-up. The follow-up question's on revenue linearity through the quarter and kind of expectations for March as well. And you mentioned last quarter that you saw a slight uptick, I guess, in the first month of the quarter. I presume that downtick toward the end of the quarter and then how do you typically see linearity as you go through the March quarter, again, taking into consideration the Chinese New Year holiday in the middle? -- Well, so I think the uptick we talked about in bookings in November call basically did not hold. I think you have heard from everybody that December was fairly weak. That's always the problem in making decisions based on very short-term data and I said that earlier that our bookings have normalized. Very lately we have even seen some strength, but don't take it to the bank yet, I'm not taking to the bank. We have made the call today at the midpoint down about 3.5% sequentially from GAAP to GAAP revenue. This does not include any dramatic improvement of bookings or improvement of trade or anything like that. I think it's just assumes that the market stays in the doldrums. -- Okay, understood. Thank you.Our next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. -- Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. In terms of executing on the March quarter guide and maybe providing the team with a bit more confidence on the June quarter kind of qualitative outlook, historically how much changes upon the replenishment rates post Chinese New Year and when do you typically get these signals, is it two weeks, three weeks after Chinese New Year? -- So, March quarter sometimes lands up very much depending on where the Chinese New Year falls based on the lunar calendar. Earlier the Chinese New Year, the better the March quarter usually lands up being because Chinese customers kind of go slow before that then they come back and then they see all charged up and ramp up the factories. So Chinese New Year is happening this week, which we will consider kind of early because it can be -- late February can even be fairly late, but it has been even earlier sometime in late January, but this is really early to mid. So this is good sign and we will see what happens after Chinese New Year. -- Okay, I appreciate the insights there. I know you guys are waiting for the Gartner data, but just looking at the recent SIA data, the MCU segment was down about 4% sequentially in Q4 versus your MCU business, which was down about 9% sequentially. I know you guys look at this data as well. Any reason for the big delta, is it sell-in versus sell-through, so not a fair comparison? -- I think in any given quarter, you're going to find that the data is more noisy. It's easier to look at these on a four-quarter rolling basis and that's what we expect when we will see the 2018 data. So there is no doubt in our mind we're gaining market share, but quarter to quarter, the numbers can be more noisy. -- Thank you.Our next question will come from Gil Alexandre with Darphil. -- Good evening. -- Hello, Gil. -- Good evening. -- Good evening. -- Nice work. -- Thank you. -- (inaudible) it seems that your 300 synergies is pretty good number looking for fiscal '21 or '22. -- So what I would say to that is we are ahead of the accretion target today, just because in some cases we have pulled some of the synergies in, it has gone better in terms of integration, but we haven't revised the final number. The other major change that happened is this business environment recession that we're going through that we have not built into the forecast. Nobody had anticipated back then. It will depend on the shape of the recovery. If the recovery is fast like it has happened in some prior cycles and we get back on that schedule. If the recovery is lot slower and it's kind of L-shaped recovery, it stays in doldrums for the year then the schedule for achieving that may have to be adjusted. But I don't think we're uncomfortable with the number, total accretion. -- So it really means that you get $8 non-GAAP earnings in fiscal '21 or '22, or you could? -- Well, you're putting words in my mouth, but that was our forecast then and again, depending on the shape of the recovery that is still our target. -- Okay. And your long-term model targets are stayed the same as you made in March of 2018? -- Correct. I think -- state them again for everybody. -- So it is 63% gross margin, 22.5% operating expenses and 40.5% operating margin on a non-GAAP basis. -- Yes, thank you. -- And do I need to be concerned that autos represent 17% of your mix? -- Autos has been a very good business and you shouldn't be concerned. We have just tremendous funnel of the design wins in automotive for future and all that, significant entry into various electric vehicles around the world and autonomous vehicles around the world. So there is really no reason to be concerned. The issue in automotive market have been two. One is Europe implemented a new emission standard for their diesel vehicle starting September 1 and all the agencies had a one-year notice, they knew a year ahead of time that the new emission standard will go into effect on September 1, 2018.September 1, 2018 came and there was no capacity. People kind of just felt sleep on the switch. So there were millions of cars taking away airport parking lots that can't be on the road because they don't pass emission standard. So that created a significant dislocation in the European car market. It's working through, it will take more time to work through all that. So that was one issue. And the second issue was the slowdown in China. China is now the largest automotive market, larger than US and larger than Europe and China is going through its own issues of slowdown and stock market crash and some of the people's wealth have been affected. So the China automotive market, all that will come back. -- And Gil, if I can add one more point. The consumption of electronics going into cars continues to go up year after year after year. So -- and in many years that consumption of electronics going up offsets any reduction in production as well. And so, that's been the long-term trend and it remains so. -- I thank you very much. Good work. -- Thank you, Gil. Nice to hear you on the call. -- Thank you.We'll take our next question from Kevin Cassidy with Stifel. -- Thanks for taking my questions. Hi, Steve. Maybe just on the 32-bit micro traction that you're seeing, can you say what end markets it is, maybe your discussion around automotive maybe that plays into it. But can you say which end markets you're gaining the traction? -- We're broadly represented, the 32-bit microcontroller market, the standard products are broadly represented in all the end markets, it's a ubiquitous product. I can't pick any one of them that's necessarily the one that's going there, but we've been coming off of a -- being lower in the rankings, we're rapidly coming up the rankings and as we do that it has to come from all the different segments that we plan. -- Okay, great. And maybe is there such a thing as an upgrade from your 8- and 16-bit customers going to 32, is that helping your traction? -- No, not at all. I think the 8- and 16-bits are continuing to do well. And again when you see the annual results for 2018, you'll see that all three segments as it was in prior years are doing well. The 32-bit, we have more capabilities that have come both organically as well as through the acquisitions. It's allowing us to play in a number of incremental markets that perhaps we couldn't get to a few years ago. And so I think the point of providing some color was there was a sense of perhaps 32-bit was still very small for us, we've been just playing in 8- and 16s. 32-bit at over $1.2 billion annualized base in the last two quarters is a pretty significant portion of a $3 billion plus annualized microcontroller market for us. -- Okay, thank you. Congratulations. -- Thanks.We'll go next to Chris Rolland with Susquehanna. -- Hi, Steve. So regardless of the SEC opinion this analyst supports the standard should be sell-through for what it's worth, but in terms of the question, now that we're a few quarters into Microsemi what has been the biggest positive surprise for you in terms of products and traction and demand for those products positively since you guys closed? -- I would say that we confirm usually a lot of positives after we close the acquisition. We don't usually find new positive because the management is always, you know, those are the positives they bring out and they are selling of the company, so there isn't (ph) not hidden positive. We usually find some new negatives that we may not have known or may not have fully understood or may not have been fully explained as you have seen. But on the positive side, we don't get surprises, but we get confirmation.And here as I said, we've got a very good confirmation. The products are very good, customers sockets are very sticky in discrete military products, in FPGAs sockets, and a lot of the analog sockets, in timing business, and data center businesses and they are very good businesses, a good sticky socket, very complex products as well as very simple discrete products. So it has a range of products and very, very good engineering teams, and very, very good work done and I think we have continuously said that we feel very good about it, business fits very well with Microchip.We have truly enhanced the ASPs and gross margins by our methodology of discontinuing some of the discounts and all that. We've brought the inventories to the right levels. Internal inventory, we're still working through as we reramp the factories, I think that will have some more positive effect. So all that is very good. I think we feel good about where we are. -- Great. And then on some of the PMCS products whether it's optical or storage, given kind of the well-known storage slowdown trends that we've seen out there more broadly and then some guys talking about a data center slowdown or hyperscale digestion out there, have you seen any of this at all and have you seen that play into either optical or storage for you guys? -- I think built into our guidance for this quarter, as I mentioned earlier, does reflect that there is some weakness in those two segments, in communications and data center. It's not different from what others have been talking about as well and we are seeing that in the Microsemi products that play into those segments. -- But I don't think anybody questions the strength of data center or communication markets as a good market longer term. Any segment is going to go through inventory digestion and cycles. The question we were dealing with was, is Microsemi a good business? Is it the right acquisition? A short-term cycle coming in and having some hyperscale digestion for a quarter or two will not really factor into our decision. I think this will be a very good business long-term. -- Thanks, guys.Our next question will come from Rajvindra Gill with Needham & Company. -- Yes, thanks for taking my questions and forgive me if this question was asked because I am joining late. But I was wondering if you could -- if you can make a distinction between any potential trade settlement or trade agreement versus the actual deceleration that's happening in the Chinese economy. So meaning, if there is some sort of trade settlement, what impact would that have in the business environment or is it just maybe taking one risk off the table, but the reality is that the economy is slowing down dramatically and the trade agreement would really more have a sentiment improvement, but nothing really changing in terms of actual business. Just wondering if you could -- maybe if you could just elaborate on that. -- So, Rajvi, I think our assessment is that trade is the problem why Chinese economy is weakening so much. China has been the production center for the world. And as these trades came in, Chinese goods became more expensive and threatened to go more expensive with $200 billion of Chinese goods getting 25% tariff, that's a $50 billion tax. So companies have moved production out of China to the extent they could, to the extent the product was running in two different factories and one was outside, but there is just not enough capacity outside of China to take all that outside, but there are lots of them in works.With the tariffs, Chinese stock market has taken a major hit and Chinese consumers use the stock market as the cash machine to run their businesses and buy cars and buy stuff. So I think you cannot take (ph) the trade issue away from the Chinese economy. As the trade issues settle, that is a boost of the Chinese economy will need. And then the people have to think about, do they stop taking factories outside of China or with the trade talks settled, all their efforts stops. I can't know what would have happen there. Is there a a future risk? If there is complete removal of trade barriers, then I think nobody is going to do the work to move the factories outside if the settlement happens whether there is significant barrier on both sides, then all that will continue. -- That's helpful. And along those same lines, do you think there will be some sort of fiscal stimulus in addition to the -- if there is a trade agreement, a fiscal stimulus coming out of the Chinese government? -- I thought (ph) there already was one. -- Yes, some small ones that have been done, but we don't have any inside knowledge... -- Post New Year, post Chinese New Year? -- I think that was one small one done, but I would think, yes, if there is a settlement and trade post Chinese New Year, you know, whenever Chinese economy has been weak, that's what they have done, stimulus for various things. That's largely predictable. And I don't know, I don't have a line to the premier, but I think that's probably what would happen. -- Okay, thank you.We'll take our next question from Janet Ramkissoon with Quadra Capital. -- Hi, Janet, long time no see. -- Yes. I was still there as a shareholder, Steve, very happy. Just a question about the China again. Could you comment on the business with ZTE in the quarter. Did you see a recovery there? And do you have any exposure, specifically to Huawei? -- So ZTE had no restrictions in the quarter and our business was normal. I think we've said in the prior quarter, there was some demand destruction where during the time ZTE couldn't build the product, they lost some designs and competitor picked it up and in certain cases we got designed with the competitor also, in certain cases we did not. But ZTE business is kind of normal. The Huawei business is normal. There is a lot of talk about US indictments and CFO has been detained in Canada. There has been no impact of any of that on the Huawei business yet. -- Thanks very much, appreciate it. -- You're welcome.Our next question will come from Craig Ellis with B. Riley FBR. -- Thanks for taking the question. Steve, I wanted to go back to the issue of integration with Microsemi a bit, approach it more qualitatively than quantitatively understanding that you're not changing any targets at this point. So as we look at calendar 2019, can you just touch on what the key integration milestones are, objectives are, top two or three for sales items and channel management. Then the follow-up, obviously right now it's similar, if we looked lower on the income statement at manufacturing and operating expenses, what would be some of the key issues you'd want to tackle this year in those areas as well? -- Well, we are moving forward on a very, very wide beachfront, so pick one. When we bought Microsemi, Microsemi compiled their results on 21 different ERP systems, business unit by business unit and then they compiled, (inaudible) like a conglomerate. We -- the companies we have brought, we have brought them all into our enterprise system and ran a single enterprise system for years and years. With Microsemi, we have said we are going to go down to two systems. I would love to go down to one, but the work was just too much.So we were 22, one of ours and 21 of Microsemi. From 22, we will go down to two, and we're making progress. We took one business into our system on November 1. We took three on February 1. We have another three years or so planned for May 1 and then there will be a cadence of these go-live every quarter. In another 12 to 18 months, we will consolidate. So that's a huge project with lots of synergy and accretion coming from that.The business units in terms of the marketing and design and pipelines and integration with our technologies and factories and all that is largely some done, some ongoing. Most of Microsemi parts are not going to come into our factories like PMC-Sierra parts, they run in foundries and FPGA parts are run in foundries and they are not going to come in, inside but certain products of other business units may come in and that's an ongoing process.As far as sales is concerned, sales all work for a common sales leader. So that's already done. The biggest job in sales is cross-training and cross-pollinating. So a Microchip sales person feel very confident selling Microsemi products and a total system solution gets all those designed in and vice versa, a Microsemi person feels very confident with Microchip. With $4 billion company on one side, $2 billion company other side, that takes some time and that's progressing. And how we kind of make it work is really is a team where you call on the expert from the Microchip side or the Microsemi side to make that join call so you start to get to total system solution effect and that we're already getting. The reviews we see from various businesses in the Microsemi reviews we see Microchip parts designed in, in the future boards and on the Microchip reviews, we see that Microsemi parts are designed in. So that is starting to happen, but lot more needs to happen. -- That's helpful. And on that last point, Steve, is that something that will bear fruit from a revenue standpoint this year or does that just put you in a position where you've got the design win and then you work through what can often be 12 to 18 month gestation period before that design would go to revenue? -- It's the latter. The designs take about nine months to two years to go to production depending on how complex it is. You could have a very simple some discrete parts such something are designed in, there could be faster, but they're complicated products which would be longer. So it's really yes, there's a gestation period after you get the design in. You should see some revenue coming out of TSS in 2020 and then it accelerates from there. -- Thank you very much and good luck.That concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back to Mr. Steve Sanghi for any additional or closing remarks. -- Well, we want to thank everyone for joining this call today and we'll be seeing some of you between now and the next conference call on the road, there are various conferences we'll be going to. So, thank you.This concludes today's call.

" recently provided an update on fourth-quarter fiscal 2019 outlook.The company now anticipates fourth-quarter revenues to be in the band of $1.279 billion to $1.375 billion, compared with prior range of $1.251-$1.403 billion. Notably, the change in the guided range reflects unchanged mid-point of $1.327 billion.Per the press release, management notes that it is revising the range of revenues, as it is skeptical of whether there will be an addition or reduction in inventory levels at its distributors.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.33 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 32.6%.Non-GAAP earnings per share have now been forecast in the range of $1.30-$1.49 per share, compared with the previous guided range of $1.26-$1.53. In this case as well, the change in the guided range reflects unchanged midpoint of $1.395 per share.Notably, in the past couple of months, analysts have become increasingly cautious on Microchip's financial performance with estimates moving south and no movement in the opposite direction.In fact, in the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current quarter earningsmoved down 10.9% to $1.31 per share. The consensus estimates indicate decline of 1.7% from the year-ago quarter.Microchip's CEO, Steve Sanghi believes that excluding further negative developments pertaining to trade war between the United States and China, ""the March 2019 quarter will mark the bottom of the current cycle for Microchip.""Coming to share price performance, Microchip stock has plunged 7.1% in the past year, compared with  's decline of 4.4%.The company provided no other updates on the remaining financial metrics. Per the previous guidance, management anticipated non-GAAP gross margin in the 61.2-61.8% range. Non-GAAP operating expenses, as percentage of sales, are projected at 25.8-26.5%, and operating margin is expected at 34.7-36%.Microchip's inventory days in the impending quarter are expected between 123 and 133 days. Capital expenditures are estimated in the range of $50 million.Microchip delivered third-quarter fiscal 2019 non-GAAP earnings of $1.66 per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $1.57 per share. The figure was also above the higher end of management's guided range of $1.49-$1.64 per share and surged from $1.36 per shares reported in the year-ago quarter.The year-over-year upside was driven by higher net sales, increasing 42.4% from the year-ago quarter to $1.416 billion on a non-GAAP basis. The figure also marginally outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.402 billion and was toward the higher end of management's guided range of $1.362-$1.438 billion. The company benefited from robust demand for 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers.Microchip's strength in microcontroller business holds promise in the longer haul. We believe the company is well poised to capitalize on Microsemi's growth catalysts. Apart from a robust portfolio, the buyout is likely to expand Microchip's total addressable markets.However, management remains cautious over few emerging concerns. Increasing lead time, slim demand trends in ZTE and Bitcoin business domains are headwinds. Further, significant exposure to Asian markets amid imposition of tariff owing to trade war between the United States and China remains an overhang.Furthermore, unfavorable movement in exchange rates continue to adversely impact the top line of the company and undermine its growth potential to some extent. Microchip has a highly leveraged balance sheet which adds to its woes.Currently, Microchip carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Cadence Design Systems, Inc  , Synopsys, Inc.  and Symantec Corporation  , each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

The figure also marginally surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.402 billion and was toward the higher end of management's guided range of $1.362-$1.438 billion. | In terms of product line, microcontroller business (52.9% of non-GAAP net sales) decreased 8.7% sequentially to $748.4 million. However, revenues from microcontroller went up 13.2% on a year-over-year basis.Analog net sales came in at $411.8 million (29.1%), down 6.2% sequentially but surged 77.9% on a year-over-year basis. Synergies from Microsemi buyout aided growth across both the domains on a year-over-year basis. Notably, the sequential decline can be attributed to macroeconomic weakness.We believe Microchip is well poised to capitalize on Microsemi's growth catalysts. Apart from a robust portfolio, the buyout is likely to expand Microchip's total addressable markets. Strong demand for Microsemi's solutions in Data Center, Communications, Defense & Aerospace markets is likely to aid Microchip's long-term growth prospects.FPGA revenues (7%) came in at $99.2 million and surged 8.7% sequentially. Robust adoption of company's low power PolarFire solutions was noteworthy.Licensing segment (2.8%) reported non-GAAP revenues of $40.1 million, increasing 7.9% sequentially, primarily on account of patent license sale and strength in royalty revenues.Memory business (2.8%) declined 15% sequentially to $40.1 million.MMO or multi-market and other business unit revenues (5.4%) were down 3% from the previous quarter.Geographically, revenues from Americas, Europe and Asia contributed 25.4%, 20.4% and 54.2% of total revenues, respectively.Portfolio expansion across majority of the operating domains bode well. The company recently partnered Google Cloud to launch the latest AVR-IoT WG Development Board with a fully certified Wi-Fi network controller to provide a simple and effective way to connect embedded applications.Recently, Microchip announced availability of the SAM R34/35 which integrates ultra-low-power 32-bit MCU, sub-GHz RF LoRa transceiver and software stack.Microchip unveiled the first RISC-V SoC Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) architecture. The company also announced the availability of Intelligent Network Interface Controller networking (INICnet) technology to support all data types, including audio, video, control and Ethernet, over a single cable.Further, the company introduced the single-chip MXT2912TD-A and MXT2113TD-A for touch screens up to 20 inches in size. Microchip announced availability of MPLAB X Integrated Development Environment (""IDE"") version 5.05 that supports AVR MCUs.Moreover, the company unveiled the PolarFire FPGA burst mode receiver (""BMR"") solution primarily for 10G passive optical network execution.The company also introduced new MCP6V51 zero-drift operational amplifier to enhance the high-frequency noise in regular life and work environment.Microchip reported non-GAAP gross margin of 62.2%, expanding 80 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis.Non-GAAP operating expenses, as percentage of revenues, were up 280 bps year over year to 24.8%. The increase was primarily due to higher research & development (R&D) and selling, general & administrative (SG&A) expenses.Consequently, non-GAAP operating margin contracted 200 bps from the year-ago quarter to 37.4%.The company exited the quarter under review with $436.2 million of cash and short-term investments as compared to $464.2 million reported in the previous quarter. Total debt (long plus current portion) amounted to $10.54 billion as compared with $10.9 billion in the previous quarter.Notably, the company paid $377.5 million of total debt during the quarter.During the reported quarter, Microchip generated $481.5 million of operating cash flow.The company announced a quarterly cash dividend of 36.45 cents per share, payable on Mar 7, 2019.Microchip forecasts fourth-quarter fiscal 2019 net sales of $1.251-$1.403 billion (mid-point $1.327 billion). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $1.39 billion.For the fourth quarter, non-GAAP earnings are anticipated in the range of $1.26-$1.53 per share (mid-point $1.395 billion). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $1.57 per share.Non-GAAP gross margin is anticipated in the 61.2-61.8% range. Non-GAAP operating expenses, as percentage of sales, are projected at 25.8-26.5%, and operating margin is expected at 34.7-36%.Microchip's inventory days in the impending quarter are expected between 123 and 133 days. Capital expenditures are estimated in the range of $50 million.For fiscal 2019, capital expenditures are projected to be $235 million.While Microchip is benefiting from acquisition synergies particularly from Microsemi and Atmel, and a robust microcontroller business, management remains cautious over few emerging concerns.Increasing lead time and significant exposure to Asian markets, particularly the trade war woes are anticipated to be a headwind.Slim demand trends in ZTE and Bitcoin business domains, and leveraged balance sheet remain major concerns.Microchip carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Symantec Corporation  , salesforce.com, inc.  and Guidewire Software, Inc.  , each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see Symantec, salesforce and Guidewire have a long-term earnings growth rate of 7.9%, 24.2% and 8%, respectively.Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

" is scheduled to release third-quarter fiscal 2019 results on Feb 5.The company has outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, recording average positive surprise of 4.13%.In the las  ed quarter, the company delivered non-GAAP earnings of $1.81 per share that surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7 cents. The figure also jumped 28.4% on a year-over-year basis.The year-over-year upside was driven by higher net sales, which increased 49.5% from the year-ago quarter to $1.513 billion on a non-GAAP basis. The figure comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of$1.512 billion.Microchip forecasts third-quarter fiscal 2019 net sales of $1.362-$1.438 billion (mid-point $1.4 billion). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $1.402 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of almost 41%.For the fiscal third quarter, non-GAAP earnings are anticipated in the range of $1.49-$1.64 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.57 per share, indicating year-over-year growth of 15.4%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Microchip's microcontroller business (54.3% of second-quarter sales) continues to outperform the industry and has enabled it to gain significant market share. In the second quarter, segment revenues (GAAP) increased 17% year over year to $778.4 million.Portfolio expansion across majority of the operating domains bode well. Notably, Microchip is now focusing on improving driving experience to strengthen its position in producing autonomous vehicle controllers.In fact, the company unveiled cost-effective three-dimensional (3D) gesture recognition controller, MGC3140, which offers a robust single-chip solution for sophisticated automotive HMI designs. The new solution is aimed at reducing driver distractions, in turn enhancing the in-car capability of the drivers.Robust adoption of company's low power PolarFire solutions is a positive. Recently, Microchip also announced availability of MPLAB X Integrated Development Environment (IDE) version 5.05, that support AVR family of the company's MCUs.The company added two new devices, ATtiny3217 and ATtiny3216, with highly developed analog features to its tiny AVR MCU series. These are aimed at developing highly responsive sensor nodes.The new solutions are anticipated to generate incremental revenues, consequently favoring the top line. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for microcontroller revenues is pegged at $737 million for the third quarter. | Acquisitions like Microsemi, SMSC, ISSC, Micrel and Atmel have expanded Microchip's product portfolio and continue to aid the top line. Additionally, strong demand for Microsemi's solutions in Data Center, Communications, Defense & Aerospace markets make us optimistic about the company's prospects.Further, collaborations with the likes of Amazon's  and Sony  augur well for the company. Notably, the company has collaborated with Amazon Web Services (""AWS"") to support AWS offerings and develop secure cloud systems.In fact, Microsemi, Microchip's subsidiary recently announced that AcuEdgeZLK38AVS Development Kit for Amazon Alexa Voice Service (""AVS"") could showcase far-field voice pick up and various mic array configurations.Additionally, Microchip unveiled IS2064GM-0L3, a Bluetooth 5-compliant System-on-Chip (SoC) compatible with Sony's advanced LDAC audio codec technology.Robust collaborations and strategic buyouts are expected to aid the company in expanding business and total addressable market (TAM), consequently favoring top-line growth.The company continues to capitalize on enhancing its solution range and improving capacity constraints along with design wins. This provides Microchip a competitive edge in the semiconductor industry.However, increasing lead time, slim demand trends in ZTE and Bitcoin business domains are headwinds. Further, imposition of tariff owing to trade war between the United States and China has been taking a toll on chipmakers for a while now and remains a concern.According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive  .

Another winning day for the market means all of the losses seen during the early part of Thanksgiving week have been wiped away. The 2.3% gain the  drove yesterday admittedly leaves it vulnerable to some profit-taking, but if nothing else a message has been sent to the doubters. (NASDAQ:  ) led the charge, gaining 6.1% on Wednesday on the heels of multiple announcements. One of them was news that the tech giant is  . The other biggie was news that the company was  that takes aim at  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ).There weren't many of them, but most noteworthy among the losers yesterday was the 11.8% tumble from  (NYSE:  ). The luxury brand  .Yesterday's volatility is often the kind that makes it tough to get a good read on stock charts, but  (NYSE:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NYSE:  ) have set up fairly reliable futures regardless of what the rest of the market does.After a rather torturous Q2 and Q3, Microchip Technology shares have mustered the respectable beginnings of a recovery. As of a couple of weeks ago though, the effort has hit a wall.Nevertheless, the odds of a rekindled recovery effort and the potential gain - should that take shape - are too compelling to pass up. That's especially true after Wednesday's trading.Click to Enlarge  • Since early November, MCHP stock has been trapped between a rising support line and a horizontal resistance level. Both are marked with a white dashed line.• Though range-bound, as of yesterday the blue 20-day moving average line is above the purple 50-day line, and Wednesday's bullishness unfurled on huge volume that so far had been missing.• If the ceiling at $76.08 can be cleared, the next most likely technical ceiling is around $86.50, where you'll find the 200-day moving average. The ultimate goal here, however, may be to fill August's bearish gap. That would bring MCHP to at least $96.58.Just because a stock loses ground on a day when the broad market gains doesn't inherently make that name a sell. On the other hand, when a stock fails to make forward progress on a day like Wednesday's or Tuesday's trading, something is decidedly wrong.That's Ralph Lauren shares, which have not only broken below the last-ditch technical support level identified  , but just squandered their best shot at a turnaround. The bearish clues, meanwhile, continue to pile up.Click to Enlarge  • The last-ditch support line in question was the 200-day moving average line, plotted in white. As of the 12th it was under attack, and failed to hold it up. RL hasn't closed above that line since then.• In the meantime, we've seen the blue 20-day moving average line move below the 200-day average, confirming the short-term momentum has turned bearish. Note the other moving average lines are also sloped downward.• Though we saw a hint of bullishness late last week and early this week, also notice how much bearish volume we saw before and after that brief bounce effort.Finally, though Masco shares were hit hard in September and October, a healthy rebound effort is underway. Not only was last month's reversal decisive, MAS shares have found support at a place where it was needed the most.Wednesday's bar, in the meantime, puts an exclamation point on the turnaround move.Click to Enlarge  • The new support line is the 20-day moving average line, plotted in blue. Once MAS got above it on Nov. 2, it has been almost a near-perfect floor while letting the bulls gear up for another leg higher.• Zooming into the daily chart of Masco, we can see the bears tried to drag the stock below the support being offered by the 20-day moving average line. With a little help from Jerome Powell, the bulls sent a clear message that it just wasn't going to happen. The buyers have fully tipped their hand.• Zooming back out to the weekly chart, we can see the two-bar reversal from late October and early November.

icrochip Technology (MCHP) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when i  s results for the quarter ended December 2018. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 5. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the  will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.This chipmaker is expected to pos  of $1.57 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +15.4%.Revenues are expected to be $1.40 billion, up 41% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks  (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce  , and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).For Microchip Tech, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Microchip Tech will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Microchip Tech would pos  of $1.74 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.81, delivering a surprise of +4.02%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our  to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Microchip Tech doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the Morningstar Wide Moat ETF (Symbol: MOAT), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $51.17 per unit.With MOAT trading at a recent price near $45.08 per unit, that means that analysts see 13.52% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of MOAT's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Microchip Technology Inc (Symbol: MCHP), KLA-Tencor Corp (Symbol: KLAC), and Biogen Inc (Symbol: BIIB). Although MCHP has traded at a recent price of $72.02/share, the average analyst target is 42.00% higher at $102.27/share. Similarly, KLAC has 38.41% upside from the recent share price of $92.32 if the average analyst target price of $127.78/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting BIIB to reach a target price of $386.16/share, which is 23.16% above the recent price of $313.55.

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 Value ETF (Symbol: SPYV), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $34.39 per unit.With SPYV trading at a recent price near $28.39 per unit, that means that analysts see 21.13% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of SPYV's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Microchip Technology Inc (Symbol: MCHP), Celanese Corp (Symbol: CE), and Affiliated Managers Group Inc. (Symbol: AMG). Although MCHP has traded at a recent price of $75.08/share, the average analyst target is 35.08% higher at $101.42/share. Similarly, CE has 28.68% upside from the recent share price of $94.65 if the average analyst target price of $121.80/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting AMG to reach a target price of $137.50/share, which is 28.32% above the recent price of $107.15. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of MCHP, CE, and AMG:Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
  
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past.

"Semiconductor stocks are presenting investors with a bit of a conundrum right now. Members of the chip space have some of the top-rated companies in terms of their fundamental indicators, but the charts for several semiconductor stocks are showing multiple layers of resistance that the stocks will have to fight through.The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) peaked at 1,464.61 in March before falling through late April. The index bounced back through May and early June and it was able to get back above the 1,425 level. The SOX was able to grind sideways through the summer, but the index fell sharply in October. It ended up falling over 16% from the beginning of the month through Oct. 29.The index itself has held up much better than some of its most prominent components. Since the March high, the SOX is down 16.9%.  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ) are all down considerably more than the index and yet they all have strong fundamental ratings.All five of these companies get an earnings-per-share rating of 85 or higher from  . That means they rank in the top 15% in terms of earnings growth over the last three years and in recent quarters. The companies also score an ""A"" in IBD's SMR rating system. The SMR rating scores companies with an A through an E rating based on the sales growth, profit margin and return on equity.With that in mind, here are five semiconductor stocks to keep an eye on as they try to power through significant resistance.Applied Materials gets an EPS rating of 85. The company has seen earnings grow by an average of 69% per year over the last three years. However, if we look at the weekly chart of AMAT stock, we see that the stock peaked in March and has been trending lower ever since. The chip stock is down 40% since that March peak. You can also see that AMAT stock has formed a downward sloped trend channel.AMAT has closed above its 13-week moving average since early April and that is the first layer of resistance it will have to overcome, then the upper rail of the channel will come in to play as the next resistance point. The stock has also fallen below its 52 and 104-week moving averages and those trendlines will also act as resistance points.Like some of the other semiconductor stocks on this list, Lam Research also scores an 85 in the EPS ratings and it has seen earnings grow at an annual rate of 53% over the last three years. LRCX stock has dropped 35% since peaking back in February.Like AMAT stock, LRCX stock has fallen below all of its weekly moving averages - the 13, 52 and 104-week. The 13-week has crossed bearishly below both the 52-week and the 104-week. Lam Research has also seen a trend channel form, so it has numerous layers of resistance it will have to break through in order to get back above the $200 mark. One particularly interesting point for the stock was in July when the LRCX stock price, the 13-week and the 52-week were all converging around the $186 level. The semiconductor stock closed above the two moving averages that week, but then fell nine of the next 13 weeks.Microchip scores a little better on the EPS rating with an 88. The average earnings growth rate over the last three years has been 38%, which is lower than AMAT and LRCX stock, but the most recent quarterly report showed growth of 28%, which was much better than those two. Unlike the other two chip stocks we have seen so far, MCHP stock peaked in early June. The stock is still down 23.4% from when the SOX peaked in March.Microchip has a downward sloped channel like the others, but it did manage to move back above its 13-week moving average. That still leaves the upper rail of the channel, the 104-week moving average and the 52-week moving average for MCHP stock to break through if it is going to reach the $100 mark again.Micron's EPS rating is even better than the other three semiconductor stocks mentioned on this list so far. MU stock scores a 96 in the rating system and its earnings growth has been incredible. The annual growth rate over the last three years has been 143% and EPS grew by 75% in the most recent quarterly report.Micron peaked at $64.66 back in late May. MU stock has fallen 43.4% from its own peak and it's down 38.4% from the March peak in the SOX. The first layer of resistance Micron will have to deal with is its 104-week moving average, which it has just recently fallen below. The 13-week moving average and the upper rail of its trend channel are in close proximity to one another, so that could be an especially difficult area for MU stock.Nvidia has the highest EPS rating of all five of the chip stocks with a 97. The company has seen its earnings grow by an average of 101% per year over the last three years and it saw them grow by 32% in the most recent quarterly report. The NVDA stock chart looks very different from the other semiconductor stocks' charts, as the stock didn't peak until the beginning of October. However, from its peak, NVDA stock has fallen 47.7% and it is down 38.7% since the SOX peaked in March.Because Nvidia has fallen so dramatically in the last few months, it doesn't have a trend channel like the other chip stocks on the list. However, what it has done that is similar to the other four chip stocks is fall below all three of its weekly moving averages. All three of those trendlines will now act as resistance levels if NVDA stock tries to rally. The abrupt decline has caused the 13-week moving average to cross bearishly below the 52-week. Unless the stock rallies sharply, the 13-week will fall below the 104-week in short order.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@5 Beaten-Down Semiconductor Stocks That Will Struggle to Rise Again@2018-11-28@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/5-beaten-down-semiconductor-stocks-will-struggle-rise-again-2018-11-28
"echnology offers some of the best investing opportunities today -- as well as some of the biggest potential pitfalls. New technologies such as cloud computing, AI, self-driving cars, and the  have mouth-watering long-term growth prospects. Of course, with such opportunities often come stretched valuations, and if a company hits a roadblock, the ensuing sell-off can be brutal.One of the best ways to figure out which trends are hot is to listen to the conference calls of companies with broad tech exposure. At the top of the list is  (NASDAQ: MCHP) , helmed by CEO Steve Sanghi. Microchip sells microcontrollers, analog, and field-programmable gate array [FPGA] chips to an extremely broad set of customers -- especially since its acquisition of Microsemi last spring.Because of its reach, Microchip gets an early look at demand trends in tech, often highlighting which sectors are growing and which are troubled well before others in the industry feel it. Here's what Sanghi and management had to say on Microchip's recent  with analysts.Tech investors can learn a lot from Microchip's conference calls. Image source: Getty Images.Microchip reported a better-than-expected third quarter. Non-GAAP revenue of $1.52 billion beat expectations by $10 million, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.81 beat expectations by $0.08. But for the December-ended quarter, Microchip projects revenue to decline sequentially to $1.36 billion to $1.44 billion, and earnings per share to decline to $1.49 to $1.64.The expected weakness next quarter is particularly telling. Microchip, like competitor  (NASDAQ: TXN) , derives a majority of its sales from the automotive and industrial segments. According to the company, the automotive segment is being hurt by delays in emissions testing in Europe (causing production bottlenecks) as well as weak demand in China. Meanwhile, trade-war-fueled tariffs have led to widespread caution across the industrial segment.On the bright side, data center and cloud computing continue to be strong, along with the smaller aerospace & defense and communications segments.So if you're invested in the automotive industry, especially with exposure to China and Europe, things may be a little dicey over the next few quarters. However, cloud data center companies seem likely to continue their strong trend.Sanghi explained that Microchip gets a particularly early look into demand trends: ""... numerous times in the past we have seen the impact of industry events about three, four months ahead of [when] the others see it. ... And now on the other side, we always come out earlier.""Unfortunately, Sanghi also said, ""We are not fully ready to talk about the other end of the cycle yet,"" which means the broad auto and industrial weakness could last into 2019.All this being said, Sanghi is confident in Microchip's products over the long term, citing the demand for microcontrollers, analog chips, Wi-Fi, ethernet, and Bluetooth connectivity:While Microchip surged almost 6% the day after earnings, the stock is still down over 25% from its 52-week highs. That could make the company a strong bounce-back candidate in the beaten-down semiconductor segment, if and when the cycle eventually turns around.Of note, Microchip made progress winding down the excess inventory built up in Microsemi's distribution channel last quarter. That was a  after the closing of the acquisition, and was explained in detail on  . However, Microchip was able to work down Microsemi's excess inventory from about four months to 2.6 months in just one quarter, in line with legacy Microchip levels. At the same time, Microchip eliminated Microsemi's policy of giving discounts to certain customers, without seeing a decline in demand. ""Fortunately, we are not easy to design out,"" said Sanghi.And there are more cost savings to be had. While the company has already made progress, management says it will take two years to get through all the integration work. Microchip is also making progress in paying down its $10.9 billion debt load, reducing net debt principal by $315.5 million in the quarter.While it's not a great thing to have such a large debt load while the economy hits a soft path, Microchip is highly profitable and should survive to the other side. Sanghi is a very straight shooter, and seems confident in the company's long-term prospects. Investors should be, too.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

" month has gone by since the last earnings report for Microchip Technology (MCHP). Shares have lost about 1.4% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Microchip Tech due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Microchip Technology Incorporated delivered second-quarter fiscal 2019 non-GAAP earnings of $1.81 per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7 cents. The figure was near the higher end of management's guided range of $1.65 to $1.83 per share and surged 28.4% from the year-ago quarter.The year-over-year upside was driven by higher net sales, which increased 49.5% from the year-ago quarter to $1.513 billion on a non-GAAP basis. Both the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues and the mid-point of management's guided range ($1.474-$1.550 billion) was pegged at $1.512 billion.In terms of product line, microcontroller business (54.2% of non-GAAP net sales) increased 12.6% sequentially to $820.1 million. Analog net sales came in at $328.5 million (29%) and surged 33.6% sequentially. Synergies from Microsemi buyout aided growth across both the domains.We believe Microchip is well poised to capitalize on Microsemi's growth catalysts. Apart from a robust portfolio, the buyout is likely to expand Microchip's total addressable markets. Strong demand for Microsemi's solutions in Data Center, Communications, Defense & Aerospace markets is likely to aid Microchip's long-term growth prospects.FPGA revenues (6%) came in at $91.3 million. Robust adoption of company's low power PolarFire solutions was noteworthy.Licensing segment (2.5%) reported non-GAAP revenues of $37.1 million which increased 40.3% sequentially, primarily owing to a patent license sale and strength in royalty revenues.Memory business (3%) declined 3.8% sequentially to $47.3 million.MMO or multi-market and other business unit revenues (5.2%) surged 90.7% from the previous quarter, primarily due to Microsemi contribution.Geographically, revenues from Americas, Europe and Asia contributed 25.1%, 22.5% and 52.4% of total revenues, respectively.Portfolio expansion across majority of the operating domains bode well. Recently, Microchip announced availability of MPLAB X Integrated Development Environment (""IDE"") version 5.05 that supports AVR MCUs.Microchip unveiled IS2064GM-0L3, a Bluetooth 5-compliant System-on-Chip (SoC) compatible with Sony's advanced LDAC audio codec technology. Further, the company introduced MCP39F511A, a flexible dual-mode power monitoring IC which provides accuracy for power measurement of both AC and DC modes.Notably, Microchip is now focusing on improving driving experience to strengthen its position in producing autonomous vehicle controllers. Toward this purpose, the company unveiled cost-effective three-dimensional (3D) gesture recognition controller, MGC3140, which offers a robust single-chip solution for sophisticated automotive HMI designs. The new solution is aimed at reducing driver distractions,in turn enhancing the in-car capability of the drivers.Microchip also added two new devices, ATtiny3217 and ATtiny3216, with highly developed analog features to its tiny AVR MCU series. These are aimed at developing highly responsive sensor nodes.Microchip posted non-GAAP gross margin of 61.7%, expanding 70 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis.Non-GAAP operating expenses, as percentage of revenues, were up 90 bps year over year to 23.4%. The increase was primarily due to higher research & development (R&D) expenses and selling, general & administrative (SG&A) expenses.Consequently, non-GAAP operating margin contracted 30 bps from the year-ago quarter to 38.3%.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowThe company exited the reported quarter with $464.2 million of cash and short-term investments as compared to $649.7 million reported in the previous quarter. Total debt (long plus current portion) amounted to $10.9 billion.During the quarter, Microchip generated $487.6 million of operating cash flow.The company announced a quarterly cash dividend of 36.45 cents per share, payable on Dec 5, 2018.GuidanceMicrochip forecasts third-quarter fiscal 2019 net sales of $1.362-$1.438 billion (mid-point $1.4 billion).For the fiscal third quarter, non-GAAP earnings are anticipated in the range of $1.49-$1.64 per share.Non-GAAP gross margin is anticipated in the 61-61.5% range. Non-GAAP operating expenses, as percentage of sales, are projected at 24.9-25.4%, and operating margin is expected at 35.6-36.6%.Microchip's inventory days in the impending quarter are expected between 117 and 127 days. Capital expenditures are estimated in the range of $50 million.For fiscal 2019, capital expenditures are projected at $230-$250 million.In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. The consensus estimate has shifted -8.1% due to these changes.Currently, Microchip Tech has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with a D. However, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Estimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise Microchip Tech has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

alue investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn't want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let's put  stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:A key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock's current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Microchip Technology has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 11.8, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 16.6. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Microchip Technology's current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years. Moreover, the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock, suggesting it might be a good entry point.Further, the stock's PE also compares favorably with the industry's trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 13.9. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Microchip Technology has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year's earnings) of just 10.5, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Microchip Technology stock in the near term too.Another key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock's price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Microchip Technology has a P/S ratio of about 3.7. While this is a bit higher than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.0 right now, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, MCHP is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of undervalued trading-at least compared to historical norms.In aggregate, Microchip Technology currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Microchip Technology a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Microchip Technology is 0.8, a level that is slightly lower than the industry average of 0.9. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock's earnings growth rate. Additionally, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 8.0, which is better than the industry average of 9.9. Clearly, MCHP is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.Though Microchip Technology might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of A. This gives MCHP a Zacks VGM score-or its overarching fundamental grade-of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  )Meanwhile, the company's recent earnings estimates have been disappointing. The current fiscal quarter as well as the fiscal full year has seen zero estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to one lower.As a result, the current fiscal quarter consensus estimate has remained stable in the past two months, while the fiscal full year estimate has inched lower by 0.2%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below: | This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Microchip Technology is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (among the bottom 28%) and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past two years, the industry has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates, analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.The greatest discovery in this century of biology is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization. Billions of dollars in research have poured into it. Companies are already generating revenue, and cures for a variety of deadly diseases are in the pipeline.So are big potential profits for early investors.

nvestors eyeing a purchase of Microchip Technology Inc (Symbol: MCHP) stock, but tentative about paying the going market price of $75.46/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2021 put at the $57.50 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $5.00. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 8.7% return against the $57.50 commitment, or a 4.4% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to MCHP's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $57.50 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Microchip Technology Inc sees its shares decline 23.4% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $52.50 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $5.00 from $57.50), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 4.4% annualized rate of return.Interestingly, that annualized 4.4% figure actually exceeds the 1.9% annualized dividend paid by Microchip Technology Inc by 2.5%, based on the current share price of $75.46. And yet, if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downside because the stock would have to fall 23.37% to reach the $57.50 strike price.Always important when discussing dividends is the fact that, in general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Microchip Technology Inc, looking at the dividend history chart for MCHP below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 1.9% annualized dividend yield.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Microchip Technology Inc, and highlighting in green where the $57.50 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2021 put at the $57.50 strike for the 4.4% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Microchip Technology Inc (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $75.46) to be 37%.

The figure also improved 22.9% year over year.Higher net sales which increased 24.7% from the year-ago quarter to $1.213 billion on a GAAP basis drove the year-over-year upside. On a non-GAAP basis revenues came in at $1.216 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.208 billion.This outperformance can primarily be attributed to solid demand witnessed by the company's product portfolio and synergies from accretive acquisitions. End-market diversification and operational efficiencies are also catalysts.Microchip forecasts second-quarter fiscal 2019 net sales of $1.474-$1.550 billion (mid-point $1.512 billion). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.51 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of almost 49.4%.For the fiscal second quarter, non-GAAP earnings are anticipated in the range of $1.65-$1.83 per share (mid-point $1.74). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.74 per share, reflecting year-over-year growth of 23.4%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Microchip's microcontroller business (60% of first-quarter sales) continues to outperform the industry and has enabled it to gain significant market share. In the first quarter, segment revenues increased 10.8% year over year to $728.6 million.The company introduced new 32-bit SAM L10 and SAM L11 microcontrollers families based on Arm Cortex-M23 core.

icrochip Technology (MCHP) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2018. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 7. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the , it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.This chipmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.74 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +23.4%.Revenues are expected to be $1.51 billion, up 49.4% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.33% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks  (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce  , and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).For Microchip Tech, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Microchip Tech will beat the consensus EPS estimate.While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Microchip Tech would post earnings of $1.49 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.61, delivering a surprise of +8.05%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our  to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Microchip Tech doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Image source: The Motley Fool. (NASDAQ: MCHP)Q2 2019 Nov. 07, 2018 , Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Microchip Technologies Second Quarter and Fiscal Year 2019 Financial Results Conference. (Operator Instructions)At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the -- over to Mr. Eric Bjornholt. Please go ahead, sir. -- Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the Company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today, as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Chairman and CEO, and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and COO. I will comment on our second quarter fiscal year 2019 financial performance and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance, and provide an update on our integration activities associated with the Microsemi acquisition. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.I want to remind investors that during the quarter ending June 30, 2018, we adopted a new GAAP revenue recognition standard, which requires revenue to be recognized at the time products are sold to distributors versus our historical revenue recognition policy, where revenue on such transactions were deferred until the product was sold by our distributors to an end customer. We are not able to provide guidance on a GAAP basis, as we are not able to predict whether inventory at our distributors will increase or decrease in relation to end market demand and this is not how we manage our business.As evidence of this uncertainty, in recent years, we have seen net inventory at our distributors increase or decrease by a significant amount in a single quarter. Our non-GAAP revenue is based on true end market demand in which we measure the revenue based on when the product is sold by our distributors to an end customer. We will continue to manage our business and distributor relationships based on creating and fulfilling end market demand. All of Microchip's bonus programs will continue to work based on the amount of revenue earned from fulfilling market demand. Therefore, along with GAAP results based on sell-in, we will also report our non-GAAP results based on sell-through revenue recognition.I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin, and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis, using revenue based on end market demand, and expenses prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation.Non-GAAP net sales in the September quarter were $1.513 billion, just above the midpoint of our guidance and up 24.4% sequentially from net sales of $1.217 billion in the immediately preceding quarter. We have posted a summary of our revenue by product line and geography on our website for your reference.On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 61.7%, operating expenses were 23.4% of sales, and operating income was a record $579.3 million and 38.3% of sales. Non-GAAP net income was a record $454.6 million. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was a record $1.81, which was $0.07 above the midpoint of our guidance of $1.74.On a GAAP basis, net sales in the September quarter were $1.433 billion. GAAP revenue was impacted by a significant reduction in the Microsemi distribution channel during the quarter, resulting in Microsemi distributor months of inventory being down to 2.6 months. We believe that the current levels, the distributors are holding the amount of inventory needed to support end market demand and that the inventory levels are in line with the levels maintained by our distributors for our historical business.GAAP gross margins were 48.1% and include the impact of $3.9 million of share-based compensation, $184.4 million of acquisition related and acquired inventory valuation and other costs, and $56.1 million impact from changes in distributor inventory levels. Total operating expenses were $586.6 million and include acquisition intangible amortization of $169.9 million, special charges of $18.2 million, $6.6 million of acquisition related and other costs and share-based compensation of $37.5 million. The GAAP net income was $96.3 million or $0.38 per diluted share and includes one-time tax benefits of $115.6 million related to a variety of matters, including tax reserve releases due to audit settlements and statute of limitations expiring, tax reform and transition tax refinement and intercompany restructuring of intellectual property.The non-GAAP cash tax rate was 3.5% in the September quarter and we expect a similar rate for all of fiscal 2019. We expect our non-GAAP cash tax rate for fiscal '20 and fiscal '21 to be 5% or less. Exclusive of the transition tax any potential tax associated with restructuring the Microsemi operations into the Microchip global structure and any tax audit settlements related to taxes accrued in prior fiscal years.We have many tax attributes and net operating losses, tax credits and interest deductions that will keep our cash tax payments low, the transition tax for the combined Microchip, Microsemi Group is expected to be about $364 million was recorded last fiscal year and will be paid over eight years. We have posted a schedule of our projected transition tax payments on the Investor Relations page of our website. For GAAP purposes, we had a significant tax benefit in the quarter for the variety of reasons I discussed earlier.Moving onto the balance sheet, our inventory balance at September 30, 2018 was $836.7 million, including a $120.1 million of inventory mark-up from Microsemi required for GAAP purchase accounting. Excluding the inventory mark-up, we had a 117 days of inventory at the end of September quarter, which was down two days from the prior quarter levels. Inventory at our distributors in the September quarter were 37 days compared to 40 days at the end of June. As indicated earlier, we believe that our distributors are holding an appropriate level of inventory to support end market demand.The cash flow from operating activities was a record $487.6 million in the September quarter. As of September 30, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $464.2 million. We paid down $501 million of total debt in the September quarter. And the net debt on the balance sheet reduced by $315.5 million. At September 30, our debt outstanding includes $3.1 billion of borrowings under our line of credit, $2.733 billion of Term Loan B, $2 billion in high-grade bonds and $4.481 billion of convertible debt.Our net debt to EBITDA, excluding our very long-dated convertible debt that matures in 2037 and is more equity like in nature, was 4.9 at September 30, 2018. Our leverage is higher than we originally projected, primarily due to lower EBITDA from the Microsemi business, driven by needing to correct distribution inventory levels through lower shipment activity in the month of June, as well as in the September 2018 quarter. As indicated earlier, we believe the distribution inventory correction for Microsemi is essentially complete.We are committed to using substantially all of our excess cash generation beyond our dividend payment to reduce our debt levels and we expect our debt levels to reduce significantly over the next several years. Our net leverage metrics are based on 12 month trailing EBITDA, which will continue to provide some headwinds due to the significant distribution inventory reductions, which caused our shipment activity to be significantly less than end market demand for the past two quarters, as well as our guidance for the December 2018 quarter.Capital expenditures were $72 million in the September 2018 quarter, we expect about $50 million in capital spending in the December quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2019 to be about $230 million to $250 million. We continue to add capital to support the growth of our production capabilities for our fast growing new products and technologies and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. These capital investments will bring some gross margin improvement to our business, particularly for the Atmel and Microsemi manufacturing activities that we are bringing into our own factories. Depreciation expense in the September quarter was $47.2 million.I will now turn it over to Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the September quarter and provide an update on some of the Microsemi integration activities. Ganesh? -- Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. As I review our product line performance, please bear in mind that the September quarter has a full quarter of contribution from Microsemi, while the June quarter only had a month of contribution from Microsemi. This along with the fact that Microsemi revenue only maps into four of the six product line reporting categories we have, while in some cases distort the quarter-over-quarter comparisons of revenue by product line.Taking a closer look at microcontrollers, our microcontroller business was sequentially up 12.6% as compared to the June quarter. This benefited from a full quarter of Microsemi contribution in September as compared to a partial quarter for June. Our September quarter microcontroller revenue annualizes at almost $3.3 billion, putting us within striking distance in the next few years of the two industry players who are ahead of us in the 2017 microcontroller rankings. Our microcontroller portfolio continues to expand with several new product introductions, our roadmaps remain strong and design-in funnel is robust. We see all these as positive indicators for future growth. We believe we have the new product momentum and customer engagement to continue to gain even more share in the future.Now moving to analog, our analog business was sequentially up 33.6%, as compared to the June quarter. This too benefited from a full quarter of Microsemi contribution in September as compared to a partial quarter for June. Our September quarter analog revenue annualizes at over $1.75 billion firmly in the top 10 of analog semiconductor players. With Microchip 2.0 and our total system solutions approach, we expect to continue to grow and gain further analog market share.Next up is our FPGA business, which came to Microchip through the Microsemi acquisition. Our FPGA revenue hit an all time record even after going back through the Microsemi and Actel history. Our low power mid range PolarFire family continues to garner strong market acceptance with revenue more than doubling sequentially as compared to the end-market consumption in the full June quarter. Despite being a new product category for Microchip, we are optimistic about the prospects for the FPGA product line based on the highly defensible markets and applications they are designed into, as well as the intense design win focus and broad-based market application and customer focus requiring. These requirements are very similar to Microchip's microcontroller business requirements. And therefore, we expect the FPGA product line will very nicely leverage our capabilities.Moving next to our licensing business, this business was sequentially up 40.3% as compared to the June quarter. We achieved an all-time record for our royalty revenue. Additionally, our results also benefited from the sale of a patent license for a specific set of patents that can be used in a noncompetitive fields of play. We did anticipate this patent license to close in the September quarter and included in our guidance. We continue to retain indefinite rights for these patents for the fields of players that are of interest to us. Even without the patent license sale, the September quarter licensing business revenue was sequentially up from June.Let me share some background as to our thinking in regards to patent licensing. We have inherited a substantial patent portfolio from the companies we acquired over the last 10 years. Several quarters ago, based on licensing request we were receiving, our licensing business unit embarked on a strategy to monetize certain patents, which have value to players noncompetitive fields of play. In all cases, we retain rights to use these patents in our products as well. The first results from this monetizing effort is what we saw in the September quarter results. There is a second such patent license sale for a specific set of patents, which is in the advanced stages of negotiation; and is included in our guidance for the December quarter. Investors should expect that the revenue contribution in the future from this effort will be a little lumpy from quarter-to-quarter.Our memory business was sequentially down 3.8% in the September quarter, as compared to the June quarter. And finally, our MMO, which stands for multi-market and other business was up 90.7% sequentially as we had a full quarter of Microsemi contribution in the September quarter, as compared to just a month in the June quarter. On a combined company basis, which has a full quarter of Microchip and Microsemi, our second quarter fiscal of 2019, non-GAAP end market demand revenue of $1.51 billion was split across the six product lines we report as follows. Microcontrollers were 54.2%, analog was 29%, FPGA was 6%, memory was 3.1%, licensing was 2.5% and MMO was 5.2%. We expect this will be the approximate forward going revenue percentages by product line and that quarter-to-quarter changes from here onwards will be relatively small.Now an update on the Microsemi integration progress. The business unit integration continues to progress well. We are restructuring underperforming businesses, while implementing the strengths and best practices from both companies to drive improvements across the board. The key Microsemi business unit leaders, we retained continue to run their businesses and are adapting to the Microchip culture and business expectations. New product development and design win momentum are continuing to happen as planned.The sales integration is also progressing well. We have converted the Microsemi sales team to a Microchip's style non-commissioned sales approach. Teams from Classic Microchip and Microsemi are working collaboratively as one team to drive new opportunities and pursue product cross-selling opportunities. Our internal reference designs are increasingly taking advantage of our combined total system solutions approach. A comprehensive analysis of our new channels and channel partners from the Microsemi acquisition was completed and we are making the adjustments required for an effective combined company approach.The operations integration work is an enormously complex undertaking, as little to no integration of prior Microsemi acquisitions have taken place. Because of the size of the business and the absence of ERP integration by Microsemi, the business system and operational integration will be done in phases. The first phase for one of the business units went live on November 1 successfully. Further phases have been planned with the quarterly cadence of go live events for many quarters.We expect the overall operational integration will take about two more years to complete. From a factory standpoint, the initial plans for insourcing some from Microsemi was outsourcing have been completed and prioritize actions to execute these plans have commenced. In the G&A functions, we eliminated some more of the support organizational redundancies and more will happen after we get further along with our business system and operational integration plan.Let me now pass it to Steve for some comments about our business and our guidance going forward. Steve? -- Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to first reflect on the results of the fiscal second quarter of 2019. I will then provide updates on our progress at Microsemi, I will then provide guidance for the fiscal third quarter of 2019.Our September quarter financial results were good. Our consolidated non-GAAP net sales came in just above the midpoint of our guidance that we issued on August 9, 2018. Our consolidated non-GAAP gross margin was strong at 61.7% of sales. Microchip classic, non-GAAP operating margin was an all-time record. Consolidated non-GAAP operating profit, including Microsemi was 38.3% of sales and near the high end of our guidance. Our consolidated non-GAAP EPS was an all-time record at $1.81 and near the high end of our guidance. There was a strong EPS contribution from both Classic Microchip and Microsemi, the accretion from Microsemi exceeded our original guidance of $0.15 for the September quarter. This was based on non-GAAp revenue which is based on distribution sell-through and is representative of real market demand. On non-GAAP basis, this was also over 112th consecutive profitable quarter.Now let me provide you some update on the progress we have made with the Microsemi integration. First to distribution inventory. We had told you last quarter that we will complete a distribution inventory reduction in two quarters, September and December. I'm pleased to report that with a lot of work by the combined teams of Microchip and Microsemi and in cooperation with the distributors, we almost completed the inventory reduction in one quarter. The distribution inventory at the end of September was 2.62 months, down from about four months prior to the closing of the acquisition. This level of inventory, we believe is the level distributors need to support in market demand and is in line with the level maintained by distributors for Microchip classic business. This was accomplished without any negative impact on distribution sales out, the non-GAAP net sales from Microsemi based on direct shipments and distribution sales out was an all-time record.Second is termination of deals. Since closing the Microsemi acquisition on May 29, 2018, we terminated deals, discounts and subsidies that were used prior to the acquisition in connection with sales into distribution and contract manufacturers. For example, we can sell the Aero supply assurance program concerning sales into the channel of end-of-life product. At acquisition close, there was approximately $47 million of inventory in distribution under this Aero supply assurance program. We won't take any inventory back, but we will not ship anymore into distribution under that program.We also canceled the interest subsidy there was offered to some distributors to compensate them based on the inventory they have. We also canceled the production incentive program under which there was a discount offered to contract manufacturers to take additional inventory. Cancellation of this program has had no negative impact on contract manufacturers willingness to purchase the product they need.Finally, there with a number of OEM customers that were transferred to distribution and then the inventory shipped into distribution. This resulted in lower margin for Microsemi. As of today, we have transferred many of those customers that account for about $110 million of annualized revenue back to direct customers. So overall, we are pleased that we were able to reduce some Microsemi distribution inventory very rapidly. There was one business unit, call the high reliability discrete products business unit where the inventory at the end of June was very high at 8.6 months.At the end of September, we had brought it down to 6.7 months. We are continuing to reduce the inventory for this business unit further. The shipments are now quite linear in the four quarters prior to being acquired by Microchip, about 57% of Microsemi's quarterly sell-in revenue were shipped in the last month of the quarter. In the September 2018 quarter, only 31% of sell-in revenue from Microsemi products were shipped in the third month.Now next is Microsemi internal inventory. It is obvious that as we reduce the distribution inventory, the inventories that Microsemi would grow substantially unless we took corrective actions in the factories and subcontractors by cutting production targets. And that is what we did. Fortunately, a very large amount of Microsemi business was done from wafer foundries and assembly and test subcontractors. We aggressively cut wafer starts at the foundries and loadings at assembly test subcontractors.Microsemi had several small fabs in assembly locations owned by Microsemi. We cut loadings in these factories quite substantially, some of them as much as 50%. We let go temporary workers in many of these facilities and implemented temporary plant shutdowns to control inventory. Microsemi did not produce a high percentage of their products inside. So the gross margin impact was fairly small. We maintained over 61% overall gross margin for Microsemi. We believe that the under loadings of the factory has got somewhat counterbalanced by the discontinuance of all the discounts. But as I have said before, the results are going to be a bit noisy for a couple of quarters.At the end of September, the overall inventory, internal inventory at Microchip, including Microsemi was 117 days, down two days from 119 days at the end of June quarter. So we did a great job in controlling internal inventories. Now, this may seem all too easy after the fact, but there was a tremendous focus and amount of work that went into reducing the distribution inventory. And at the same time, ensuring that our internal inventory does not belong up. We have multiple joint teams from Microchip and Microsemi, some focused on distribution inventory reduction, others focused on controlling internal factory production and others managing reduction of foundry wafer starts and assembly and test loadings.So while addressing the inventory has provided some headwind on the distribution selling driven GAAP revenue, including sales to contract manufacturers. The non-GAAP revenue for distribution, which is based on sell-through has not been affected. I'm pleased that Microsemi business achieved a record non-GAAP net sales based on end market demand. The second issue we highlighted last quarter was extravagance. In this area, we have been moving aggressively to implement Microchip's frugal expense culture. We have shutdown the executive floor at the Microsemi headquarter building, canceled the private jet account, terminated or sold many of the sport's sky boxes, canceled golf and auto racing sponsorships and substantially prune the many memberships.As we reduced inventory and spending, Microsemi business has continued to do well. This was a negative from the beginning that Microsemi has very good engineering teams and has very good products. The customers sockets are sticky and there are good end market opportunities for the combined company. Our strategy for the better part of this decade has been to buy businesses and turn them into world-class performers in the likes of Microchip. Here, we are starting with excellent products, excellent gross margins and excellent engineering teams. With the distributor and contract manufacturing inventory reduced and with Microchip's operating expense approach, we are optimistic about achieving our long-term targets for attrition from Microsemi.So far, we are ahead of our original targets. I also want to provide you one more figure. In the September quarter, we paid $501 million of our debt. This was accomplished by squeezing all the cash out of nearly 100 subsidiaries around the world. We could not have done it without the new tax law. Despite the large debt pay down in the September quarter, the debt leverage has not moved, though, primarily because the EBITDA has dropped, driven by lower GAAP revenue of Microsemi and also some softness in the Microchip classic business.I also want to provide you update on our Classic Microchip business, all of the issues that I highlighted last quarter, that was built into our guidance essentially came true. I had described four concerns. First, long lead times for some of the passive components. This issue did affect from sales as we expected, since the customers could not complete the whole kit. Number two, tariffs. While we were one of the first to highlight the risk of tariffs and trade war, this issue investor and analyst attention during the quarter for the whole industry. We saw a significant impact on our business during the quarter due to customer concerns about tenants and we saw a significant weakening of our bookings. We believe that tariffs and related customer concerns will continue to be an issue. Number three, ZTE. We saw some impact from not being fully able to ship to ZTE for both Microchip and Microsemi, despite the release from the Justice Department, there has been some demand destruction at ZTE. And number four, Bitcoin. Our bitcoin business has essentially evaporated, it was about 1% of our business, supplying microcontrollers and power management products for the power supplies, as well as Ethernet controllers.Now, I will provide you guidance for the December quarter. The guidance we provided for the September quarter, which reflected our caution on business conditions turned out in retrospect to be spot on and was a harbinger for broader industry weakness. We continue to be cautious about the outlook for the December quarter. We see weak market conditions for automotive and industrial, our two largest markets. Automotive business is negatively impacted by emission testing bottlenecks in Europe as well as weakness in China. The industrial business is negatively impacted by tariffs. On the other hand, communication, data center and aerospace and defense businesses are seeing strength.With all this commentary, we expect our total non-GAAP net sales to be down 5% to 10% sequentially. We expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 61% and 61.5% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 24.9% and 25.4% of sales and we expect the non-GAAP operating profit percentage to be between 35.6% and 36.6% of sales. And we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $1.49 and $1.64 per share. Given all the complications of accounting for the acquisitions including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges, inventory write-up on acquisitions and changes in distribution inventory, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on a non-GAAP basis, we believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters and we request that the analysts continue to report their non-GAAP estimates to first call.With this operator, will you please poll for questions?Certainly. (Operator Instructions) We'll hear first today from Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna. -- Hey guys, great quarter in light of some of the headwinds that we're having here and great update on Microsemi as well. So Steve, maybe you can just elaborate a little bit more on some of the end markets there. You had a little bit more detail than others did perhaps on auto, maybe talk about industrial as well. And then some bright points maybe within data center and comps, maybe that's your optical business that you might be pointing to, any more details there would be great. -- Well, if you look at the auto business, we highlighted two areas, one is there was a new emission standard implemented in Europe, effective September 1. There was a one year notice on it almost from September 1 of the prior year, however testing agencies couldn't build up the capacity to test all the car production. So there was a significant bottleneck for cars waiting to be tested which brought the European car production down. And the whole China economy has been weak due to various reasons, some incentives were taken away, the concerns about tariff in Chinese production and all sorts of other reasons, China automotive market has been weak.In the industrial area, the concerns are mainly tariffs, both driven by Chinese end products coming to US which have a 10% duty today going to 25% in January. So there are a lot of people concerned about whether they will be competitive or not in selling products in U.S. and because of weak Chinese economy, Industrial is weak in China too. The three markets which are doing stronger are data center, communication and defense and aerospace. If I take them in the reverse order, defense and aerospace, I think after years of drawing down defense spending, the defense and aerospace spending has been on the way up. And we are very broadly designed in into essentially every single weaponry system, every single aircraft, helicopters and others. So that part of the business is doing well.The data center business, I think you probably have seen some other companies with higher exposure to data center, data center cloud, hyperscalers and all that, that part of the business has been stronger. So that business did well last quarter and is stronger relative to the automotive and industrial and other businesses. And third is the communication, I think we also see the communication business doing well. -- And you guys have talked about this potential weakness that we're seeing from most guys out there in the market a little bit earlier, some however haven't guided for much weakness at all. Do you think that perhaps they're going to see it a little bit later and you might be working through this process a little bit earlier? And then, are there any signs of stabilization in late October or early November? -- Well, we are not going to talk about what other companies have said or what may happen to other industry players. I think you should ask them. Regarding Microchip, we first saw some impact in June quarter. And what we were seeing in June based on that we had a fairly conservative guidance for the September quarter and most people didn't talk about it till the results for the September quarter. So we were four months earlier before we saw it. And that's not first time, numerous times in the past we have seen the impact of industry events about three, four months ahead of the others see it. And we seed early and we always end early.If we talk about the industry four months earlier, nobody tends to believe it, because nobody else is talking about it and you're not seeing it. And therefore we start talking about the industry, we just talked about some factors that were affecting our business. So it turned out we were correct again and everybody else saw it later. And now on the other side, we always come out earlier but whenever we tell you that, that won't get believed either because others are not seeing it yet. So we are not fully ready to talk about the other end of the cycle yet. -- Great. Thanks so much, Steve. Appreciate that. -- Welcome.We'll hear next from Harsh Kumar with Piper Jaffray. -- Yeah, hey guys, thanks for the MSCC update. Congrats on preserving EPS in a tough market. Maybe one for Eric. Eric, I think you had cited a goal of 0.7 turns of delevering for I believe for this fiscal year. Can you maybe talk about if that gets impacted at all with this environment and currently based on what you're seeing? And also maybe one for Steve, and I won't ask a follow-up after this. Microchip was usually up in March, I think mostly MSCC was just all over the place. Maybe could you help us think about how we can think about modeling March just from your initial read on what you've seen in the business? -- Sure. So I'll take the deleveraging one first and then pass it back to Steve. But we made really good progress in terms of paying down debt as both Steve and I mentioned in our prepared remarks, we took down $500 million worth of total debt and on a net basis $315.5 million. So did a really good job there of using all the cash that we could to pay down debt. We will continue to use substantially all of our excess cash generations after dividends to reduce our debt levels. And we expect our net leverage to decline dramatically over the next several years.Now with the correction of the Microsemi distribution inventory having a significant impact on our EBITDA in the June and September 2018 quarters and then combining that with our guidance for the December 2018 quarter, our trailing 12 month EBITDA will have significant headwinds over the next year. And our net debt to EBITDA will not trend down as fast as we had indicated back in August, but this is a very good cash flow business, like I said, we'll continue to pay down debt, but in the current quarter we probably expect that debt paydown to be somewhere in $160 million range, a broad range should be $150 million to $200 million, but we'll have to see how things trend here over the next few quarters to give you a longer-term forecast. -- Got it. -- So I'll pickup the second question you had which was regarding the March quarter. So I remind investors that when we bought Atmel, it was not a small acquisition, either. Atmel was about 40% to half of our business. And after we integrated Atmel, we didn't understand Atmel's seasonality for awhile because companies on their own, their prior seasonality was based on sell-in, however, they work for the distributors, the whole end market mix was different. And after we had Atmel for the entire year or more than a year, we fully understood the impact of Atmel seasonality on our business to be able to guide properly.Same is the situation now with Microsemi. We don't fully understand Microsemi's seasonality. We haven't had a March quarter where the Microsemi in it. And we do not consider the March quarter on a Microsemi's clot to be a meaningful indicator for us regarding seasonality because that business was managed with a selling driven mentality, with a significantly high distribution inventory, our guidance will be based on real market demand. So -- and the end markets for Microsemi are quite different. They are stronger in defence, stronger in data centers, stronger in communication and almost no automotive, very little automotive and all that.So I'm not ready to talk about the March quarter in terms of guidance till we have some more experience on our belt in understanding their seasonality as well as being able to gauge the impact of the current correction when it is ending and how its impact would be in the March quarter. -- That's fair. Thanks, Steve.We'll hear now from Craig Ellis with B. Riley. -- Yes, thanks for taking the question. I'll start with a clarification with respect to the strong performance on the Microsemi inventory cleanup in the quarter. Did that have a particular impact on any of the product segment revenues that you reported or was the impact spread about equally among MCUs, analog and other businesses? -- So, it really did not have an impact on the sales-out activity that Ganesh talked about, breaking out by product lines. So it was really just more of correcting the inventory sitting in distribution. So I don't think there was really any end-market impact from the actions that we took. -- We basically, we haven't broken out the sell-in data by product line. We only have broken out sell-out data by product line and that did not change based on lowering the sell-in and cleaning up the inventory. -- Yes. So, I mean, we have the sell-in data in our public filings and in our 10-Q, but that doesn't really give you an indication of where the distribution inventory drain was by product line. -- Got it. And then the follow-up. There were a couple of references to accretion and I just wanted to clarify, what was the exact amount of Microsemi earnings accretion in the quarter? And Steve, are you retaining all the prior synergies and accretion targets, the $300 million in synergies as well as the $0.75 plus in year one (ph) and $8 and I believe fiscal '20 earnings? -- Yes, we're not breaking out the exact numbers of Microsemi attrition because we kind of managing it as one company, but we gave you anecdotes that the accretion in the September quarter was higher than the $0.15 for the September quarter, we had originally guided. And we feel very confident that going out of the first year, the accretion will be higher than the $0.75 that we guided and we remain committed to a longer-term accretion of earnings per share of $8 that we guided before. This is a short-term impact based on this business cycle environment, whatever one, two, three quarters at last, it doesn't really have a long-term impact over a three, four years because usually the bounce back, will get you back to where you were. -- Thank you.From SunTrust, we'll hear from William Stein. -- Great, thanks for taking my questions. First, really more of a housekeeping one. The share count was a little lower than expected in the quarter and in the outlook. Is that just owing to a share price and the treasury method accounting for average shares in the quarter? Or is there something else going on there? -- No, that's exactly what it is. We post a schedule on our Investor Relations page under supplemental financial information that walks through what the share count approximately would be based on various prices. As you know, we have several convertible debt instruments outstanding and the share dilution from those has gone down with the stock price falling. -- That helps. Thank you. And the other is to address the GAAP to non-GAAP revenue adjustment. I think it was $81 million in the quarter. You noted that the channel inventory from Microsemi now approximates the sort of heritage Microchip business channel inventory. So it sounds like maybe there is little bit more work to do, but it's mostly done. And so, while I understand that just the inventory is going to fluctuate somewhat quarter-to-quarter after this $81 million delta that we saw in the quarter you just posted, going forward, should we expect this number to sort of fluctuate around zero or average around zero over time? Is that the right way to think about it? -- I'll take a stab at answering that and then Steve or Ganesh can chime in. So, we're really pleased with the progress that we made in getting the Microsemi just the inventory down to 2.62 months, which is right in line with where Microchip has been historically. We really are not able to project what distributors are going to do, some of that is going to be based on environment, it's going to be based on working capital needs, it's going to be based on lead times, there are so many things that factor into it. We have 120 or so distributors that we work with worldwide. We don't manage our business in a way where we get that type of visibility from them and really we're driving for end-market demand forecast versus sell-in.When it surprise me in an environment like this, that distributors are going to be very tight with our working capital. But again, for us to be able to provide any sort of forecast of what it's going to do is quite difficult and we don't feel we have capability to do that. Steve, do you want to add anything? -- What I would add is, we do not put any effort into managing our business to put the inventory into distribution. We put our entire effort into creating market demand which pulls the inventory out of the distribution and then allow the asset managers of the distribution to buy the product they need to serve the end market demand. So as the quarter is approaching, the quarter-end is approaching, we don't look at sales out is this and sell-in is this and we got to go make another $10 million of deal. So sell-in is lower than the sell-out or to hold back product because it's going to go up or lower. We don't manage both of those numbers. We only manage one number which is sales out.And like I told you last quarter, the standard has changed, the GAAP standard is sell-in. I told you that before we disagree with it. But we have to report a GAAP sell-in number which we do, and we'll continue to do it. But all our measurements, all our bonus programs what Board manages us is to a market demand driven number that we report as a non-GAAP revenue. And sell-in would be whatever distributors want based on their own asset management, their cash flow needs, lead times, there are hundreds of things go into what they do with their inventory. And we don't manage that. -- Understood and appreciate it. Thank you. -- Thank you.We'll hear now from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. -- Yes. Thank you. Steve, understanding, you don't want to talk about the March quarter and seasonality yet, just for the core business, your commentary about kind of cautious into December, what type of signals are you looking for in terms of distribution, our customers in terms of how far along we are for the correction here? -- Well, we interact with a large number of customers and distributors over the course of this quarter. And based on that collective engagement with hundreds, if not thousands of customers in all three geographies, US, Europe, Asia, we will have an assessment by the time we announce the December quarter results, which will be in early February. If there is a meaningful information that developed before that and gives us enough data points that we can kind of make a call, then we'll use the opportunity at one of the conferences to make comments on it. But fresh coming from the elections yesterday with 1% of precincts reporting, we cannot make the call on the election. -- Understood. And appreciate the color on the end markets, where you're seeing strength and weakness, any thoughts on consumer appliances, because that's the market that we've seen some potential slowing in China as well, do you have any thoughts there? -- So that part of the business appliance consumer part of the business is weak also. I cannot put it in the industrial. People who make wave conditioners and appliances and that's kind of industrial kind of business, you may call it consumer, but yes, that is we call so. -- Okay, thank you. -- Welcome.From Stifel we will hear from Kevin Cassidy. -- Thanks for taking my question. With reference to China, have you seen any change in behavior on new designs where -- maybe because of the tariff and trade war if there's preference for non-US microcontrollers as an example, rather than Microchip? -- We haven't really seen a lot of impact in reality. There is lot of talk about it, but it's not changing the funnel size in any way, partially because very large portion of Microchip business is proprietary, such functionality with such low power or such features or performance for that really is not available in any local kind of Chinese parts, which are really fairly low end. So I don't think we have seen any meaningful difference in the funnel size or design activity. There is a lot to talk about it. -- Yes. And maybe I didn't understand the question directly, but tariff impact on our products directly is very, very small, right. It's the products that our customers are building with our products where the tariff applies. So I think it's probably too early for us to see any real impact on the design side, Kevin.If they were to use the Chinese microcontroller or analog part to build their end product appliance or washers and dryers whatever that will have duty also coming in here. So not designing a Microchip product does not abate the duty coming into US. And that is a bigger impact. -- Right. It's just more whether it's going to anti-US, view in the design point of view, even if it's an STMicro (ph) something from Europe, rather than the US-based, that's what I was trying to get. -- I think your question is the right one and we hit that, but like I said, fortunately we're not easy to design up. -- Okay, great. Thank you.We'll hear next from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. -- Yes, guys, thanks for letting me ask questions. Congratulations on the good results. Steve, relative to the industrial weakness should calling out tariffs. I know this is probably an impossible question to answer, but I'm going to ask your opinion anyhow. To what extent do you think customers are reacting to the 10% tariff that's already been levied? And to what extent do you think that they're actually trying to be anticipatory to the raise to 25% come in the beginning of the year, I'm just trying to get a sense as to whether or not you think there's another sheer to drop or not?And then my second question, you did a great job kind of talking about the distribution inventory at Microsemi. I'm kind of curious about direct customer inventory. What did you see as the quarter unfolded? Was there any meaningful adjustments you needed to make there those behind you and to the extent they might be behind you, could there be a potential tailwind which I think you referred to on the last conference call once this inventory depletion was done. -- So let me take the first one first, which is a tariff question. So what's happening is as the percentage tariff and the products which are -- we've tariffs on keeps moving, it is kind of creating waves in customer sentiment. Originally, back in June-July time frame when there were some tariffs ready to go on in August, some people will try to get ahead of it, build the product, so they bring it to US and avoid the tariff, others will hold back production, they want to draw down their inventory, because they don't really know whether they'll be able to pass the tariff to the customers or they will agree that entire tariff.So it kind of create some waves both ways and that was for the 10% tariff. And through the quarter of September, customers were essentially cutting down production, drawing down their inventory, because they felt that it will be uncompetitive passing on the tariff to US customers who had a choice to buy the product made in Taiwan, made in Singapore, made in Vietnam, made in Mexico or wherever. And now, very recently we're hearing the talk that the expectation many of the customers had was heading toward the elections, the whole thing we're going to get settled. You may recall at the UN, Trump was talking so bad about Canada that Canada was cooperating and all that, and there maybe an agreement with Mexico only. One week later they signed an agreement announced the agreement with Canada, so the thought was similarly few days before the election there will be settlement with China and so kind of people who are holding back. Well, that didn't happen. And now the feeling is I don't think the settlement is closed. So now some of the customers are thinking tariffs are going to go to 25% and we should pull in and built some of the stuff and bring to US at 10% tariff and then bringing to 25%. So you could see that the waves moving all over the place and 50,000 customers we might have in China, not all aligned. It's very noisy, it's very hard to make decisions and we had lead times are short and we're responding to every customer and they're signing as we see it. So I don't know if that answers your first question. -- No, that's helpful. And then just on the direct customer inventory situation of Microsemi? -- On the direct to customer, the inventory we saw on the direct customer side was with contract manufacturers, because contract manufacturers is considered OEM business, it's a direct business, it's not through distribution. There was really not much inventory in the direct customers that we saw. And we wouldn't know it either, I mean, you don't know every customers inventory, but the way the deals were made with the discounts were given were to the contract manufacturers under a program called Production Incentive Program. So we can fill that program. And as we cancel that program, contract manufacturers only started taking what they need for their needs and they drew down their inventory. -- Perfect, thank you.(Operator Instructions) We'll hear next from Chris Danely with Citi. -- Hey, thanks guys. Steve, I know you're not going to comment on March seasonality. If hypothetically speaking if March revenue was down, would you be able to keep OpEx flat to down ? -- Well, we definitely will have the March OpEx down, not even flat to down, will be down, because we are still continuing to reduce Microsemi expenses as we do integration. And if March quarter is down as we're supposing, bonuses would be lower, so bonus approval will be lower. Yes, so I would say in that situation, March expense will not be flat, they will be down. -- Okay, great. And then for my next question, any sort of comparisons on this correction versus previous corrections? Are you seeing anything in common or this completely new? -- Well, I think that's more of your department than and mine, but... -- I'm just newest as you... -- In 2015, we saw this impact, I believe in August-September time frame. And we made a call I believe in late September time frame that we see China slowing down. It was driven by China and nobody else was seeing it and by -- and then when the numbers came out and numbers were cut, and they were cut again and everybody was down as much. And most stocks went down lower than they had gone down that day when we had made the call. So everybody was about four months behind. Same thing is happening this time. I think we saw that impact three to four months behind everybody else, so that is common. But what's driving it today versus what was driving it back then, I think the reasons are a little bit different, tariffs, maybe lead time becoming shorter, some are same, some are different, tariff is a new phenomenon. -- Got it. Okay, thanks guys.We'll hear now from Vivek Arya of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. -- Thanks for taking my question. Steve, for the first one, can you give us some more real-time sense on production plants? Are you still looking to reduce them further versus seasonality or do you think they have kind of stabilized at these levels? -- Well, so if you look at Chris Danely's question, you have to make an assumption on March. We cut back production quite a bit, with that, the internal inventory is in good control. We actually -- internal inventory went down by a couple of days. So, if the business is stable from here, if this quarter marks the bottom, then factory start building back slowly. If there is a further downside, which was an assumption possibly Chris was making -- I don't know if he was making that assumption, then you have to adjust to the reality. -- And on the OpEx side, if my math is right, so you had $354 million on non-GAAP OpEx in September, I think December, you are guiding to $352 million, so kind of a flattish. Why are we not seeing more cost synergies? And -- or does it just mean we will see them later on? -- Well, we took a lot of costs out early. I think if you were to combine the Microchip and Microsemi models from back in March or even a year ago, you're going to see that significant expense has been taken out. And that doesn't mean that there still not more to come. But I think we're actively managing that. Our OpEx came in significantly lower than our guidance for the quarter that we just completed. And we're managing based on the environment that's presented to us and I think we're doing a good job of that. -- Got it. And just one quick housekeeping. I think, Eric, you said tax rate under 5%, I believe in the past it was between 3% to 4%. So, just for modeling purpose, should be more like 3.5% or 4.5% for the next one or two years? Thank you. -- Well, when we gave a 3% to 4% before, that was kind of the short-term and we've got now questions coming in, in terms of what it's going to be over the next few years. And it's not a perfect science to forecast this but under 5% or 5% or less is where we're at today, it's not saying it can't be 3.5% but that's a pretty tight range. -- I think you're modeling 100 plus subsidiaries around the world and varying tax rates in various countries and interest payments and deductions and all these taxes and it should kind of average of all that, it's not a perfect sound, so it can change based on mix. -- Got it. Thank you.Moving on to Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. -- Yes, hi, good afternoon, and thanks for taking the question. The first question, I was hoping you could help us better understand some of the trade-offs that you've made with Microsemi's business now that you've had it under your wing for a longer period of time. It sounds like there's been several efforts taken to improve gross margins and I think that business had run in the low 60s on a stand-alone basis. With all the changes, some of the product pruning and that changed things along those lines, do you think it gets to above that 63 range that you're guiding for on a combined basis or that were just toward that higher end once the utilization rates normalize? And related to that, maybe you can help us think about, has there been any share shifts or the size of product pruning that you may have done given some of these changes that you're making to the business model? -- I think, Mark, one mistake most people make in looking at Microsemi gross margin is that day-to-day acquisition of a company called Vectron which closed in late November, early December timeframe. It had gross margins in the mid 30s and was $100 million revenue. And so, its impact was really never seen by investors in a non-GAAP basis. December quarter was fairly short just one month. And then March quarter, we announced the deal on March 1. So March quarter was really never fully announced based on a non-GAAP. -- All right. They filed the 10-Q. -- Yes, they filed the 10-Q. -- But didn't have a conference call -- -- But didn't have a conference call. So you wouldn't really know the non-GAAP margin taking away all these charges and everything else that acquisitions do. So Microsemi gross margin wasn't 63% driven by all those acquisitions margin was below 60%. And so we have already improved some and we'll continue to improve the gross margin, but looking for the gross margin to go over 63% would be quite a stretch right now. -- Yes, so we -- as you said, have margin improvements programs that are in place and we still have confidence in the combined long-term model of 63%, this last quarter, we were at 61.7%. So it's not like we're light years away from that but -- -- We got to get the factories to full production again because of the inventory correction as you ship less to distribution, all that inventory stays in house unless you cut production, so we did. And we take the under-absorption in the current quarter, we don't put it into -- we don't capitalize it into the inventory. So as the production starts going back, you will have some accretive effect on gross margin. -- That's helpful. And then just -- for the second part of that question, obviously there is a different focus on the types of businesses Microchip will be participating with there, but can you just help us think about the scope of revenue that you may not participate in any more either because you're focusing on -- and there are set of product lines, any share shifts that we should be contemplating things along those lines, so we can think about the right revenue run rate for that business once we adjust for some of these inventory dynamics that have gone on the last couple of quarters? -- So, we said that before we are going to keep and we like all the businesses. The combined Microsemi all businesses together, P&L is very good. There are product lines which are lower gross margin, there are product lines which are higher gross margin than average, there are product lines that grow less than average, there are product lines that are growing more than average. Microchip classic is no different. Our gross margins are lower in certain Microchip businesses but mix and match overall gross margin is excellent and that is the case with Microsemi. Every business is accretive and we're not going to offload a business just because it's a lower gross margin than the average. If it's accretive and growing and adding and providing additional attach is a part of the total system solution. So if all the other things are working, then it's a good Microchip product. -- And every business unit leader that we have is tested and not just growing the revenue but improving their gross margin and operating margins over time. And with -- in the Microchip system, we work together to make that happen. -- Yes. Thank you.We'll move Next to Krysten Sciacca with Nomura. -- Good evening. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the great execution of Microsemi. I just wanted to follow up on the OpEx question from before. It looks like the OpEx from this quarter came in a little bit lower than expected. And I'm just wondering if that was just due to better than expected execution on synergies or was there something else, going on in the quarter there that we should be thinking about? -- There was nothing else going on. Although, we would say that since we saw the effect of this downturn coming much earlier than anybody else, we hunker down earlier. We can sell majority of the open wrecks, we cut back on capital, we canceled firm orders that we had in capital to the extent we were able to cancel them and that's we slipped them out. We hunker down and we kind of batten down the hatches. -- We ask our employees to treat the spending as if it's their own money and do that on a global basis and it has very good results. So I think Steve is right. We just got out ahead of this quicker. -- Okay, great. That's helpful. And then just moving to the inventory question from Microsemi and how you completed that about a quarter earlier, then you stated on the prior call for the most part. What exactly caused that faster, that correction to happen faster than expected? Was there something in particular that Microchip did, or was it just better end demand, or what was kind of driving that for us? -- So, I think, especially when you buy new business, you're in lot to learn for that business. You're getting to know the people that are concerned with employees regarding what Microchip could do with various businesses. Let me get this in, various analysts write about various businesses that we will sell out, we should sell. And I always ask you please don't do that, because you create problem for us. The employees of that business read those reports and they get concerned that their business is maybe sold or not get focused on. And we have said that we're going to keep all the businesses, but every time you look at some analysts will make this speculation why data center business doesn't fit with Microchip and Opto (ph) doesn't fit with Microchip or something else doesn't Microchip. All that does is creates concern for our customers and creates concern for our employees.So what I'm saying is, we are working very hard on all these items, learning the businesses, keeping the customers at peace, talking to the employees, learning the inventory, and when such a large challenge comes up like the inventory, then it just takes an enormous amount of energy forming the teams and focusing the teams to go clean up the inventory. It also depends on how in the mix that inventory was. If that inventory was highly out of mix, then you have to continue to ship additional products for which there is demand. And if there is lot of slow-moving inventory that we call sludge, then that will take much longer time. And in certain business units, the inventory was in good mix. And certain other business units, inventory was not as good as a mix. So basically, huge amount of work, the combined teams are working together, creating a goal for everybody to clean up this inventory faster than the two quarters we guided to. And I think that's where we are. And also working in coorporate -- getting cooperation from the distributors. -- Excellent. Thank you. -- It's just lot of groundwork, there is not much magic there, it's just a lot of hard work. -- And as Steve mentioned in his prepared remarks, there is still a business unit or two, that's inventory is higher than we'd like it to be and it will come down over time. And there may be a business unit or two, that's inventory is too low. And these things kind of balance each other out. So we think at 2.6 months, we're in a very good position today. -- And in this business unit, number one, the inventory is very high over 8.6 months. Clearly, there was a lot of excess inventory. And when you build that much inventory, then inventory also tends to age and gets out of mix, we shipped such a high amount of inventory and customer demand shifts. So lot of the inventories becomes very slow moving and takes time to correct. -- I guess I'll give kudos to all the business units that were involved, the sales and distribution organization, our distributors, the planning folks, just it was a very large team, and everybody did a good job of executing. -- There was also $110 million of product that we shifted back from distribution to direct and customer by customer and distributor by distributor whichever the pair was, the distributor shipping to customer, you had to go work that relationship and convince a customer and convince a distributor, distributor going to lose that business to direct customer will ship it directly, makes sure distributor cleans out their inventory, so the new business and Microchip ships and creating accounts for those customers, receivables, learning where the product has to be shipped some places, sometime it goes into hubs of distributors. Sometimes there are multiple locations, all that challenging task by the shipping teams and marketing teams and sales teams, it's just purely a guess when we first talked to you regarding how long would it take. I have to tell you, two quarters and get it done in one quarter, rather than tell you one quarter and takes two quarters. -- Understood. Thanks, guys.For Raymond James, we'll go to Chris Caso. -- Yes, thank you. Thanks for taking the question. Just a question with regard to customer inventory levels, and I'd say, it's probably more pertains to the Microchip classic business. How much of the slowdown that you're seeing now, do you attribute to some of the demand function, issues that you talked about as opposed to just customers holding too much inventory and typically when we've seen the slow downs in the past, it's some combination of the two, do you think about it any differently at this time around? -- Well, when customer buys less product, you're unable to differentiate whether that's a purely inventory correction or his demand is slower. It always tends to be a combination. If you're building a 100,000 widgets a week, then you have certain amount of inventory at you're loading dock, in your factory floor, some in raw material, some in work in process, a certain amount of inventory. If your demand drops, because of your tariff concerns, let's say, you only want to build a 90,000 widgets, then the entire inventory in your structure divided by 90 is going to become more weeks of inventory than at 100. And then when you draw it down, you could call it inventory correction, you can call it because of the lower demand, I don't know how you separate it. -- Understood. As a follow-up, if you could talk about the linearity of your order rate as you proceeded through the quarter and into October. And I assume that that the order rates have slowed down since we last spoke in August, but have they sort of step down to a certain level and then stabilize that level given the uncertainty about tariffs and such, you spoke about or did they continue to worsen on a month-on-month basis? -- The order rate slowed down and stayed pretty constant at the lower level and have recently bounced back, partially because lead times are fairly short, so they got to place the orders for December and January. They don't need to place orders for next June, but they do need to place the orders for the next quarter. So the order rate, as you said, slowed down, but has recently bounced back up. -- In the month of October? -- In the month of October, yes. -- Okay. Helpful. Thank you.We will hear next from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. -- Just wondering on deleveraging, how you changed, are you accelerating that? What's -- how are you looking at that? -- So I tried to answer that on a earlier question, but essentially our deleveraging is going to be at a slower pace than what we had originally guided to the Street. We've got headwinds of very low EBITDA in both June and September, due to discretion inventory reduction. We were having a down quarter this year at the midpoint of guidance. We're going to be down 7.5%. And that just have an impact and is going to stay with us now for 12 months, because this debt calculations or EBITDA calculations are all 12 month trailing. So the cash flow from the business is going to be high, but if you look at our accounts receivable balance, it's down $120 million quarter-on-quarter, and that translates to cash. So it's going to take us some time, but all of our cash, really all our significant cash in excess of what we need to run the business and pay dividends is going to be used to pay down debt. And with that, we will reduce the debt balance, but the EBITDA is going to be something that sticks with us for the next year. -- Got it. And just a follow-up here. Getting fast some of the near-term tariff issues, the lack of visibility into the March quarter and first half, let's say, any thoughts, concerns on microcontroller has been, especially as you look at automotive where does content go? And just wondering -- just want to get your thoughts on how you look at that? Thanks. -- Ganesh, you want to take that? -- Ganesh, had to run to catch a flight. -- Oh, he had to catch a flight. So I think we are not concerned about the long-term prospects of microcontroller, analog or any of our businesses. Our fundamental frame is being able to sell total system solution into a customer socket, whether it's automotive, whether it's industrial, with microcontroller, analog connectivity products Wi-Fi, Ethernet, Bluetooth, LoRa. And now where there are lots of Microsemi products, including discrete products, FEPS and diodes and RF and other products. I think, there is fundamentally no concern about long-term Microchip, and the design win funnel and all that, are very, very healthy. I think, we're just talking about this impact, some from the tariff, and some from the slowdown in the business. You could go back, there was an earlier question, how it is different, or same as the 2015 cycle? And in that 2015 cycle, some of the assumptions were, like this thing is over. The industry just goes away, and all these things don't get designed in, and you can see how the business bounced back, and we had record quarters and record years and outstanding market share gains and everything else. So there is no long-term concern here, it's a short-term. -- Got it. Thanks.We'll hear next from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. -- Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just touching on some of the pockets of strength in the business. In aerospace and defense it's obviously very sticky, very high profitability segment. It sounds like, near-term it's kind of doing well. In order for you guys to sort of take advantage of this very profitable area, how much effort is required to get your MCU and analog products mil-aero, rad-hard qualify, is there a lot of work to be done here? Or is the core Microchip team already engaged in cross-selling? -- So there is a lot of work under way. There was a small aerospace and defense business that we have acquired as part of the Atmel acquisition, which was headquartered in France. And they did business largely with French aerospace companies, and didn't have any market share in US. And after acquiring them, in the last year and a half or so, we've been putting efforts. We expanded the charter to take Microchip standard microcontroller, analog and memory products, and make them rad-hard, recharacterize them to the needs of military and aerospace with broad temperature ranges and all that. So all that work has been under way for the last two years, so in militarising our products.Microsemi brings even just a much, much higher level of expertise in that area, and about 10x to 15x larger business than Atmel had in aerospace and defense. So in our integration, we have combined the Atmel's aerospace and defense business together with the microspace, aerospace and defense business as one business unit. And that business unit is accelerating, taking Microchip products to market in that segment. So that effort is about a year old, and is really getting significant boost right now. But we're not shipping core Microchip products in military for revenue today. Any Microchip products going into aerospace and defense sector, are still standard commercial products that are bought from distributors, and just kind of use standard commercial product. In some non-sensitive applications, aerospace and defense is allowed to use standard commercial products. The military products, rad-hard products, is an effort under way, but it's not making revenue today. -- Got it. Thanks for the insights there. And then in the FPGA segment, you guys drove record revenues, obviously the Microsemi team built a strong Mil/Aero leadership franchise there. And I think Ganesh talked about some of the new opportunities with the mid-range PolarFire family, which is more for kind of like multi-market applications, but sounds like overall the business is doing well. Can you guys just give us a sense on how strongly the FPGA business is growing on a year-over-year basis? -- So, I don't have a year-over-year comparison, some, but it won't be valid, because it will be a sell-in by putting in your high channel inventory versus sell-through that we're measuring. So that's why we said based on a sell-through basis, the numbers were a record. It was all-time record. And I don't have a year-over-year comparison, since we haven't had the business for a year. But the business is doing very well. It's doing very well in defense and aerospace, it's doing very well in the multi-market. It has a very good design and funnel. The next-generation architecture, which is Gen5, is just going into market and just introducing at the sample level.And there is a significant demand pull on that. So I think we are very optimistic about that business. -- Thanks for the insight, Steve.We'll go next to Jefferies' Mark Lipacis. -- Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just one. Steve, a number of the contract manufacturers with the global footprint, have talked about some of their customers already shifting manufacturing outside of China and accelerated core activity with our customers to do as much. I was wondering, if you were noticing that any evidence or anecdotes on that front? And to the extent that you think that might be causing some near-term disruption? That's all I had. Thank you. -- You're very correct. We are seeing that, too. So two things are happening. One, if there are two sources of production, one in China and one outside of China, then some attempt is being made to take the Chinese production and sell it to Europe and Asia, and take the non-Chinese production and ship it to US. This way you can optimize, and not pay any duties. Two challenges in that. Number one, it's lot of manual work and most people aren't set up to really differentiate the product where it should go, but manually and then writing some automation, it's really being done. But it's not perfect, because in many cases, the US demand is not exactly equal to the non-Chinese production, and Europe and Asia demand isn't equal to Chinese production. So there are still problems.So to solve that problem, you're correct, there are many customers, they are moving Chinese production to outside of China, but they are rapidly running into capacity issues. Where the outside factories are full, there was a little bit space, and they're now full, and there is lot more to be transferred from China, but there's no place to put it till they really expand capacity, build more square footage and all that. And that's a slow process. So, yes, we're seeing that. -- Very helpful. Thank you.And at this time, I'd like to turn things back to Steve Sanghi for any closing remarks. -- Well, we want to thank all of our customers and analysts for your patience and for your understanding. I think, this has been a tough four months here, but I think we've done a lot of good work in cleaning up the Microsemi inventory. And at the same time, it's really the first acquisition whose timing was such that the wind is not on our back. We did number of other acquisitions, and the timing was great. Here, along with the Microsemi inventory challenges, we're also facing this downturn in the business. And so we're dealing with the dual challenges. But I think we posted a pretty good quarter. And despite sequentially down guidance, I think we're managing the inventory very well. The internal inventories in very good shape.Overall gross margin, operating margins are still very, very good. And we look forward to really getting through these issues and getting back to our long-term $8 earnings target. So, thank you very much.And that does conclude today's conference. Again, thank you all for joining us. --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  -- Transcript powered by When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The index only notched its sixth day of gains twice this year-the first was in early January, and the second in early to mid-February. But this most recent streak was ""noticeably weaker,"" notes , a technical analyst at , who observes that the percentage moves had been smaller than during previous streaks. While that might seem concerning, more modest moves might suggest greater health, he says. ""This type of muted levitation has become the norm over the last few months, and it has been a significant reason why the market's uptrend has persisted,"" Cappelleri says.In fact, the S&P 500 hasn't gained 1% since June 1, after registering about 20 such rallies from January through June. Bears might describe the absence of big moves as a lack of interest in buying, but Cappelleri points out that the largest up days are often during periods of stress-see February through April.

ooking at the universe of stocks we cover at  , in trading on Thursday, shares of Microchip Technology Inc (Symbol: MCHP) were yielding above the 2% mark based on its quarterly dividend (annualized to $1.456), with the stock changing hands as low as $70.63 on the day. Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return. To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) back on 12/31/1999 - you would have paid $146.88 per share. Fast forward to 12/31/2012 and each share was worth $142.41 on that date, a decrease of $4.67/share over all those years. But now consider that you collected a whopping $25.98 per share in dividends over the same period, for a positive total return of 23.36%. Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.6%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 2% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable. Microchip Technology Inc (Symbol: MCHP) is an S&P 500 company, giving it special status as one of the large-cap companies making up the S&P 500 Index.In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Microchip Technology Inc, looking at the history chart for MCHP below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 2% annual yield.

"nvestors in Microchip Technology Inc (Symbol: MCHP) saw new options become available this week, for the January 2021 expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 840 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the MCHP options chain for the new January 2021 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $77.50 strike price has a current bid of $11.00. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $77.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $66.50 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of MCHP, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $77.99/share today.Because the $77.50 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 62%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 14.19% return on the cash commitment, or 6.17% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Microchip Technology Inc, and highlighting in green where the $77.50 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $80.00 strike price has a current bid of $11.70. If an investor was to purchase shares of MCHP stock at the current price level of $77.99/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $80.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 17.58% if the stock gets called away at the January 2021 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if MCHP shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Microchip Technology Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing MCHP's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $80.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $80.00 strike represents an approximate 3% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 43%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).

"nalog chips and microcontrollers are found in just about every single electronic device. Analog chips process inputs from the natural world such as sound, light, or pressure, turn them into digital signals (or vice versa). Microcontrollers are exactly what they sound like -- tiny computers that perform a specific function as part of an integrated circuit or system (often with little power consumption). Both types of devices have favorable prospects, given increasing electronics present in cars and factories.Two leading microcontroller and analog chip companies are  (NASDAQ: TXN) and  (NASDAQ: MCHP) . Each is large and well diversified across end markets, and both should benefit as electronic content grows. In addition, both companies have proven to be very good stewards of shareholder capital.Nevertheless, both companies have also encountered turbulence recently, with company-specific problems compounding concerns over a slowdown fueled by the U.S.-China trade skirmish.This past summer, both Texas Instruments and Microchip encountered adversities.In July, Texas Instruments' new CEO, Brian Crutcher, resigned due, according to the company, to ""violations of the company's code of conduct. The violations are related to personal behavior that is not consistent with our ethics and core values, but not related to company strategy, operations or financial reporting."" Crutcher was replaced by Chairman Rich Templeton, who had been the company's CEO from 2004 until this past June.Microchip has run into a more serious problem (it appears) with its recent acquisition of chip company Microsemi. After acquiring Microsemi for $10.15 billion in May, Microchip found out that prior management had been sending larger orders to distributors in exchange for discounts in order to make its recent quarters look better.Despite these problems, I think both companies can turn things around. Texas Instruments is fortunate to have Templeton return to the helm and Microsemi's management believes the excess channel inventory should be cleared over the next few quarters and reiterated its $300 million cost-saving synergy target even after the revelations.I think both companies' problems are fixable. So which is the better buy? Let's look at four factors, with accompanying charts.Microchip is a smaller company than Texas Instruments, which should mean it has more growth potential. Indeed, Microchip has grown at a faster rate than Texas Instruments in recent years, mostly via strategic acquisitions. That gives it an edge here. data by While Microchip might be growing faster, Texas Instruments is much more profitable. Looking at both companies'  and  , Texas Instruments comes out on top, and it's not close. data by When comparing companies, it's important to look not just at the income statement but also at the balance sheet. As I mentioned, Microchip recently made the huge Microsemi purchase and paid for it almost entirely with debt. That's ballooned Microchip's debt to more than $10 billion, around five times this year's  (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization).Texas Instruments, by contrast, has a small net cash position, meaning it has roughly as much cash as debt on its balance sheet. data by Of course, the success of any investment is determined not only by the quality and growth of earnings but also by the amount paid for the stock. Looking at each stock's valuation, it appears the market is much more nervous about Microchip's situation than about that of Texas Instruments. Microchip's forward  , which looks at the stock's price and the company's expected earnings, is well below that of Texas Instruments and also its own historical valuation. data by Since they're tied at two wins each, the choice between Microchip and Texas Instruments likely depends on your risk tolerance. Microchip's lower valuation, combined with higher growth prospects, gives it much more potential upside. That being said, Microchip investors are also taking on much more risk.For more risk-averse investors, Texas Instruments is the better choice. Its steadier growth and fatter margins enable Texas Instruments to have a higher dividend yield (2.86%) than Microchip (1.85%). By the way, Texas Instruments just raised that dividend a whopping 24% ...  . That's in contrast to Microchip, which likely won't be raising its dividend anytime soon as it pays down its acquisition debt.So investors who like steady and rising payouts might opt for Texas Instruments, while those with a bit more risk appetite in pursuit of large capital gains could opt to bet on Microchip's turnaround instead. Absent a global recession, I like both companies going forward.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

egendary investor Warren Buffett advises to be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful. One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.In trading on Tuesday, shares of Microchip Technology Inc (Symbol: MCHP) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 28.6, after changing hands as low as $78.91 per share. By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) is 62.3. A bullish investor could look at MCHP's 28.6 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.

" (NASDAQ: MCHP) might not be the most exciting company, and it might not be in the most exciting business (microcontrollers and analog processors). However, the stock could be  exciting from an investing point of view.After its recent fiscal-year first-quarter earnings, Microchip sold off sharply and is now down around 2% year to date. Trade war fears, along with difficulties integrating its new Microsemi acquisition, have hit the company's top-line guidance; nevertheless, Microchip's management team is proven, with a track record of successful past acquisitions. Therefore, Mr. Market's current concerns may present an opportunity.Image source: Getty Images.Microchip announced it was acquiring Microsemi in March of this year, closing the deal in late May. Microchip paid an equity value of $8.35 billion and total enterprise value of $10.15 billion, which includes Microsemi's debt.That was only a 17% premium to Microsemi's stock price at the time, which seemed like a pretty good deal -- acquisitions typically go for a higher premium. Further, Microsemi's product lineup is highly complementary to Microchip's. For instance, Microsemi had a large presence in both the aerospace/defense and telecommunications industries, where Microchip has little exposure, and Microsemi also makes  (FPGAs), a product Microchip didn't offer before.In addition, Microchip has a history of successful acquisitions, most recently the $3.4 billion purchase of Atmel in 2016. Using the standard recipe of cost-cutting and cross-selling, along with price increases for Atmel's differentiated products, Microchip was able to exceed its initial synergy and EPS targets when that deal was first announced.Despite the apparent synergies between Microchip and Microsemi, things have gotten off to a rocky start. Soon after the closing, Microchip discovered that Microsemi had been ""stuffing the channel"" in the quarters leading up to the acquisition. What does that mean? Basically, Microsemi was artificially inflating its revenue shortly before it was acquired. Not cool.Accounting rules allow companies to record revenue when they ship products to distributors, even if that distributor does not in fact make a sale to the end customer. According to Microchip management, Microsemi executives habitually induced distributors into taking more product than they needed by offering discounts. That allowed Microsemi to ""pull forward"" its revenue, essentially inflating sales numbers (and likely the company's acquisition price).Not only that, but Microchip also found a ""culture of excessive extravagance and high spending,"" including private planes, luxury suites at sports stadiums, and costly event sponsorships. Microchip CEO Steve Sanghi didn't mince words, promising, ""we are undoing commitments to all such spending,"" calling it ""a waste of shareholders' money.""To top it off, Microchip has also incurred collateral damage in the trade wars. Sanghi acknowledged that while Microchip will not be directly affected by the Trump administration's tariffs on Chinese goods, general trade war uncertainty has caused some customers to pause spending until the smoke clears.These headwinds materialized at an inopportune time for Microchip because the company financed its Microsemi almost entirely through debt, taking on $8.6 billion in notes, a bridge loan, and a revolving credit facility to fund most of the transaction. That ballooned total company debt to more than $10.3 billion, or around five times this year's  (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization), which is quite high for a tech company.Despite the headwinds and heavy debt load, Microchip is an intriguing  after the recent sell-off. This mostly comes down to my faith in management, which was very up front about the past quarter's struggles and the culture at Microsemi. Sanghi maintained Microchip's $300 million synergy target and said that the Microsemi inventory buildup should be cleared by the end of this year.For its part, Microchip has always recorded revenue on a ""sell-through"" basis (not ""sell-in"" as Microsemi did), so investors will get a clearer picture of how the business is doing moving forward. Given management's track record with Atmel and other acquisitions, I believe the company can achieve its cost-savings targets, pay down debt, and achieve its goal of $8 non-GAAP EPS in fiscal 2021 (which ends in March of that year).That would put today's shares at just over  , which is quite cheap. Those looking for a beaten-down stock in an otherwise expensive market might want to kick the tires on Microchip.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF (Symbol: XSD), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $89.13 per unit.With XSD trading at a recent price near $76.01 per unit, that means that analysts see 17.25% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of XSD's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Microchip Technology Inc (Symbol: MCHP), Silicon Laboratories Inc (Symbol: SLAB), and Power Integrations Inc. (Symbol: POWI). Although MCHP has traded at a recent price of $83.47/share, the average analyst target is 39.67% higher at $116.58/share. Similarly, SLAB has 23.24% upside from the recent share price of $92.50 if the average analyst target price of $114.00/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting POWI to reach a target price of $77.33/share, which is 17.35% above the recent price of $65.90. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of MCHP, SLAB, and POWI:Combined, MCHP, SLAB, and POWI represent 7.40% of the SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF. Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
  
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Implied XSD Analyst Target Price: $89@2018-09-13@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/implied-xsd-analyst-target-price-89-2018-09-13

Among the largest underlying components of SOXX, in trading today NVIDIA Corp (Symbol: NVDA) is off about 1.6%, Analog Devices Inc (Symbol: ADI) is off about 0.9%, and Microchip Technology Inc (Symbol: MCHP) is lower by about 0.7%.  The chart below shows the one year price performance of SOXX, versus its 200 day moving average:Looking at the chart above, SOXX's low point in its 52 week range is $142.78 per share, with $198.84 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $185.66. Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@SOXX, NVDA, ADI, MCHP: ETF Outflow Alert@2018-07-30@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/soxx-nvda-adi-mchp-etf-outflow-alert-2018-07-30

" is scheduled to release first-quarter fiscal 2019 results on Aug 9.The company has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 3.85%.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered earnings of $1.40 that surpassedthe Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5 cents. The figure also jumped 20.7% on a year-over-year basis.The year-over-year upside was driven by higher net sales, which increased 11% from the year-ago quarter to $1 billion, comfortably outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $987 million. Notably, net sales have also outpaced the consensus mark in the trailing four quarters.Microchip recently completed the acquisition of Microsemi for $10.3 billion. The deal worth $10.15 billion in total enterprise value was announced on Mar 1, 2018. The deal is anticipated to be immediately accretive for Microchip's earnings on a non-GAAP basis.On the heels of Microsemi synergies, management recently revised first-quarter fiscal 2019 outlook.The company envisions Microsemi acquisition to raise non-GAAP net sales by $160 million-$180 million. Consequently, total non-GAAP net sales are now projected in the range of $1.172-$1.242 billion, up from the previously guided range of $1.012-$1.062 billion.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.21 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of almost 24.3%.Microchip also raised guidance for earnings as it anticipates Microsemi buyout to be accretive immediately and contribute around 2-6 cents. Management now projects earnings to range between $1.41 per share and $1.55 per share. The previously anticipated range was $1.39-$1.49 per share.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings has remained steady at $1.49 per share, reflecting year-over-year growth of 13.7%.Shares of Microchip have gained 14.8% in the  ast year, outperforming the  's rally of 10.5%.This outperformance can primarily be attributed to solid demand witnessed by the company's product portfolio and synergies from accretive acquisitions. End-market diversification and operational efficiencies are also catalysts.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Microchip's microcontroller business (65.6% of fourth-quarter sales) continues to outperform the industry and has enabled it to gain significant market share. In the fourth quarter, segment revenues increased 12.2% year over year to $657.3 million.In the quarter under review, the company introduced new 32-bit SAM L10 and SAM L11 microcontrollers families based on Arm Cortex-M23 core. With the new products, Microchip intends to enhance security of Internet of Things (""IoT"") endpoints.Microchip also announced dsPIC33CH Digital Signal Controller (""DSC"") family, featuring two dsPIC DSC cores on a single chip. The new DSC enables the software developers to integrate code from multiple design teams.We believe that newly launched products will continue to expand customer base. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for microcontroller revenues is pegged at $706 million for the first quarter compared with the year-ago figure of approximately $636 million.Microchip is well poised to capitalize on Microsemi's growth catalysts. Apart from a robust portfolio, the buyout is expected to expand Microchip's total addressable markets. Strong demand for Microsemi's solutions in Data Center, Communications, Defense & Aerospace markets make us optimistic about Microchip's prospects in the near-term.Accretive acquisitions like that of Atmel, in the recent past, have also expanded Microchip's product portfolio and continue to aid top-line growth.Collaboration with Amazon Web services (""AWS"") to support AWS offerings as well as develop secure cloud systems augurs well for the company.Microchip continues to capitalize on enhancing its solution range and improving capacity constraints along with new design wins. This enables the company to gain a competitive edge in the semiconductor industry. The company also maintains a strong balance sheet, which is a notable positive.According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive The Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) are best avoided.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  .Microchip has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, which makes surprise prediction difficult. | Here are some stocks that you may want to consider as our model shows these have the right combination of elements to deliver an earnings beat in its upcoming release.CONVERGEONE HLD  has an Earnings ESP of +9.47% and a Zacks Rank #2.

"Image source: The Motley Fool. (NASDAQ: MCHP)Q1 2019 Aug. 9, 2018, Please standby, we're about to begin. Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Microchip Technology First Quarter and Fiscal Year 2019 Financial Results Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Eric Bjornholt. Please go ahead, sir. -- Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today, as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Chairman and CEO, and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and COO. I will comment on our first quarter fiscal year 2019 financial performance and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance, and provide an update on our integration activities associated with the Microsemi acquisition. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Microchip Technology wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. to learn about these picks!I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at  , which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results.I want to remind investors that during the quarter ending June 30, 2018, we adopted a new GAAP revenue recognition standard, which requires revenue to be recognized at the time products are sold to distributors versus our historical revenue recognition policy, where revenue on such transactions were deferred until the product was sold by our distributors to an end customer. We are not able to provide guidance on a GAAP basis, as we are not able to predict whether inventory at our distributors will increase or decrease in relation to end market demand, as this is not how we manage our business. As evidence of this uncertainty, in recent years we have seen net inventory at our distributors increase or decrease by a significant amount in a single quarter. Our non-GAAP revenue is based on true end market demand in which we measure the revenue based on when the product is sold by our distributors to an end customer. We will continue to manage our business and distributor relationships based on creating and fulfilling end market demand. All of Microchip's bonus programs will continue to work based on the amount of revenue earned from fulfilling market demand. Therefore, along with GAAP results based on sell-in, we will also report our non-GAAP results based on sell-through revenue recognition.I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin, and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis, using revenue based on end market demand, and expenses prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation.Non-GAAP net sales in the June quarter were $1.217 billion, above the midpoint of our guidance and up 21.4% sequentially from net sales of $1.002 billion in the immediately preceding quarter. We have posted a summary of our revenue by product line and geography on our website for your reference.On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were a record 62.2%. Operating expenses were 23.3% of sales and operating income was a record $473.5 million and 38.9% of sales. Non-GAAP net income was a record $405.8 million. Non-GAAP earnings per share was a record $1.61, which was $0.13 above the midpoint of our guidance of $1.48.On a GAAP basis, net sales in the June quarter were $1.213 billion. GAAP gross margins were 52.9% and include the impact of $3.6 million of share-based compensation, $107.7 million of acquisition restructuring and acquired inventory evaluation costs, and $3.4 million impact from changes in distributor inventory levels. Total operating expenses were $509.7 million and include acquisition intangible amortization of $133.7 million, special charges of $40.1 million, which includes $15.9 million of share-based compensation, $26.9 million of acquisition-related and other costs, and share-based compensation of $25.8 million. The GAAP net income was $35.7 million, or $0.14 per diluted share.The non-GAAP cash tax rate was 3.5% in the June quarter. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate for fiscal '19 and the next several years to be between 3% and 4%, exclusive of the transition tax and any potential tax associated with restructuring the Microsemi operations into the Microchip global structure. We have many tax attributes and net operating losses, tax credits, and interest deductions that will keep our cash tax payments low. The transition tax for the combined Microchip-Microsemi group is expected to be about $364 million, was recorded last fiscal year, and will be paid over eight years. The first transition tax payment was made in July 2018 in the amount of $35 million. We expect payments of about $28 million in fiscal years 2020 through 2023, $54 million in fiscal year 2024, $72 million in 2025, and $91 million in fiscal year '26.Microchip's GAAP tax rate in the June quarter was 5.2% and was impacted by the various GAAP purchase accounting adjustments from the Microsemi acquisition and prior acquisitions, as well as one-time discrete benefits related to changes in U.S. and foreign tax laws.Moving on to the balance sheet, our inventory balance at June 30, 2018 was $1.105 billion, including $359.7 million of inventory mark-up from Microsemi required for GAAP purchase accounting. Excluding the inventory mark-up, we had 119 days of inventory at the end of the June quarter. Our targeted inventory levels are between 115 and 120 days. Inventory at our distributors in the June quarter were at 40 days compared to 36 days at the end of March. The historical Microchip distributor inventory was actually down by about a day in the June quarter but the consolidated increase is driven by the high inventory in the Microsemi distribution channel. We expect the Microsemi distribution inventory to reduce through the end of calendar year 2018.The cash flow from operating activities was $302.4 million in the June quarter. As of June 30, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $649.7 million. At June 30, our debt outstanding includes $3.3 billion of borrowings under our line of credit, $3 billion of Term Loan B, $2 billion of high-grade bonds, and $4.5 billion of convertible debt. Our net debt to EBITDA, excluding our very long-dated convertible debt that matures in 2037 and is more equity-like in nature, was 5.0 at June 30, 2018.Our leverage is higher than we originally projected, primarily due to lower EBITDA from the Microsemi business, driven by needing to correct distribution inventory levels through lower shipment activity. We are fully committed to using 100% of our excess cash generation beyond our dividend payments to reduce our debt levels and we expect our net leverage to decline dramatically over the next several years.Capital expenditures were $89.4 million in the June 2018 quarter. We expect about $70 million in capital spending in the September quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2019 to be about $220 million to $250 million. We continue to add capital to support the growth of our production capabilities for our fast-growing new products and technologies and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. These capital investments will bring significant gross margin improvements to our business, particularly for the Atmel and Microsemi manufacturing activities that we are bringing into our own factories. Depreciation expense in the June quarter was $38 million.I will now turn it over to Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the June quarter and to provide an update on some of the Microsemi integration activity. Ganesh? -- Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Before we get started with the product line discussion, I thought it may be helpful to summarize what we said at our May 31st conference call in regards to our revenue reporting. Classic Microchip, which is Microchip excluding Microsemi, used to report five product lines: microcontrollers, analog, memory, licensing, and, finally, multi-market and other, what we used to call MMO. In fiscal year 2018, our revenue of $3.98 billion was split across the five product lines as follows: microcontrollers at 65.8%, analog at 23.9%, memory at 5%, licensing at 2.6%, and MMO at 2.6%.With the addition of Microsemi, we will add a sixth product line category called FBGA. Microsemi's revenue reporting will be split across four of the six product line categories: in microcontrollers, analog, FBGA, and MMO. Microsemi has no memory or licensing product lines and hence the contribution to these categories will be zero.Directionally, on a combined basis, we expect our analog revenue percentage to tick up, while our microcontroller revenue percentage will tick down. That is exactly what the final results for our Q1 has shown, with a partial quarter of Microsemi results included in our overall results.Now let's get to the product line performance. On a combined company basis, we performed a little better than we expected in the June quarter, with sequential revenue growth of 21.4% as compared to the March quarter. Microchip, excluding Microsemi, achieved a new record for revenue. The Microchip 2.0 transformation continues to make good progress, especially in terms of new design opportunities, as we enable our clients' innovation with the very best, smart, connected, and secure solutions.Taking a closer look at microcontrollers, our microcontroller business, excluding Microsemi, set a new record in the June quarter. Microcontroller revenue, excluding Microsemi, also outgrew classic Microchip overall. Both 8-bit microcontroller and 32-bit microcontrollers from classic Microchip set new records. On a combined basis including Microsemi, our microcontroller business was sequentially up 10.8% as compared to the March quarter.Our microcontroller portfolio and roadmap has never been stronger and we are seeing continued growth in our design funnel, which we expect will drive future growth as these designs progress into production over time. We believe we have the new product momentum and customer engagement to continue to gain even more share in 2018, as we further build the best-performing microcontroller franchise in the industry.Now moving to our analog business, our analog revenue, excluding Microsemi, set a new record in the June quarter. Analog revenue, excluding Microsemi, also outgrew classic Microchip overall. And on a combined basis, our analog business was sequentially up 35% as compared to the March quarter.Moving next to our licensing business, this business was sequentially up 0.2% as compared to the March quarter and up 5.8% as compared to the year ago quarter. Our memory business was sequentially down 1.8% in the June quarter as compared to the March quarter. And, finally, our MMO business for Microchip, excluding Microsemi, was down sequentially. However, it was up 63% sequentially when including Microsemi.On a combined company basis, which has a full quarter of Microchip and a partial quarter of Microsemi, our FQ1 2019 revenue of $1.2 billion was split on the six product lines we report as follows: microcontrollers at 59.9%, analog at 27%, FBGA at 3.4%, memory at 4%, licensing at 2.2%, and MMO at 3.5%. We expect the tick down in microcontroller revenue percentage and tick up in analog revenue percentage will be further accentuated when we announce our FQ2 results in November, as we will have a full quarter of Microsemi revenue included in the results.Now on an update on the Microsemi integration and our progress since our May 31st conference call. We made dramatic changes to the top-level leadership structure in the first few weeks after the close. Essentially all of the top leadership are no longer with Microchip. The reasons for this will be more evident after Steve provides you some color in his section. As we have done in other large acquisitions, we have used our leadership depth and strong pipeline to insert Microchip executive leaders in the top positions to run the Microsemi enterprise.The business unit restructuring is progressing well. We have retained several of the key Microsemi business unit leaders to continue to run their businesses, while selectively combining some of the smaller businesses where Microchip had similar product lines into the Microchip business unit structure. This eliminates duplicate infrastructure and creates synergy in the process. We have also restructured some of the less profitable businesses and adjusted their going-forward investment levels to be consistent with what is affordable and we have some more to go.The sales integration has commenced. We have converted the sales team to a Microchip style non-commission sales team and ended all incentives and discount product for quarter-end revenue maximization. Teams from classic Microchip and Microsemi have started to identify and pursue product cross-selling opportunities and have also identified reference designs that can take advantage of our combined total solutions approach. Several of the sales office space consolidations have already taken place and many more are in the works.The normal analysis of effectiveness of channels, as well as of each channel partner, is under way. One decision we have already made, which was announced last week, is the refranchising of Avnet from Microsemi products. That's adding more channel bandwidth to sell Microsemi's products.The operations integration work has started but it is an enormously complex undertaking, as little to no integration of prior Microsemi acquisitions had taken place. For example, Microsemi has 21 ERP installations that we need to converge in our business system and operational integration plans. We expect to have the plan worked out by the end of this month and start working toward specific business system and operational integration goals at that time. However, given the complexity that we're seeing, we expect the operational integration will be a two- to three-year project.We're also performing a detailed analysis of what outsourced operations can be insourced, as well as evaluating the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of Microsemi's internal factories. Lastly, the normal task of working with the supplier base to find the best cost from either company and applying it to the other is happening as we speak.In the G&A areas, we have eliminated some of the support organizational cost redundancies. More will happen after we get further along with our business system and operational integration plans.Let me now pass it to Steve for some comments about our business and our guidance going forward. Steve? -- Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to first reflect on the results of the fiscal first quarter of 2019. I will then provide commentary on our first two months at Microsemi. I will then provide guidance for the fiscal second quarter of 2019.Our June quarter financial results were good. Our consolidated net sales came in above the midpoint of our revised guidance that we issued on May 31, 2018, after the closing of the Microsemi transaction. In discussion with our Board of Directors, the Board wants us to manage as a combined business from Day 1, not break out the individual components of Microchip and Microsemi, and proceed to integrate the businesses together at a rapid pace. The Board does not want to engage in the old controversy of organic versus inorganic growth and wants to measure us on the overall results achieved.What we are driving toward is to produce an increasing non-GAAP earnings per share from the combined company. This worked well when we acquired Atmel and it should work well here. Therefore, we will not provide a breakdown of the two businesses other than some useful nuggets of information along the way. I will refer to Microchip business without Microsemi as classic Microchip. When we include Microsemi, we will call it consolidated.So our class Microchip non-GAAP revenue, non-GAAP gross margin, and non-GAAP operating margins were all new records last quarter. Our overall consolidated non-GAAP revenue, non-GAAP gross margin, and non-GAAP EPS were also new records. Non-GAAP EPS exceeded the high end of our guidance.The non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.61, $0.13 better than the midpoint of our guidance. $0.05 of this EPS beat came from higher operating profits and the balance $0.08 of the EPS beat came from a much lower tax rate. Our tax rate guidance was intentionally conservative in the wake of new tax laws and significant uncertainty of the tax rate of the combined company after acquisition of Microsemi. We consider the tax planning for the combined company to be a part of our planned synergy and had intentionally modeled for it in our synergies planning.On a non-GAAP basis, this was also our 111th consecutive profitable quarter.Our inventory at classic Microchip at the end of June 2018 were 119 days, which is right at our target of 115 to 120 days. The total inventory, including Microsemi, is cluttered by purchase accounting adjustments, with inventories written up to market value, and hence the total inventory indicator is not meaningful.We have made enormous progress on the manufacturing side by bringing capacity online and decreasing lead times. Our lead times are now near normal, with the majority of our products having lead times of between 4-8 weeks. But scattered issues with certain products continue to cause longer lead times on those products.Now let us shift gears. I will give you our observation from our first two months at Microsemi. This has been the time when we are able to get access to all the company's information that we were not able to get before. And this is a time when we discover some of the weaknesses, as we have found in other acquisitions like Atmel and Micrel. This is typically the low point in the acquisition. Things usually rapidly improve from here, as we go to work to fix things and integrate.In the case of Microsemi, we found that Microsemi management was extremely aggressive in shipping inventory into the distribution channel. Microsemi's distributors had about four months of inventory, whereas Microchip's distributors carry about two and a half months of inventory. While we have seen some excess shipments of inventory into the distribution channel in other acquisitions, we have never seen as much excess as we found in the case of Microsemi. Microsemi also always shipped into the contract manufacturers by making deals and offering discounts. This excessive distribution in contract manufacturers' inventory will provide some headwind for revenue for the next couple of quarters. Our trailing EBITDA and the next two quarters of cash generation will also be impacted by needing to correct this inventory for Microsemi products.While excessive shipments into distribution and contract manufacturers has been the main issue at Microsemi, we also found a culture of excessive extravagance and high spending. The company had millions of dollars of sponsorships and several luxury suites in sports stadiums, luxury private plane travel, and generous sponsorships for many conferences, stadiums, and other venues that are a waste of shareholders' money. We are undoing commitments to all such spending.So what are we doing to clean up our excess inventory and other spending? We did not make any deals with the distribution, contract manufacturers, or end customers in the month of June to ship excess inventory. As a result, we shipped close to $100 million less in the month of June than Microsemi's ex-management would have shipped. That was nearly half the inventory correction accomplished in a single month. We expect to achieve the balance of the distribution inventory correction in the next two quarters and nearly complete the correction by the end of this calendar year.Based on high inventory in distribution, as well as inside Microsemi, we have substantially cut back on the manufacturing build plan in internal factories, as well as foundries and assembly test subcontractors. The vast majority of Microsemi business is subcontracted so we will see a dollar-for-dollar cash saving, which will offset the negative cash impact of -- some of the negative cash impact of inventory correction.While this may seem disappointing, we have seen such challenges before, as the problems of the acquired company become more visible post-close. We remain optimistic about the medium and longer term prospects from the Microsemi acquisition and are not changing our longer term thesis. We have high confidence in the $300 million of synergies that we've previously communicated. Microsemi has a very good engineering team. We are still very bullish on the Microsemi products, the stickiness of the customers' sockets, and the end market opportunities for the combined company. Our strategy for the better part of this decade has been to buy underperforming assets and turn them into world-class performers in the likes of Microchip. Here, we are starting with excellent products and excellent gross margins and we will correct the excessive distribution and contract manufacturing shipments and high expense culture as we have done before, for example, at Atmel.Now let us go into the non-GAAP guidance for the September quarter. In addition to the headwinds I described on Microsemi, there are several small factors that are starting to impact the business. Standalone, none of them would be material but all of them together are causing us to provide a cautious guidance for fiscal second quarter of 2019. I will describe four reasons.No. 1, the lead times in the market for some of the passive components continue to be long. We are seeing pushouts by several customers because they cannot complete the whole kit and hence do not need our devices.No. 2, all the talk about tariffs and trade war is making our customers nervous. While it is hard to put your finger on it, it is hurting business confidence, which makes people pull back on investments, expansion, and capital spending. A very small portion of products are made in China and an even smaller portion are imported back in the U.S. so we are not worried about duties on our products imported into the U.S. But we are concerned about our customers' products imported into the U.S. This is based on original July 6th tariff implementation. We are still analyzing the impact of expected August 23rd tariff implementation.Here is a quote from one of our sources, one of our customers. ""The United States imposed 25% tariffs on some Chinese goods on July 6th. The U.S. issued a list of thousands of Chinese goods for the new tariffs. It makes manufacturers conservative in building product due to uncertainty of market demand.""Third point, we are seeing the impact of not being fully able to ship to ZTE. While the Justice Department is now allowing shipments to ZTE, ZTE is still organizing and figuring out what their real demand is now and if they can assemble the entire bill of materials with long lead times on passive components. So despite the release from the Justice Department, there has been some demand destruction at ZTE.No. 4, Microchip is a supplier to Bitcoin mining industry by supplying microcontrollers and power management products for the power supplies, as well as Ethernet controllers. Bitcoin values have crashed. It has lowered the demand for new shipments to the Bitcoin industry quite substantially.With all this commentary, we expect total non-GAAP net revenue in the September quarter to be between $1.474 billion to $1.55 billion. Our best estimate for overall non-GAAP gross margin is between 61.3% and 61.9% of sales, a range wider than normal as we integrate and understand Microsemi, as well as deal with the excess inventory in the channel and resultant reduction in the internal factory builds. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 23.6% and 24.2% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating profit to be between 37.1% and 38.2% of sales.And we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $1.65 and $1.83 per share. This includes more than the $0.15 of accretion from Microsemi that we had originally guided to. So you can see that, despite the significant headwind on Microsemi's revenue and cautious guidance, our non-GAAP EPS guidance at the midpoint is well above prior consensus analysts' estimates. This reflects our rapid pruning of some underperforming product lines, raising some prices on mature products, and significant restructuring already at Microsemi.Our guidance also represents some excellent tax planning, resulting in a lower effective cash tax rate. Our synergy assumptions included this tax planning for the combined company. We do expect our financial results to be a bit noisy for a couple of quarters, as we correct distribution and subcontractor inventories and as we adjust our internal manufacturing based on inventory correction. But our synergy assumptions for fiscal year '19 and our long-term synergy assumption of $300 million and our fiscal year '21 non-GAAP EPS target of $8.00 per share have not changed. The target for non-GAAP EPS of $8.00 per share in fiscal year '21 may, in fact, seem conservative in light of the progress we have made in integration and a much lower effective cash tax rate. And we expect to exceed the $0.75 accretion guidance that we had provided as the annualized run rate accretion for the first year after close.Given all the complications of accounting for the acquisitions, including amortization of the intangibles, restructuring charges, inventory write-up on acquisitions, and changes in distribution inventory, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on a non-GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters and we request that the analysts continue to report their non-GAAP estimates to first call.With this, Operator, will you please poll for questions.Thank you. If you'd like to ask a question, please signal by pressing ""*1"" on your telephone keypad. If you are using a speaker phone, please make sure your mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment. And due to time constraints, we ask that you limit yourself to one question per person. Again, that's ""*1"" to ask a question.We'll take our first question from Harsh Kumar with Piper Jaffray. Go ahead, sir. -- Yeah, hey, thanks, Steve. It seems like you guys are going through the normal things when you acquire a company. Steve, I had a quick question for you and a follow-up. You mentioned a lot of things that are coming into play, Bitcoin, some other stuff, trade wars. I'm curious, does your guidance on the top line take into account, obviously the Microsemi inventory clearing, but is there also a slowdown in your organic business? Or is it mostly all Microsemi that's being played out in your revenue guide? -- We're not breaking it out but it's a combination. And the Bitcoin exposure was on the Microchip side. ZTE exposure was mostly on the Microsemi side. If there is any kind of demand slowdown because of tariffs, if the customers would be nervous to draw down their inventories because they do not know what the tariffs would be to bring the product into the U.S., then that will really affect both sides, Microchip as well as Microsemi. So it's really a combination. But a fair amount of correction really is on the Microsemi side. -- Got it, Steve. And then for my follow-up, your margins in the September guide are slightly lower than your margins in what you reported in the June. I'm assuming that that's predominantly a function of you guys taking down the Microsemi inventory quite hard down in the channel. And then how do you -- do you expect -- you said you cleared 50% in one month. Do you expect the rest to be cleared evenly or you're going to come down pretty hard in September again and then sort of ease off with very little left in December? -- Several questions. Let's take the margin first. Microsemi margins are lower than Microchip's classic margins. Many investors and analysts may have forgotten that Microsemi acquired a company called Vectron back in September. And that company only had a little over 30% gross margin. So that brought the gross margins low. But during all that time, they had been sort of in the acquisition so they never reported -- Microsemi never reported their March quarter when their margins were impacted by Vectron. And prior quarter was some sort of ratio. So -- -- Just to clarify, that acquisition was in the November/December timeframe of 2017. Not September. -- Okay. So I stand corrected. And that makes my point actually better. So since it was in that November/December timeframe, the first full quarter of the lower Vectron margin would have presented itself in the March quarter and March quarter was never reported by Microsemi anyway because they were already in acquisition. So we are seeing lower gross margins for Microsemi. So last quarter was only one month. And this quarter, we have the entire quarter. So, therefore, it has a larger impact of the lower gross margins. And this quarter, we will also see the impact of substantial reduction of the build rates in the internal factories of Microsemi. But that was the answer on the gross margin side. The other part of your question was? -- Distribution correction. -- Distribution correction. So roughly the $100 million left that we shipped was a combination of shipments. Lower shipments through distribution, to contract manufacturers, and also to direct customers, because there was essentially equal opportunity making deals with everybody and shipping excess product into every channel. So out of the $100 million, a good portion, more than half of that, was a correction in distribution. We will see another distribution correction in the September quarter and the December quarter. And right now we're expecting that that will complete the majority of the correction. The largest piece got done last month in the month of June. And then the September and December will be two roughly equal pieces. And, if anything is left after that, it's kind of a tail, you know. A very, very small portion here and there which will not be meaningful. -- Understood. Thanks, Steve and guys, and best of luck. -- Thank you.Thank you. And next we'll hear from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. -- Yeah, good afternoon, Steve, and thanks for letting me ask the question. Steve, I just want to go back to yours and the Board's decision not to kind of break out Microsemi. I think that makes a lot of sense looking several quarters out, especially because you're so confident in the revenue synergies on this transaction that you included it in the initial synergy targets. But as you kind of think about the June and the September quarter, if you can just help me understand the rationale of not telling us what Microsemi lost. And to the extent that you're not, can you help us get some comfort level about how the classic Microchip business is performing relative to peers? Because, in the absence of kind of not being able to do that math, I think it's pretty easy to perhaps wrongfully conclude that maybe the core Microchip business just isn't holding up as well as some of your peers in this environment. -- Well, John, I'm surprised to get that question from you. Really rightly, Day 1, we took our guy who runs our networking business and he took over the internet business and all those products are combined and we're getting a single forecast from that division. Similarly, the case with our analog products, private management products, and others. I think if you go back to the Atmel scenario, if we had managed the business to look at Atmel's 8-bit MCUs and Microchip's 8-bit MCUs and Atmel's 32-bit MCUs and Microchip's and the square products and automotive and others, we probably wouldn't have gotten as good of results in Atmel as we were able to get because we went at it as it's really one business, shipped the lowest cross-product at the highest ASP, wherever you have the best specs and best product. And that's really what we're doing here.We just don't want to spend, and the Board doesn't want to spend, any of the company's energy to do it any other way. I think Microchip business was fine and Microsemi business was fine. One month can't tell the story because the business was very non-linear. So even though you're looking at, overall, we achieved the numbers and slightly better than the guidance, both theses were in the range so there's really not a problem. But reporting it is just like a slippery slope. Honestly, John, what you guys would like is really there are two clean spreadsheets, one and the other, and everything adds up and 2 + 2 = 4.00000. And the world is too complex on our side. We've got too many moving parts and things are moving too fast and this whole inventory correction got shoved on us from Microsemi that we were not aware of. There was so much inventory. And the Board doesn't want to put the energy on what doesn't add value in us really driving the business. -- That's helpful, Steve. And then you kind of updated us or reiterated a lot of the accretion targets around Microsemi. I'm just kind of curious, given that there are some concerns about the leverage on the balance sheet relative to this deal, can you just give us an update on how we should think about leverage going forward and how aggressively you're thinking about taking that leverage down? Thank you. -- Certainly. Eric can point that out to the leverage. -- Okay. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, our leverage on a net basis, excluding our very long-dated convertible, was 5.0 at the end of June. We had originally guided that we'd have about a turn reduction per year. And because of the distribution and inventory correction that we need to make, we think that in that first year, we're going to be somewhere in the 0.75 range in terms of reduction. And then get back to the one turn per year. So a little bit slower pace and absolutely we are focused on de-leveraging the balance sheet and using 100% of our excess cash generation beyond the dividend to pay down debt. So it's a focus area of ours. We know that we have a lot of leverage at this point in time but we're committed to bring it down. -- That reduction from one turn to 0.7 turns is largely because of shortage of the next two quarters. When you look at it on the LTN basis a year from now, the September quarter and December quarter are going through substantial inventory correction. That is a shortage of the EBITDA. After that, we get back to one turn. -- Helpful, guys. Thanks for the detail, as always.And our next question will come from William Stein with SunTrust. -- Great. Thank you for taking my questions. I have two. First, I know in the past, you've evaluated potential divestitures. I wonder in this case if you think that, if valuation continues, is it more or less likely than in the past? You highlight this lower margin Vectron business. Is there anything that you might want to divest? And then I have a follow-up, please. -- Well, I think we always evaluate other things when we buy a company. And as you have seen in our prior acquisitions, we have really divested very little. There was a tiny, small piece out of the Atmel. There was nothing out of Standard Microsystems. There was nothing out of Micrel. Nothing out of Supertex. We look at divestiture more driven by ""it doesn't fit at all"" rather than ""it isn't performing well"" or ""it's lower margin."" Because we fix margins. We fix pricing, increase pricing. We adjust the model mix of the products. We move the product into a different set of customers, industrial or automotive and others, where the margins may be higher. We have done that in many, many acquisitions and we'll do similar things here. The acquired company focus or the reach may be in a certain set of customers and we expand that and improve margins. So, so far, we have not found anything we're going to divest but it's only been a couple of months and that's not what we are focused on, divesting. We are focused on improving. -- Thanks. And as a follow-up, I just want to make sure I understand the discussion point around Microsemi's having stuffed not only the distribution channel but other sort of channels, including, it sounds like, direct customers as well. And when we marry that up with Microchip's approach to rev rec, which is sell-through, the reduction in inventory in the channel, that doesn't actually reduce your non-GAAP revenue. Maybe perhaps a shortfall in your outlook on the revenue side is more driven by the reductions in inventory perhaps at contract manufacturing and other direct customers, but not what's going to distribution. Is that the right way to think about it? -- Well, good question. Very good question. That would be the case if everything was pure. But everything was not pure. They had also -- ex-management had also taken -- every quarter, they would take some direct customers and move them to distribution by giving distribution some discount so they could make a margin on it. And in doing so, they would take the next couple of quarters of product for that customer and stuff them into distribution. So, therefore, you get to recognize higher sell-in revenue because, to the end customer, you only ship 1x, but to the distributor, you can give them 1.5x or 2x. And they would do some of that every quarter. So there was, overall, more than a couple hundred million dollars of direct accounts had been moved to distribution over the last year or so. And you can't totally put your finger on it but a lot of that seemed to coincide when it was sort of decided when the company would be sold. There is some timeline you can triangulate to. It's not something I can really prove. -- Thanks. -- Therefore, there is inventory sitting in distribution for the direct customers. And those direct customers, we are converting them back to direct customers but they won't be buying anything for a little while until the distribution has cleared out their inventory, shipping it to the direct customers. -- Got it. Thank you. -- Does that make sense to you? -- Yeah, it does help clarify. Thank you.Thank you. And next from Raymond James, we'll hear from Chris Caso. -- Yes, hi, thank you. Just as a follow-on to the other question, I guess, as we look forward, I guess from what I'm hearing you saying, the quarterly revenue that we were seeing from Microsemi, at least for the past couple of quarters, was inflated, if we looked at it on a pure, sell-through, consumption basis. I mean, is there any way you can give us any help with where the correct run rate should be? I guess, suffice to say, it's lower than what we were seeing reported over the last few quarters? -- You're correct. The revenue they reported -- now, there was -- I want to be very clear that there was no fraud involved, because the SE606 allows you to recognize revenue shipped to distribution at sell-in. Now, the question is -- -- And so did the prior revenue recognition standard of 605. -- Yeah. So ordinarily a management team, in managing the business, will ship to distribution roughly what distribution ships out and have the distribution inventory grow only by the amount of distribution shipping amount, in terms of business growing. That's not really what happened here, hiding under the revenue recognition that sell-in is a revenue recognition. There were a large number of deals made with the distribution. When the inventory got higher and higher, they even offered interest subsidy to the distributor to carry inventory beyond a certain number of months, because the distributor wouldn't want to carry -- he has his money tied up. And they would off interest subsidy. So basically shipping to distribution was made an art form almost. So, yes, the revenue was higher than the real end market demand.Now, at this point in time, we're not totally prepared to give you that number. I think it's not extremely large. It's in a few percentage range. But we need to clear out this inventory over the next one or two quarters and, ourselves, be comfortable with what the run rate is. There will be, as we clean out this inventory over the next couple of quarters, there will be a larger revenue increase as we head toward the full board shipment, because inventory correction is over. So there will be some attenuation out in time of the growth rate, and I think we'll provide you some guidance over time, but not today. -- Okay. That's helpful. If, for my follow-up, I could pivot on to the Microchip organic business. And I understood what you said about those four issues, which were impacting revenue as we go into the September quarter. Can you talk to the sustainability of those headwinds? I mean, is this what you'd consider to be sort of a short-term issue? Maybe you could speak to the health, outside of these four issues that you talked about, the health of the remaining business and then what you're seeing in terms of order rates. Any change in the fundamentals to the business, I suppose. -- So core Microchip business does not really have any fundamental problem. I think there isn't anything we're trying to correct there. I think our issues are on the Microsemi side. But, if you take those four points, the lead times on passives you have heard from many other companies. The whole industry is kind of being impacted. We do not know why passive lead times are that long and the growth has not been -- it's not like businesses have grown 30% to 40% where passives can't be provided. But there must have been significant reduction in passive capacity of some kind. So that's not long-lasting. I think, as the industry corrects and passive lead times comes down, that issue will go away.The tariffs and trade war is beyond our scope of being able to control it or fathom it. And we don't know any more than anybody else does, what the effect of that would be.The ZTE situation, Microchip had a fairly small business with ZTE. But the overall business, Microsemi had larger business, but it's not huge. For the combined company, I can't give you an exact number, but let's say it's the order of 1%. Standalone, that wouldn't be meaningful. That wouldn't be all that large. You don't highlight 1% kind of customers. But if there's a significant demand destruction and one goes to half, then 0.5% change on a sequential basis can be meaningful.And the Bitcoin is similar. Bitcoin was on the core Microchip side. It's not like it's a huge business like maybe at some other companies, like Nvidia or something. For us, it was like a 1% type business. But it's down 70% or more. So stand-alone it's not really very much. With all these moving parts, you can make up with growth in other segments. But when you combine many of these factors together and with all the headwinds from Microsemi, we cannot make up for these small components when you add these four together. I don't know if that helps. -- Yep, it helps. Thank you.And next we'll go to Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. -- Yes, thank you. Steve, just going back to the topic of tariffs and the business confidence. Are you seeing any change in terms of order activity that your customers have been placing? -- We have -- yeah. We are seeing it in order activity. More than that, I think, we are seeing it in distribution sell-through in China to those customers. A fair amount of business in China is down through distribution, just because logistics and all that. We do business both direct and distribution. We're seeing it in both channels. Distribution does business with lots and lots of small customers who build stuff, hardware, that ships back into the U.S. And we have always told you our business consists of long tail thousands and thousands, probably 70,000-80,000, small customers, which can adjust their build rates in real time. They're really nimble. And when they think they don't really know if they can pass on this cost to their end customer in the U.S., whether they are competitive with the 25% duty, will this product have a duty or not have a duty, it makes them pull back on their builds. And we're seeing that impact in sales out from distribution in China. -- I appreciate the color there. And then on Microsemi, once you get through the inventory correction adjustments over the next couple of quarters, are there any parts of the business that you call out that you see as attractive from a growth perspective or have a better outlook once you get past these issues? -- Well, I mean, we like lots of different businesses. They have very good FBGA business. They have very good business in the data center. They have very, very good business in analog and discrete, aerospace and defense. And then there are certain businesses maybe not as great. I mentioned one, the electronics business they bought. We don't know why they bought that. We have some -- that was a low margin business and Microchip would not have bought it. But there are a number of good businesses.What attracted us to Microsemi in the first place really hasn't changed. We had not imagined this seven months of inventory correction and crisis that we have to go through. But fundamentally we're saying, fiscally at '21, guidance that we gave you at $8.00 per share is now conservative. This year, we said by the end of this fiscal year, we'll be producing $0.75 of accretion. We think that is conservative. -- Okay. Thanks.And next we have Kevin Cassidy with Stifel. -- Yeah, thanks for taking my question. On the CapEx guidance, it seems the second half of the year, the CapEx comes down quite a bit to maybe 2.5% of revenue or so. Is that going to be the run rate going forward or is that just a temporary adjustment? -- I would say longer term, Kevin, probably a good estimate to use is 4% of revenue. We need to continue to evaluate the Microsemi business and see with the investments there. Obviously we'll be looking to see if there's ways that we can improve the margin on their products by making investments like we've done in other acquisitions and investing in assembly and tests and bringing activities in-house. So I think that's kind of the swing factor there. But, yeah, we were more heavily weighted in the front end of fiscal '19 from a CapEx perspective. -- And that heavily weighted, those products you were targeting, certain long lead times, so as all your lead times, you feel like you've got the equipment in place to correct that? -- Our lead times are in very good condition at this point in time. I think Steve mentioned that the majority of our products have lead times of 4-8 weeks. And there's always some exceptions to that and we're making the proper investments to correct all our lead times to the right level. -- Okay, great. Thank you.And our next question comes from Chris Danely with Citi. Chris, go ahead. -- There. Can you hear me? -- Yes, Chris, go ahead. -- Sorry. Wrong mute button. Fat fingers here. So just a couple of clarifications. So, Steve, it sounds like the headwinds from Microchip and Microsemi are going to last a couple quarters. I guess conceptually, how big of an impact should we be thinking about into the December and March quarters would it be? And then what gives you confidence that revenues should bottom in the March quarter? And then do you think that at least this slowdown you're seeing on, I guess, the classic Microchip business, would you expect this to hit others in this space? -- Well, to your last question, I don't have any comment. For others, ask the others. We don't comment on the industry, we comment only on ourselves.In terms of the inventory correction, inventory correction we can somewhat control because we're working with distribution and contract manufacturers and end customers, moving the end customers back from distribution to direct, which were erroneously transferred to distribution and should not have been. And that we know we will complete sometime in the calendar fourth quarter. And to distribution, we are monitoring very, very carefully shipping less product to them.With the distribution, they didn't want all this inventory. So in the month of June, we simply didn't offer them any discounts and then they didn't take the inventory. You don't have to do much. You just run the business. Say, ""Distribution, buy what you need."" And it will get corrected by the end of the year. You don't have to do much in that case. Because inventory was jammed through incentives and discounts and, to smaller distributors, even threatening. You don't do any of that, inventory will correct. So we have high confidence that the inventory corrects. That's not an issue.The impact of tariffs, nobody can call. We don't really know what happens in the trade war area. The passive components issue, I think, should go away because capacity is being added. I think that should go away. ZTE is temporary. ZTE will get its act together and figure out what their real demand is, what demand they have lost to their competitors. And the Bitcoin is anybody's guess. It's not a huge portion of our business over a long period of time. For $1.5 billion roughly per quarter, 1%, we're talking about $15 million a quarter. So it's really not a huge, huge portion of the business. And we don't know whether Bitcoin comes back to its old glory or not.So I think the main issue is the inventory correction one. That gets corrected in six months. And then the tariff one is not clear. -- Thanks. I guess one last quick one before I leave. I mean, were these guys worse than Atmel, in terms of the shenanigans they were pulling out there? You guys corralled the Atmel stuff pretty handily. Is this a similar situation or is it worse? -- Well, I'm not willing accuse anything. I just think the accounting standard is wrong. And we have been seeing it from the beginning and we wrote even a position paper on it when the accounting standard was changed for the sell-in. all you need is a willing distributor or a set of distributors who are willing to take an increasing amount of inventory, which will ship out eventually someday. There are products in distribution from Microsemi that will take two years to clear. It's not a huge amount. And like we're saying, the majority of it will clear by the end of the year. But there are certain products.Every quarter, they would take certain products, older products, and slate them as end-of-life. Then they would build three or four years of inventory and give it to a distributor and recognize it as revenue in the current quarter. And next quarter, do it with some more products, some more products. And standard allows it, since it's nonreturnable by the distributor. You give them at a deep discount and you give them interest subsidy so the distributor is willing to carry it. They will eventually ship it. The standard allows you to recognize it for revenue. So they didn't do anything illegal.But the issue is they represented to us, to their own analysts before, to their customers or to the investors and everybody else, that that was the end run rate. And legally that was the run rate because they could continue to do this for I don't know how long, until some day it bursts. That's not how we do it. We have never stuffed the channel in our life. We have always recognized revenue on sell-through, even though now GAAP standard says you have to account for sell-in. We're giving you that GAAP number but we give no GAAP guidance. We manage our business on sell-through. All of our incentives are based on sell-through.So I'd just say that's really what happened. They did what they were allowed to do. -- Okay. Thanks a lot for all the clarification, Steve.And our next question will come from Kristin Sciacca with Nomura Instinet. --  -- Good afternoon. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Maybe just a different take on the revenues for the second half of this fiscal year. So on prior calls you've noted that December and March typically tend to be the softer quarters seasonally, with December being the weakest. Given the inventory issues that you are having with Microsemi, are you expecting any changes to the seasonality or do you expect this to still be the case? -- Well, we expect that still to be the case. But what you start to see is really certain products' inventory corrects. Now, it all doesn't all correct in one day. Certain products have high inventory, certain products have low inventory, and every month, certain products' inventory corrects. So their run rate returns back to normal. So you've got lots of moving parts.Where you should see an ordinary kind of December weak quarter, to the extent certain products' inventory has corrected, those see an uplift. So I think driven by all those, we should just see a normal low single digit down kind of December quarter. I think that's usually what we see. -- I think in all our acquisitions in the past as well, the blend of seasonality will adjust and it'll take some time before all that settles out. So I don't think a historical seasonality would be an accurate predictor of future seasonality when there are acquisitions with different seasonalities and different blending taking place. --  -- Understood. Thanks for the detail. And then on a more positive note, can you just maybe detail what was behind some of the strong growth in analog and your microcontroller segments for classic Microchip this quarter? -- If you're asking for segments of growth, we don't break out any of the segments. Those businesses have been in a long-term growth mode. We have shared with you what we have been doing with Microchip 2.0, with the Total System Solutions. You have to note, though, that some of the growth this quarter that we're showing sequentially is a combined company growth and so reflects some of the addition of Microsemi in those numbers. We haven't broken out the classic Microchip microcontrollers or analog, other than to give you some comfort that they both hit records, they both grew more than classic Microchip as an average, so that you can see the underlying strength in those businesses. -- I would say some of the questions are overly focused on just the shortfall in revenue guidance. Nobody has mentioned that the earnings guidance is $0.07 better than consensus. I think you all's consensus was $1.67 or $1.68. At the midpoint, we're guiding $1.74. So we're doing very well, actually. We're increasing our assessment of the overall earnings for the year and, going out of the year, the accretion we can get. So I think look at the glass also half full.And we, at the end of the day, deliver non-GAAP earnings per share increasing amount. That is our goal. That's where all of our incentives are built on. That's what the Board manages us by. And even the EBITDA doesn't give you the credit for a lower tax rate. If the earnings per share are better for a given share count, that's creating a higher amount of total profit after tax. So we feel pretty good about where we are and how we executed the quarter, how we're carrying out the integration. The issues and challenges we've seen in inventory correction, they're straightforward. They're fixable. It's not like we need to devise a tool or do some invention. It's just normal blocking and tackling to correct debt. But, otherwise, earnings per share are great. --  -- Alright. Thank you. -- Thank you.And our next question will come from Harlan Sur from JP Morgan. -- Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I understand top line rationalization is kind of taking a second priority to some of the more structural changes you're making in terms of business process improvements at Microsemi. But if I look at Microsemi's data center storage and OTN optical product lines, these are very different products, right? Leading edge silicon, leading edge packaging, big, complex chip designs. Very different versus Microchip's focus on classic, embedded microcontroller, analog, memory, and all the other complementary building blocks around this. So help me understand how the storage and the OTN optical stuff kind of fits into the Microchip 2.0 model. -- So they are stand-alone businesses. You are right. They do have more leading edge process technologies and design technologies and packaging in many cases that they use. But that's not different from when we went to SMSC five years ago, six years ago, in the acquisition. It brought a new degree of complexity. We adapt to it. It fits within the overall portfolio. We find the strengths that the acquired entity has and bring it into the rest of Microchip. We find the strengths that Microchip has and take it back to the acquired businesses. And on a blended basis, if we don't' get out of our box, our growth opportunity is unlimited. So, of course, new product lines will bring new complexity but they also bring lots of opportunity to use the strengths of both companies and that's the way we look at it and how we go forward.And in these two businesses, in specific, there's also a substantial amount of Microchip classic content available to us to take into those markets where they have significant strength, customer presence, and visibility into what else is needed. And, in fact, some of the reference designs I talked about, where the joint sales teams have looked at, that's coming from the joint teams looking and saying, ""Wow, here's things Microchip didn't know could be done added to things that Microsemi does extremely well in certain applications and certain customers."" -- I tell you guys after every acquisition that don't underestimate, don't undersell Microchip management's ability to transform the company to take on the challenges that the new acquisition presents. In Standard Microsystems, the complaint was they're vertical, you're horizontal. Look at how well that thing has worked out. In the case of Atmel, they're ARM and you're MPS and all that. Look at how well that thing has worked out. So don't underestimate Microchip's ability and the management team and the huge pipeline we have built internally that we prepare for this to take on the new challenges and expand our business. We're about the eighth largest U.S. semiconductor market cab in a consolidating industry. You can't just be sitting in your box and want everything to come with a nice bowtie, only microcontroller. We have to get into other businesses and grow our business in a consolidating industry. -- And it reinforces Steve's point earlier that, as we move forward, we focus on the combined company opportunities, rather than trying to box it and saying, ""Well, let's make the old one look good or the new one look good."" It's really the combined company opportunities that provide the richest forward-looking opportunities. -- A number of our business units are planning leapfrog the lithography at the foundries by skip one generation and leapfrog. Because that leapfrog technology has already been used by Microsemi in some of the same business units that you're mentioned. With a library available, with experience available, with EST structures and chip designs and all that kind of stuff available, it will accelerate our roadmap and leapfrog the technology to be able to reuse some of that stuff at Microchip. So I think that's kind of how we look at it. The ship is very safe in the harbor but that's not what ships are made for. We can't sit in our box and just look for everything to be a neat, little microcontroller. We have to branch out and be able to expand our business and we have done successfully that in the last decade. -- Yeah, absolutely. Thanks for the great insights. -- Thank you.And next, from Darphil, we have Gil Alexandre. Please go ahead, sir. -- Hello, Gil. -- Thanks for taking my question. I get back to tariffs. Is there a willingness to compromise and how is it affecting your automotive business? -- Well, is there a willingness to compromise? Compromise by who? That compromise has to be between the Chinese and U.S. authorities and that's way above my pay grade. That's not -- in terms of the automotive business, I think our automotive business -- I don't think our automotive business has yet been affected by tariffs. -- No. I think some of the uncertainties are there. Cars are built in the U.S. and shipped to other parts of the world. Cars are built in Europe and shipped into the U.S. And some of the discussions have created uncertainty. We'll see how it all plays out. But I think Steve's right. It's not a current impact. -- So far, automobiles are not included in the tariffs. Steel and all that are, but the built automobiles are not included. It's in negotiation. So when they had an edict on July 6th and then August 23rd, a set of products that have tariffs, washers and dryers and those things are included. Cars are not. Cars are not dutiable right now. Some of the car components are, like steel. So this thing is still raw. Thank you for your question, Gil. -- Thank you. Good luck. -- Yes, thank you. Anybody else, Operator?Yes, our next question comes from Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna International Group. -- Hey, guys. I think it's nice to see you guys get out in front of this in the true Microchip way. I think it's appreciated by guys who know your track record. So, Steve, as we try to judge this snapback in revenue, once you work through this inventory, can you give us some perspective of perhaps how long this overshipment issue was going on for? Was it just the last few quarters when they knew they were in negotiations or was this accumulated over a couple of years? -- Well, there are a lot of moving parts and you can't put a complete finger on it because there is some EOL mechanism with which they put the distribution inventory. Normal amount of inventory was very high. There was a huge non-linearity. A lot of stuff was shipped undetermined. There was also this direct to distribution conversion. So there were a lot of these programs interlayered. And I'm not accusing anything but I'm just saying that the timing, roughly, it all started about a year or so ago, which is more like when the conversations about the acquisition began. But I couldn't prove that. I think it's very, very rough. -- Yeah. Sounds pretty common in a lot of these deals. And then, lastly, on Microsemi's product pricing, after the Atmel deal, you saw a lot of kind of pricing imbalances. I can't remember. Maybe they were selling some below gross profit, if I remember right, or priced it below gross profit. Are you seeing anything like that here? And just any other tidbits on where you get more synergies? -- I think on that, I think I will give kudos to the sales and marketing team. The prices are not below market or anything like that. But when they got an excellent price for a customer, then they inserted a distributor and kept the customer price the same and then they discounted to the distributor. Gave an interest subsidy to carry the inventory. After a good price negotiated with the customer, they asked the customer to take much more inventory than the customer wanted and offered them a discount. So I think the pricing by marketing was done well but then, later on, in the overzealous attempt to really recognize higher revenue, they kind of did their own thing on the top of that. So this one is easier to correct. It's much harder to raise prices on the customer. It's much easier simply not to offer the discount and say, ""Just buy what you need, customer. I don't want you to buy a lot of product that you don't need."" So we think this one is easier for us to correct that way. -- And the high starting gross margins are a good indicator of how that was far better discipline than other acquisitions we've done. And hopefully there's some upside from the discounting being rolled off that we'll see in the coming quarters -- Yeah. Good point. Thanks, guys.Thank you. Next we'll hear from Craig Ellis with B. Riley FBR. -- Thanks for taking the question and, Steve and team, thanks for all the color on where you see things shaking out at this point of the integration. Steve, I wanted to follow up on a comment that you made in the Q&A regarding the deal's accretion in the current quarter. I think you said your synergies are tracking above the prior expectation for $0.15 of accretion. And, if I heard that correctly, the question is does that mean that, while retaining longer term accretion targets, $0.75 run rate first full year, $8.00 a couple years out, that you're realizing your synergies earlier but you still have the same expectation? Or do you think you're tracking above prior expectations? And, to the extent that's the case, can you identify where you think that is? -- So a little bit of both. So I said that we believe that the accretion run rate at the end of the first year will be higher than $0.75. We didn't numerically say what the number is because there is still -- like I said, the numbers are going to be noisy here for the next couple of quarters because there's just a lot of moving parts. But as we get out, by June next year, we see a number higher than $0.75, which will represent, really, a little bit of pull-in based on our prior plan.Now, in terms of $8.00 for fiscal '21, we see that as conservative also. Internally, we're modeling a number higher than $8.00. So that is the incremental accretion. I think some of that difference is coming from tax rate, lower tax rate, also. -- That's helpful. And then previously the company, and on this call, the company had identified the $300 million in synergies targets. When do you think you'll be able to provide some color on how that breaks out between revenue synergies, COGS synergies, and other synergies? -- Really never. We're just going to deliver it. Not going to break it out. -- Okay. Given that quick response, can I take a swing at another one? There's been a lot of discussion with what you found with distribution and I've heard you talk a lot about levels and what happened with shipments. But the question is really an operational one. What have you found with respect to the appropriateness of the consignment versus demand generation distribution, geographic representation, and the degree to which you think you've got a good distribution fit for the business that exists there? And how long does it take to right-size any of the operational changes that are needed with distribution? -- So, as we have interfaced with a lot of the distributors -- some of them, by the way, a fair number of them are common with Microchip. The largest distributor was Arrow Electronics and our largest distributor is Arrow Electronics. And similarly there are some other common distributors in Asia and Japan and Europe and others. A large amount of interaction with the distributors was how much inventory they would take. Basically, beginning around the middle of the quarter -- and large amount of, I would say, tension with the distributor was largely how much inventory would you take.And so, as we have spoken with the distributors, distributors feel refreshed and seeing that you're not going to force me to take inventory that I never wanted. You will, in fact, let me drain down my inventory. And so we can have a conversation about demand creation, reference design, how can we together build the business, let's go call on common customers, let's highlight and beef up the website and put reference designs and solutions on it. How do we take advantage of Total Systems Solution, Microchip and Microsemi common products going into the same platform? On and on and on. So conversations with distributors have turned into positive interactions regarding growing the business. And before that -- and this is distributors telling us. The ex-management of Microsemi is gone. Distributors are telling us that this tension about such a large amount of inventory jamming took all the oxygen out of the room. It just consumed the entire energy and interaction with the distributors. -- And it's actually liberated time within the company as well because the business units and others that were all a part of that discussion process. -- When do you start to see a positive benefit from this new conversation that's occurring? -- You will start to see, as this inventory bleeds out by the end of this calendar year, you'll start to see the impact, starting in the March quarter. So, if you're talking about brand new designs in production, that usually takes 12-18 months. But you'll start to see impact on the funnel, impact on joint opportunities, probably as early as late this quarter. -- Thanks for the insight, Steve. -- Yeah, thank you.Thank you. Our next question will come from Rajvindra Gill with Needham and Company. -- Yes, thank you. Hi, how are you? Just switching to earnings, as you noted. Eric, what is the de-leveraging campaign? Is that changing at all, given the situation? And as part of the $8.00 per share in fiscal year '21, how much of that is related to a lower interest reduction related to de-leveraging? Just wondered if you could talk about that in the grand scheme of earnings, being the end all of everything. -- So the de-leveraging approach is essentially all cash generation above and beyond the dividend is going to go to pay down debt. We aren't going to do anything unnatural, right? I mean, we're not going to push inventory into the distribution channel to generate cash and things like that. -- We're not going to cut the dividend. -- We're going to run the business, going to get our synergies as quickly as we can, and, with that, generate cash to pay it down. And so we are definitely a little bit behind schedule to start and we've got a little bit of a headwind in front of us. But long-term cash generation and operating profit generation from these businesses combined is very high. No real change in that long-term outlook. So hopefully that answers your question.And then obviously, as we pay down debt, there's interest expense reduction. That's built in to our forecast but we aren't going to give any real details in terms of how that lays out quarter by quarter at this time. -- One of his questions was really what portion of our incremental to possibly $8.00 is tax-related. Raj, what I would say is, in the past, when RND tax credit used to go away every year and then used to come back later in the year, most companies would have a much lower tax rate in the fourth quarter and then they'd true up and have a much lower tax rate and sometimes make up the earnings miss with that tax rate and all that. And analysts and investors will discount the additional earnings per share coming by the tax rate. This is not that kind. This is real tax rate, per quarter. There is nothing we're taking from the past or future. This is actual good, old tax planning, which, for the next several years, we'll have a very low tax rate. So you should look at that as it's no better or worse than earnings per share produced from higher gross margin or higher revenue or lower expenses or anything else. -- No, that's true. At the end of the day, that's what it is. And last question, Steve. I know it might be difficult to understand the tariffs, but in late 2014, you saw a slowdown in China industrial, you saw a slowdown in China housing. You were one of the first ones to note that. And then we did see a slowdown in China in 2015. I'm just wondering if that's a scenario that could repeat itself. Or just any general thoughts on that? Thanks. -- Raj, I resigned from that job back in 2014. I would let those jobs be yours rather than mine. I'll just talk about our business. I get no benefit from that. I let you guys decode that. -- Okay, got it. Thank you.And our next question will come from Mark Lipacis with Jefferies. -- Thanks for taking my question. Just one for Eric. Eric, in the trailing previous four quarters, free cash flow tracked pretty close to the non-GAAP net income. This quarter, there's a little bit more of a gap and I think that's typical when you start integration process. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of when does the free cash flow start to track back to the net income. If you could give us any help on that, I'd appreciate it. Thank you. -- I think we had a big correction in June, as we've kind of talked about. I think it continues through the end of the calendar year to have a little bit of pressure on that because of the continued reduction that we expect in distribution inventory. But, after that, I think it should return to a more normalized basis. -- Fair enough. Thank you. -- You're welcome.And, as that was our final question, gentlemen, I'll turn the call back over to you for final comments. -- Well, we want to thank everyone for attending this call. We'll see some of you on the road at conferences, which I think begin again in late August and September. So thank you very much.And that concludes today's conference call.

hareholders of Microchip Technology Inc (Symbol: MCHP) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 1.5% annualized dividend yield can sell the September covered call at the $95 strike and collect the premium based on the $4.10 bid, which annualizes to an additional 26.8% rate of return against the current stock price (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ), for a total of 28.4% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $95 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but MCHP shares would have to advance 0.5% from current levels for that to occur, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 4.8% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Microchip Technology Inc, looking at the dividend history chart for MCHP below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 1.5% annualized dividend yield.Below is a chart showing MCHP's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $95 strike highlighted in red:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the September covered call at the $95 strike gives good reward for the risk of having given away the upside beyond $95.

icrochip Technology (MCHP) came out with quarterly earnings of $1.61 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.49 per share. This compares to earnings of $1.31 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 8.05%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this chipmaker would post earnings of $1.35 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.40, delivering a surprise of 3.70%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Microchip Tech, which belongs to the Zacks Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed industry, posted revenues of $1.21 billion for the quarter ended June 2018, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.37%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $972.14 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the .Microchip Tech shares have added about 11.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 6.9%.While Microchip Tech has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Microchip Tech was mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see  .It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead.

"nvestors seeking strong returns may allocate their assets in stocks with significant liquidity. Liquidity is an important yardstick that indicates a company's capability to meet debt obligations by converting assets into cash.A company with a favorable liquidity position has the potential to generate higher returns as liquidity drives growth. However, one should exercise caution before investing in such stocks. While a high liquidity level may imply that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate than its peers, it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently.Hence, the efficiency level of a company should be considered in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners as this combination indicates underlying financial strength. It measures current assets relative to current liabilities. This ratio is used for measuring a company's potential to meet both short- and long-term debt obligations. Thus, a current ratio - also known as working capital ratio - below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets. However, a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape. It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly. Hence, a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal. Unlike current ratio, quick ratio - also called ""acid-test ratio"" or ""quick assets ratio"" - indicates a company's ability to pay short-term obligations. It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities. Like the current ratio, a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable. : This is the most conservative ratio among the three, as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents, and invested funds relative to current liabilities. It measures a company's ability to meet its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets. Though a cash ratio of more than 1 may point to sound financials, a higher number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization.So, a ratio greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always appropriately represent a company's financial condition.In order to pick the best of the lot, we have added asset utilization, which is a widely used measure of a company's efficiency, as one of the screening criteria. Asset utilization is the ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four-quarter average of total assets. Though this ratio varies across industries, companies with a ratio higher than their respective industries can be considered efficient.In order to ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential, we have added our proprietary  to the screen. (While liquidity ratios of greater than 1 are desirable, significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency.) (Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company's efficiency.) (Only Strong Buy-rated stocks can get through). You can see  . (Back-tested results show that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 handily beat other stocks.)These criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only six.Here are four of the six stocks that qualified the screen:Sunnyvale, CA-based  is a leading supplier of semiconductor-based, interconnect products to world-class server, storage, and infrastructure OEMs servicing Fortune 500 data centers, the world's most powerful supercomputers, and mission critical embedded applications.

"Chicago, IL - July 19, 2018 - Stocks in this week's article  ,  ,  ,  and  .The earnings season has kick started on a positive note with decent performance across the table. It appears that the equity markets have more or less factored in the risks from the ongoing trade war and is likely to have a relatively smooth spell, buoyed by improving economic sentiments led by solid domestic job market conditions, higher wage rates and lower taxes.As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of ""backing and filling"" in the market, they could benefit from 'cash cow' stocks that garner higher returns.However, singling out cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless these are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return.ROE = Net Income/Shareholders' EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry - the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management's efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Zacks.com created the first and best screening system on the web earning the distinction as the ""#1 site for screening stocks"" by Money Magazine. But powerful screening tools is just the start. That is why Zacks created the Screen of the Week to highlight profitable stock picking strategies that investors can actively use.Many are little publicized and fly under the Wall Street radar.

In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy. This metric measures how much investors pay for $1 of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock. This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company. This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.

"n the Global Week Ahead, we will see a top week for USA earnings reports.A flood of quarterly reports, and guidance on the year ahead, will likely dominate the thinking of both traders and investors.On Monday: On Tuesday: On Wednesday: On Thursday: On Friday: Outside the USA, I listed Reuters' five big world market themes below.These are likely to play an added role -- in the thinking of investors and traders -- in the Global Week Ahead.The yuan is at a one year-low - state-run banks finally stepped in to its support, but clearly authorities are prepared to tolerate a weaker currency, which helps exporters.It could prove tricky, however, to keep conditions supportive while preventing big capital outflows that put the skids on the yuan. Sharp yuan depreciation poses problems for Chinese firms with dollar debt and hurt overall confidence in markets. Also, too much currency weakening will draw the ire of U.S. President Donald Trump who has already complained about the yuan ""dropping like a rock.""Benchmark rate cuts are therefore unlikely. Instead, policymakers are tinkering with liquidity, including initiatives such as incentivizing commercial banks to lend to small business. And after cutting banks' reserve ratios in March and June, they may cut again, potentially in September.The rest of emerging Asia is also concerned - a lurch lower by the yuan will mean currencies from the Philippines to India, already at multi-year lows, will have to play catch up.After the excitement generated at its last meeting by its pledge to keep interest rates unchanged ""at least through the summer"" of 2019, this will be of great interest to those looking for further guidance.Some ECB policymakers apparently still want a June 2019 rate rise, while others see trade tensions as a reason to stay loose for longer. But given that ECB President Mario Draghi made it clear the bank had left language ""intentionally vague"", he is unlikely to be any more forthcoming on the timing.But there are other issues to quiz him on. One is on how the central bank plans to deploy redemptions from its outstanding bond holdings once its asset purchase scheme expires at the end of 2018. Reports suggest it will use reinvestments to buy long-dated bonds, thus magnifying the stimulus effect.Yield curves have already flattened in anticipation, giving borrowers the opportunity to issue more long-dated bonds and lock in low borrowing costs for decades to come. Belgium plans to sell 50-year bonds next week and others could follow.What of the economy? There are signs momentum is stabilizing after a sudden slowdown earlier this year. Flash euro zone PMI data due on Tuesday should give some indication of how the economy is coping with global trade conflicts, Italian politics and messy Brexit negotiations.The leaders of the BRIC nations also meet in Johannesburg, following G20 finance ministers and central bankers who met in Buenos Aires last weekend.In short, it's a big week for emerging markets. As it seems to be every week right now, with the strength of the dollar, rising U.S. interest rates and escalating trade war tensions tightening the squeeze. Emerging stocks, bonds and currencies are falling and investors are pulling cash out of EM funds.EM central banks are in a bind. Do they cut rates to support growth and domestic asset prices, which would fuel inflationary pressures? Or do they raise rates to track the Fed, fight inflation and support their currencies even though that could choke growth? We'll find out next week on which side of that fence many of them sit, while the commentary out of Buenos Aires and Johannesburg could also be market moving.One of the main drivers of the robust expansion was, possibly, a rush by U.S. exporters to get their products to markets before tariffs and counter-tariffs kicked in and full-fledged trade war broke out.U.S. farmers probably stuffed the export channel (think soybeans to China) before the tariffs. But while that probably contributed to overall growth, economists warn the spike higher in GDP, either from net exports or increased business spending (see defense, or oil drilling) may not last. So even if Q2 growth turns out to be a barn-burner, it is likely to back off in the second half of the year as tariffs bite harder and both imports and exports ease.Shares in the sector, under immense pressure from the threat of higher U.S. import levies, are down almost 10 percent this year, and the results could give the selloff extra mileage should companies downgrade earnings outlooks.Autos are likely to be high on the agenda for trade talks between European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Trump next Wednesday too, after the industry blasted tariff plans in a U.S. Department of Commerce hearing.But many investors are simply looking for some clarity. For the sector, 12-month earnings growth forecasts have come down from 13 percent to six percent over the past year. Since January, though, estimates have stalled, as analysts see no end to the fog surrounding tariff threats.(1) Intel  : This is a $51 stock now. The market cap is $242B.

"f you are looking for quality growth investments with compelling valuations, consider the world of semiconductor stocks. Yes, this can be an expensive area of the market, put over the past few months, shares across the industry have pulled back due to concerns of a cyclical peak in demand.However, analysts are robust in their view that structural changes in the industry are resulting in increasingly sustainable demand. Plus, chip stocks appear to be deeply undervalued (for once), especially when you factor in strong fundamentals like cash flow, earnings and sales.We used  powerful market data to source the five best semiconductor stocks to buy now. All five of these stocks score a ""Strong Buy"" analyst consensus rating and big upside potential from the current share price to the average analyst price target. The ratings included here are all from within the last three months to give us the latest insights into the market's outlook.Market value: $45.2 billionTipRanks consensus price target: $65.60 (46% upside potential)TipRanks consensus rating: Applied Materials (  , $44.80) engineers highly complex manufacturing and process technologies for semiconductor chips and displays. And according to top Stifel Nicolaus analyst Patrick Ho (  ), AMAT is now trading at ""very attractive"" levels. Indeed, his $75 price target represents more than 65% upside potential from the current share price.Although he factors in a push-out of $250 million of shipments and revenue from Samsung (  ) from 2018 to 2019, Ho writes that Applied Materials' revisions are more modest than peers. He sees this as further evidence that AMAT has a more broad-based customer pool, and he continues to recommend shares.One of the best-ranked analysts on TipRanks, B. Riley FBR's Craig Ellis (  ), agrees with this bullish outlook. He sees shares spiking 56% to hit $70 and calls the current valuation ""inexpensive."" ""AMAT's growth story remains the most diversified in large cap Semi (stocks), and we are encouraged with management's high-quality view through 2019,"" he writes.He reiterated his ""Buy"" rating following ""another stellar quarterly execution performance showing AMAT's new product engine is firing on all cylinders and producing share gains at surprisingly attractive margins.""Market value: $103.3 billionTipRanks consensus price target: $311.86 (29% upside potential)TipRanks consensus rating: Global semiconductor company Broadcom (  , $242.05) is consistently one of the Street's favorite semiconductor stocks. The company has one of the highest free-cash-flow margins in the semiconductor group at greater than 40%. For 2018, AVGO is expected to generate FCF of around $8.5 billion, with half that amount earmarked for dividends.Broadcom investors currently enjoy a generous dividend yield approaching 3%. Factor into this an aggressive share buyback plan of $12 billion (announced in April) with plenty of cash for future acquisitions, and you can see why AVGO deserves its Triple-A rating.For top Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer (  ) AVGO's growth/margin/FCF profile make any discount tough to justify. ""We see a gradual re-rate as new FCF-focused income investors gravitate to the story,"" he writes. Schafer just held a meeting with AVGO execs, following which he reiterated his Buy rating with a $315 price target (30% upside potential).""The company has the cash flow, operating metrics and capital allocation strategies of a diversified analog company, and the growth opportunities of a mobile/wireless company"" Schafer writes. And with this in mind, he believes AVGO deserves to trade at a higher multiple closer to wireless companies given its ""superior technology"" and ""diversified top line.""Over the past three months, 24 analysts have published bullish Broadcom ratings, with only one analyst staying sidelined.Market value: $27.4 billionTipRanks consensus price target: $264.20 (58% upside potential)TipRanks consensus rating: Semiconductor equipment specialist Lam Research (  , $167.25) is a leading global supplier of wafer fabrication equipment (WFE). Its systems play a critical role in enabling companies to produce better, faster and more efficient chips. The stock has a sterling rating from top analysts, with 15 recent buy ratings versus just one hold rating.UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri (  ) has finally upgraded LRCX from ""Hold"" to ""Buy."" Even his cautious $220 price target indicates robust upside potential of 31%. So what brings him to the bull camp at this late stage in the game? ""We have preferred KLA-Tencor (  ) since launch, but see now see upside in Lam Research that is too good to ignore,"" Arcuri writes. He believes Lam Research has ""felt the disproportionate brunt"" of Samsung's memory delays, and that this now sets a very low bar for outperformance.He isn't alone in this analysis. Merrill Lynch's Vivek Arya (  ) believes shares are underpriced, with structural industry changes (diversification of end-demand and increased chip complexity) ensuring sustainable WFE demand.""With shares currently trading at trough multiples at 9-10x (typical at peak earnings) we see this as a particularly attractive buying opportunity with limited cyclical downside and potential upside,"" Arya wrote on June 10. He has a far more bullish price target on the stock of $285 (70% upside potential).Market value: $21.2 billionTipRanks consensus price target: $118.20 (29% upside potential)TipRanks consensus rating: This ""Strong Buy"" semiconductor stock is a leading supplier of microcontrollers and analog processors for customers like the auto industry. The big news for Microchip Technology (  , $91.47) is its recent acquisition of Microsemi. For a whopping $8.35 billion, Microchip Technology snapped up the largest U.S. commercial supplier of military and aerospace semiconductor equipment.The deal has now closed following antitrust clearance from China. As a result, top Argus analyst Jim Kelleher (  ) boosted his MCHP price target to $115. This represents 27% upside potential from current levels. He believes the deal will result in operating efficiencies and ultimately margin expansion. Plus, MCHP will strengthen its position in non-tech markets as well as the booming datacenter and communication infrastructure industries.In a similar move, five-star Mizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rakesh (  ) bumped up his price target to $110. He also raised his MCHP estimates, writing, ""While we believe there are fewer synergies with MSCC, Aerospace/Defense and Communication provide attractive diversification of MCHP's portfolio while storage should add growth."" Specifically, MCHP is modeling for 75 cents per share in annual accretion during the first year, then $1.75 per share in the second.Bear in mind that out of the stock's 10 recent analyst ratings, nine are bullish and only one is neutral.Market value: $59.7 billionTipRanks consensus price target: $82.80 (52% upside potential)TipRanks consensus rating: Red-hot chip stock Micron (  , $54.48) describes itself as the world leader in innovative memory solutions. The company has had a tremendous run recently- exploding by 70% on a one-year-basis. And luckily for investors, top analysts are confident that further growth lies ahead.Top Benchmark analyst Mike Burton (  ) has just initiated coverage on MU. His rating comes with a bullish $80 price target (48% upside potential). ""We believe MU has progressed from a 'cash burn' to a 'cash return' story in only two years, and we expect the stock to remain a cyclical growth name, generating increasing profits and cash flow on each respective high and low of the memory cycle,"" Burton writes.He is confident that concerns about an upcoming cyclical weakness are unfounded. Instead, Burton writes, ""We see little evidence of a supply glut in MU's DRAM business heading into 2H18 (or until significant wafers are added due to structural tightness), and we are encouraged that its product roadmap extends another 4 generations.""The overall analyst consensus mirrors this optimism. In the past three months, 17 analysts have published MU buy ratings vs just four hold ratings. Even longtime Micron bear UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri has just upgraded the stock from ""Sell"" to ""Hold"" and ramped up his price target from $42 to $60. He cites a sizable DRAM production delay from Micron rival Samsung. This limited supply is good news for Micron - one of only three major DRAM suppliers.Harriet Lefton is head of content at TipRanks, a comprehensive investing tool that tracks more than 4,700 Wall Street analysts as well as hedge funds and insiders.

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the WisdomTree U.S. Quality Dividend Growth Fund ETF (Symbol: DGRW), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $46.54 per unit.With DGRW trading at a recent price near $41.79 per unit, that means that analysts see 11.36% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of DGRW's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Ormat Technologies Inc (Symbol: ORA), Microchip Technology Inc (Symbol: MCHP), and Jabil Inc (Symbol: JBL). Although ORA has traded at a recent price of $51.44/share, the average analyst target is 27.82% higher at $65.75/share. Similarly, MCHP has 26.07% upside from the recent share price of $92.01 if the average analyst target price of $116.00/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting JBL to reach a target price of $33.50/share, which is 17.71% above the recent price of $28.46. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of ORA, MCHP, and JBL:Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
  
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Analysts Forecast 11% Upside For The Holdings of DGRW@2018-07-12@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/analysts-forecast-11-upside-holdings-dgrw-2018-07-12

or the Global Week Ahead, here are five Reuters themes likely to dominate the thinking of investors and traders alike.I list them in importance to equity markets.Thanks to tax-cut tailwinds, Q1 earnings growth clocked in at 26.6 percent and the second quarter, starting next week, should moderate only slightly, to 20.7 percent.However, the season is being clouded by trade tensions and their impact on corporate profits. So analysts will closely scrutinize outlook statements to see whether to adjust numbers for the rest of 2018. Right now, 23.4 percent earnings growth is forecast for the third quarter and 20.2 percent for the fourth.Financials stocks won big from the tax cuts - their Q1 bottom lines were possibly fattened by as much as $5 billion, many estimate. So, eyes will be on  ,  and  reports on Friday, July 13th. Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S forecast banks' Q2 growth at 22 percent.But numbers are seen less toppy next year, slimming to 7.3 percent in the first quarter and just over ten percent for the three subsequent quarters.The Fed is pressing ahead with raising interest rates, global financial conditions are tightening and investors are nervous about the global economy. Emerging markets are under the cosh and bond yield curves are flattening - the U.S. yield curve is less than 30 basis points from inversion, the signal that recession is coming. - Bank of Japan governor Kuroda, European Central Bank chief Draghi, Bank of England boss Carney and Bank of Canada's Poloz all take the stand. The BoC will likely also raise interest rates next week.Here's the balance they will try to strike: signal an exit from crisis-era stimulus but not so fast that growth and investor confidence will plummet. It won't be easy. As it stands, the current economic expansion and bull market are very long in the tooth. Fed tightening alone could be enough to end them both.As U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports kick in, President Donald Trump is threatening to tax goods worth $500 billion - roughly the value of all U.S. imports from China in 2017.In theory, it could ease policy. It has also subtly hinted at using yuan depreciation as a retaliatory tool, by allowing the currency to post its biggest monthly loss on record in June.Though capital outflows are a risk. Upcoming data will provide a crucial insight into China's economy - the weekend brings the latest FX reserves picture; consumer and factory inflation figures emerge on July 10; trade data due July 13 will show if trade angst had already hit exports and imports in June. All that will set markets up for Q2 GDP due the following week.Tensions with Washington may already have slowed economic growth, Reuters polls predict.Resignations, rebellions and coup plots have all been rumored if Prime Minister Theresa May doesn't back a clean break from the EU. At the same time, British industrial giants are sounding shrill warnings of mass exodus if EU trade ties are lost.May will then get a visit from Germany's Angela Merkel on Tuesday - assuming she hasn't been ousted by then. Merkel's visit is part of a Western Balkans summit where, ironically, the main agenda is EU integration. But she will make time for a Brexit powwow with May.And it's not just politics. On Tuesday, Britain publishes monthly growth estimates for the first time, a move intended to give policymakers more timely information about the economy. The numbers will be released alongside output data for the services, industrial and construction sectors, and trade figures.They have already been on a rollercoaster, rising almost to $80 per barrel after output cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies.OPEC has agreed to ease output curbs but prices are receiving fresh impetus from Washington's new sanctions against Tehran. Those, in turn, have led Iran's Revolutionary Guards to threaten a blockade of the Strait of Hormuz, the world's most important oil artery through which a fifth of the world's oil consumption passes. Tensions are running high, with the U.S. Navy standing ready to ensure free navigation through the channel.High oil prices are wiping out any benefits the U.S. economy might enjoy from Trump's tax cuts. But while he has lashed out at the cartel and urged it to raise production, he is also pressuring governments to stop Iranian purchases. Such rhetoric may push oil prices higher still. As will any outbreak of hostilities in Hormuz.Glencore  : This is a $62B market cap mining stock. Oil and natural resource stocks like this are popping up in the top Zacks Rank these days. At $8.65 a share, this one may be cheap too. The long-term Zacks VGM score of A is attractive. This is a $22B semiconductor (analog and mixed) company.

The long-term Zacks VGM score is A.There is not much in the way of data catalysts coming out this week.I would pay most attention to the central bank policymaker speeches. On Tuesday, the central banks of Poland and Canada hand down monetary policy decisions. , Brazil's inflation rate could be heading in the wrong direction. The prior +5.2% y/y reading may be upped to +8.08%. Add that to the woes of this economy.Mexico's inflation rate is also heading higher, but not as dramatically. +4.54% y/y could get to +4.66% y/y. , Argentina's repo rate should be steady at 40%. I wish that were good news here.The U.S. NFIB for small business optimism index comes out. It has been high at 107.8.South Korea's unemployment rate is 4.0%. We get a new reading. , Poland's central bank should keep its base rate at 1.5%.The Bank of Canada also sets in policy rate. It has been 1.25%. , Germany's HICP consumer inflation rate comes out. It should stay at 2.1% y/y. This is good for European Central Bank monetary policy.In comparison, the French HICP looks a bit hot at +2.4% y/y.The CPI in India may go from 4.87% y/y to 5.15% y/y.U.S. initial claims should stay low after last week's 231K. , Japan's GDP growth rate comes out. It looks to be -0.6% last quarter. In comparison, Singapore's quarterly growth rate was +1.7% q/q.Iceland's unemployment rate is rock bottom at 2.2%.

"Chicago, IL - July 20, 2018 - Stocks in this week's article  ,  ,  and  .Investors seeking strong returns may allocate their assets in stocks with significant liquidity. Liquidity is an important yardstick that indicates a company's capability to meet debt obligations by converting assets into cash.A company with a favorable liquidity position has the potential to generate higher returns as liquidity drives growth. However, one should exercise caution before investing in such stocks. While a high liquidity level may imply that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate than its peers, it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently.Hence, the efficiency level of a company should be considered in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners as this combination indicates underlying financial strength.Zacks.com created the first and best screening system on the web earning the distinction as the ""#1 site for screening stocks"" by Money Magazine.

ooking today at week-over-week shares outstanding changes among the universe of ETFs covered at  , one standout is the iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (Symbol: SOXX) where we have detected an approximate $211.3 million dollar outflow -- that's a 11.9% decrease week over week (from 10,100,000 to 8,900,000). Among the largest underlying components of SOXX, in trading today Broadcom Inc (Symbol: AVGO) is up about 0.9%, Microchip Technology Inc (Symbol: MCHP) is up about 1.3%, and Micron Technology Inc. (Symbol: MU) is up by about 1.5%.  The chart below shows the one year price performance of SOXX, versus its 200 day moving average:Looking at the chart above, SOXX's low point in its 52 week range is $139.14 per share, with $198.84 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $178.30. Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF Experiences Big Outflow@2018-07-05@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ishares-phlx-semiconductor-etf-experiences-big-outflow-2018-07-05

"icron Technology  was hit badly in Tuesday's trading session following a report that a Chinese court has suspended its sale of memory products in that country, citing violation of patents held by Taiwan's United Microelectronics Corp  . Shares of MU fell as much as 8% on the news but recovered slightly to close on the day at down 5.5%. The other stocks in the industry also felt the pinch.The news came amid accelerating trade tensions between Washington and Beijing, with a tit-for-tat threats, which have already led to a bloodbath in the semiconductor space. This is especially true as the United States announced a 25% tariff on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods including many products in the semiconductor supply chain effective Jul 6. Additionally, Trump is seeking to curb China's technology investments in the United States.The United States is the largest semiconductor manufacturing country, with China being its biggest market. As such, a higher tariff will hit the revenues and profitably of these semiconductor manufacturers. Per Morgan Stanley equity strategists, ""semiconductor and semiconductor equipment companies have the highest revenue exposure to China at 52%.""Despite this, the outlook for the sector is solid. After witnessing the highest growth in 14 years, the global semiconductor industry is on track to grow 12.4% this year, according to the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS).Semiconductors are the most important drivers of overall technology growth as these are used in cars, electronic gadgets, planes and weapons. Robust demand for memory chips and other semiconductor products -- owing to the rapid adoption of cloud, Internet of Things, autonomous cars, gaming, wearables, VR headsets, drones, virtual reality devices, artificial intelligence, cryptocurrencies, and other advanced information technologies -- will fuel huge growth in the space.Additionally, the deployment of 5G (fifth-generation) technology - the next wireless revolution - will likely create further opportunities. The waves of mergers and acquisitions will also provide further impetus to the space. Trump's tax reform is another tailwind. Big semiconductor companies hoard huge cash overseas and are poised to benefit the most from the reduced tax rates.The latest trade friction wiped out most of Micron's gains made earlier in the year pushing its shares down 13.4% in a month. However, the stock is up 25.2% from a year-to-date look, and has crushed the broad electronic-semiconductor market by a wide margin. It carries a top Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has a solid Growth and Value Score of A and B, respectively. You can see  .Micron saw positive earnings estimate revision of 19 cents for fiscal (ending August 2018) over the past 30 days and has an estimated whopping growth rate of 136.29%. Revenues are also expected to grow 48.25% for this year. Yet, this Idaho-based chipmaker is immensely vulnerable to tariff threats as it generates 51% of its revenues from Mainland China.Given this, we have highlighted a few other #1-Ranked semiconductor stocks that look attractive picks at present given their strong fundamentals and lower exposure to China. This Arizona-based company develops, manufactures and sells specialized semiconductor products used by the customers for a wide variety of embedded control applications. The stock lost 12.8% in a month and has 30% exposure to China. It saw positive earnings estimate revision of 16 cents for the fiscal (ending March 2019) over a month, and has an expected earnings growth of 20.00%. Microchip Technology has a Growth Score of B. This California-based company is a worldwide leader in graphics processors and media communications devices. The stock has shed 10.7% in a month and has 20% exposure to China. It has seen no earnings estimate revision in a one-month period for the fiscal (ending January 2019) and has an expected earnings growth rate of 61.18%. NVIDIA has a Growth Score of A (read:  ). This Texas-based company is a leading manufacturer and supplier of high-quality discrete and analog semiconductor products, primarily to the communications, computing, industrial, consumer electronics and automotive markets. The stock has shed 8.2% over the past month and has a minimal exposure to China. It has seen positive earnings estimate revision of five cents for this year over a month and has expected earnings growth of 49.64%. DIOD flaunts a top Growth Score of A. This California-based company is a leading supplier of semiconductor-based, interconnect products to world-class server, storage, and infrastructure OEMs servicing Fortune 500 data centers, the world's most powerful supercomputers, and mission critical embedded applications. It has lost 3.85% in a month and has a minimal exposure to China. It has seen no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for this year and has an expected earnings growth rate of 90.35%. Mellanox Technologies flaunts a top Growth Score of A. This Pennsylvania-based company is one of the world's largest manufacturers of discrete semiconductors (diodes, MOSFETs, and infrared optoelectronics) and passive electronic components (resistors, inductors, and capacitors). The stock has gained 11.9% in a month and has a minimal exposure to China. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 has moved up by a penny over the past 30 days, representing year-over-year earnings growth of 25.17%. Vishay Intertechnology has a Growth Score of B.It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

"iquidity indicates a company's capability of meeting its debt obligations by converting its assets into liquid cash and equivalents. Companies with a favorable liquidity position have always been in demand as these are believed to have the potential to boost portfolio returns.However, one should exercise caution before investing in such stocks. While a high liquidity level may imply that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate than its peers, it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently.Hence, the efficiency level of a company should be considered in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners as this combination is indicative of underlying financial strength. It measures current assets relative to current liabilities. This ratio is used for measuring a company's potential to meet both short- and long-term debt obligations. Thus, a current ratio - also known as working capital ratio - below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets. However, a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape. It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly. Hence, a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal. Unlike current ratio, quick ratio - also called ""acid-test ratio"" or ""quick assets ratio"" - indicates a company's ability to pay short-term obligations. It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities. Like the current ratio, a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable. This is the most conservative ratio among the three, as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents, and invested funds relative to current liabilities. It measures a company's ability to meet its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets. Though a cash ratio of more than 1 may point to sound financials, a higher number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization.So, a ratio greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always appropriately represent a company's financial condition.In order to pick the best of the lot, we have added asset utilization, which is a widely used measure of a company's efficiency, as one of the screening criteria. Asset utilization is the ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four-quarter average of total assets. Though this ratio varies across industries, companies with a ratio higher than their respective industries can be considered efficient.In order to ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential, we have added our proprietary  to the screen. (While liquidity ratios of greater than 1 are desirable, significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency.) (Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company's efficiency.) (Only Strong Buy-rated stocks can get through). You can see  .

"he technology sector, which has showed its immense strength against the trade and tariff threats recently on the FANG surge, has lost its ground following news of a potential curb in Chinese investment. In fact, the sector pushed Wall Street even lower on Jun 27 with the S&P 500 Technology Sector dropping 1.5% and Philadelphia semiconductor index sliding 2.5%.The Trump administration is seeking to limit many Chinese companies from investing in U.S. technology firms and block additional technology exports to that country. The Treasury Department is working on the rules to block companies with at least 25% Chinese ownership from buying companies involved in ""industrially significant technology."" The measures are expected to be announced by the end of this week and are intended to counter Beijing's Made in China 2025 strategic plan. Under this plan, China wants to become a global leader in 10 broad areas of technology, including robotics, aircraft and aircraft components, advanced rail equipment, electrical-generation and transmission equipment and pharmaceuticals and advanced medical devices.As such, the potential move would hurt the tech sector more broadly than just the semiconductors and hit revenues, earnings and stock prices of the tech titans having significant exposure to China.However, the outlook for the technology sector has been encouraging. The emergence of cutting-edge technology such as cloud computing, big data, Internet of Things, wearables, VR headsets, drones, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence as well as strong corporate earnings are acting as the key catalysts.Additionally, the twin tailwinds of Trump's tax reform plan and a rising interest rate scenario are pushing the stocks higher. Adding to the strength is a pickup in the economy and better job prospects that are giving a solid boost to economically sensitive growth sectors like technology, which typically perform well in a maturing economic cycle.Given encouraging long-term trends, investors could definitely tap the current dip in the stocks.

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the Semiconductor ETF (Symbol: SMH), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $122.92 per unit.With SMH trading at a recent price near $109.97 per unit, that means that analysts see 11.77% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of SMH's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Marvell Technology Group Ltd (Symbol: MRVL), KLA-Tencor Corp (Symbol: KLAC), and Microchip Technology Inc (Symbol: MCHP). Although MRVL has traded at a recent price of $21.75/share, the average analyst target is 30.74% higher at $28.44/share. Similarly, KLAC has 21.72% upside from the recent share price of $114.20 if the average analyst target price of $139.00/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting MCHP to reach a target price of $116.00/share, which is 13.56% above the recent price of $102.15. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of MRVL, KLAC, and MCHP:Combined, MRVL, KLAC, and MCHP represent 10.87% of the Semiconductor ETF. Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
  
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Analysts See 12% Upside For The Holdings of SMH@2018-06-11@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/analysts-see-12-upside-holdings-smh-2018-06-11

"Our connection to the internet took on a new and more involved form when much of the connectivity moved from the PC to the smartphone. This ushered in a whole host of applications that changed the way we live.And now, connectivity is changing form again with the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT takes device connectivity far beyond smartphone and tablets. With IoT, objects such as speakers, refrigerators and electrical meters now find themselves connected.The existence of the small but powerful chips used to achieve this will enhance the productivity of people and businesses. It also creates a new line of business for companies in the semiconductor and telecom industries, as the Internet of Things is fueling higher demand for these chips.It should also serve as a boon to the wireless industry, as such chips could create new sources of revenue.Given this potential, it seems every tech hardware company is fighting for a presence in the Internet of Things. Many companies will grow as a result. Be careful, as valuations can greatly vary. However, these stocks should profit both themselves and their investors: (NYSE:  ) specializes in the value-added distribution of components such as semiconductors, software and hardware related to data centers. The Centennial, Colorado-based tech company started out in the 1930s as a seller of radio parts. Today, Arrow manufactures IoT components for every step in the Internet of Things process. Arrow handles the creation, connectivity, management and maintenance of such components.The marketplace responded well to this comprehensive IoT solution, taking revenue higher by over 10% both last year. Analysts expect that growth rate to continue this year. Profit growth has followed suit. Net income grew by almost 12% per year over the last five years. ARW stock expects growth to stay in the 10% per year range for the next five years as well.Despite this high revenue and profit growth, the performance of ARW stock has lagged. For that reason, its growth comes at a very low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Predicted 2018 earnings of $8.78 per share and a stock price of around $76 per share place the forward P/E at about 8.7. The stock's average P/E over the last five years has stood at about 12.8. Hence, even if the stock remains well below the average  P/E (currently around 25), the profit potential remains high.Both its valuation and its market cap at around $6.6 billion should also attract investors and possibly buyout interest in the future. Given the factors working in its favor, ARW stock provides both an affordable and potentially lucrative segue into the Internet of Things business.Having lost its long-held status as ""world's largest chipmaker,""  (NASDAQ:  ) is looking to stage a comeback partially built on IoT. Long the dominant chipmaker in the PC era, Intel has switched its focus. With its history with PCs and more recent success in the data center market, Intel has firmly positioned itself to lead the way in the Internet of Things. They provide an end-to-end solution and have redesigned their chips to provide an IoT function. Combined with its data-center capabilities, Intel can also offer both security and analytics capabilities.What makes this a better investment than other old-line tech peers in IoT such as  (NASDAQ:  ) hinges on its valuation. Despite its comeback and move higher, INTC stock trades at only 13.6 times forward earnings. This low PE likely remains a legacy of the declining PC-market. Although Intel's growth lagged during this time, the pivot towards data centers and the Internet of Things has revitalized it. Analysts project an average annual growth rate of around 10% per year over the next five years due to its new niches.Also, its market cap stands at nearly $240 billion. With a return to growth, it holds enough cash to buy out many of its competitors. This should only boost profits going forward.The sudden resignation of CEO Brian Krzanich creates some uncertainty. However, the falling stock price caused by this anxiety probably creates a buying opportunity.With a low valuation and high potential to return to dominance, Internet of Things investors need to continue following INTC stock. (NASDAQ:  ) manufactures microcontroller, memory, and analog chips. The Chandler, Arizona-based technology company was founded in 1987, with origins in the PC business. Its current era began in 2009, when it developed a chip that claimed to have the world's lowest sleep current. It has since acquired several other semi companies. Today, it boasts a market of around $22 billion.Like with many of its peers, the Internet of Things has driven MCHP's growth to new highs. Over the last five years, annual profit growth has exceeded 20% per year. Although analysts expect growth to slow to an average of about 14% per year, IoT should continue driving MCHP stock higher. Wall Street also estimates a forward P/E of just over 12 at current prices.Analysts predict this growth even though MCHP stock has doubled over the last two years. Historical patterns indicate the stock can keep growing. The P/E ratio has exceeded 30 at various times during the previous ten years. The continuation of good news could bring valuations back to past levels.Due to the growth expected in IoT, Wall Street has every reason to expect this good news. With its lead in low-sleep current chips, MCHP should play a significant role in the Internet of Things revolution.Woburn, Massachusetts-based  (NASDAQ:  ) specializes in semiconductors for RF and mobile applications. It has leveraged this wireless technology into the Internet of Things, connecting a wide variety of consumer-oriented devices. It also helps companies connecting devices, and machines used in infrastructure, industrial and medical applications.Many of these items have already become available on the consumer market. This has helped to drive massive amounts of growth.SWKS stock saw profit growth in excess of 28% per year over the last five years. Analysts forecast a slowdown to just under 15% annual growth. Interestingly, the market has not priced in the growth rate of SWKS. It currently trades at about 12.5 times forward earnings. The average P/E over the last five years has come in at about 21.6. Therefore, the SWKS stock price would have to rise by over 40% to meet its average valuation.Such a move would push SWKS stock through its resistance point. Since May 2015, it has moved into the $110s per share range only to fall back. However, profits continue to reach the point that the stock will either have to push through or remain at an absurdly low P/E ratio. The stock has not seen an average yearly P/E below 10 since 2008. Still, barring a financial crisis comparable to the one that occurred that year, I doubt SWKS stock would reach such a low level again.The stock trades in the high $90's per share range now. If it can break its past resistance levels, Skyworks can finally head towards the sky. (NASDAQ:  ) is a Canadian company that designs and manufactures wireless equipment. The Richmond, British Columbia-based company offers Internet of Things technology in a wide variety of applications.At a market cap of $575 million, SWIR remains one of the smaller players in this space. Still, it makes up for a small size with its massive growth. The company enjoyed an average growth rate of about 27% per year over the last five years. Wall Street expects that growth rate will average about 19% per year over the next five years.Despite this small size and massive growth potential, this stock trades at a cheap valuation. Analysts expect the company to earn 87 cents per share this year, down from $1.05 per share in 2017. This drop will probably become an anomaly as Wall Street expects to see earnings of $1.25 per share in 2019. This would bring the stock to a forward P/E of about 18.3.SWIR stock has also seen a history of price spikes. The stock, which now trades in the $16 per share range, spiked to $48 in late 2014. Such spikes always occurred when the stock's value more than doubled in just a few months. If such an occurrence repeats, perhaps that would make SWIR stock one to sell. However, given its IoT profit growth, I think investors can make money on SWIR even without trying to time the stock.Louis Navellier - the investor the  called an ""icon"" - just helped investors make 487% in the booming Chinese stock market … 408% in the medical device sector … 150% in Netflix … all in less than 2 years!Now, Louis is urging investors to get in on what may be the opportunity of a lifetime.

" .  recently introduced new 32-bit SAM L10 and SAM L11 microcontrollers (MCUs) families based on Arm Cortex-M23 core. With the new products, the company intends to enhance security of Internet of Things (""IoT"") endpoints.In a separate press release, Microchip also announced dsPIC33CH Digital Signal Controller (""DSC"") family, featuring two dsPIC DSC cores on a single chip. The new DSC enables the software developers to integrate code from multiple design teams.The new MCUs introduced by Microchip not only function on low power but also deliver high security required by IoT endpoints. SAM L11 works on Arm TrustZone tech. It features Armv8-M, a programmable infrastructure offering hardware isolation amid certified libraries, application code and IP. TrustZone tech in combination with advanced chip-level security and tamper resistance ensures safety of customer applications from physical and remote attacks.The enhanced features will aid the customers across varied Human Machine Interface (""HMI"") applications, pertaining to appliance, automotive, consumer and medical industries. We believe the new MCU families hold promise given the emerging demand of IoT based applications.SAM L10 and SAM L11 devices are available in several package alternatives and pin counts in volume production quantities. Devices in the SAM L10 and SAM L11 series are available starting at $1.09 and $1.22 each, respectively in 10,000-unit quantities. Meanwhile, both DM320204 and DM320205 Xplained Pro Evaluation Kits for SAM L10 and SAM L11 are available for $58.00 each.With a view to streamline the design and development of applications which require complex algorithms, Microchip introduced dsPIC33CH family of DSCs. The two dsPIC DSC cores are categorized as master and slave. The master core supports the user interface, supervises system and other communications functions, tailored for the end application. The slave core maintains time sensitive control code.The dsPIC33CH family delivers high power density, enhanced efficiency, improved Digital Signal Processor (""DSP"") performance and accelerated execution. The products enable live updating vital for power supplies applications which require firmware updates to be made in zero downtime.The diverse applications including the likes of automotive sensors, wireless power, and server power supplies and drones, which require sophisticated algorithms can also benefit from the new offering. The first-of-a-kind two cores in one chip is likely to broaden Microchip's prospects. We believe the company can gain competitive edge against its peers with this introduction.The dsPIC33CH comes in eight package options. The 28-pin dsPIC33CH64MP202 is available for lesser than $2.00 each for high volume orders. Packages range between 28 and 80 pins, for memory size in the band of 64-128 KB of Flash. The dsPIC33CH Curiosity development board is available for $34.99 each. The dsPIC33CH PIM for motor control development boards are priced at $25.00 each. The dsPIC33CH PIM for Explorer 16/32 boards are also available for $25.00 each.Shares of Microchip have gained 20% in the last year, outperforming the industry's rally of 18.8%. This outperformance can primarily be attributed to solid demand witnessed by the company's product portfolio and synergies from accretive acquisitions. End-market diversification and operational efficiencies are other tailwinds.Microchip claims that both the MCU families deliver industry's lowest power consumption. The capacitive touch capability is also one-of-a-kind. Per EEMBC (Embedded Microprocessor Benchmark Consortium) estimates, SAML10 has an ULPMark of 405, which ensures over 200% improved performance against its closest rival in the market. The Peripheral Touch Controller empowers the MCU families with advanced capacitive touch capabilities.Furthermore, per GrandViewResearch data, IoT MCU market size is projected to reach $3.56 billion by 2022. The market report reinforces our view and strengthens the prospects of the MCU products.Microchip is benefiting from robust demand for 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers. We believe that Microchip's expanding product portfolio driven by new launches will continue to expand customer base. The new first-of-a-kind dsPIC33CH family of DSCs featuring two cores in one chip also augurs well for the company in the long run.Microchip carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Western Digital  , Seagate  and NVIDIA Corporation  . All the three stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see  .Western Digital, Seagate and NVIDIA have a long-term expected EPS growth rate of approximately 19%, 18.9% and 10.3%, respectively.Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Micron, the world's leading provider of innovative memory solutions, has had a mind-boggling run so far this year. The stock has gained 25%, compared with a 3.6% rise of the PHLX Semiconductor Index and 1.5% of the S&P 500.The chip industry, in itself, offers upside even after stellar years. From high-end gaming, emergence of Internet-of-Things (IoT) to automation demand for chips, all are skyrocketing. Meanwhile, supply is low which spells a grand period for chip stocks. Hence, it is the ideal time to capitalize on the current slump by betting on chip stocks that are poised to grow in the near term.China's Fuzhou Intermediate People's Court has issued an authoritative warning against Micron's Chinese holdings blocking sales of PRC 26 DRAM and NAND-linked items. This included solid-state hard drives and memory sticks. The Boise, ID-based company's subsidiaries like the Micron Semiconductor (Xi'an) Co were earlier charged for patent infringement by Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co. (Jinhua) and Micron Semiconductor (Shanghai) Co. Ltd. was slapped with the same charges.Micron is already embroiled in a trade war between the United States and China, when the Chinese regulators launched an investigation into memory-chip pricing. Nonetheless, shares of the chipmaker tanked 5.5% to close at $51.48 on Jul 3 after hitting an intra-day low of $50.10. Markets remained closed on Jul 4 as the nation observed Independence Day.Shares of other semiconductor stocks did suffer due to the tussle between the Asian nation and Micron. China is fighting for advanced chip technology and knowhow, while the Trump administration intends to block additional technology exports to Beijing. Chipmakers, including Intel and Nvidia Corp., saw their shares decline 1.5% and 2.2% on Jul 3, respectively. The PHLX Semiconductor Index went down 1.8%, after the Chinese court ruling came out.But, it isn't doomsday for Micron or the semiconductor industry. Micron does generate half of its revenues from China, per Fact Set. However, semiconductors are components of products that are sold elsewhere, according to Morgan Stanley. Thus, the adverse effect of high revenue exposure to China ""is not as meaningful"" as it can be for other industries.Micron's chief financial officer Dave Zinsner forecasts fiscal fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of $3.23 to $3.37 a share on revenues of $8 billion to $8.4 billion, better than analysts' projection of $3.16 on sales of $8.02 billion. In fact, the chipmaker's fiscal third-quarter 2018 profits more than doubled from the year-ago levels, while sales surged 40%. The chipmakers net income of $3.82 billion, or $3.10 per share, on sales of $7.8 billion, was up from $5.57 billion a year ago.And luckily for investors, top analysts are optimistic about further growth ahead. Top benchmark analyst Mike Burton said that ""MU has progressed from a 'cash burn' to a 'cash return' story in only two years, and we expect the stock to remain a cyclical growth name, generating increasing profits and cash flow on each respective high and low of the memory cycle."" He has raised his price target to $80 per share (  ).Micron bear UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri has upgraded the stock from ""Sell"" to ""Hold"" and raised his price target from $42 to $60 (  ).But, why just buy Micron? Semiconductor chips are much in demand, largely due to gaming, emergence of IoT and automation.E-sports, a multiplayer video game for professional gamers, needs thousands of semiconductor chips for production, while chips are an essential part of crypto mining as these provide the processing power needed for decoding blockchain algorithms.Banking on the strengths, chipmakers are positioned to make a comeback in the near term. Since the long term bodes well for stocks after the initial dip, it will be wise to invest in such stocks. Furthermore, by purchasing stocks right after a dip, investors are essentially buying shares at a discount. We have, thus, short-listed five stocks that flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). provides semiconductor systems. The stock currently has a Zacks Rank 1.

"he  formula at  ranks a coverage universe of thousands of  , according to a proprietary formula designed to identify those stocks that combine two important characteristics - strong fundamentals and a valuation that looks inexpensive. Microchip Technology Inc (Symbol: MCHP) presently has an above average rank, in the top 50% of the coverage universe, which suggests it is among the top most ""interesting"" ideas that merit further research by investors.But making Microchip Technology Inc an even more interesting and timely stock to look at, is the fact that in trading on Wednesday, shares of MCHP entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $90.59 per share. We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30. In the case of Microchip Technology Inc, the RSI reading has hit 28.4 - by comparison, the universe of dividend stocks covered by  currently has an average RSI of 48.0. A falling stock price - all else being equal - creates a better opportunity for dividend investors to capture a higher yield. Indeed, MCHP's recent annualized dividend of 1.454/share (currently paid in quarterly installments) works out to an annual yield of 1.56% based upon the recent $93.14 share price.A bullish investor could look at MCHP's 28.4 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. Among the fundamental datapoints dividend investors should investigate to decide if they are bullish on MCHP is its dividend history. In general, dividends are not always predictable; but, looking at the history chart below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Microchip Technology Becomes Oversold@2018-06-27@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/microchip-technology-becomes-oversold-2018-06-27

Among the largest underlying components of SOXX, in trading today Qualcomm Inc (Symbol: QCOM) is off about 1.4%, Micron Technology Inc. (Symbol: MU) is down about 1.1%, and Microchip Technology Inc (Symbol: MCHP) is lower by about 1.4%.  The chart below shows the one year price performance of SOXX, versus its 200 day moving average:Looking at the chart above, SOXX's low point in its 52 week range is $138.23 per share, with $198.84 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $189.58. Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Notable ETF Outflow Detected - SOXX, QCOM, MU, MCHP@2018-06-18@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/notable-etf-outflow-detected-soxx-qcom-mu-mchp-2018-06-18

"Chicago, IL - June 8, 2018 - Stocks in this week's article include: Allison Transmission Holdings, Inc.  , Westlake Chemical Corp.  , Microchip Technology Inc.  , M.D.C. Holdings, Inc.  and Shoe Carnival, Inc.  .Investors who have the propensity to take higher risk can think of investing in momentum stocks to boost their gains. In this respect, the Driehaus strategy can be used to choose the best momentum stocks using the ""buy high and sell higher"" theory. Eventually, Richard Herman Driehaus earned his place in Barron's All-Century Team following the success of this investment strategy.The American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) proved that the strategy has the potential to offer high returns. AAII's portfolio, which was developed following the strategy, returned 13.5% and 18.1% in the five- and 10-year time frames, respectively, compared with -1.1% and 4.2% gains registered by the S&P 500. Thus investors with a high risk appetite may opt for this strategy to boost their portfolio returns.Regarding the strategy, Driehaus once said: ""I would much rather invest in a stock that's increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that's already in a decline and try to guess when it will turn around."" In line with this insight, AAII took into account the percentage 50-day moving average as one of the key criteria before creating a portfolio following Driehaus' philosophy.It is calculated by dividing the numerator (month-end price minus 50-day moving average of month-end price) by the 50-day moving average of the month-end price. Another momentum indicator - positive relative strength - has also been included in this strategy. A positive percentage 50-day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50-day moving average level, indicating an uptrend.Moreover, AAII found that Driehaus primarily focuses on strong earnings growth rates and impressive earnings projections to pick potential outperformers. Companies with a strong history of beating estimates are also given importance in this strategy, which was made to provide better returns over the long term.And that's what we're screening for today…Get the remaining stocks on the list and start putting this and other ideas to the test.

 month has gone by since the last earnings report for  . Shares have added about 12.7% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is MCHP due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Microchip Technology reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 non-GAAP earnings of $1.40 per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5 cents. The figure improved 20.7% year over year.The year-over-year upside was driven by higher net sales, which increased 11% from the year-ago quarter to $1 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues was pegged at $984.5 million.In terms of product line, microcontroller business (66% of net sales) increased 12.2% year over year to $657.3 million. Analog net sales came in at $242.3 million and accounted for 24.5% of the total revenues.Microchip posted non-GAAP gross margin of 61.7%, which expanded 250 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis.Non-GAAP operating expenses, as percentage of revenues, were down 150 bps year over year to 22.2%. The decline was primarily due to lower research & development (R&D) expenses and selling, general & administrative (SG&A) expenses, both of which shrunk 70 bps.As a result, non-GAAP operating margin advanced 390 bps from the year-ago quarter to 39.5%.The company exited fiscal 2018 with $2.2 billion of cash and short-term investments. During the fiscal fourth quarter, Microchip generated $359.6 million of operating cash flow.Management noted that inventory during the March 2018 quarter, was at 112 days, down by three days from the December 2017 quarter level. Also, inventory days remained below the company's targeted range of 115-120 days.The company announced a quarterly cash dividend of 36.35 cents per share, which is payable on Jun 4, 2018.Microchip forecasts first-quarter fiscal 2019 net sales of $1.012-$1.062 billion (mid-point $1.037 billion).Non-GAAP gross margin is anticipated in the 61.6-62% range. Non-GAAP operating expenses, as percentage of sales, are projected at 22-22.4%, and operating margin is expected at 39.2-40%.For the fiscal first quarter, non-GAAP earnings are anticipated in the range of $1.39-$1.49 per share (mid-point $1.44).Microchip's inventory days in the impending quarter are expected between 106 and 116 days. Capital expenditures are estimated in the range of $70-$90 million.For fiscal 2019, capital expenditures are projected at $200-$250 million.In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates. There have been seven revisions higher for the current quarter compared to one lower. | At this time, MCHP has a great Growth Score of A, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. However, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Based on our scores, the stock is more suitable for growth and momentum investors than value investors.Estimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. It comes with little surprise MCHP has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). We expect an above average return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

ave you been paying attention to shares of  ? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 12.7% over the past month. MCHP hit a new 52-week high of $102.80 in the previous session. Microchip Technology has gained 16.2% since the start of the year compared to the 9.1% move for the Computer and Technology sector and the 11% year-to-date return for its peer group.The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on May 8, 2018, Microchip Technology reported EPS of $1.4 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.35 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 1.81%.For the current fiscal year, Microchip Technology is expected to post earnings of $6.47 per share on $5.93 billion in revenues. Meanwhile, for the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $7.65 per share on $6.61 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 18.25% and 11.34%, respectively.While MCHP has moved to its 52-week high in the recent past, investors need to be asking, what is next for the company? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Microchip Technology has a Value Score of C. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 15.8X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 24.3X versus its peer group's average of 15.3X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.13. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective. | We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Microchip Technology currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Microchip Technology passes the test. Thus, it seems as though MCHP shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.Shares of Microchip Technology have been moving higher, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also looking good, including Tokyo Electron  , Micron Technology  , and Mellanox Technologies  , all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.However, it is worth noting that the Zacks Industry Rank for this group is in the bottom half of the ranking, so it isn't all good news for Microchip Technology. Still, the fundamentals for MCHP are promising, and it still has potential despite being at a 52-week high.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The momentum can be attributed to its recent acquisition of GitHub as well as increasing traction in conversational AI.Shares of Microsoft have returned 20.9% year to date, outperforming the  's rally of 18.4%. The outperformance was driven by the company's rapidly expanding efforts in AI and IoT based developments. Moreover, uninterrupted focus on Azure remains a key catalyst.The stock has a market cap of $789.15 billion.Microsoft's acquisition of the open-source software development platform giant, GitHub will helpthe company in becoming more future-oriented by encouraging more developers to create services and apps.This in turn will aid Azure to compete better against other computing giants by being more appealing to customers.The tech powerhouse projects the acquisition to be accretive to non-GAAP operating income in fiscal 2020. Investors should note that Microsoft expects the buyout to dilute adjusted earnings by roughly 1% in fiscal years 2019 and 2020.Microsoft is also gaining from its increasing traction in conversational AI. The software pioneer recently acquired Berkeley, CA-based Semantic Machines, which has a new approach for the development of conversational AI. With the buyout, the company is likely to gain a competitive edge in the conversational AI industry.Notably, Microsoft has been working on speech recognition and natural language understanding for the development of its conversational AI initiatives. The company had earlier introduced pre-built Cognitive Services into its intelligent assistants. Microsoft Cognitive Services and Azure Bot Service have found a number of takers already.Furthermore, the tech giant's digital assistant Cortana has aided the accelerated adoption of its virtual assistants powered by conversational AI. The addition of Semantic Machines is expected to enhance Microsoft's overall conversational AI capabilities, consequently helping it gain a strong foothold in the industry.Per a recent report by Grand View Research, the AI market is anticipated to hit $35.9 billion by 2025 at a CAGR of 57.2% with 2017 as the base year. The projected figure takes into account direct revenue sources.Given the huge growth prospect in the industry, Microsoft is striving to grab a major share of the projected revenue growth.In a bid todrive the autonomous vehicle revolution forward, Microsoft collaborated with MapboxInc, a mapping startup. Microsoft Azure IoT platform's open sourced Azure IoT Edge Runtime will be integrated with Mapbox's recently unveiled Vision SDK.When integrated with Vision SDK, the detected events will aid the software builders develop responsive application which will provide accelerated feedback to the driver.This will ensure proper streaming of semantic event data directly into Azure Cognitive Services for detailed analysis on the back end. On a regular basis, this back-end event data will aid the developers to enhance algorithms accordingly.Additionally, the road data on the back end will provide analytic solutions for insurance companies, smart cities, and more.This will consequently enhance the driving experience.Autonomous driving backed by AI is expected to reduce accidents due to human errors. Per a recent report by Grand View Research, the ADAS market is expected to hit $67.43 billion by 2025. The Verge, on the other hand, quoted Intel stating that there is a $7 trillion self-driving future ahead.Microsoft is also one of the largest providers of gaming hardware. The Xbox One X has a wide adoption rate. Moreover, robust performance of its surface line of devices is driving the top line.Microsoft recently unveiled a new gamepad, Xbox Adaptive Controller, which is aimed to ensure ""gaming for everyone"". The controller, priced at $99.99, can be personalized as per the requirements of the specially-abled gamer.In the gaming console market, XBox can gain a competitive edge with the new Adaptive Controller over Nintendo, which doesn't have significant improvement in features for differently-abled gamers.Meanwhile, Sony's PlayStation 4 has controllers which make gaming comparatively easier for differently-abled over Play Station 3, thanks to its reorganized operating system as well as user interface (""UI"") and tighter controls.Per an IDC study, total spending in home game console market for the years 2018 and 2019 is projected to be more than $45 billion each.Per Statista, PwC projects console games industry revenues to grow by 2.43% per year between 2015 and 2020.In the recently reported third quarter, Microsoft's gaming revenues increased 18% (16% at constant currency) to $2.25 billion, driven by robust performance from Xbox software and services (up 21% at cc). Xbox Live monthly active users were up 13% to 59 million active users.At the Build conference this year, Satya Nadella also announced a special initiative for the disabled with an initial funding of $25 million to develop AI for people with disabilities, whether temporary, permanent or situational.The aforementioned initiatives in the emerging technologies space is likely to boost the top-line, going forward.Microsoft's cloud services form a major contributor to its top-line growth. The company is also committed to reorganizing itself around its cloud-computing businesses and Office business, instead of Windows.In the third quarter, the company delivered revenue figures of $26.82 billion, topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $25.71 billion. Furthermore, Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud unit revenues, which comprise its rapidly growing Azure segment, climbed roughly 17% to reach $7.79 billion. Azure revenues alone soared 93%, after skyrocketing 98% last quarter. | Microsoft's Azure has witnessed a significant boost due to the increasing adoption of cloud-based technologies.Moreover, continuing robust adoption of Azure will drive Microsoft's top-line growth. According to data from Synergy Research, Azure trailed only Amazon Web Services in the cloud infrastructure services market.Microsoft has outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters delivering an average positive surprise of 19.5%. The company is witnessing northbound estimate revisions - up 14 cents to $3.84 per share for the current year in the last 60 days.Further, the company has a long-term expected EPS growth rate of 11.96%.Microsoft carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks trading at 52-week high include NVIDIA Corporation  , Microchip Technology  and Twitter  , each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see  .Long-term earnings growth rate for NVIDIA, Microchip and Twitter are currently pegged at 10.25%, 14.02% and 23.1%, respectively.Here's another stock idea to consider.

Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the First Trust NASDAQ-100-Technology Sector Index Fund ETF (Symbol: QTEC), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $86.55 per unit.With QTEC trading at a recent price near $78.61 per unit, that means that analysts see 10.10% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of QTEC's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Western Digital Corp (Symbol: WDC), KLA-Tencor Corp (Symbol: KLAC), and Microchip Technology Inc (Symbol: MCHP). Although WDC has traded at a recent price of $78.45/share, the average analyst target is 47.86% higher at $116.00/share. Similarly, KLAC has 26.41% upside from the recent share price of $109.17 if the average analyst target price of $138.00/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting MCHP to reach a target price of $112.45/share, which is 22.42% above the recent price of $91.86. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of WDC, KLAC, and MCHP:Combined, WDC, KLAC, and MCHP represent 7.43% of the First Trust NASDAQ-100-Technology Sector Index Fund ETF. Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
  
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Surprising Analyst 12-Month Target For QTEC@2018-05-10@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/surprising-analyst-12-month-target-qtec-2018-05-10

Consequently, total non-GAAP net sales are now anticipated in the range of $1.172-$1.242 billion, up from the previously guided range of $1.012-$1.062 billion. This new guided figure represents sequential growth rate to be in the range of 17% to 24%.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.45 per share.Shares of Microchip have gained 18.7% in the last year, outperforming the  's rally of 16.5%.

"Chicago, IL - May 8, 2018 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include  ,  ,   and  .The Q1 earnings season will see releases from a number of semiconductor companies over the next few days. The industry serves as a driver, enabler and indicator of technological progress.According to the latest  , technology is one of the six sectors predicted to report double-digit earnings growth this quarter. Per the report, total earnings for the tech sector are projected to be up 28.5% on 12.6% higher revenues.We note that the technology sector has been a robust performer over the past year. The sector has been benefiting from increasing demand for cloud-based platforms, growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions, Augmented/Virtual reality devices, autonomous cars, advanced driver assisted systems (ADAS) and Internet of Things (IoT) related software.We believe the aforementioned trends have provided some much-needed opportunity to semiconductor companies to counter loss of business due to the declining PC market, which still consumes the bulk of the chips. Notably, according to the latest report of World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (""WSTS""), semiconductor revenues climbed 20.6% year over year to $408.7 billion in 2017.The semiconductor industry is anticipated to continue to witness growth this year as well, although not as high as 2017 but still at a respectable rate. Per the WSTS report, semiconductor revenues are likely to touch $437.3 billion in 2018, representing growth of 7.7%.The industry is poised to benefit from rising demand for new technologies, deployment of 5G broadband technology globally and President Trump's pro-business policies, including tax cuts, deregulation and outlays on infrastructure.However, this does not ensure earnings beat for all companies in the space. It should be noted that a company's earnings outperformance is dependent on the overall business environment as well as management's ability to implement operating and strategic plans.In other words, a company may perform dismally despite a favorable business environment if it fails to capitalize on the opportunities due to lack of execution.Let's see what's in store for the following semiconductor stocks, all of which are slated to release quarterly figures on May 8. is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2018 results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.35 per share while the same for revenues stands at $984.5 Million. The estimates, when compared with the year-ago quarter figures, represent 16.4% and 9.1% increase in earnings and revenues, respectively. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Further, the company has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 5.3%. You can see  .Microchip is benefiting from robust demand for 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers. We believe that the company's expanding product portfolio driven by new launches will continue to improve customer base. Additionally, the company expanded collaboration with Amazon Web services to support AWS offerings as well as develop secure cloud system.The company also continues to capitalize on enhancing its solution range and improving capacity constraints along with design wins. This enables Microchip to have a competitive edge in the semiconductor industry. (Read more:  )Next up is  , which is set to report first-quarter 2018 results. The stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 43 cents, representing remarkable year-over-year growth of 207.1%. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $269 million, up 13.8% from the year-ago quarter.We believe that the BCD Semiconductor acquisition is benefiting Diodes by expanding its footprint in the broader analog market and extending its product offerings. Further, the company's product launches and product refreshes are anticipated to boost revenues. However, stiff competition remains a concern.Another semiconductor company,  , is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results.

The company recorded an increase of 31% in last quarter revenues which indicates that its increased investment toward sales and marketing are paying off. We believe although elevated expenses are hurting its near-term profitability, these will have long-term benefits.It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

Further, escalating programming and content expenses along with retransmission fees is expected to keep margins under pressure.Nevertheless, DISH's efforts to diversify its business from being a pure-play satellite-TV operator to an Internet TV operator should help it counter competitive threats from low-cost video streaming operators.DISH is focusing on providing an improved customer experience.

Moreover, lack of visibility around the business model is a concern.However, Gogo operates in a sector (in-flight connectivity) that presents significant growth opportunities, which bodes well for the company.Gogo's 2Ku service has been the chief growth driver. Increasing bandwidth through installation of more 2Ku aircraft online is expected to boost take rates, driving top-line growth and improves profitability.Moreover, launch of products like GOGO TV and Gogo Vision Touch in 2017 are also anticipated to gain traction.With the introduction of AVANCE L5 and L3, Gogo anticipates to expand its market share in the Business Aviation segment.

The company plans to replace these ATG aircrafts with satellite based ones. The newly installed aircrafts will have lower ARPUs compared with the de-installed ones, which is a headwind.According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive  .

In the trailing four quarters, the company's earnings have beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate on three occasions, delivering an average positive surprise of 3.17%.In the last reported quarter, Cognizant delivered a positive earnings surprise of 6.19%. Revenues of $3.83 billion were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and increased 10.6% year over year driven by growth in all the four domains.For first-quarter 2018, Cognizant expects revenues in the range of $3.88-$3.92 billion. Non-GAAP earnings are expected to be at least $1.04 per share.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings has remained steady at $1.05 over the last seven days, reflecting year-over-year growth of 25%. The consensus mark for revenues currently stands at $3.90 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of almost 10%. | Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Cognizant is consistently developing its capabilities to gain from the ongoing digital transition, especially from the integration of the new digital framework with legacy technology platforms.Cognizant's strong growth can be attributed to its significant exposure to fast-growing verticals like Financial Services and Healthcare.Notably, Financial Services segment is driven by growth in insurance companies and mid-tier banks, which offset the softness from large banks.Moreover, higher demand from payer and top-tier consulting clients in the healthcare segment is likely to help the company sustain the momentum. The company serves more than 430 organizations that support more than 70% of the Medicare Advantage and managed Medicaid markets.The company's strategic customer base (clients with the potential to generate $5-$15 million or more in annual revenues) continues to expand. Cognizant now has more than 357 strategic clients.Moreover, acquisitions have been a key growth driver for Cognizant. Buyouts like Japan-based Brilliant Service, Adobe partner Netcentric, and Zone, a U.K. based digital aganecy have widened the company's domain and overall digital delivery capabilities.The acquisition of TMG Health has expanded Cognizant's position as a leading software-as-a-service (SaaS) healthcare partner in a growing market for government programs.Additionally, the company gained deep industry expertise and knowledge of the domains through partnerships with top firms like Microsoft and SAP SE.The partnerships with leading IT-firms have enabled the company to deliver more value to clients and capitalize on new opportunities. It has also provided a competitive edge against the likes of Accenture, Infosys and Wipro.According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive  .

Net Sales decreased 13.2% year over year to $456.3 million.Notably, shares of Overstock have lost 39% year-to-date, as compared with the  's rally of 17.7%.For the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $454.1 million. Further, the consensus estimate shows a loss of 87 cents for the company.Let's see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Overstock's continuous efforts on expanding product offering are likely to boost the customer base. This will is likely to generate more revenues on the platform.Also, the company recently introduced augmented reality within its shopping app powered by Google's ARCore technology. This will provide customers with accurate information about the product that they are looking to buy with enhanced picture of it on their mobile. This is likely to boost the customer base of the company.Further, the company's strong focus on enhancing the portfolio of blockchain securities bodes well with the emerging trend of blockchain across the world. DeSoto, Bitt and tZERO are expected to perform well and drive results in the quarter under review.Moreover, Overstock's decision of selling off its home e-commerce business will benefit the company in focusing more on its core retail as well as blockchain business.Additionally, its FinTech investments portfolio which is comprised of investments in those companies which are leveraging blockchain technology remain positive for the company's gaining momentum in the market.Overstock's tZERO platform is likely to drive the top-line in the going-to-be reported quarter, courtesy given to its initial coin offering. Recently, tZERO unveiled a prototype for its soon-to-be-launched token trading platform, which remains positive.We believe these endeavors will continue to benefit the company's results in the quarter under review. However, intensifying competition in the retail sector poses a serious threat to the company's market position.Our proven model does not show that Overstock will beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.

A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  .Fortinet carries a Zacks Rank of 3 and has an Earnings ESP of +2.70%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first-quarter earnings is pegged at 24 cents, which indicates a massive 41.2% year-over-year jump. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged, over the past 30 days. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $390.8 million, up 14.7% from the year-ago quarter. | We expect Fortinet's initiative to change its business model to a subscription-based service provider to have driven the company's bottom-line results in Q1. Subscription-based service is a high gross margin business (approximately 80%) compared with the hardware-centric model.Notably, the company generated more than 50% of the total revenues from these services, which helped it generate a 50-basis-point gross-margin expansion in 2017. We believe this strategy will continue to improve the company's top and bottom-line performances.Nonetheless, the company's sluggish revenue growth rate makes us cautious about its to-be-reported quarter top-line performance. Notably, over the last six quarters, the company's revenue growth rate has been around 20%, significantly lower than the previous rates of more than 30%. Additionally, Fortinet's first-quarter revenue guidance marks an even lower growth rate of 13.6-15.4%.The company observed that organizations have been breaking the cybersecurity investment plans into phases and implementing the same over longer periods of time instead of making a single large investment. Therefore, the above-mentioned factor is likely to have affected the first-quarter revenues, the negative impact of which might have trickled down the bottom as well.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Microchip Technology Incorporated  has an Earnings ESP of +0.15% and a Zacks Rank of 2. You can see  .Arrow Electronics, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +0.66% and a Zacks Rank of 2.CyberArk Software Ltd.  has an Earnings ESP of +3.53% and a Zacks Rank of 3.Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

" .  is set to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 8. The company has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 5.28%.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered earnings of $1.36 that beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. The figure jumped 29.5% on a year-over-year basis.Moreover, net sales have outpaced the consensus mark in the trailing four quarters. In the last reported quarter, net sales increased 12.8% year over year to $994.2 million, which comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $992 million.However, management's sales guidance is not so optimistic for the to-be-reported quarter. Microchip expects net sales to be ""flat to down 2%"" narrower than its previous guidance of ""up 1% to down 3% with a mid-point of down 1%.""Moreover, adjusted earnings are anticipated between $1.32 and $1.37 per share. | The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings has remained steady at $1.35 per share over the last seven days, reflecting year-over-year growth of 16.4%. The consensus mark for revenues currently stands at $984.5 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of almost 9.1%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Microchip's microcontroller business (66.5% of third-quarter sales) continues to outperform the industry and has enabled it to gain significant market share. The company had a market share of 15.84% in third-quarter fiscal 2018, which expanded 138 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter.Moreover, acquisitions like SMSC, ISSC, Micrel and Atmel have expanded Microchip's product portfolio and continue to aid top-line growth. Collaboration with Amazon Web services (""AWS"") to support AWS offerings as well as develop secure cloud systems augurs well for the company.Further, we believe that newly launched products like a single-wire, Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (EEPROM), Crypto Authentication device and two new microcontroller families PIC16F18446 and ATmega4809 will continue to expand customer base.Microchip also unveiled MPLAB PICkit 4 to ensure a cost effective, feature rich, debugging and programming solution. The In-Circuit debugger supports Microchip's latest digital signal controllers, microcontrollers and cryptography enabled devices.The company continues to capitalize on enhancing its solution range and improving capacity constraints along with design wins. This enables Microchip to have a competitive edge in the semiconductor industry.According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive  . The Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) are best avoided.We believe that Microchip is likely to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the first quarter due to a favorable combination of a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of +0.15%.

"he Q1 earnings season, which is well past the halfway mark, is widely anticipated to be one of the strongest in the past seven years with decent performance across the table. As global tensions eased a bit with leaders of North and South Korea pledging to collaborate to secure complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and reduce the risk of war, the markets might be headed for a smooth spell.As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of ""backing and filling"" in the market, they could benefit from 'cash cow' stocks that garner higher returns.However, singling out cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return.ROE = Net Income/Shareholders' EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry - the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management's efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.In order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE, we have added  and  as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy. This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock. This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company. This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength. Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 18 stocks that qualified the screen: : Headquartered in Los Angeles, CBRE Group is a commercial real estate services and investment firm.

"nvestors in Microchip Technology Inc (Symbol: MCHP) saw new options become available this week, for the June 15th expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the MCHP options chain for the new June 15th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $80.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.10. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $80.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $76.90 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of MCHP, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $82.55/share today.Because the $80.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 64%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.88% return on the cash commitment, or 27.73% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Microchip Technology Inc, and highlighting in green where the $80.00 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $85.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.95. If an investor was to purchase shares of MCHP stock at the current price level of $82.55/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $85.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 6.54% if the stock gets called away at the June 15th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if MCHP shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Microchip Technology Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing MCHP's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $85.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $85.00 strike represents an approximate 3% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

ave you been paying attention to shares of  ? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 9% over the past month. MLNX hit a new 52-week high of $80.55 in the previous session. Mellanox Technologies has gained 22.7% since the start of the year compared to the 2.7% move for the Computer and Technology sector and the 13.9% year-to-date return for its peer group.The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on April 17, 2018, Mellanox Technologies reported EPS of $0.98 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.83 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 2.67%.For the current fiscal year, Mellanox Technologies is expected to post earnings of $4.07 per share on $1.04 billion in revenues. This represents a 78.51% change in EPS on a 20.72% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $4.53 per share on $1.12 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 11.28% and 7.84%, respectively.Mellanox Technologies may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for MLNX? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Mellanox Technologies has a Value Score of D. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 19.5X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 26.7X versus its peer group's average of 12.8X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.3. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective. | We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Mellanox Technologies currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Mellanox Technologies fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though MLNX shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.Shares of Mellanox Technologies have been rising, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also looking good, including SMART Global Holdings  , Micron Technology  , and Microchip Technology  , all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.However, it is worth noting that the Zacks Industry Rank for this group is in the bottom half of the ranking, so it isn't all good news for Mellanox Technologies. Still, the fundamentals for MLNX are promising, and it still has potential despite being at a 52-week-high.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"Chicago, IL - April 16, 2018 - Stocks in this week's article include: Superior Uniform Group  , H&E Equipment Services Inc.  , Chemours Company  , Applied Materials Inc.  and Microchip Technology Inc.  .Dividend growth stocks lead to a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend paying stocks or those with high yields.Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase is likely in the future.Moreover, a history of dividend growth year over year leads to a healthy portfolio with greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend paying stocks or those with high yields.

"emiconductor stocks were hit hard by the recent market sell-off, but the underlying business of this industry is growing-and should continue that trend in 2018 and beyond. Throughout the chip-making space, companies have successfully adapted to the changing needs of the consumer, including an increased demand for small, high-powered chips that enable ""Internet of Things"" (IoT) devices.For those that don't know, the Internet of Things is the growing world of interconnected household and industrial devices. Everyday products and machines can now be embedded with sensor technology to process data or interact with other electronic devices.For example, consumer-level IoT products include things like Amazon's  Echo ""smart speaker,"" wearable motion and activity tracking products, and advanced in-car technology. On the commercial side of the IoT market, industrial manufacturers have begun implementing sensors into machines to track performance and efficiency.As demand for the microchips that power these IoT devices continues to grow, semiconductor manufacturers with a focus on IoT products will continue to benefit. And 2018 promises to be another marquee year for these suppliers, with the number of connected devices worldwide set to continue its rapid growth.With that said, we've found three already-strong stocks that are looking to benefit even more from further IoT growth in 2018:Although you might recognize the brand because of its calculators, Texas Instruments is actually one of the leading suppliers of advanced semiconductors in the world. The company's IoT profile falls under its Embedded Processors division, which includes the Connectivity, Microcontrollers, and Processors categories.Texas Instruments reported year-over-year growth of 20% in its Embedded Processors division during the most recent quarter. The firm also surpassed revenue estimates and released in-line guidance. TXN is now sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Meanwhile, the stock has a Forward P/E of 20.5 and a PEG of 2.1, so investors are getting a decent price for its earnings and earnings growth outlook.Microchip Technology is a manufacturer of microcontroller, memory, and analog chips. The company is a leader in several IoT-related fields, including automotive and wireless connectivity. Microchip also develops products that are secure and trusted by platforms like Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Cloud.MCHP is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Growth). The company is an aggressive EPS growth pick, with current estimates calling for earnings to improve by 36% this fiscal year. Shares are also trading at an attractive 15.1 forward 12-month earnings, and its PEG of 1.1 implies its growth is being undervalued. Management is also generating cash flow growth of 57%, which should help it improve its financial position to fund further innovation.Comtech develops innovative products, systems, and services for advanced communications solutions. The company markets its solutions to both commercial and government clients, and it conducts business through three key segments: telecommunications transmission, RF microwave amplifiers, and mobile data communications.CMTL is holding a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now. The stock is a hot momentum pick after gaining a staggering 43% over the past three months. The company will look to continue that momentum with projected earnings growth of 232% this year. Shares are pricey at 27x forward earnings, but Comtech has consistently crushed expectations over the past year-and investors will pay a premium for that.The Internet of Things is one of the most exciting emerging tech markets in the world. And while these specific products are interesting, the real moneymakers in these situations are the companies that are building the tech that powers these products.The best way for investors to cash in on this growing trend is to identify companies that are not only investing in the Internet of Things, but are also displaying solid fundamentals and impressive Zacks metrics.Zacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the SPDR S&P 500 Fossil Fuel Reserves Free ETF (Symbol: SPYX), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $73.68 per unit.With SPYX trading at a recent price near $66.54 per unit, that means that analysts see 10.73% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of SPYX's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Federal Realty Investment Trust (Symbol: FRT), KLA-Tencor Corp. (Symbol: KLAC), and Microchip Technology Inc (Symbol: MCHP). Although FRT has traded at a recent price of $117.28/share, the average analyst target is 17.03% higher at $137.25/share. Similarly, KLAC has 15.20% upside from the recent share price of $117.43 if the average analyst target price of $135.28/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting MCHP to reach a target price of $108.82/share, which is 13.84% above the recent price of $95.59.

Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments?

ividend growth stocks lead to a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend paying stocks or those with high yields.Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase is likely in the future.Moreover, a history of dividend growth year over year leads to a healthy portfolio with greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend paying stocks or those with high yields. Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.As a result, picking dividend growth stocks appears as a winning strategy when some other parameters are also included. : This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history. : This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenues. : This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history. : This represents the rate at which a company's earnings are expected to grow.

"nvestors have been on the edge since Trump hinted at possibilities of missile attacks on Syria. As tensions gradually eased with the U.S. President clarifying that attacks (if at all) were not imminent, the market took a breather with bank stocks leading the rebound on solid earnings expectations.As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of ""backing and filling"" in the market, they could benefit from 'cash cow' stocks that rake in higher returns.However, singling out cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return.ROE = Net Income/Shareholders' EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry - the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management's efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.In order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE, we have added  and  as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy. This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock. This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company. This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength. Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 11 stocks that qualified the screen: : Incorporated in Delaware in 1989, Microchip develops and manufacturers microcontrollers, memory and analog and interface products for embedded control systems, which are small, low-power computers designed to perform specific tasks. The company has a Zacks Rank #2. Microchip has a trailing four-quarter average positive earnings surprise of 5.3% and long-term earnings growth expectation of 14.6%. : Headquartered in New York, NY, AMC Networks operates various cable television brands delivering content to audiences, and a platform to distributors and advertisers in the United States and internationally.

 has announced a significant expansion to its Mosaic Subscriber Experience Suite, just before the scheduled reporting of first-quarter results on Apr 17.The Mosaic Subscriber Experience tools provide advanced analytics, software centric operations and virtualized service delivery, making device installation and service activation ultra-efficient.The company has added two new software applications - Mosaic Subscriber Insight and Mosaic Device Manager - which give service providers network and subscriber intelligence as well as remote in-home device management. These applications support a user-driven service model to enable a simple, intuitive experience with better in-home network visibility and performance.Mosaic Subscriber Insight outlines the subscriber experience through a network intelligence tool, enhancing business operations. The Mosaic Device Manager defines the subscriber experience through a device management tool, which empowers service providers to monitor and maintain in-home customer devices and Wi-Fi networks from a distance.These two applications will join the previously announced Mosaic Activate, which integrates one click broadband service activation. The enhanced Mosaic portfolio enables service providers to meet the increasing customer expectations. These innovations will help to provide high quality analytics, lower operating costs, gain visibility to subscriber behavior while building customer loyalty.All three components operate in an open architecture that supports ADTRAN and third-party devices across both SD-Access and traditional broadband. Such enhancements to the Mosaic Cloud Platform are likely to reinforce the company's position as the industry leader in Software-Defined Access.However, over the past month, ADTRAN's shares have underperformed the  with an average loss of 5.2% compared with a decline of 2.1% for the latter.ADTRAN carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Mastercard (MA), Petrobras (PBR) and Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see Buy-rated  's shares have increased 54.5% over the last year, significantly outperforming the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry's gain of 33.2% during the same period. The Zacks analyst likes its solid market position, ongoing expansion and digital initiatives.Also, there are significant opportunities from the secular shift toward electronic payments. The acquisitions of VocaLink and NuData Security complement the company's efforts to participate in new payment flows and enhance its safety and security offerings.The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised upward over the last 60 days. It, however, continues to face increasing costs. Also, higher incentives and rewards will put pressure on the bottom line.(You can  ).Shares of  have outperformed the Zacks Emerging Markets Integrated Oil industry over the last three months, gaining +21.5% vs. +11.7%. Adding to the bullishness, Brazil's flagship oil company reported robust fourth quarter results. While its strong free cash flow performance reflects operational improvement and lower investments, Petrobras has been able to partly revive its financial health through divestments and spin offs.The company's ambitious plan to boost volumes by 27% through 2022 also looks achievable considering its impressive pre-salt reservoirs portfolio. However, Petrobras still carries a massive net debt of $85 billion, with net debt-to-capitalization ratio of 51%. Weak oil products sales volume in Brazil and lower margins at its downstream unit are other headwinds. As such, the Zacks analyst maintains a cautious stance on the stock.(You can  ). 's shares have done better than the embattled Zacks Drug Stores industry over the last year (WBA is down -10.5% vs. decline of -13.4% for the peer group). Walgreens Boots reported better-than-expected second quarter fiscal 2018 results. This time the company witnessed its highest sales in the last eight quarters.The Zacks analyst likes Walgreens Boots' increase in sales at the Retail Pharmacy International. Moreover, the company has been gaining on account of strategic tie-ups. The company's alliance with Express Scripts aiming to expand their existing group purchasing efforts is another positive.This apart, the company's decision to acquire a 40% stake in Sinopharm Holding Guoda Drugstores in China looks promising as it should provide a strong impetus to Walgreens Boots' worldwide retail pharmacy business. However, declining Retail Pharmacy sales at CER was a disappointment. The company faces tough competition along with currency fluctuations.(You can  ).Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Kimberly Clark (KMB), Microchip (MCHP) and Carnival (CCL).It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.Mark VickerySenior EditorPer the Zacks analyst, Wirtgen buyout will aid Deere's North America-centric construction business. Strong order activity in Combine Early Order Program and large tractors will also drive growth.Per the Zacks analyst, Interactive Brokers' dependence on IBG LLC is a concern as if it fails to provide funds for taxes, the company's financials may suffer. Focus on Electronic segment aids growth.The Zacks analyst notes that Darden's acquisition of Cheddar's has added value to the company's portfolio of differentiated brands. However, a competitive industry poses challenge.The covering analyst is encouraged by Carnival's effort to enhance revenue yield from high ticket prices amid increased demand.Per the Zacks analyst, Extra Space Storage is poised to gain from its high brand value, strategic acquisitions & robust presence in key cities.The Zacks analyst likes the strong performance of the intermodal unit, which is aiding the company's overall freight revenues.The Zacks analyst believes that improving economy has helped Huntington witness growth in loan and deposits.Per the Zacks analyst, economic improvements in IDACORP's service territories is expanding its customer base. Ongoing investments to strengthen its operations will continue to boost performance.The Zacks analyst likes VeriFone's dominant position in the electronic payment systems and services market. Robust product portfolio is a positive. Growth prospects from buyouts raise optimism.Kimberly-Clark expects cost savings of over $2 billion from its FORCE Program and 2018 Global Restructuring Program over the next four years. Per the Zacks analyst, this is likely to fuel bottom-line.Per the Zacks analyst, continued losses in fixed line voice business and shift in customers to discounted calling rate offers from national wireless operators have hurt Telefonica Brasil revenues.Per the Zacks analyst increasing expenses have weighed on the company's margins and the same are expected to rise over the coming quarters given its ongoing investments in business expansion.Per the Zacks analyst, Microchip is adversely impacted by exchange rate volatility, increasing lead time, significant exposure to Asian markets and competition from peers.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

he Semiconductor industry is undergoing a massive consolidation wave. A huge number of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) worth hundreds of billion dollars have taken place over the last few years.Consolidation is natural in a mature industry like semiconductor which is now more than 60 years old. This industry is currently plagued with two huge challenges, which include escalating costs of producing chips for devices and a sluggish growth rate.With continued innovation over the decades, the size of chips has shrunk to that of a few atoms, while the costs of producing these have flared up. Moreover, escalating costs for designing, packaging and testing are becoming unaffordable for most companies, especially for the smaller firms.Additionally, the industry has been countering a sluggish growth-rate challenge despite big trends like Internet of Things (IoT) which is believed to add an extraordinary volume in sales of electronic devices. Over the last 15-20 years, the semiconductor industry has recorded growth at an annualized rate of less than 5%.In such a turbulent environment, semiconductor companies need to be huge in order to compete effectively. Therefore, these companies have resorted to M&A in an effort to grab more market share, cut costs, boost productivity and improve investment returns through scale economies.Over the last 24 months, the industry has witnessed more than 10 major mergers and acquisitions which have a combined worth of more than $100 billion, such as the buyout of Altera by Intel  and purchase of Broadcom  by Avago, which retained the name of the acquired company.The acquisition of Altera has helped Intel get a chip technology which the latter, otherwise, did not have i.e. field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). This technology has strengthened its server offerings which enjoy huge demand from data-center operators. Also, FPGAs are very useful in IoT implementation which is a big trend in the technology sector, at the moment.Similarly, the Avago-Broadcom merger has made the current Broadcom the leading diversified communications semiconductor company in the world. This alliance has also resulted in annualized cost synergies of approximately $750 million - a perfect example of enhancing market share and improving economies of scale through M&A activity.The last few months have been eventful for the industry in terms of M&A activities like buyout of Cavium by Marvell Technology and Microchip  taking over Microsemi  . The most interesting is Broadcom's aggressive approach of buying QUALCOMM (QCOM) which, looking at the current scenario, seems to be turning out as a hostile takeover.All the recent M&A events are hinting toward a new wave of consolidation in the semiconductor industry in the near future.M&A announcements generally result in a massive surge of the targeted company's share prices, thereby providing investors an opportunity to make huge money overnight. As the consolidation cycle for the semiconductor industry does not seem to end any time soon, it is wise to stay focused on stocks that can be a potential takeover target.We, at Zacks, have searched four semiconductor stocks which might get an acquisition offer in few months' time.The first stock in our list is  which is a specialist in making audio-chips. However, for the past few quarters this company has not been performing well due to its overdependence on a single customer - Apple Inc. - which accounts for more than 75% of its total revenues.Apple's latest iPhone X sales have remained below expectations, in turn hurting Cirrus Logic's overall financial performance. Due to this, the company's shares have plummeted in a year's time. The stock is currently trading near its 52-week low and has lost 17.8% of its value over the past year. Also, the company is highly undervalued as it trades at a forward P/E multiple of 10.1x, which is a significant discount to the industry average of 14x.We believe there is no such problem in the company's business model. It is a good takeover target for companies which are specialized in providing hardware to smartphone makers like Qualcomm. Moreover, the cheap valuation makes it an attractive buyout opportunity. , which is a leading provider of DRAM memory to the Brazil market, is another semiconductor company which looks like a potential takeover target. Although the company was founded 25 years back, it got listed in May 2017. The company's last three quarterly results have been stellar, thanks to elevated demand as well as prices of DRAMs. According to various research reports, the prospects of DRAM memory chip makers will remain bright this year due to supply shortage.Furthermore, although the stock has soared a whopping 182% in the last year, it is still undervalued given the fact that it currently trades at a forward P/E multiple of just 7.6x, significantly lower than the industry average of 14x. Moreover, the company has an expected long-term EPS growth rate of 15%, much higher than the industry average of 10.2%. may also be another acquisition target as the company is a promising player in the solid state drive (SSD) controllers market. Over the coming years, we expect an increasing number of PCs/servers to use the flash-based solid state technology for storage. The storage market has been witnessing a steady increase in demand, given fast-growing data volume, especially the exponential growth in unstructured data.Various research firms suggest NAND (non-volatile storage technology) demand will remain very strong in 2018 as well. This demand will also rise further and might even surpass the manufacturing capacity, leading to periodic shortage and higher pricing in the near term. Marvell has been benefiting from this growing demand for SSD products.Further, although the stock has appreciated 47.9% in a year's time, it is still undervalued given the fact that it currently trades at a forward P/E multiple of just 17.8x, significantly lower than its industry average of 24.9x. Moreover, the company has an expected long-term EPS growth rate of 16.3%, way higher than the industry average of 9.1%.Another potential pick is  , which is a provider of radio-frequency analog and mixed signal semiconductor SoC solutions for broadband communication applications offering small silicon die-size, and low power consumption. The company recorded a 31% increase in its last quarter revenues which indicates that its increased investment toward sales and marketing are paying off. We believe although elevated expenses are hurting its near-term profitability, these will have long-term benefits.The stock currently trades near to its 52-week low and has lost 9.8% of its value over the past year. Also, the company has a forward P/E multiple of 14.2x, which is almost in line with the industry average of 14x.The total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion - more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months. They're now bigger than Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and even Visa! The new asset class may expand even more rapidly in 2018 as new investors continue pouring in and Wall Street becomes increasingly involved.Zacks' has just named 4 companies that enable investors to take advantage of the explosive growth of cryptocurrencies via the stock market.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

t has been about a month since the last earnings report for  . Shares have added about 15.3% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is MCHP due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Microchip reported third-quarter fiscal 2018 non-GAAP earnings of $1.36 per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. The figure improved 29.5% year over year but declined 3.5% sequentially.The year-over-year upside was driven by higher net sales, which increased 12.8% from the year-ago quarter to $994.2 million. However, the same declined 1.8% sequentially. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $992 million.Book-to-bill ratio was approximately 1.00 compared with 1.05 in the previous quarter, reflecting stable lead times. Management expects to achieve normal lead times by June 2018.In terms of product line, microcontroller business (66.5% of net sales) increased 18.9% year over driven by robust demand for 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers.Microchip unveiled a single-wire, Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (EEPROM) device, which will help in remote identification of electronic components.The company also launched Crypto Authentication device, which will allow developers to integrate hardware-based security to their designs. Additionally, it announced a third-party security design partner program.In the quarter, Microchip announced that it has improved response time for critical system events to help designers create CAN-based applications, without any added complexity.Additionally, the company expanded collaboration with Amazon Web services (AWS) to support AWS offerings as well as develop secure cloud systems.However, analog sales (23.3% of net sales) were down 3.2% on a sequential basis. Revenues were hurt by capacity constraint at Atmel. Moreover, the company's intent to offer total system solutions that combines microcontroller cores with analog products and connectivity firmware negatively impacted sales. Revenue recognition for these products was shifted from analog business to the microcontroller business.Still management believes that the higher margin total system solutions will help Microchip retain customers and win new designs in the long haul. According to the company, improving capacity constraints along with design wins will enable the analog business to expand at a higher rate than Microchip.Memory sales (4.8% of net sales) were down 7.6% on a quarter-over-quarter basis.Licensing (2.8% of net sales) sales increased 6.8% sequentially and 15.5% on a year-over-year basis.In the reported quarter, MMO revenues came in at $26 million and accounted for 2.6% of net sales.Geographically, Asia remained Microchip's largest market with 60% of net sales coming from the region. Europe and Americas contributed 23% and 17%, respectively.Microchip posted non-GAAP gross margin of 61.4%, which expanded 360 bps on a year-over-year basis.Non-GAAP operating expenses, as percentage of revenues, were down 300 bps year over year and 50 bps sequentially to 22%. The decline was primarily due to lower research & development (R&D) expenses and selling, general & administrative (SG&A) expenses, which decreased 170 bps and 130 bps, respectively.As a result, non-GAAP operating margin expanded 660 bps from the year-ago quarter and 80 bps sequentially to 39.4%.Cash generated in the reported quarter was $365 million compared with $350.1 million in the previous quarter. As of Dec 31, 2017, cash and total investment position was $1.985 billion compared with $1.84 billion in the previous quarter.Management noted that inventory on Dec 31, 2017, was at 115 days, up by 10 days from the September quarter level.The company declared a quarterly cash dividend of 36.30 cents per share, which is payable on Mar 6, 2018.Microchip forecasts fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 net sales in the range of $964.4-$1,004.1 million.Non-GAAP gross margin is anticipated in the range of 61.3-61.7%, which is based on Microchip 2.0 margin drivers. Non-GAAP operating expenses, as percentage of sales, are projected in the 22-22.4% band and operating margin is expected at 38.9-39.7%.For the fourth quarter, earnings are anticipated in the range of $1.30-$1.39 per share.Microchip's inventory days in the impending quarter is expected to between 115 and 120 days. Capital expenditures are estimated in the range of $50-$60 million.For fiscal 2018, capital expenditures are now projected in the range of $200-$210 million, down from $200-$220 million guided previously. This reflects aggressive investment to strengthen and expand production capabilities.Furthermore, the company plans to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced, which will ultimately improve gross margin.The heightened capital expenditures also reflect three new buildings that Microchip is constructing in Arizona, India and Germany. These, in turn, will help in reducing cost in the long-haul.In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There have been five revisions lower for the current quarter. | At this time, MCHP has a strong Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a lot on the momentum front with a D. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Our style scores indicate that the stock is more suitable for growth investors than value investors.Estimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, MCHP has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Semiconductor ETF Experiences Big Outflow@2018-03-02@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/semiconductor-etf-experiences-big-outflow-2018-03-02

Leading the way is chip giant and Dow component Intel.Last week, the chipmaker trounced quarterly earnings and sales targets, sparking a 10.6% advance. In that quarter, year-over-year earnings and sales growth came in at 37% and 4%, respectively. The company now shows two quarters of accelerating earnings - a bullish fundamental metric.Three weeks prior to that announcement, the stock triggered a 7%-8% loss-cutting sell rule from a 47.40 cup-shaped base buy point after reports that  were found in its processors.The post-earning rally took the stock to new highs, although it was a riskier entry and the stock has been fading this week.Within the chipmakers' industry group, the top-ranked stock is  (  ) with a 96 (out of a highest-possible 99) IBD Composite Rating. While its most recent formation appears to be a cup-shaped base, it is too short - only five weeks long - to fit that bill, and it is slightly too deep to be a flat base. The best way to look at the stock may be a strong move back above the 10-week line after spending a couple weeks below that key support level.Check out the stock's relative strength line - the blue line painted on every IBD and MarketSmith daily and weekly chart. It is strongly in new high territory, indicating that it is outperforming the market.Other group leaders including  (  ) and small-cap stock  (MX) are near potential buy points.Microchip is just below a 96.02 cup-shaped base entry after a strong breakout on Jan. 17. Meanwhile, Magnachip is approaching a cup with handle's 13.45 buy point.Both of these stocks show lagging relative strength lines, which could end up being substantial flaws in their chart patterns. The RS line should hit a new high on the breakout day or shortly thereafter to indicate substantial market outperformance.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Despite Trouble Among Semis, Top Chipmakers Near New Entries@2018-02-01@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/despite-trouble-among-semis-top-chipmakers-near-new-entries-2018-02-01

These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Noteworthy ETF Outflows: SOXX, MCHP, ADI, AMAT@2018-02-02@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/noteworthy-etf-outflows-soxx-mchp-adi-amat-2018-02-02

ooking today at week-over-week shares outstanding changes among the universe of ETFs covered at  , one standout is the Semiconductor ETF (Symbol: SMH) where we have detected an approximate $106.8 million dollar inflow -- that's a 8.7% increase week over week in outstanding units (from 11,470,937 to 12,470,937). Among the largest underlying components of SMH, in trading today Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Ltd. (Symbol: TSM) is up about 3.5%, ASML Holding NV (Symbol: ASML) is off about 0.8%, and Microchip Technology Inc (Symbol: MCHP) is higher by about 0.3%.  The chart below shows the one year price performance of SMH, versus its 200 day moving average:Looking at the chart above, SMH's low point in its 52 week range is $72.76 per share, with $107.37 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $107.11. Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Noteworthy ETF Inflows: SMH, TSM, ASML, MCHP@2018-01-22@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/noteworthy-etf-inflows-smh-tsm-asml-mchp-2018-01-22

One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 235 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the MCHP options chain for the new July 2018 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $85.00 strike price has a current bid of $5.00. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $85.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $80.00 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of MCHP, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $89.70/share today.Because the $85.00 strike represents an approximate 5% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 64%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.88% return on the cash commitment, or 9.14% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Microchip Technology Inc, and highlighting in green where the $85.00 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $92.50 strike price has a current bid of $6.10. If an investor was to purchase shares of MCHP stock at the current price level of $89.70/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $92.50. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 9.92% if the stock gets called away at the July 2018 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if MCHP shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Microchip Technology Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing MCHP's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $92.50 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $92.50 strike represents an approximate 3% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 52%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.80% boost of extra return to the investor, or 10.56% annualized, which we refer to as the  .The implied volatility in the put contract example is 27%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 28%. Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $89.70) to be 22%.

"he equity markets bounced back yesterday as the House of Representatives passed a historic tax bill, inching closer to a legislative tax overhaul centered on President Trump's electoral promise. With corporate taxes likely to come down from 35% to 20%, expectations of higher corporate earnings and dividend payouts are likely to drive stocks.As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of ""backing and filling"" in the market, they could benefit from 'cash cow' stocks that garner higher returns.However, singling out cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return.ROE = Net Income/Shareholders' EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry - the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management's efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.In order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE, we have added  and  as our primary screening parameters.

It delivered a positive surprise of 6.50% in the last quarter.Adjusted earnings surged 56% year over year and 12.9% sequentially to $1.31 per share in the first quarter. The strong growth was driven by higher net sales, which increased 15.2% from the year-ago quarter to $972.1 million. On a sequential basis, net sales increased almost 7.7%.Microchip recently reaffirmed its second-quarter guidance backed by successful execution of its strategic initiatives, optimization of manufacturing operations and a favorable macro environment.Management expects fiscal second-quarter 2018 net sales to be approximately $1.00 billion, which reflects growth of approximately 3% on a sequential basis and 14.6% on a year-over-year basis. Earnings are anticipated to be in the range of $1.33-$1.37 per share.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Notably, the company enhanced its product portfolio during the quarter, which is expected to boost its top line in the near term.Microchip unveiled a sequential linear LED driver for the purpose of cost-effective LED lighting applications.

According to  , 76% (209 of 275) of companies that have reported Q3'17 results have beat their EPS estimates. Source: ©iStock.com/lef2481This is above the trailing 4-quarter average EPS beat percentage of 71% and well above the 5-year average of 59%. In addition, these companies have beat their expected earnings on average of 4.7% which is also above the 5-year average of 4.2%.The reason this earnings season has been  is due to the minuscule impact these positive surprises have had on share prices. Companies that have reported upside earnings surprises have seen an average price impact of only +0.1% immediately following the announcement. Investors typically expect a stock to jump much higher when the company beats their estimates.We're not seeing this impact because the market has already priced in these positive earnings as illustrated by the S&P 500's premium valuation. The forward P/E ratio for the S&P 500 currently stands at 17.9x. This is well above its 5-year average of 15.6x and its 10-year average of 14.1x.However, there has been a silver lining among these earnings announcements.The Information Technology () sector has been a clear leader this earnings season with 91% of companies reporting earnings above estimates. Furthermore, these companies are beating their expected earnings on average of 11.3%. This sector is on pace to achieve 14.8% year-over-year (YoY) growth.More specifically, companies in the Semiconductor & Semiconductor Equipment industry have significantly outperformed reporting 42% YoY earnings growth thus far (  ). Other IT industries such as Software, IT Services, and Internet Software & Services have also reported healthy earnings growth of 12%, 11%, and 10%, respectively.The semiconductor industry is  and is constantly facing booms and busts as demand for its products quickly changes. However, it is worth taking a closer look at stocks in this industry when times are good as they are currently;  (NASDAQ:  ) is up 40% since the beginning of the year and nearly 10% in the last month.Therefore I was curious to see if there were still any companies that have  exposure to the semiconductor industry,  have yet to report earnings, and  are still trading at a fairly reasonable valuation implying that there's still upside potential.According to finbox.io, the forward P/E multiple for the entire IT sector currently stands at 21.4x, well above the 17.9x of the S&P 500. This is not surprising as premium growth warrants a premium valuation. Therefore I use the 21.4x multiple as a ceiling in my screen.The following are all the filters applied in this  .There were only 7 stocks that resulted from this stock screen as of October 31st. I then ranked them below by their P/E multiple in ascending order. (NASDAQ:  ) designs and manufactures analog and mixed-signal semiconductor solutions worldwide.

ooking today at week-over-week shares outstanding changes among the universe of ETFs covered at  , one standout is the Semiconductor ETF (Symbol: SMH) where we have detected an approximate $147.4 million dollar outflow -- that's a 12.6% decrease week over week (from 11,520,937.00 to 10,070,937.00). Among the largest underlying components of SMH, in trading today Micron Technology Inc. (Symbol: MU) is up about 1%, ASML Holding NV (Symbol: ASML) is up about 0.9%, and Microchip Technology Inc (Symbol: MCHP) is lower by about 0.9%.  The chart below shows the one year price performance of SMH, versus its 200 day moving average:Looking at the chart above, SMH's low point in its 52 week range is $66.13 per share, with $102.44 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $101.89. Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Noteworthy ETF Outflows: SMH, MU, ASML, MCHP@2017-11-01@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/noteworthy-etf-outflows-smh-mu-asml-mchp-2017-11-01

Among the largest underlying components of FTC, in trading today Micron Technology Inc.

The chart below shows the one year price performance of FTC, versus its 200 day moving average:Looking at the chart above, FTC's low point in its 52 week range is $47.21 per share, with $58.59 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $58.58. Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Noteworthy ETF Inflows: FTC, MU, PYPL, MCHP@2017-10-06@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/noteworthy-etf-inflows-ftc-mu-pypl-mchp-2017-10-06

"One of the strongest corners of the market this year has been the semiconductors industry. Throughout the chip-making market, companies have successfully adapted to the changing needs of the consumer, including an increased demand for small, high-powered chips that enable ""Internet of Things"" (IoT) devices.For example, consumer-level IoT products include things like  (NASDAQ:  ) Echo ""smart speaker,"" wearable motion and activity tracking products, and advanced in-car technology. On the commercial side of the IoT market, industrial manufacturers have begun implementing sensors into machines to track performance and efficiency.As demand for the microchips that power these IoT devices continues to grow, semiconductor manufacturers with a focus on IoT products will continue to benefit. With that said, we've found three already-strong stocks that are looking to benefit even more from further IoT growth. (NASDAQ:  ) is a leading provider of high-performance digital and mixed-signal integrated circuits. Just last year, the company shelled out $550 million to acquire Broadcom's Wireless Internet of Things business and now its ""WICED"" Platform is one of the largest IoT portfolios in the industry.The stock is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which pairs well with its ""B"" grade for Growth in our Style Scores system. Our current consensus estimates are calling for EPS growth of 65% this fiscal year, and that expansion is expected to continue with 41% EPS growth in the next fiscal year. Cypress also pays an impressive 3.20% dividend.Although you might recognize the brand because of its calculators,  (NASDAQ:  )  is actually one of the leading suppliers of advanced semiconductors in the world. The company's IoT profile falls under its Embedded Processors division, which includes the Connectivity, Microcontrollers, and Processors categories.In its most recent earnings report, Texas Instruments saw growth of 15% in its Embedded Processors segment, and that's not to mention that it once again surpassed our consensus estimates for earnings and revenue. Texas Instruments is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), and on top of this, the company pays a nice 2.44% dividend. (NASDAQ:  ) is a manufacturer of microcontroller, memory, and analog chips. The company is a leader in several IoT-related fields, including automotive and wireless connectivity. Right now, Microchip is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and we've seen multiple positive revisions to the company's current-year and next-year earnings estimates.The stock also has an ""A"" grade for Growth. According to our current consensus estimates, Microchip is set to report earnings and revenue growth rates of 32% and 16%, respectively, this year. Microchip's current cash flow growth is more than 57%, and the company pays a respectable 1.67% dividend.The Internet of Things is one of the most exciting emerging tech markets in the world. Home automation products are fun. In-car technology is cool.And while these specific products are interesting, the real moneymakers in these situations are the companies that are building the tech that powers these products. The Internet of Things needs semiconductors to function, and as the IoT grows, so too will semiconductor companies.The best way for investors to cash in on this growing trend is to identify semiconductor companies that are not only investing in the Internet of Things, but are also displaying solid fundamentals and impressive Zacks metrics.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@3 Internet of Things Stocks You Should Buy Right Now@2017-09-08@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-internet-of-things-stocks-you-should-buy-right-now-2017-09-08

"or Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL - September 1, 2017 - Stocks in this week's article include  . (NYSE:  -  ),  (NASDAQ:  -  ),  . (NYSE:  -  ),  (NYSE:  -  ) and  (NASDAQ:  -  ).Dividend is a major source of consistent income for investors when returns from the equity market are at risk.Dividend paying stocks are primarily mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market. Their market leading position, large customer base, sustainable business model, long track of profitability and strong liquidity allow them to offer outsized payouts or sizable yields on a regular basis irrespective of the market direction. As a result, these stocks provide greater stability and more scope for capital appreciation as opposed to those that pay high yields.Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that a future hike is likely. This makes the portfolio healthy and safe.Though these stocks have a long history of outperformance compared with the broad stock market or any other dividend paying stocks, it does not necessarily mean that they have the highest yields.Here are the screening parameters that could result in a winning dividend growth portfolio: : This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history. : This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenue. : This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history. : This represents the rate at which a company's earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments. : A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for a better cash flow generated by the company. : This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S&P 500 over the past one year. : Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in all types of market environment. You can see  .VGM  of B or better: This is simply a weighted combination of Value, Growth and Momentum. This when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 offers the best upside potential.Here are five of the 13 stocks that fit the bill: . (NYSE:  -  ): This Toledo, TX-based company develops, manufactures and markets insulation, roofing and fiberglass composites. The stock has a VGM Style Score of B and a Zacks Rank #1.

The stock has a Zacks Rank #1 and a VGM Style Score of A. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained steady at $12.61 over the last 30 days. .

ividend is a major source of consistent income for investors when returns from the equity market are at risk.Dividend paying stocks are primarily mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market. Their market leading position, large customer base, sustainable business model, long track of profitability and strong liquidity allow them to offer outsized payouts or sizable yields on a regular basis irrespective of the market direction. As a result, these stocks provide greater stability and more scope for capital appreciation as opposed to those that pay high yields.Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that a future hike is likely. This makes the portfolio healthy and safe.Though these stocks have a long history of outperformance compared with the broad stock market or any other dividend paying stocks, it does not necessarily mean that they have the highest yields.Here are the screening parameters that could result in a winning dividend growth portfolio: : This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history. : This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenue. : This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history. : This represents the rate at which a company's earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments. : A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for a better cash flow generated by the company. : This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S&P 500 over the past one year. : Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in all types of market environment. You can see  .VGM  of B or better: This is simply a weighted combination of Value, Growth and Momentum. This when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 offers the best upside potential.Here are five of the 13 stocks that fit the bill: .  : This Toledo, TX-based company develops, manufactures and markets insulation, roofing and fiberglass composites. The stock has a VGM Style Score of B and a Zacks Rank #1. The stock delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 20.17% in the past four quarters.

"Chicago, IL - September 8, 2017 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include  (Nasdaq:  -  ),  (NYSE:  -  ),  (Nasdaq:  -  ),  (NYSE:  -  )and  (Nasdaq:  -  ).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations. The semiconductor industry is very well poised to benefit from all the major technology trends such as cloud computing, IoT, self-driving cars, drones, industrial and other automation, smart cities, 5G Internet, you name it. That's because none of these things can be operational without these little integrated circuits serving to store, process, transport, transmit or receive information. As we move towards a more connected world where humans not only talk to each other, but also to their machines and machines also increasingly talk to each other, the need for semiconductor devices can only increase hereafter.So it's not hard to imagine that there would be investment opportunities in the segment and that's what this article is about. To make the investment decision easier, I've picked on companies with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can also see  . They also have a VGM score A.As many Zacks.com readers already know, the VGM score essentially captures the investment style (and therefore also the risk appetite) and breaks down as the value-growth-momentum score. So if a stock has a Value score A, value investors should be interested in that stock, if it has a Growth Score A, it would be ideal for growth investors and so on. So a VGM score of A indicates that no matter what your investment style, you should take a look at these stocks: (Nasdaq:  -  )Fremont-based Ichor Holdings is engaged in the design, engineering and manufacturing of critical gas and chemical delivery subsystems used in the etch, deposition, electroplating and cleaning processes of semiconductor manufacturing. It operates in the U.S., UK, Singapore and Malaysia. The company had its IPO at the end of 2016, so supporting numbers are limited. But it's encouraging to note that:2017 earnings estimate up 48.5% from Jan 2017 to $2.422018 earnings estimate up 54.1% from Jan 2017 to $2.85In the December 2016 quarter, it missed estimates, following that up with a beat in the March quarter and a match in the June quarter, so not a great track record just yet.However, given the capital intensive nature of the business, it's encouraging to note that the debt-to-total capital ratio is just 17.9% and that the company has a current ratio of 1.79X, a quick ratio of 0.96X and a book value per share of 7.0X.As far as valuation is concerned, the P/E based on forward 12 months earnings shows a median value of 11.2X for ICHR compared to 12.4X for the  and 17.9X for the S&P 500. (NYSE:  -  )Headquartered in Chungbuk, South Korea, MagnaChip Semiconductor Corporation operates as a designer and manufacturer of analog and mixed-signal semiconductor products for high-volume consumer applications. It operates through the Display Solutions, Power Solutions and Semiconductor Manufacturing Services segments. So in addition to consumer markets like LCD, LED and 3D televisions and displays, mobile PCs, and mobile communications and entertainment devices, it also offers specialty analog and mixed-signal foundry services for fabless semiconductor companies.While MagnaChip's 2017 earnings estimate continues to trend down, the estimate for 2018 is up 32.8% since March. This isn't surprising since management has more or less completed a big headcount reduction plan, most of the severance and other cost related to which has already been charged to profit and from which it's currently expected that there will be annualized cost savings in the $23-27 million range. The gross margin is also trending up although not much of this is falling to the bottom line yet because of necessary investments in opex.The valuation is also encouraging with the P/E based on forward 12 months earnings showing a median value of 12.5X for MX compared to 18.4X for the  and 17.9X for the S&P 500. (Nasdaq:  -  )Headquartered in Chandler, Arizona, Microchip Technology develops and manufactures specialized semiconductor products including microcontrollers, application-specific standard products (ASSPs) and related mixed-signal and memory products for embedded control applications. The company markets its products to the consumer, automotive, office automation, communications and industrial markets. There's an upward trend in its estimate revisions:2017 earnings estimate up 29.6% from Jan 2017 to $5.262018 earnings estimate up 22.2% from Jan 2017 to $5.67The surprise history shows that MCHP has consistently topped earnings estimates in each of the last four quarters at an average rate of 10.2%.Also, revenues have grown consistently over the last five years with both revenue and gross margin picking up momentum over the last few quarters. The company has been building operating leverage that could help it sustain the current rate of EBIT margin expansion. The per-share book value consequently jumped up in 2016 and appears to be stabilizing now. Encouragingly, this hasn't had a negative impact on the asset turnover, which continues to rise. Additionally, while debt levels jumped up in 2015 and in the first quarter or 2016, they have stabilized since. As a result, the debt to total capital ratio, which increased through 2015 and stabilized in 2016, is now coming down.On the valuation side, the stock is attractive because its P/E based on forward 12 months earnings shows a median value of 17.9X compared to 18.4X for the  and 17.9X for the S&P 500. (NYSE:  -  )Vishay Intertechnology of Malvern, Pennsylvania is a leading manufacturer and supplier of discrete passive and active electronic components, particularly resistors, capacitors, inductors, diodes and transistors. It offers one of the most comprehensive electronic component lines of any manufacturer in the U.S. or Europe. Its estimate revisions are trending up:2017 earnings estimate up 28.8% from Apr 2017 to $1.342018 earnings estimate up 65.8% from Apr 2017 to $1.41The company topped estimates in two of the last four quarters while doubling quarterly earnings over the last two years.Other encouraging numbers include a debt to total capital ratio of just 20.3%, a constantly improving return on assets of 5.2, a relatively steady book value per share of 11.8X and a growing per-share net cash of 4.8X.From the valuation perspective, Vishay is worth looking at because its P/E based on forward 12 months earnings shows a median value of 14.4X compared to 25.8X for the  and 17.9X for the S&P 500. (Nasdaq:  -  )Boise, Idaho-based Micron Technology has established itself as one of the leading providers of semiconductor memory solutions in the world, serving the computer and computer-peripheral manufacturing, consumer electronics, CAD/CAM, telecommunications, office automation, network and data processing, and graphics display markets.2017 earnings estimate up 108.1% from Jan 2017 to $4.622018 earnings estimate up 141.9% from Jan 2017 to $6.00The company topped estimates in each of the last four quarters at an average rate of 23.1%.Micron is seeing very strong demand, leading to solid revenue growth and even stronger gross profit growth. Opex is also stabilizing, leading to very strong growth in EBIT over the last few quarters. The company does have considerable debt, but the debt cap at a little over 40% is manageable.From the valuation perspective, Micron is attractive because its trailing twelve months P/S shows a median value of 2.0X compared to 2.1X for the  and 3.0X for the S&P 500.Since 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year. With compounding, rebalancing, and exclusive of fees, it can turn thousands into millions of dollars.This proven stock-picking system is grounded on a single big idea that can be fortune shaping and life changing. You can apply it to your portfolio starting today.Many are little publicized and fly under the Wall Street radar. They're virtually unknown to the general public. Yet today's 220 Zacks Rank #1 ""Strong Buys"" were generated by the stock-picking system that has nearly tripled the market from 1988 through 2015. Its average gain has been a stellar +26% per year.

"nvestors in Microchip Technology Inc (Symbol: MCHP) saw new options become available today, for the January 2020 expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 858 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the MCHP options chain for the new January 2020 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $87.50 strike price has a current bid of $11.50. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $87.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $76.00 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of MCHP, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $88.09/share today.Because the $87.50 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 59%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 13.14% return on the cash commitment, or 5.59% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Microchip Technology Inc, and highlighting in green where the $87.50 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $90.00 strike price has a current bid of $11.10. If an investor was to purchase shares of MCHP stock at the current price level of $88.09/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $90.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 14.77% if the stock gets called away at the January 2020 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if MCHP shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Microchip Technology Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing MCHP's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $90.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $90.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 45%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 12.60% boost of extra return to the investor, or 5.36% annualized, which we refer to as the  .The implied volatility in the put contract example is 26%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 29%. Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $88.09) to be 22%.

n Sep 6,  was upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Microchip recently reaffirmed its second- quarter guidance on the back of successful execution of its strategic initiatives, optimization of manufacturing operations and a favorable macro environment.Management expects fiscal second-quarter 2018 net sales to be approximately $1.00 billion, which reflects growth of approximately 3% on a sequential basis and 14.6% on a year-over-year basis. Earnings are anticipated to be in the range of $1.33-$1.37 per share for the quarter.Notably, the company's last reported quarter results were impressive. Adjusted earnings of $1.31 per share were up 56% year over year and 12.9% sequentially. The figure exceeded the company's expectations. The top line also saw a massive improvement with a 15.2% surge from the year-ago quarter and 7.7% sequential growth to $972.1 million.Accelerating demand for the company's products led to the better-than-expected results, which along with an encouraging guidance drove shares. Microchip stock has gained 36.8% year to date, substantially outperforming the 20.3% rally of the  it belongs to.Microchip's microcontroller business is one of the key catalysts behind the company's robust performance. Strong demand of 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers drove the 9.5% sequential and 18.1% year-on-year growth of the segment, which constituted 65.4% of the revenues. The company's acquisition of Atmel in April 2016 has enriched its microcontroller product portfolio, which aids its bottom line.Additionally, new products such as PIC32MX1/2 XLP and MOST-based Intelligent Network Interface controllers are anticipated to expand its customer base. Efficient operations are also expected to boost margins. | We believe the company's initiatives to bridge the gap between lead time, inventory and backlog will be further beneficial for earnings and revenues in the near to middle term. Management expects the balance to be reached by the middle of calendar year 2018.Stocks worth considering in the broader tech space are Applied Optoelectronics, Inc.  , Applied Materials, Inc.  and Micron Technology, Inc.  . All three stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see The long-term earnings growth rate for Applied Optoelectronics, Applied Materials and Micron are projected to be 17.5%, 17.1% and 10% respectively.Tech stocks have been a major force behind the market's record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough. There's a simple way to invest in the success of the entire sector. Zacks has just released a Special Report revealing one thing tech companies literally cannot function without. More importantly, it reveals 4 top stocks set to skyrocket on increasing demand for these devices.

ooking today at week-over-week shares outstanding changes among the universe of ETFs covered at  , one standout is the PowerShares Dynamic Market Portfolio (Symbol: PWC) where we have detected an approximate $43.7 million dollar outflow -- that's a 23.3% decrease week over week (from 2,150,000 to 1,650,000). Among the largest underlying components of PWC, in trading today Microchip Technology Inc (Symbol: MCHP) is trading flat, Western Digital Corp (Symbol: WDC) is down about 0.8%, and KEMET Corp. (Symbol: KEM) is lower by about 5.5%.  The chart below shows the one year price performance of PWC, versus its 200 day moving average:Looking at the chart above, PWC's low point in its 52 week range is $72.22 per share, with $89.11 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $87.18. Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@PowerShares Dynamic Market Portfolio Experiences Big Outflow@2017-09-07@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/powershares-dynamic-market-portfolio-experiences-big-outflow-2017-09-07

"ne of the strongest corners of the market this year has been the semiconductors industry. Throughout the chip-making market, companies have successfully adapted to the changing needs of the consumer, including an increased demand for small, high-powered chips that enable ""Internet of Things"" (IoT) devices.For those that don't know, the Internet of Things is the growing world of interconnected household and industrial devices. Everyday products and machines can now be embedded with sensor technology to process data or interact with other electronic devices.For example, consumer-level IoT products include things like Amazon's  Echo ""smart speaker,"" wearable motion and activity tracking products, and advanced in-car technology. On the commercial side of the IoT market, industrial manufacturers have begun implementing sensors into machines to track performance and efficiency.As demand for the microchips that power these IoT devices continues to grow, semiconductor manufacturers with a focus on IoT products will continue to benefit. With that said, we've found three already-strong stocks that are looking to benefit even more from further IoT growth.Cypress Semiconductor is a leading provider of high-performance digital and mixed-signal integrated circuits. Just last year, the company shelled out $550 million to acquire Broadcom's Wireless Internet of Things business and now its ""WICED"" Platform is one of the largest IoT portfolios in the industry. The stock is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which pairs well with its ""B"" grade for Growth in our Style Scores system. Our current consensus estimates are calling for EPS growth of 65% this fiscal year, and that expansion is expected to continue with 41% EPS growth in the next fiscal year. Cypress also pays an impressive 3.20% dividend.Although you might recognize the brand because of its calculators, Texas Instruments is actually one of the leading suppliers of advanced semiconductors in the world. The company's IoT profile falls under its Embedded Processors division, which includes the Connectivity, Microcontrollers, and Processors categories. In its most recent earnings report, Texas Instruments saw growth of 15% in its Embedded Processors segment, and that's not to mention that it once again surpassed our consensus estimates for earnings and revenue. Texas Instruments is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), and on top of this, the company pays a nice 2.44% dividend.Microchip Technology is a manufacturer of microcontroller, memory, and analog chips. The company is a leader in several IoT-related fields, including automotive and wireless connectivity. Right now, Microchip is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and we've seen multiple positive revisions to the company's current-year and next-year earnings estimates. The stock also has an ""A"" grade for Growth. According to our current consensus estimates, Microchip is set to report earnings and revenue growth rates of 32% and 16%, respectively, this year. Microchip's current cash flow growth is more than 57%, and the company pays a respectable 1.67% dividend.The Internet of Things is one of the most exciting emerging tech markets in the world. Home automation products are fun. In-car technology is cool.And while these specific products are interesting, the real moneymakers in these situations are the companies that are building the tech that powers these products. The Internet of Things needs semiconductors to function, and as the IoT grows, so too will semiconductor companies.The best way for investors to cash in on this growing trend is to identify semiconductor companies that are not only investing in the Internet of Things, but are also displaying solid fundamentals and impressive Zacks metrics.Tech stocks have been a major force behind the market's record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough. There's a simple way to invest in the success of the entire sector. Zacks has just released a Special Report revealing  .More importantly, it reveals 4 top stocks set to skyrocket on increasing demand for these devices.

"s today's market rally shows, stocks still want to move higher. If it weren't for North Korea and domestic politics, then no one would even be worried about the ""fear gauge"". Instead, we'd be talking about the fantastic earnings season we just had, or the improving jobs picture, or the Fed taking its sweet time in raising rates. If you can keep your head while all your fellow investors are losing theirs, then there is still plenty of money to be made.Therefore, the  screen is as lucrative as ever. This is a tool that looks for Zacks Rank #1s (Strong Buys) that have a Zacks Style Score of ""A"" for Growth and projected EPS growth of 20% or more. If the market is going to keep chopping around as it moves higher, then these stocks could make sure you're always prepared for the dips and rallies.Today's article has three stocks from this screen that were beating the market when stocks were soaring, and should continue to do so regardless of which way the tides take us next.It's always great when a stock beats the market (which is what this screen is all about), but it's even better when it eclipses its own highly-ranked industry. The electronics - manufacturing machinery space is already outperforming the market with a gain of nearly 22% this year...and Ultra Clean Holdings (UCTT) has left its own industry in the dust. The company, which develops systems for the semiconductor equipment and flat panel industries, has soared approximately 140% this year!Late last month, UCTT announced its fifth straight positive surprise (and 12th out of the last 13) with second-quarter earnings of 62 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 24%. It now has a four-quarter average beat of 27.7%. Revenue skyrocketed by nearly 76% from last year to $228.3 million; the Zacks Consensus Estimate was only calling for $213 million.Earnings estimates have taken off over the past month because UCTT offered a third-quarter guidance that was well ahead of expectations. The company expects earnings per share between 62 cents and 68 cents for the quarter, while we were only expecting around 39 cents at the time. The revenue guidance of $235 million to $245 million was also well in front of Zacks expectations at $193 million.Given such an overshoot in the guidance, it's no surprise that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter soared more than 68%. The outlooks for this year and next year are also on the rise. At the moment, we expect UCTT to earn $2.22 per share this year, marking an advance of 29% in the past month as all four analysts raised their estimates. It's also up 6.2% in just the past week. As for next year, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.30 has gained 20.4% in 30 days and 3.1% in 7 days. | Back on June 5, Microchip Technology (MCHP) offered an updated guidance for its fiscal first quarter…which it completely trounced earlier this month with the official release. The company, a provider of microcontroller, mixed signal, analog and Flash-IP solutions, has been reporting better-than-expected releases for two years now, and is outperforming its industry with a year-to-date improvement of practically 29%.MCHP was expecting non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.22 and $1.26, but it ended up being $1.31. The result also bettered the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6.5% while soaring 56% from last year. Net sales jumped 15.2% from last year to $972.1 million, which again was ahead of the company's guidance at $943.3 million to $956.8 million. The company stated that this quarterly performance represents an acceleration of our organic growth with its Microchip 2.0 initiative.The company expects fiscal second quarter earnings per share between $1.33 and $1.37. At the moment, the Zacks Consensus is right in the middle at $1.35, having advanced more than 7% in the past month. Net sales are forecasted to make it all the way $1.001.3 billion, which marks a 14.6% improvement on a year-over-year basis.Earnings estimates have moved upward in the past 30 days with strong agreement among the analysts. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this year (ending March 2018) is at $5.26 per share right now, or nearly 7% better than a month earlier. Seven of the 9 covering analysts contributed to this enhancement by raising their expectations. As for next year (ending March 2019), analysts see earnings per share of $5.67, marking an advance of 6.8% in 30 days. Again, agreement was strong as 6 of 8 covering analysts raised their estimates. | All you need is one look at the momentum displayed by Arista Networks (ANET) and you know that this company is at the cutting edge of something big. In this case, ANET is a leader in software-driven cloud networking solutions for large datacenter and computer environments. It has been a public company for only about three years now, and it has never missed quarterly earnings expectations.Earlier this month, it reported earnings of $1.34 per share for the second quarter, which was more than 41% better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate and marked a four-quarter average beat of 22.8%. That makes 13 straight quarters of positive surprises. The result also beat last year by an impressive 81.1%. Revenues soared by 50.8% to $405.2 million thanks to the expanding cloud networking market amid rising demand for scalable infrastructure.Shares of ANET have soared nearly 78% so far in 2017, reaching into the $170 range. Looking toward the third quarter, the company expects revenue between $405 million and $420 million. But it's not just investors or management that are expecting big things moving forward, analysts have been raising earnings estimates sharply since its earnings report. For both 2017 and 2018, eleven of 12 covering analysts boosted their expectations.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this year has jumped 17% in the past 30 days to $4.66 per share. Then, analysts expect earnings to jump nearly 15% more to $5.35 per share next year. That consensus is up 14.3% in the past month. | Since 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year. With compounding, rebalancing, and exclusive of fees, it can turn thousands into millions of dollars.But here's something even more remarkable: You can master this proven system without going to a single class or seminar.

The stock has gained 63.5% year to date, substantially outperforming the 17.4% rally of the  it belongs to.The momentum can be attributed to AppFolio's consistent results as well as positive 2017 guidance. We note that the company has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the four quarters with an average positive surprise of 291.24%.Moreover, following the results, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 surged from a penny to 15 cents over the last 30 days. Estimate for 2018 also jumped from 11 cents to 23 cents per share over the same period.Currently, AppFolio carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see Notably, the company has a market cap of $1.32 billion.In the recently concluded second-quarter 2017, AppFolio reported earnings of 8 cents per share, which was well ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of a penny. The company had reported a loss of 7 cents in the year-ago quarter.The significant improvement was attributed to strong revenues, which surged almost 37% to $35.9 million. The figure was also better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate. | Following the results, AppFolio raised its 2017 revenue guidance. The company now projects revenues in the range of $138-$139 million, up from previous guidance range of $136-$138 million.AppFolio offers cloud-based software solutions for property management and legal industry verticals. The company's expanding customer base - 10,800 property manager and 9,000 legal customers - at the end of the second quarter is the key driver.AppFolio's Value+ services revenues jumped 43%, driven by increased usage of electronics payment platform and screening services.Appfolio is highly focused on product and technology innovation. The company's software applications, Appfolio Property Manager and MyCase, are aiding it to further leverage cloud-based business software solutions. The company is continuously enhancing product features per customer specifications, which is expected to expand its customer base further.However, intense competition in the cloud-based business software solutions space remains a concern.Microchip  , Applied Optoelectronics  and FormFactor  are other stocks in the broad technology sector, which sport the same Zacks Rank as that of AppFolio (APPF).Long-term earnings growth for Microchip, Applied Optoelectronics and FormFactor is currently pegged at 8%, 18.75% and 16%, respectively.Since 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

bout a month has gone by since the last earnings report for  . Shares have added about 7.2% in that time frame, outperforming the market.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a pullback?

"One of the strongest corners of the market this year has been the semiconductors industry. Throughout the chip-making market, companies have successfully adapted to the changing needs of the consumer, including an increased demand for small, high-powered chips that enable ""Internet of Things"" (IoT) devices.For those that don't know, the Internet of Things is the growing world of interconnected household and industrial devices. Everyday products and machines can now be embedded with sensor technology to process data or interact with other electronic devices.For example, consumer-level IoT products include things like Amazon's () Echo ""smart speaker,"" wearable motion and activity tracking products, and advanced in-car technology. On the commercial side of the IoT market, industrial manufacturers have begun implementing sensors into machines to track performance and efficiency.As demand for the microchips that power these IoT devices continues to grow, semiconductor manufacturers with a focus on IoT products will continue to benefit. With that said, we've found three already-strong stocks that are looking to benefit even more from further IoT growth. (NASDAQ:  )Microchip Technology is a manufacturer of microcontroller, memory, and analog chips. The company is a leader in several IoT-related fields, including automotive and wireless connectivity. Right now, Microchip is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), and our current consensus estimates are calling for EPS growth of 31% and revenue growth of 11% this quarter. The company will now look to continue the momentum it has maintained with its 9.7% earnings beat in the most recent quarter, which included record sales figures. Shares of MCHP are already up over 25% this year, and the stock could climb higher with even more positive results. (NASDAQ:  ) Cypress Semiconductor is a leading provider of high-performance digital and mixed-signal integrated circuits. Just last year, the company shelled out $550 million to acquire Broadcom's Wireless Internet of Things business and now its ""WICED"" Platform is one of the largest IoT portfolios in the industry. Cypress is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which pairs well with its ""B"" grade for Growth and ""A"" grade for Momentum in our Style Scores system. This is another stock that is up nearly 25% year-to-date, although a recent dip could allow investors a fresh opportunity to buy at a slight discount. (NASDAQ:  )Although you might recognize the brand because of its calculators, Texas Instruments is actually one of the leading suppliers of advanced semiconductors in the world. The company's IoT profile falls under its Embedded Processors division, which includes the Connectivity, Microcontrollers, and Processors categories. In its most recent earnings report, Texas Instruments saw growth of 15% in its Embedded Processors segment, and that's not to mention that it once again surpassed our consensus estimates for earnings and revenue. Texas Instruments is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The Internet of Things is one of the most exciting emerging tech markets in the world. Home automation products are fun. In-car technology is cool.And while these specific products are interesting, the real moneymakers in these situations are the companies that are building the tech that powers these products. The Internet of Things needs semiconductors to function, and as the IoT grows, so too will semiconductor companies.The best way for investors to cash in on this growing trend is to identify semiconductor companies that are not only investing in the Internet of Things, but are also displaying solid fundamentals and impressive Zacks metrics.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@3 Stocks to Buy Now to Get In Early on the Internet of Things@2017-08-08@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-stocks-to-buy-now-to-get-in-early-on-the-internet-of-things-2017-08-08
ooking at the universe of stocks we cover at  , on 8/17/17, Microchip Technology Inc (Symbol: MCHP), Ryder System, Inc. (Symbol: R), and BWX Technologies inc (Symbol: BWXT) will all trade ex-dividend for their respective upcoming dividends. Microchip Technology Inc will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.362 on 9/5/17, Ryder System, Inc. will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.46 on 9/15/17, and BWX Technologies inc will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.11 on 9/8/17. As a percentage of MCHP's recent stock price of $83.73, this dividend works out to approximately 0.43%, so look for shares of Microchip Technology Inc to trade 0.43% lower - all else being equal - when MCHP shares open for trading on 8/17/17. Similarly, investors should look for R to open 0.62% lower in price and for BWXT to open 0.20% lower, all else being equal.Below are dividend history charts for MCHP, R, and BWXT, showing historical dividends prior to the most recent ones declared. : : :In general, dividends are not always predictable, following the ups and downs of company profits over time. Therefore, a good first due diligence step in forming an expectation of annual yield going forward, is looking at the history above, for a sense of stability over time. This can help in judging whether the most recent dividends from these companies are likely to continue. If they do continue, the current estimated yields on annualized basis would be 1.73% for Microchip Technology Inc, 2.48% for Ryder System, Inc., and 0.81% for BWX Technologies inc.In Tuesday trading, Microchip Technology Inc shares are currently off about 0.3%, Ryder System, Inc. shares are up about 0.2%, and BWX Technologies inc shares are up about 0.2% on the day.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Ex-Dividend Reminder: Microchip Technology, Ryder System and BWX Technologies@2017-08-15@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ex-dividend-reminder-microchip-technology-ryder-system-and-bwx-technologies-2017-08-15

"ne of the strongest corners of the market this year has been the semiconductors industry. Throughout the chip-making market, companies have successfully adapted to the changing needs of the consumer, including an increased demand for small, high-powered chips that enable ""Internet of Things"" (IoT) devices.For those that don't know, the Internet of Things is the growing world of interconnected household and industrial devices. Everyday products and machines can now be embedded with sensor technology to process data or interact with other electronic devices.For example, consumer-level IoT products include things like Amazon's (AMZN) Echo ""smart speaker,"" wearable motion and activity tracking products, and advanced in-car technology. On the commercial side of the IoT market, industrial manufacturers have begun implementing sensors into machines to track performance and efficiency.As demand for the microchips that power these IoT devices continues to grow, semiconductor manufacturers with a focus on IoT products will continue to benefit. With that said, we've found three already-strong stocks that are looking to benefit even more from further IoT growth.Microchip Technology is a manufacturer of microcontroller, memory, and analog chips. The company is a leader in several IoT-related fields, including automotive and wireless connectivity. Right now, Microchip is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), and our current consensus estimates are calling for EPS growth of 31% and revenue growth of 11% this quarter. The company will now look to continue the momentum it has maintained with its 9.7% earnings beat in the most recent quarter, which included record sales figures. Shares of MCHP are already up over 25% this year, and the stock could climb higher with even more positive results.Cypress Semiconductor is a leading provider of high-performance digital and mixed-signal integrated circuits. Just last year, the company shelled out $550 million to acquire Broadcom's Wireless Internet of Things business and now its ""WICED"" Platform is one of the largest IoT portfolios in the industry. Cypress is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which pairs well with its ""B"" grade for Growth and ""A"" grade for Momentum in our Style Scores system. This is another stock that is up nearly 25% year-to-date, although a recent dip could allow investors a fresh opportunity to buy at a slight discount.Although you might recognize the brand because of its calculators, Texas Instruments is actually one of the leading suppliers of advanced semiconductors in the world. The company's IoT profile falls under its Embedded Processors division, which includes the Connectivity, Microcontrollers, and Processors categories. In its most recent earnings report, Texas Instruments saw growth of 15% in its Embedded Processors segment, and that's not to mention that it once again surpassed our consensus estimates for earnings and revenue. Texas Instruments is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The Internet of Things is one of the most exciting emerging tech markets in the world. Home automation products are fun. In-car technology is cool.And while these specific products are interesting, the real moneymakers in these situations are the companies that are building the tech that powers these products. The Internet of Things needs semiconductors to function, and as the IoT grows, so too will semiconductor companies.The best way for investors to cash in on this growing trend is to identify semiconductor companies that are not only investing in the Internet of Things, but are also displaying solid fundamentals and impressive Zacks metrics.It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it.

The figure was better than management's  guidance range of $1.22-$1.26.The strong growth was also driven by higher net sales, which surged 15.2% from the year-ago quarter to $972.1 million. On a sequential basis, net sales increased 7.7%.Microchip provided positive guidance for the second quarter based on robust demand for its products. The stock has gained 25.8% year to date, substantially outperforming the 13.7% rally of the  it belongs to.In terms of product line, microcontroller business (65.4% of net sales) increased 9.5% sequentially driven by robust demand for 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers. On a year-over-year basis revenues increased 18.1%, benefitting from the addition of Atmel's product portfolio.Analog sales (24.6% of net sales) increased 3.7% from the previous quarter. Revenues were negatively impacted by capacity constraint at Atmel.

Europe and Americas contributed 23.2% and 18.8%, respectively.Microchip posted non-GAAP gross margin of 60.4%, which expanded 460 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis and 150 bps sequentially. The figure was better than management's expectation of 60%.Non-GAAP operating expenses, as percentage of revenues, declined from 28.4% in the year-ago quarter to 22.9% in the reported quarter. The decline was primarily due to lower research & development (R&D) and selling, general & administrative (SG&A), which declined 320 bps and 230 bps, respectively.As a result, non-GAAP operating margin expanded to 37.5% in the reported quarter from 27.4% in the year-ago quarter and 33.1% in the previous quarter. The figure was well above the high-end of the management's guidance of 37%.

Distributor inventory at 31 days was also on the lower end of the company's normal range.Leverage continues to improve with net debt-to-EBITDA at 1.58 down from 1.94 at the end of the March quarter.Microchip forecasts second-quarter fiscal 2018 net sales to be $1,001.3 billion, which reflects approximately 3% growth on a sequential basis and 14.6% on a year-over-year basis.Gross margin was anticipated to in the range of 60.5-60.75%, operating expenses as percentage of 22.5-23% and operating margin 37.5-38.25%.Earnings are anticipated to be in the range of $1.33-$1.37 per share for the quarter. Atmel is forecasted to contribute 18-22 cents per share.Microchip's inventory days at Sep 30, are expected to be 99 to 101 days. Capital expenditure is estimated to be approximately $70 million. Net cash generated in the quarter is anticipated to be $230-$250 million.Management expects net debt-to-EBITDA to be under 1.3 by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2018.For fiscal 2018, capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $180 million up $10 million from the previous guidance.Microchip forecasts annual growth expectations of high single digit growth over the long term.Microchip carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). MaxLinear  , Applied Optoelectronics  and Infineon  are other top ranked stocks in the broader technology sector. All the three companies sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see MaxLinear, Applied Optoelectronics and Infineon have a long-term earnings growth rate of 17.50%, 18.75% and 15.45%, respectively.It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the Semiconductor ETF (Symbol: SMH), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $94.34 per unit.With SMH trading at a recent price near $84.39 per unit, that means that analysts see 11.79% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of SMH's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Microchip Technology Inc (Symbol: MCHP), Qorvo Inc (Symbol: QRVO), and Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (Symbol: SWKS). Although MCHP has traded at a recent price of $81.24/share, the average analyst target is 16.20% higher at $94.40/share. Similarly, QRVO has 14.80% upside from the recent share price of $67.77 if the average analyst target price of $77.80/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting SWKS to reach a target price of $116.18/share, which is 14.35% above the recent price of $101.60. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of MCHP, QRVO, and SWKS:Combined, MCHP, QRVO, and SWKS represent 8.69% of the Semiconductor ETF. Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
  
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@SMH's Underlying Holdings Could Mean 12% Gain Potential@2017-08-11@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/smhs-underlying-holdings-could-mean-12-gain-potential-2017-08-11
ith several interesting trends like the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence on the rise, it is an exciting time to be investing in the technology sector. What's more, it is also a profitable time to be a tech-focused investor, as this space has been among the strongest performing sectors all year.And while the behemoths like Microsoft  and Apple  may hog all the headlines, it's really been the companies powering their technologies-the semiconductor manufacturers-that have had a strong year on the markets.Indeed, as our Computer and Technology  has gained nearly 13% year-to-date, semiconductor companies have been a driving factor behind its growth. The aforementioned emerging tech trends have created new consumer demand, and the semiconductor makers are delivering.Luckily, the proven Zacks stock picking methods are effective across all industries. Check out these Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) semiconductor stocks right now:Lam Research is a designer and manufacturer of semiconductor processing equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits. The company is recognized as a leading supplier of front-end wafer processing equipment to the worldwide semiconductor industry.In its latest report, Lam posted earnings of $2.80 per share and revenue of $2.15 billion, beating our respective consensus estimates of $2.54 and $2.13 billion. The company will wrap up its fiscal year in the current quarter, and our consensus estimates call for full-year totals to mark EPS growth of 57% and sales growth of 36%. Looking ahead, we've already seen Lam's next-year EPS estimates gain more than 27% over the past 90 days.Microchp Technology is a manufacturer of microcontroller, memory, and analog chips. The company is a leader in several IoT-related fields, including automotive and wireless connectivity. MCHP shares have gained more than 50% over the past year, but this stock could be poised to break even higher given the right catalyst, and might have just that.Indeed, last month, the company upped its sales and EPS guidance for 1Q18, sending shares soaring. Furthermore, our current consensus estimates are calling for EPS growth of 26% and revenue growth of 12% this fiscal year. It's also important to note that some of Microchip's other key metrics, including its cash flow growth of 57% and RoE of 24%, are significantly better than their respective industry averages.Micron is one of the leading worldwide providers of semiconductor memory solutions. The company's memory solutions are marketed towards customers in a variety of industries, including computer manufacturing, consumer electronics, and telecommunications.Micron's revenues in the most recent quarter jumped 92.1% on a year-over-year basis to $5.566 billion and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.370 billion. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to strong DRAM pricing environment and favorable product mix. This is also a rare value pick in the tech space, with an impressive P/E of 7.38, as well as a P/S of 1.67 and a PEG of 0.74.Here's another stock idea to consider.

Shutterstock photoTalk about hot! Brian Demain is lead manager of $14.2 billion Janus Henderson Enterprise (  ), which is an  . So is the fund's twin, $1 billion Aspen Enterprise (  ), of which he also is skipper.[ibd-display-video id=2068635 width=50 float=left autostart=true] The portfolios won Best Funds honors by outperforming the S&P 500 in four time periods ended Dec. 31 - the trailing one, three, five and 10 years.And they did so in not just one category but in three - diversified equity mutual funds, growth mutual funds and midcap mutual funds.That put them into a small group of gems. A mere 44 U.S. diversified stock mutual funds, out of 1,104 with assets of at least $100 million, prevailed as winners across those four time spans.Demain and Cody Wheaton run the funds with little turnover, just 20% now, according to Morningstar Inc. Among both portfolios' holdings are  (  ),  (  ),  (  ),  (ST) and  (AMTD). All are either forming basing patterns or in buy ranges.Enterprise is open to investors who already own shares. It's also open to old or new shareholders in 401(k) plans that already offer the fund, as well as to old or new investor clients of a wirehouse brokerage that offers the identical strategy through a separately managed account. Twin sister Aspen Enterprise can be bought by old or new investors through some insurance companies.A midcap fund at Janus Henderson that is still open to new investors is $4 billion Mid Cap Value (JMIVX).Demain, who is 40 years old, talked about his investment approach and several key stock holdings in a recent interview with IBD: Brian, summarize your investment approach. First, we look for what we call sustainable growth. We want companies that are growth companies today and will be three, five, seven years from now. They may not be the fastest growers, but they can grow for the long term.Second, we're looking for companies with sustainably high returns on invested capital. It's great if a company can grow. But if it's not earning high returns on invested capital, it's not increasing shareholder value. So we try to understand a company's competitive advantage, because that's what will drive its long-term return on invested capital.Third, we care about the quality of a company's management team. We like management teams that focus on the right areas, and that are good leaders.If we find companies that meet those three criteria and we can buy them at attractive valuations and hold them for the long term, we can outperform our peers. The fund's performance is consistent, as shown by its being an IBD Best Mutual Funds Awards winner. Is the key its outperformance during up markets or during down markets? We've generally been able to keep up in up markets and outperform in down markets. We try to have a predicted beta (a measurement of volatility relative to the market or benchmark) against our Russell MidCap Growth Index benchmark of between 0.85 and 1, so we have less absolute risk than the benchmark. But it's higher than 0.85, because we don't want to only outperform in a down market. That's where we want to shine, but we do OK in up markets as well. Why do you like midcaps? They're not as mature as large caps, so they have real growth opportunities ahead of them. But their business models are more established than small caps'.Many have withstood competitive challenges, which small caps may not have. But they tend to be less volatile than small caps. You've got about 70% of your assets in the technology, industrials and health care sectors. Why do you expect to find so many opportunities in those spaces? With tech and health care, it is the power of innovation. In tech, we've been overweight in hardware and semiconductors. The mobile internet is driving semiconductor growth. And we're seeing a lot of innovation in software pushing itself into our lives.In health, we own biotechs, pharmaceuticals, life-science tools and diagnostic companies. Aging baby boomers and an emerging middle class globally are driving innovations in drug development and diagnostics. You've noted that corporate tax cuts, infrastructure spending and deregulation may not occur as fast as many investors have hoped. How have you hedged your bets on those areas? Take tax cuts. Sensata is a Netherlands domiciled company (which makes sensors for aircraft, cars and other products) but it does business in the U.S. It pays a low tax rate because of where it is domiciled, so it will not benefit from lower U.S. rates.We also own TD Ameritrade (which is a brokerage). It pays a full tax rate, so if there's reform it will benefit. But policy changes can cut both ways. Ameritrade also benefits from rising interest rates. It sweeps clients' cash balances into TD Bank and earns more money on that spread as rates rise. And we own Crown Castle (a REIT that owns wireless cell towers). It has high levels of borrowing, so it will be hurt by high interest rates. (LRCX) must be one of your semiconductor plays. Describe it, please. They are a semiconductor capital equipment manufacturer. In the last few years, we've gone from everything being etched on one plane of each microchip to effectively stacked layers on chips. So a lot of growth has gone to etching deposition players like Lam.In addition, demand in the memory market is robust. That's driven by uptake in solid-state drives. We're going from the old disk drives to solid-state flash-driven drives. That demands lots of chips, which is good for Lam.And we like their valuation. The stock trades at 13.5 times forward earnings. If you back out their cash, it is close to 12 times. The market's multiple is north of 18 times. And several high quality semiconductor companies are trading at 20 times. (CELG) is best known for Revlimid, its blood-cancer treatment. Do you like its other products? You're right, Revlimid is its workhorse and continues to grow due to longer treatment duration and finding new patients. But what do they do after Revlimid goes off-patent in 2026?The outlook for three other Celgene products - Pomalyst, Otezla and Abraxane - is constructive. And we're excited about its pipeline of new (treatments). Also, they've done business development deals with cash from Revlimid to build emerging franchises in gastroenterology and immunology, and inflammation and immunology. Those things should make the 2026 patent cliff for Revlimid a manageable event. Microchip Technology's earnings per share growth has accelerated for six quarters in a row. Does your thesis revolve around the fact that their chips are used in a variety of products? The majority of their revenue is from microcontrollers, which are very simple computers that can go into all sorts of devices from airplanes to microwave ovens to kids' toys. That has great growth dynamics, which is a function of the growth of the Internet of Things. That's the company's sustainable growth.That business has a very fragmented customer base. You're not just selling a ton of chips to one customer like  (AAPL). You're selling to thousands of end markets. That's their competitive advantage.As for a good management team, the company is led by Steve Sanghi. We have high regard for his value creation. The company recently acquired Atmel, which was a large microcontroller competitor. It had good assets, but was poorly managed. Sanghi has improved operating margins and driven strong earnings growth. And valuation is not that demanding at about 15 times forward earnings. How does  (SSNC) illustrate your investment approach? This is another example of sustainable growth plus competitive advantage plus strong management. SS&C provides back-office services for financial companies. As asset management matures, more companies want to focus on their core competencies. Rather than run back offices in-house, they look to outsource. And once they are embedded with a customer, other departments at the customer may outsource to them as well.SS&C is run by Bill Stone, who has a proven record of value creation. And their valuation is reasonable. earnings per share growth has sped up. Why? Think of  (V) and  (MA) as electronic payment highways. Global Payments is the on- and offramp. They have relationships with merchants who accept credit card terminals. If you run a restaurant, for example, Global gives you software that not only accepts credit cards but also helps you run your restaurant. And Global has benefited from consolidation. What makes  (HEIA), which designs and repairs parts for aircraft and engines, attractive to you? Only certain approved suppliers can sell parts to airlines. Planes are in service for 25, 30 years, and need servicing. But only a relatively small number of companies have parts-manufacturing approval (PMA) from the Federal Aviation Administration and the European (regulatory) body. The FAA has (limited resources) and can only approve so many parts per year. Heico has the best position in the PMA market. They earn healthy margins.Also, the Mendelson family owns a large percentage of the company. It's most of their liquid net worth, so they care a lot about creating shareholder value, so we like to partner with them. What's driven the share-price uptrend by contact-lens developer  (COO)? We like their sustainable growth. Contact lens are a growing category as contacts get more comfortable. They also benefit from international growth.There are only four players: Bausch & Lomb,  (JNJ), Alcon and Cooper. Once a consumer picks one, they usually stick with it and won't change because of a small price difference. Why is index operator MSCI attractive? The way to think about them is that they benefit from the growth of ETFs. An active manager like Janus Henderson pays a fixed fee for access to a benchmark operator. For MSCI, when a fee dollar moves from an active to a passive fund, that dollar becomes more profitable.And once you are a standard index, it is hard (for users) to change. By the way, any plans to reopen Enterprise Fund to all investors? No, we are managing $18 billion (including money in Aspen Enterprise and in separately managed accounts using Enterprise's strategy). It makes us one of the larger midcap strategies. Our first priority is working on behalf of existing clients. They think being closed is in their best interests and that's why we've done this.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Top Fund's Picks Include Stocks Within Buy Ranges Like Global Payments@2017-08-04@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/top-funds-picks-include-stocks-within-buy-ranges-global-payments-2017-08-04

 is set to release first-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings on Aug 3. We note that on average the company has delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the trailing four quarters, including an impressive beat of 11.11% in the last quarter.Moreover, adjusted earnings (excluding stock-based compensation) advanced 65.7% year over year and 10.5% sequentially to $1.16 per share in the quarter. The strong growth was driven by higher net sales, which surged 58.8% from the year-ago quarter to $902.7 million. On a sequential basis, net sales increased almost 2.4%.Meanwhile, the company  sales and earnings guidance for the going-to-be-reported quarter in early June. The company now forecasts non-GAAP net sales to be in the range of 4.5-6% (mid-point at 5.25%) as compared with earlier guidance range of 2-7% (mid-point at 4.5%), up on a sequential basis.Further, non-GAAP earnings are now expected to be in the range of $1.22-$1.26 per share, as compared with previous guided range of $1.17-$1.27. | Microchip's stock has gained 24.8% year to date, substantially outperforming the 15.6% rally of the  it belongs to. The outperformance is driven by consistent results as well as the revised guidance that reflects product portfolio strength.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Microchip's microcontroller business (64.3% of fourth-quarter revenues) continues to outperform the industry and has enabled it to gain significant market share. Moreover, the company's microcontroller business is evidently benefiting from the addition of Atmel's product portfolio (5 cents incremental benefit in the last quarter), which it acquired in Apr 2016.We believe that newly launched products like PIC32MX1/2 XLP and MOST-based Intelligent Network Interface controllers will continue to expand customer base. Moreover, improving operating efficiency and leverage will boost gross margin in the going-to-be reported quarter.However, our proven model does not conclusively show that Microchip is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below. : Microchip's Earnings ESP is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.14 per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . : Microchip carries a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some stocks which, as per our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Broadcom  has an Earnings ESP of +2.57% and sports a Zacks Rank #1. You can see  .NetEase  has an Earnings ESP of +0.25% and carries a Zacks Rank #2.CACI International  has an Earnings ESP of +1.83% and carries a Zacks Rank #2.Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"What is the 'Internet of Things,' really? In a nutshell, it's just connected technology - and that means chipmakers who specialized in connected technology are poised to profit.One of the strongest corners of the market this year has been the semiconductors industry. Throughout the chip-making market, companies have successfully adapted to the changing needs of the consumer, including an increased demand for small, high-powered chips that enable ""Internet of Things"" (IoT) devices.For those that don't know, the Internet of Things is the growing world of interconnected household and industrial devices. Everyday products and machines can now be embedded with sensor technology to process data or interact with other electronic devices.For example, consumer-level IoT products include things like  (NASDAQ:AMZN) Echo ""smart speaker,"" wearable motion and activity tracking products, and advanced in-car technology. On the commercial side of the IoT market, industrial manufacturers have begun implementing sensors into machines to track performance and efficiency.As demand for the microchips that power these IoT devices continues to grow, semiconductor manufacturers with a focus on IoT products will continue to benefit. With that said, we've found three already-strong stocks that are looking to benefit even more from further IoT growth. (NASDAQ:  )Marvell Technology is a leading designer, developer and supplier of mixed-signal and digital signal processing integrated circuits. The company's ""EZ-Connect"" platform is used by a variety of global customers in the home automation, wearables, automotive, and industrial industries. After Marvell surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 25% in its most recent quarter, estimate revisions began pouring in for the company's current-quarter and full-year earnings. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for Marvell's full-year earnings calls for EPS growth of more than 118%. This has helped the stock gain a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). (NASDAQ:  )Microchp Technology is a manufacturer of microcontroller, memory, and analog chips. The company is a leader in several IoT-related fields, including automotive and wireless connectivity. This is another Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, and our current consensus estimates are calling for EPS growth of 26% and revenue growth of 12% this fiscal year. Shares are up over 30% year-to-date, but this stock could break even higher given the right catalyst, and it might have just that. Indeed, last month, the company upped its sales and EPS guidance for 1Q18, sending shares higher. (NASDAQ:  )Cypress Semiconductor is a leading provider of high-performance digital and mixed-signal integrated circuits. Just last year, the company shelled out $550 million to acquire Broadcom's Wireless Internet of Things business and now its ""WICED"" Platform is one of the largest IoT portfolios in the industry. Cypress is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), which pairs very well with its ""A"" grades for Growth and Momentum in our Style Scores system.The Internet of Things is one of the most exciting emerging tech markets in the world. Home automation products are fun. In-car technology is cool.And while these specific products are interesting, the real moneymakers in these situations are the companies that are building the tech that powers these products. The Internet of Things needs semiconductors to function, and as the IoT grows, so too will semiconductor companies.The best way for investors to cash in on this growing trend is to identify semiconductor companies that are not only investing in the Internet of Things, but are also displaying solid fundamentals and impressive Zacks metrics.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@3 ‘Internet of Things’ Stocks to Buy Now – MRVL MCHP CY@2017-07-11@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-internet-things-stocks-buy-now-mrvl-mchp-cy-2017-07-11

"Chicago, IL - July 07, 2017 -  (NASDAQ:  -  ) as the Bull of the Day,  (NYSE:  -  ) as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on  (NASDAQ:  -  ),  (NASDAQ:  -  ) and  (NASDAQ:  -  ).Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: :With the NASDAQ Composite breaking down over the last several days it feels weird to name a NASDAQ stock as my Bull of the Day. However, while the tech-heavy index has succumbed to selling pressure since early June, this stock has held its own. That sort of relative strength in the face of a depressed investment landscape is one of the many reasons this stock is at the top of my list. (NASDAQ:  -  ) operates as a pet pharmacy in the United States. The company markets prescription and non-prescription pet medications, health products, and supplies for dogs and cats to retail customers. It provides non-prescription medications and supplies, such as flea and tick control products, bone and joint care products, vitamins, treats, nutritional supplements, hygiene products, and supplies; and prescription medications, including heartworm preventatives, flea and tick preventatives, arthritis, thyroid, diabetes, pain medications, antibiotics, and other specialty medications, as well as generic substitutes.PetMed Express is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock in an industry that's currently ranked in the Top 16% of our Zacks Industry Rank. It also has a Growth Style Score of B. Part of the reason for the favorable Zacks Rank is the recent earnings estimate revisions analysts have made over the last 30 days. The bullishness of these revisions can be seen in the change of our Zacks Consensus Estimates. Just 60 days go, analysts were expecting 33 cents EPS for the current quarter and $1.10 for the current year. This number has jumped to 40 cents for the current quarter and $1.25 for the year as a direct result of positive earnings estimate revisions. :The beer business has seen its fair share of changes over the last few years. There have been two major themes across the business; consolidation and craft beer. An industry that used to be spread out across several rival brands has been shrunk to a handful of very large players. Even Miller and Budweiser are under the same roof.Then there's the upstart craft beer business. Smaller breweries started popping up all over the US creating a whole new menu of choices for consumers. Larger manufacturers had to adapt to new flavors or buy up the smaller craft brews to keep pace.Lagging behind these sweeping changes is today's Bear of the Day  (NYSE:  -  ). Don't get me wrong, I love a cold Sam Adams, but when you see the numbers on the stock you may not want to crack your investment account open.The Boston Beer Company, Inc. produces and sells alcohol beverages primarily in the United States. Its flagship beer is Samuel Adams Boston Lager. The company sells approximately 60 beers under the Samuel Adams and the Sam Adams brands; 20 hard cider beverages under the Angry Orchard brand; 13 flavored malt beverages under the Twisted Tea brand; and 4 hard seltzer beverages under the Truly Spiked & Sparkling brand name, as well as approximately 40 beers under A&S Brewing trade name. It markets and sells its products to a network of approximately 350 wholesalers, who in turn sell to retailers, such as pubs, restaurants, grocery stores, convenience stores, package stores, stadiums, and other retail outlets in Canada, Europe, Israel, Australia, New Zealand, the Caribbean, the Pacific Rim, Mexico, and Central and South America.Rather than break down the technical chart like I typically do, the easiest way to tell the story of Boston Beer Company is to look at the Price and Consensus chart from Zacks. Here you can see the steady growth year-over-year that helped propel the stock to over $300 per share in early 2015. Then everything took a turn for the worse. Estimates started to come down, growth began to evaporate and the stock tumbled.One of the strongest corners of the market this year has been the semiconductors industry.

"ne of the strongest corners of the market this year has been the semiconductors industry. Throughout the chip-making market, companies have successfully adapted to the changing needs of the consumer, including an increased demand for small, high-powered chips that enable ""Internet of Things"" (IoT) devices.For those that don't know, the Internet of Things is the growing world of interconnected household and industrial devices. Everyday products and machines can now be embedded with sensor technology to process data or interact with other electronic devices.For example, consumer-level IoT products include things like Amazon's (AMZN) Echo ""smart speaker,"" wearable motion and activity tracking products, and advanced in-car technology. On the commercial side of the IoT market, industrial manufacturers have begun implementing sensors into machines to track performance and efficiency.As demand for the microchips that power these IoT devices continues to grow, semiconductor manufacturers with a focus on IoT products will continue to benefit. With that said, we've found three already-strong stocks that are looking to benefit even more from further IoT growth.Marvell Technology is a leading designer, developer and supplier of mixed-signal and digital signal processing integrated circuits. The company's ""EZ-Connect"" platform is used by a variety of global customers in the home automation, wearables, automotive, and industrial industries. After Marvell surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 25% in its most recent quarter, estimate revisions began pouring in for the company's current-quarter and full-year earnings. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for Marvell's full-year earnings calls for EPS growth of more than 118%. This has helped the stock gain a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Microchp Technology is a manufacturer of microcontroller, memory, and analog chips. The company is a leader in several IoT-related fields, including automotive and wireless connectivity. This is another Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, and our current consensus estimates are calling for EPS growth of 26% and revenue growth of 12% this fiscal year. Shares are up over 30% year-to-date, but this stock could break even higher given the right catalyst, and it might have just that. Indeed, last month, the company upped its sales and EPS guidance for 1Q18, sending shares higher.Cypress Semiconductor is a leading provider of high-performance digital and mixed-signal integrated circuits. Just last year, the company shelled out $550 million to acquire Broadcom's Wireless Internet of Things business and now its ""WICED"" Platform is one of the largest IoT portfolios in the industry. Cypress is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), which pairs very well with its ""A"" grades for Growth and Momentum in our Style Scores system.The Internet of Things is one of the most exciting emerging tech markets in the world. Home automation products are fun. In-car technology is cool.And while these specific products are interesting, the real moneymakers in these situations are the companies that are building the tech that powers these products. The Internet of Things needs semiconductors to function, and as the IoT grows, so too will semiconductor companies.The best way for investors to cash in on this growing trend is to identify semiconductor companies that are not only investing in the Internet of Things, but are also displaying solid fundamentals and impressive Zacks metrics.It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years, but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it. If you don't buy now, you may kick yourself in 2020. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

"There's no doubt that the first half of 2017 has been a bit confusing. Consumer spending is tepid yet unemployment is at a record low. Interest rates are low, but car and home purchases are floundering. The Federal Reserve is moving like we're in recovery, but projections for growth this year have been cut. Source: ShutterstockHealthcare reform can't make it through Congress, and neither can tax reform or infrastructure stimulus. And through all this the market has been going higher and higher.The trick in this kind of bizarre-o world is to work your proven strategy and ignore all the confusing signals around you. That's why I like to examine stocks from both the fundamental and technical perspectives, to make sure one isn't leading me in the wrong direction. When both confirm a good company I know the stocks can get through almost any challenges.Following are seven A-rated stocks that are summer buys. Now that summer is officially here, the markets tend to lounge about like so many beach-goers. These stocks will continue to work hard this summer and beyond. 21.5% in the current quarter (NYSE:  ) is one of the largest focused wine, beer and spirits companies in the world. It has an impressive array of wine labels as well as some the top selling imported beers in the U.S., including Corona and Modelo brands. It also owns the up and coming craft beer brand Ballast Point.Its spirits line is small but is growing briskly.But the most impressive thing about STZ is its numbers. It has rock solid operating margins and net profit margins and its brands are some of the most popular in each of their respective markets.STZ is coming off a solid first-quarter earnings report in late June and STZ stock is up 26% year to date. Given the heat and the height of beach season, next quarter's numbers should be even more impressive. 72.5% (NASDAQ:  ) is finally getting the traction it has been preparing for over the past decade. It's one of my  .Basically, NVDA is the leading visual computing companies on the planet. In the old days of the digital age, that meant NVDA simply made graphics processing units (aka, graphic cards or GPUs). The allowed crisper clearer visuals.As the internet age dawned, GPUs were becoming a key part of the daily experience of being online. Gamers were the only ones who demanded the highest quality and fastest GPUs, which NVDA made.Now, as we get to the next iteration of the internet - online gaming, streaming video, self-driving cars, cloud computing, etc - visual computing has become one of the most important technologies in the marketplace. And NVDA is at the hub.Up 46% in just the past three months, NVDA is certainly heating up this summer for a very long run. 46.4% (NASDAQ:  ) is a leading microprocessor and analog semiconductor company. Basically that means it makes chips - and licenses the technology - for computer chips with very specific functions and also makes and licenses chips that convert analog signals into digital signals.The latter technology digitizes things like voices, temperature, motion, etc. We're just beginning the transition to a new era where practically everything we own is 'smart'. It provides feedback to its owners and its builders on how it is operating, what it's doing and when it needs to be serviced.Our smartphones count our steps and calculate calories. They provide real time directions from Point A to Point B. They allow us to share pictures across the continent instantaneously. Now, the rest of our devices are becoming similarly integrated into our 'analog' lives. And MCHP is supplying the modern nuts and bolts to get that done.The stock is blowing away earnings estimates and up 22% year to date, but it's still in the shadow of larger competitors. That means it's still undervalued. 52% (NASDAQ:  ) is the No. 3 mobile carrier in the U.S. Trying to compete domestically with  (NYSE:  ) and  (NYSE:  ) is no easy task. TMUS is the ""Baby Telekom"" of  , the leading German telecom player.But it has been growing its reputation as the ""un-carrier"" and has tried to disrupt the industry by acting less corporate and more creatively than it larger two competitors. And there's even talk now from back in Germany that TMUS might be making a move for its second tier rival  (NYSE:  ). That would be a big deal.However they both run on different telecom platforms, which would make subscriber integration challenging. But it keeps the name in the press and that is what's important.TMUS has certainly outperformed its rivals in the first half of the year, and that trend may well continue. 15% (NASDAQ:  ) is in the weight management industry. What differentiates it from its competitors is its focus on delivering nutritionally balanced meals to its members.In that way, it can get beyond the weight loss label and use nutrition as its sales point. You're not overweight, you're finding a way to eat healthier. This subtle differentiation is paying off big.Year to date NTRI is up a solid 49%. The other strength in the NTRI program is it is built as a custom program. You go to the website, plug in your numbers and its sets your goals and suggests a diet plan.If you don't want to mess around, you order, pay and begin. If you want to customize your plan, you can do that as well. No meetings. No cards. No counting.There's plenty of opportunity in this space, especially as subscribers rise, because that means food costs go down and NTRI can reach more people. This system will go far beyond New Year's resolutions and 'swimsuit' dieting. 38.6% (NYSE:  ) has been around since 1832 and was run by a Rogers for nearly 100 years. In 2007, it celebrated its 175th year anniversary. There are very few publicly traded companies that have a lineage like that.What it proves is, ROG knows how to make money in any kind of environment. It maintains a $2 billion market cap, so it was never interested in expanding its empire into a behemoth. It has stuck to its knitting and stayed flexible and innovative.And now, it is well positioned for a new wave of demand in the Internet of Things (IoT) space. Smart cars and a smart products are expanding rapidly, and this technology isn't limited to the consumer space. Commercial, industrial and military applications are also growing quickly and ROG is a go-to supplier for mission critical materials and components.The stock is up 37'% in the past three months, which means its getting more attention on the Street from investors looking for the less obvious IoT plays. 38.5% for the current year (NASDAQ:  ) is one of the companies that's behind the new wave of veterinary diagnostics. In the past, like in the human healthcare sector. If you needed lab work, the nurse would take your specimen and ship it off to a lab, or you would have to go to a separate lab to get the work done.Then in a few days to a week, you would get your results. Now much of that work is done on the spot, or within 24-48 hours using new diagnostic equipment and 'lab on a chip' technology.HSKA is one of the companies that's bringing this type of tech to vets. The vet now has the diagnostic equipment to perform these services in-house and get the results while the owner is still in the clinic.This allows vets to cut out a middleman in their practice and provide a new service that can add to other services for their patients. And it seems to be working. Year to date HSKA is up 43% and the trend is in place for continued long-term growth.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@7 A-Rated Stocks That Look Their Summer Best@2017-07-07@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-a-rated-stocks-that-look-their-summer-best-2017-07-07
"any investors constantly attempt to find investments on the equity securities market that provide stability, as well as profitability, for their capital. Fortunately, Zacks customers can utilize our  to search for stocks that provide security on their initial principle.Large-cap stocks are usually considered less volatile because of their dominant total market capitalization compared to middle and small-cap stocks, and we can use the ""Management Excellence Premium Screen"" to find large-cap companies that are known to administer their entity successfully.Companies that exhibit prime management tend to have certain characteristics, such as high RoE, low Debt/Equity, and a high current ratio.

"Chicago, IL - July 06, 2017 - Stocks in this week's article include  (NYSE:  -  ),  (NYSE:  -  ),  (NYSE:  -  ),  (NASDAQ:  -  ) and  (NASDAQ:  -  ).Investors with higher risk tolerance generally strive to use strategies that help in scooping up awesome returns mainly from momentum stocks. Using the ""buy high and sell higher"" principle, Richard Driehaus formulated a strong momentum strategy. Driehaus's pioneering momentum investing earned him a place in the Barron's All-Century Team.The American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) proved that the strategy has the potential to offer high returns. AAII's portfolio, which was developed following the strategy, returned 13.5% and 18.1% in the five- and 10-year time frames, respectively, compared with -1.1% and 4.2% returns registered by the S&P 500. Thus investors with a high risk appetite may opt for this strategy to boost their portfolio returns.Regarding the strategy, Driehaus once said: ""I would much rather invest in a stock that's increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that's already in a decline and try to guess when it will turn around."" In line with this insight, AAII took into account the percentage 50-day moving average as one of the key criteria before creating a portfolio following Driehaus' philosophy.It is calculated by dividing the numerator (month-end price minus 50-day moving average of month-end price) by the 50-day moving average of the month-end price. Another momentum indicator - positive relative strength - has also been included in this strategy. A positive percentage 50-day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50-day moving average level, indicating an uptrend.Moreover, AAII found that Driehaus primarily focuses on strong earnings growth rates and impressive earnings projections to pick potential outperformers. Companies with a strong history of beating estimates are also given importance in this strategy, which was made to provide better returns over the long term.In order to make the strategy more profitable, we have considered only those stocks that have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a momentum score of 'A' or 'B'. Our research shows that stocks with a  of 'A' or 'B' when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.(Only Strong Buy rated stocks can get through. You can see  .) • (Strong EPS growth history ensures improving business)• (Higher EPS growth compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks)• (Positive EPS surprise indicates potential)• (High % 50-day moving average and relative strength signal uptrend)• (Favorable momentum score indicates that it is ideal to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success)These few parameters have narrowed down the universe of over 7,809 stocks to only 11.Here are five of the 11 stocks: (NYSE:  -  ) is a producer and seller of glass fiber reinforcements. Owens Corning has a Momentum Score of 'A' and an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 29.8%. (NYSE:  -  ) is an air transportation services provider.

n Jun 23,  was upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the stock moved higher in the last 30 days after the company revised its net sales and earnings guidance range for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 on Jun 5. The revised guidance depicts an improvement from the earlier projection at the mid-point.The company now expects net sales for the quarter to witness year-over-year growth in the range of 4.5% to 6% (mid-point 5.25%). The previous expected growth rate was 2%-7% (mid-point 4.5%). The revised guidance is higher at the mid-point.Similarly, GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share are now anticipated to be in the range of 62-64 cents and $1.22-$1.26, respectively. Earlier, the company had expected GAAP earnings to come in the band of 59 cents to 64 cents while non-GAAP earnings were expected between $1.17 and $1.27.Microchip revealed that its performance has been better than expected in the first two months of the June quarter. This led it to revise the first quarter revenue and earnings outlook.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 has increased 0.9% to $4.62 over the last 30 days. For fiscal 2019, the consensus estimate is currently pegged at $4.97, up 2.3% over the same time frame.We also note that shares of the company have outperformed the S&P 500 on a year-to-date basis. While the index gained 10.5%, the stock returned 26.4%.Microchip is one of the better-positioned companies in the semiconductor industry based on its product strength. Microchip is evidently benefiting from the addition of Atmel's product portfolio, which it acquired in Apr 2016.Going ahead, we believe the launch of new products like eXtreme Low Power (XLP) PIC32MM microcontroller, PIC32MX1/2 XLP, PIC32MZ DA microcontroller (MCU) family and the PIC16F19197 family (low power MCUs) will add to its customer base. The newly added Wi-Fi Software Development Kit (SDK) with Apple HomeKit support further expands the product portfolio.Moreover, the company's market penetration is quite high, evident from its net sales growth of 58.8% year on year in fiscal fourth-quarter 2017. Notably, the frequent launch of new products and updates to its existing portfolio provides Microchip a competitive edge. | Other stocks that can be considered by investors are Applied Optoelectronics, Inc.  , and Applied Materials, Inc.  and Arista Networks, Inc.  , all three sporting a Zacks Rank #1. You can see The long-term earnings growth rates for Applied Optoelectronics, Applied Materials and Arista Networks are projected to be 20%, 16.6% and 20.4%, respectively.Just released, today's 220 Zacks Rank #5 Strong Sells demand urgent attention.

"nvestors with higher risk tolerance generally strive to use strategies that help in scooping up awesome returns mainly from momentum stocks. Using the ""buy high and sell higher"" principle, Richard Driehaus formulated a strong momentum strategy. Driehaus's pioneering momentum investing earned him a place in the Barron's All-Century Team.The American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) proved that the strategy has the potential to offer high returns. AAII's portfolio, which was developed following the strategy, returned 13.5% and 18.1% in the five- and 10-year time frames, respectively, compared with -1.1% and 4.2% returns registered by the S&P 500. Thus investors with a high risk appetite may opt for this strategy to boost their portfolio returns.Regarding the strategy, Driehaus once said: ""I would much rather invest in a stock that's increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that's already in a decline and try to guess when it will turn around."" In line with this insight, AAII took into account the percentage 50-day moving average as one of the key criteria before creating a portfolio following Driehaus' philosophy.It is calculated by dividing the numerator (month-end price minus 50-day moving average of month-end price) by the 50-day moving average of the month-end price. Another momentum indicator - positive relative strength - has also been included in this strategy. A positive percentage 50-day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50-day moving average level, indicating an uptrend.Moreover, AAII found that Driehaus primarily focuses on strong earnings growth rates and impressive earnings projections to pick potential outperformers. Companies with a strong history of beating estimates are also given importance in this strategy, which was made to provide better returns over the long term.In order to make the strategy more profitable, we have considered only those stocks that have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a momentum score of 'A' or 'B'. Our research shows that stocks with a  of 'A' or 'B' when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.(Only Strong Buy rated stocks can get through.

"ooking for a stock that might be in a good position to beat earnings at its next report? Consider  , a firm in the Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed industry, which could be a great candidate for another beat.This company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. In fact, in these reports, MCHP has beaten estimates by at least 10% in both cases, suggesting it has a nice short-term history of crushing expectations.Two quarters ago, MCHP expected to post earnings of 81 cents per share, while it actually produced earnings of $1.00 per share, a beat of 23.5%. Meanwhile, for the most recent quarter, the company looked to deliver earnings of 99 cents per share, when it actually saw $1.10 earnings per share instead, representing an 11.1% positive surprise. | Thanks in part to this history, recent estimates have been moving higher for Microchip Technology. In fact, the  for MCHP is positive, which is a great sign of a coming beat.After all, the Zacks Earnings ESP compares the most accurate estimate to the broad consensus, looking to find stocks that have seen big revisions as of late, suggesting that analysts have recently become more bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This is the case for MCHP, as the firm currently has a Zacks Earnings ESP of +3.51%, so another beat could be around the corner.This is particularly true when you consider that MCHP has a great Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) which can be a harbinger of outperformance and a signal for a strong earnings profile. You can see  .When you add this solid Zacks Rank to a positive Earnings ESP,  of the time, so it seems pretty likely that MCHP could see another beat at its next report, especially if recent trends are any guide.At Zacks, we're mostly focused on short-term profit cycles, but the hottest of all technology mega-trends is starting to take hold...By last year, it was already generating $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

n Jul 5,  .  was upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see The upgrade can primarily be attributed to the successful integration of Fairchild, which the company acquired in Sep 2016. The acquisition has helped the company to strengthen its foothold in the semiconductor industry with a clear focus on smartphone, automotive and industrial end markets.The positively revised synergy run rate will be an additional boost for the company's shares, which have marginally underperformed the Zacks  industry on a year-to-date basis. While the industry gained 12.6%, the stock returned 12.1% over the same time period.ON Semiconductor revised its annual synergies run rate from the Fairchild acquisition to $180 million, up from the previous target of $160 million for 2017. For 2018, the same was raised to $220 million from $200 million. Management also expects strong revenue growth contribution from Fairchild in the near to mid-term. Total annual synergies from Fairchild are now anticipated to be $245 million, up from $225 million, which it expects to achieve by the end of 2019.Moreover, improving end markets is something that the company can bank on. Growing demand and greater adoption of ADAS related applications have given ON Semiconductor a significant growth opportunity in the automotive market.Positive guidance is another driving factor. ON Semi now forecasts revenues to be in the range of $1.28-$1.34 billion in second-quarter 2017. Non-GAAP gross margin is projected to be in the range of approximately 34.7-36.7%, while operating expenses are estimated to be in the range of $281-$295 million. | We believe that the company's diversified product and customer base along with improving end-markets and positives from the Fairchild acquisition will definitely help it gain momentum and improve its top line going forward.A few other stocks worth considering in the broader technology sector include MaxLinear  , Microchip Technology  and Applied Materials, Inc.  . All three sport a Zacks Rank #1.The long-term earnings growth rate for MaxLinear, Microchip Technology and Applied Materials is projected to be 17.5%, 14.4% and 16.6%, respectively.It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over.

 is set to report fiscal fourth-quarter 2017 earnings on Jun 21.Last quarter, it delivered a positive surprise of 10.53%. The company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 0.42% in the past four quarters.Earnings (including stock-based compensation) of 63 cents per share and revenues of $9.27 billion in fiscal third-quarter 2017 comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 57 cents and $9.24 billion, respectively.We also note that Oracle has outperformed the S&P 500 on a year-to-date basis. While the index gained 10%, the stock returned 18.2% over the same time period.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Of late, Oracle has been gaining traction driven by its Cloud segment. Hearst was added to its cloud customer base in March. It also added a host of new features to its Prime Projects Cloud Service. The company also provides Retail Merchandising Solutions via Oracle Cloud. Hence, this segment is likely to play an instrumental role in driving the company's growth.Moreover, Oracle unveiled its Cloud Converged Storage solution this quarter. The first of its kind storage system can merge cloud services to on-premises Network Attached Storage (NAS) systems.Notably, the launch of Oracle Utilities Operational Device Cloud Service (ODCS) will also boost the top line.Management expects total revenue to grow in the range of (1%) to 2% for the fourth-quarter. Earnings are anticipated to be between 78 cents and 82 cents for the quarter. However, impact from adverse currency is a concern. | Our proven model does not conclusively show that Oracle is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. : Oracle currently has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 73 cents.

t has been about a month since the last earnings report for  . Shares have added about 9.9% in that time frame, outperforming the market.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Microchip reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings (including stock-based compensation) of $1.10 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $0.11.Adjusted earnings (excluding stock-based compensation) advanced 65.7% year over year and 10.5% sequentially to $1.16 per share in the quarter. Atmel contributed $25 cents better than management's expectation of 18-22 cents.The strong growth was also driven by higher net sales, which surged 58.8% from the year-ago quarter to $902.7 million. On a sequential basis, net sales increased almost 2.4%. The figure was within management's guided range of $872-$908 million. Book-to-bill ratio was approximately 1.10.In terms of product line, microcontroller business (64.3% of net sales) increased 0.3% sequentially driven by robust performance from 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontroller businesses. These benefited from the addition of Atmel's product portfolio.Analog sales (25.5% of net sales) increased 1.1% from the previous quarter. Memory sales (5% of net sales) declined 2.3% on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Licensing (2.6% of net sales) sales decreased 3.2% sequentially. MMO (2.6% of net sales) slumped 12.8% from the previous quarter.Microchip posted adjusted gross margin (including stock-based compensation) of 58.9%, which expanded 180 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis and 140 bps sequentially.Non-GAAP operating expenses declined from 46.6% to 25.7% in the reported quarter, primarily due to lower research & development (R&D) and selling, general & administrative (SG&A), which declined 280 bps and 110 bps, respectively.As a result, non-GAAP operating margin expanded 480 bps from the year-ago quarter and 280 bps sequentially. Atmel achieved operating margins of more than 30% in the quarter.Cash generated in the reported quarter was $322.6 million as compared with $290.8 million at the end of Dec 31. As of Mar 31, cash and total investment position was $1.30 billion as compared with $669.6 million.Microchip had no borrowings under its revolving line of credit at the end of March. As part of the refinancing activities, the company exchanged some of the 2.125% 2037 bonds issued in 2007 for newly issued 2.25% 2037 bonds during the quarter.Leverage continues to improve with net debt-to-EBITDA at 1.94 down from 2.47 at the end of the December quarter.Microchip forecasts first-quarter fiscal 2018 net sales to be in the range of $920.7-$965.9 million, which reflects a range of 2-7% growth on a sequential basis.Gross margin was anticipated to in the range of 59.5-60%, operating expense as percentage of 23-25% and operating margin 36-37%. Earnings are anticipated to be in the range of $1.17-$1.27 per share for the quarter.

In the current market scenario, marked by changing customer preferences and habits, evolving needs, demographic changes and an extremely competitive environment, maintaining stable sales growth is vital for any business.Companies are always looking out for ways to boost their marketing initiatives to drive revenues. Notably, revenues are often more closely monitored than earnings when assessing the growth of a business.It's worth keeping in mind that in cases when companies incur a loss, albeit briefly, they are valued on their revenues, as top-line growth (or decline) is usually an indicator of a company's future earnings performance.So, the Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio can turn out to be an apt metric for stock valuation. It remains a major stock selection criterion as management usually has limited opportunities to manipulate revenues unlike earnings. Thus, the P/S ratio is subject to lesser influence than the Price-to-Earnings ratio.Sales growth in isolation, however, does not assure success. A consideration of a company's cash position along with its sales number can be a more dependable strategy. Substantial cash in hand and steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and investments.In order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected  and  as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy. This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company's revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales. Better-than-industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in the stock price. Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs, an optimal situation for the company. This metric will ensure that sales growth is being translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.

rowth at a reasonable price, or GARP, provides an excellent opportunity for investors who are interested in consistent and assured returns. It helps an investor gain exposure to stocks that are undervalued but have impressive prospects.Unlike a blend strategy, a portfolio that uses GARP investing is expected to have stocks that offer the best of both value and growth investing.The GARP approach prefers stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.Both strong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is a preferred tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the strategy.Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.GARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics - price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios compared to value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. Moreover, the price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is another value metric that is considered.Using the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.Along with the criteria discussed in the above section, we have considered a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) to make the strategy foolproof. (Only Strong Buy and Buy-rated stocks can get through.) (Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business.) (Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks.) (P/E and P/B ratios less than that of the industry indicates that the stocks are undervalued.)These few criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only nine.Here are four stocks that made it through the screen:Pasadena, CA-based  is the holding company for East West Bank, East West Capital Trust I, East West Capital Trust II and Risk Services Inc.

"lain and simple earnings growth may no longer entice investors. Now, earnings improvement (no matter how big it is) seems inadequate for solid moves in the market. It is the ""BEAT"" that matters the most and leads one to a lucrative investment.A positive earnings surprise or earnings beat is typically the case when actual or reported earnings come in above the consensus estimate. Historically, if a company's earnings manage to beat market expectations, its stock surges post release.This is becauseinvestors always try to take positions ahead of time and look for stocks that are likely to come up with stellar performances. Now, since Wall Street analysts project earnings of companies after much deliberation, their estimates act as investment leads.After all, only earnings beat can give investors a clear picture of a company's strength when an industry-wide earnings recession is felt.Also, a 20% earnings rise (though apparently looks good) doesn't tell you everything about the company's performance. This might represent decelerating earnings growth momentum over the years or quarters, raising questions over the company's fundamentals.Also, seasonal fluctuations come into play at times. If a company's Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 is strong, then it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline. In such cases, growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company.On the other hand, analysts put together their insights and a company's guidance when giving an earnings estimate. Thus, outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company's own expectation as well as market perception.Now, since it is difficult to foretell if a company will beat or miss in the upcoming earnings season, investors can check the earnings surprise history. An impressive track in this regard generally acts as a catalyst in sending a stock higher. It indicates the company's consistency in surpassing estimates. And investors generally believe that the company will have the same trick up its sleeve or in other words is smart enough to beat on earnings in its next release.In order to shortlist stocks that are likely to come up with an earnings surprise, we chose the following as our primary screening parameters. Stocks delivering positive surprise in the last quarter tend to surprise again. We lifted the bar for outperformance slight higher by setting the average earnings surprise for the last four quarters at 20%. This points to a more consistent surprise history and makes the case for another surprise even stronger.In addition, we place a few other criteria that push up the chance of a positive surprise. Only companies with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) rating can get through. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for an earnings beat to happen, as per our proven model.In order to zero in on those that have long-term growth potential and high trading liquidity we have added the following parameters too: Solid expected earnings growth exhibits the stock's long-term growth prospects. High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity.A handful of criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to 13.Here are five out of the 13 stocks: This Zacks Rank #1 company is engaged in the owning and operating of casino gaming and entertainment casino resorts. The Zacks Industry Rank of the stock is in the top 27%. You can see  . This Zacks Rank #2 company is a global leader in children's and family leisure time and entertainment products and services. The Zacks Industry Rank of the stock is in the top 42%. This casual dining restaurant chain holds a Zacks Rank #1. The Zacks Industry Rank of the stock is in the top 37%.

"ith several interesting trends like the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence on the rise, it is an exciting time to be investing in the technology sector. What's more, it is also a profitable time to be a tech-focused investor, as this space has been among the strongest performing sectors all year.And while the behemoths like Microsoft  and Apple  may hog all the headlines, it's really been the companies powering their technologies-the semiconductor manufacturers-that have had a strong year on the markets.Indeed, as our Computer and Technology  has gained nearly 15% year-to-date, semiconductor companies have been a driving factor behind its growth. The aforementioned emerging tech trends have created new consumer demand, and the semiconductor makers are delivering.Luckily, the proven Zacks stock picking methods are effective across all industries. Check out these Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) semiconductor stocks right now:Lam Research is a designer and manufacturer of semiconductor processing equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits. The company is recognized as a leading supplier of front-end wafer processing equipment to the worldwide semiconductor industry.In its latest report, Lam posted earnings of $2.80 per share and revenue of $2.15 billion, beating our respective consensus estimates of $2.54 and $2.13 billion. The company will wrap up its fiscal year in the current quarter, and our consensus estimates call for full-year totals to mark EPS growth of 57% and sales growth of 36%. Looking ahead, we've already seen eight positive revisions to Lam's next-year earnings estimates.Microchp Technology is a manufacturer of microcontroller, memory, and analog chips. The company is a leader in several IoT-related fields, including automotive and wireless connectivity. MCHP shares have gained more than 30% year-to-date, but this stock could be poised to break even higher given the right catalyst, and might have just that. Indeed, earlier this week the company upped its sales and EPS guidance for 1Q18, sending shares higher in after-hours trading. Our current consensus estimates are calling for EPS growth of 26% and revenue growth of 12% this fiscal year, but it could also be a stock that continues to benefit as the IoT grows over the next few years.Alpha and Omega Semiconductor is a manufacturer of power semiconductors. Its portfolio of products targets high-volume end-market applications, such as notebooks, netbooks, flat panel displays, and mobile phone battery packs. In the most recent quarter, the company Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for the eighth consecutive time. It also surpassed our consensus revenue estimate for the sixth consecutive time.We've seen three positive revisions to the company's full-year and next-year earnings within the past 60 days, so it's clear that analysts are feeling more confident about the company's prospects. The stock has been on a nice run recently, but it still sits about 20% lower than its 52-week high, so there's plenty of room for gains before investors even have to worry about breaking into a new range.Want more  from this author?

Continuing the momentum gained in the second half of 2016, the stock market has made a remarkable run this year. In 2017 so far, the NASDAQ Composite, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average have gained 15.4%, 7.9% and 6.7%, respectively.Among the various sectors, technology continued to perform well, with the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF registering a return of 16.6% in the year-to-date period. Notably, the ETF gained 12.9% last year.Launched in Dec 1998, XLK is a passively managed fund designed to deliver the returns of the U.S. technology stocks. The fund, before expenses, is expected to remain on par with the returns and characteristics of the S&P Technology Select Sector Index.The future prospects of the technology sector look promising as it is positioned to gain from the improving U.S. economy, which is highlighted by an increase in gross domestic product (up 1.2%) for first-quarter 2017, a favorable job scenario (unemployment rate down to 4.4% in April), income growth, heightened consumer confidence and momentum in the housing market.In view of these bullish sentiments, momentum investing can be a winning strategy for those looking for high returns in a short time. This is because the strategy focuses on hot stocks that have been gaining over the past few weeks or months.Today, we've zeroed-in on some tech stocks using our premium screen ""Momentum Style Score.""The Momentum Style Score theory states that what has been going up so far should continue to do so in the near future. This indicates the time to buy a stock that is likely to witness a rise in share price. Nothing is more frustrating than watching a fundamentally sound or inexpensive stock remain stagnant.Momentum investors, thus, strongly believe ""the trend is your friend,"" which implies that stocks which are growing will continue to grow. They make short-term choices among stocks that are scaling up and sell them at the first sign of a downtrend. The basic idea is that once a trend is recognized, it is likely to retain that direction and not move against the flow.Thus, bettling on momentum stocks might help investors earn higher returns in the short term. Nevertheless, investors should remember that this is a speculative strategy and not meant for the faint hearted.Finding the right momentum stocks is not easy due to market volatility, but if executed properly, momentum stocks can bring in hefty returns.It is here that our new  can come in handy.

"ne of the strongest corners of the market this year has been the semiconductors industry. Throughout the chip-making market, companies have successfully adapted to the changing needs of the consumer, including an increased demand for small, high-powered chips that enable ""Internet of Things"" (IoT) devices.For those that don't know, the Internet of Things is the growing world of interconnected household and industrial devices. Everyday products and machines can now be embedded with sensor technology to process data or interact with other electronic devices.For example, consumer-level IoT products include things like Amazon's (AMZN) Echo ""smart speaker,"" wearable motion and activity tracking products, and advanced in-car technology. On the commercial side of the IoT market, industrial manufacturers have begun implementing sensors into machines to track performance and efficiency.As demand for the microchips that power these IoT devices continues to grow, semiconductor manufacturers with a focus on IoT products will continue to benefit. With that said, we've found three already-strong stocks that are looking to benefit even more from further IoT growth.STMicroelectronics is a French-Italian semiconductors company that develops circuits and discrete devices for use in microelectronic devices. The company specifically tailors its tiny, low-power technology for use in a wide range of Internet of Things products. It is shaping up to be a year of aggressive earnings growth for this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company; our current consensus estimates call for its EPS to spike over 340% this quarter and 170% this fiscal year. The stock is also sporting a ""B"" grade for Growth and an overall VGM grade of ""B.""Marvell Technology is a leading designer, developer and supplier of mixed-signal and digital signal processing integrated circuits. The company's ""EZ-Connect"" platform is used by a variety of global customers in the home automation, wearables, automotive, and industrial industries.After Marvell surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 25% in its most recent quarter, estimate revisions began pouring in for the company's current-quarter and full-year earnings. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for Marvell's full-year earnings calls for EPS growth of more than 118%. This has helped the stock gain a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), which pairs well with its ""A"" grade for Momentum and overall VGM grade of ""B.""Microchp Technology is a manufacturer of microcontroller, memory, and analog chips. The company is a leader in several IoT-related fields, including automotive and wireless connectivity. This is another Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, and our current consensus estimates are calling for EPS growth of 26% and revenue growth of 12% this fiscal year. Shares are up over 30% year-to-date, but this stock could break even higher given the right catalyst, and it might have just that. Indeed, on Monday the company upped its sales and EPS guidance for 1Q18, sending shares higher in after-hours trading.The Internet of Things is one of the most exciting emerging tech markets in the world. Home automation products are fun. In-car technology is cool.And while these specific products are interesting, the real moneymakers in these situations are the companies that are building the tech that powers these products. The Internet of Things needs semiconductors to function, and as the IoT grows, so too will semiconductor companies.The best way for investors to cash in on this growing trend is to identify semiconductor companies that are not only investing in the Internet of Things, but are also displaying solid fundamentals and impressive Zacks metrics.Want more  from this author?

Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

"Chicago, IL - May 11, 2017 - Stocks in this week's article include  (NYSE:  -  ),  (NYSE:  -  ),  (NYSE:  -  ),  (NASDAQ:  -  ) and  (NASDAQ:  -  ).Sales growth is an important metric for any company, as it is an important part of growth projections and instrumental in strategic decision making. By observing this key metric over a period of time, one can clearly understand a company's growth trend.Sales growth is crucial to justify the fixed and variable expenses incurred to operate a business. Low revenues lead to an unprofitable business and unimpressive financial results. Stagnant companies may generate near-term profit. But companies need to show accelerated growth to attract new investors.Also, in an improving economy, lack of sales growth most likely indicates that the company is not gaining market share over its competitors. In simple terms, some sustained sales growth is required to support profitability.Focusing exclusively on sales growth is not enough though. A healthy sales growth rate is certainly a positive indicator for picking good stocks, but it does not ensure profits. Hence, taking into consideration a company's cash position along with its sales number can prove to be a more dependable strategy.Strong liquidity position and steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments. Cash also enables a company to endure market downturns. Most importantly, a sufficient cash position indicates that revenues are being channelized in the right direction.In order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected  and  as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy. This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company's revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales. Better-than-industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in the stock price. Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs, an optimal situation for the company. This metric will ensure that sales growth is being translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.

"Chicago, IL - April 28, 2017 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NYSE:  ),  (NYSE:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations. Much has been said about semiconductor stocks lately, with some of the opinion that the secular growth drivers will continue to push them up and others taking the more cautious approach that such appreciation may be risky because they are already fully valued. Neither position can be completely ruled out. But it may be worthwhile to drill down a little deeper to identify the names that still have upside potential.And what better way than to start with than the Zacks Industry Rank, which is based on the philosophy that about half of a stock's price movement can be attributed to the group (sub-industry) that it's in. In fact, Zacks studies have shown that the top 50% of Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.So today, we are going to take a closer look at the  , which is in the top 10% of Zacks-ranked industries.The group has slightly outperformed the S&P 500, having appreciated 5.5% compared to the 4.8% for the S&P 500.Sector revenues have grown in each of the last four years with the jump in 2016 being particularly high (up 31.4%). Gross profit (up 26.3% in 2016) and net income before non-recurring items (up 16.4%) show similar trends. However, the industry is investing heavily in R&D and SG&A (up 65.0% in 2016 although moving both ways in preceding years) and unlike in the past, it's tapping into the debt market to do it (interest expenses are up 134.5% in 2016 and up double digits in each of the three preceding years.A quarterly cross section shows revenues rising steadily from the Sep 2015 quarter. Gross profit dipped in the Mar 2016 quarter but barring that one quarter shows a rising trend from Dec 2014. Net income before non-recurring items has risen since Mar 2016. As with the annual trend, the quarterly performance shows rising operating expenses and capex spend (using depreciation as a proxy), as well as rising interest rates.If you add the above data to secular growth drivers like machine learning, artificial intelligence, self-driving cars, IoT, industrial and medical technology, drones (the list is almost never-ending), it's clear that this is a growth segment. So while momentum trading opportunities may be there in some cases, they may not be what value buyers are looking for.So with that let's jump to the picks for today- (NASDAQ:  )Analog Devices, Inc. is one of the world leaders in the design, manufacture and marketing of high-performance analog, mixed-signal and digital signal processing integrated circuits used in signal processing applications.

uch has been said about semiconductor stocks lately, with some of the opinion that the secular growth drivers will continue to push them up and others taking the more cautious approach that such appreciation may be risky because they are already fully valued. Neither position can be completely ruled out. But it may be worthwhile to drill down a little deeper to identify the names that still have upside potential.And what better way than to start with than the Zacks Industry Rank, which is based on the philosophy that about half of a stock's price movement can be attributed to the group (sub-industry) that it's in. In fact, Zacks studies have shown that the top 50% of Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.So today, we are going to take a closer look at the  , which is in the top 10% of Zacks-ranked industries.The group has slightly outperformed the S&P 500, having appreciated 5.5% compared to the 4.8% for the S&P 500.Sector revenues have grown in each of the last four years with the jump in 2016 being particularly high (up 31.4%). Gross profit (up 26.3% in 2016) and net income before non-recurring items (up 16.4%) show similar trends. However, the industry is investing heavily in R&D and SG&A (up 65.0% in 2016 although moving both ways in preceding years) and unlike in the past, it's tapping into the debt market to do it (interest expenses are up 134.5% in 2016 and up double digits in each of the three preceding years.A quarterly cross section shows revenues rising steadily from the Sep 2015 quarter. Gross profit dipped in the Mar 2016 quarter but barring that one quarter shows a rising trend from Dec 2014. Net income before non-recurring items has risen since Mar 2016. As with the annual trend, the quarterly performance shows rising operating expenses and capex spend (using depreciation as a proxy), as well as rising interest rates.If you add the above data to secular growth drivers like machine learning, artificial intelligence, self-driving cars, IoT, industrial and medical technology, drones (the list is almost never-ending), it's clear that this is a growth segment. So while momentum trading opportunities may be there in some cases, they may not be what value buyers are looking for.MagnaChip Semiconductor Corporation is a designer and manufacturer of analog and mixed-signal semiconductor products for high-volume consumer applications.

"Chicago, IL - May 08, 2017 - Stocks in this week's article include  (NASDAQ:  -  ),  . (NASDAQ:  -  ),  (NYSE:  -  ) and  . (NASDAQ:  -  ).Investors on the lookout for stocks that have the potential to offer the best growth as well as value investing may consider the growth at a reasonable price or GARP strategy.This well-liked strategy helps investors gain exposure to stocks that have impressive growth prospects but are trading at a discount. Unlike the blend strategy, a portfolio created on the GARP way of investing is expected to help find stocks that offer the best of both value and growth investing.The GARP approach prefers stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.Both strong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is also a tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the GARP strategy.Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.GARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics - price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios compared to value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. Moreover, the price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is another value metric that is considered.Using the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.Along with the criteria discussed in the above section, we have considered a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) to make the strategy foolproof. (Only Strong Buy and Buy-rated stocks can get through.) (Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business.) (Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks.) (P/E and P/B ratios less than that of the industry indicates that the stocks are undervalued.)These few criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only six.Here are four stocks that made it through the screen:Pasadena, CA-based  (NASDAQ:  -  ) is the holding company for East West Bank, East West Capital Trust I, East West Capital Trust II and Risk Services Inc. The company has an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 9.35% and sports a Zacks Rank #1. You can see  . . (NASDAQ:  -  ) develops and manufactures specialized semiconductor products for a wide variety of embedded control applications.

ooking at the universe of stocks we cover at  , on 5/19/17, Microchip Technology Inc (Symbol: MCHP), Alaska Air Group, Inc. (Symbol: ALK), and MSA Safety Inc (Symbol: MSA) will all trade ex-dividend for their respective upcoming dividends. Microchip Technology Inc will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.3615 on 6/6/17, Alaska Air Group, Inc. will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.30 on 6/8/17, and MSA Safety Inc will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.35 on 6/10/17. As a percentage of MCHP's recent stock price of $80.74, this dividend works out to approximately 0.45%, so look for shares of Microchip Technology Inc to trade 0.45% lower - all else being equal - when MCHP shares open for trading on 5/19/17. Similarly, investors should look for ALK to open 0.36% lower in price and for MSA to open 0.45% lower, all else being equal.Below are dividend history charts for MCHP, ALK, and MSA, showing historical dividends prior to the most recent ones declared. : : :In general, dividends are not always predictable, following the ups and downs of company profits over time. Therefore, a good first due diligence step in forming an expectation of annual yield going forward, is looking at the history above, for a sense of stability over time. This can help in judging whether the most recent dividends from these companies are likely to continue. If they do continue, the current estimated yields on annualized basis would be 1.79% for Microchip Technology Inc, 1.43% for Alaska Air Group, Inc., and 1.80% for MSA Safety Inc.In Wednesday trading, Microchip Technology Inc shares are currently off about 1.1%, Alaska Air Group, Inc. shares are down about 0.8%, and MSA Safety Inc shares are trading flat on the day.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Ex-Dividend Reminder: Microchip Technology, Alaska Air Group and MSA Safety@2017-05-17@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ex-dividend-reminder-microchip-technology-alaska-air-group-and-msa-safety-2017-05-17
"Chicago, IL - May 01, 2017 - Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Features:  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ).Semiconductor-related industries have been doing  good in 2017 that you'd think most of the profits have been made. Yet our  premium screen still has several chip companies with room to grow.So what is this screen all about? The parameters of this list include many of Zacks' best investment tools. Zacks Rank #1s and #2s? Check. Top 50% of the Zacks Industry Rank? Check. Zacks Growth Style Scores of As and Bs? Check. Plus, it also uses average broker ratings, positive surprises, favorable valuations and positive price momentum to round out its list.Below are three semiconductor-related companies from the list that are worth a look. (NASDAQ:  )A company that outperforms its industry is always worth noting, but it's all the more impressive when that industry is Semiconductor Equipment - Wafer Fabrication. The space is currently seventh out of 256 spots in the Zacks Industry Rank, which places it in the top 3%. Over the past year, it has returned more than 65%. But Applied Materials has soared more than 90% in that time, so it is really making the most out of its prosperous ""neighborhood"".AMAT has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 14 straight quarters. In fact, the only miss was back in August of 2013. In mid February, the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.5% while revenues jumped more than 45% year over year to $3.28 billion. New orders were up 86% to $4.24 billion. The company won't report again until mid-way through May, but it offered fiscal second quarter guidance ranges with midpoints that suggest revenue growth of 44% year over year and adjusted EPS growth of 124%.The long-term growth prospects for its silicon and display segments are encouraging for the future, especially since the strength of its industry is likely to continue. AMAT is a global leader in semiconductor equipment sales and, therefore, has a strong pipeline of enabling technologies and a very solid balance sheet. Analysts like what they see and boosted expectations after its latest report. Over the last three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for this fiscal year (ending October 2017) grew 10% to $2.65, while next fiscal year (ending October 2018) advanced 11.1% to $2.80. (NASDAQ:  )Shares of Ultra Clean Holdings soared by 13% yesterday in the wake of another strong quarterly performance for this semiconductor equipment services company. The stock continues to capitalize on the ""extraordinary"" demand for anything that has to do with semis. UCTT is part of the Electronics - Manufacturing Machinery space, which is ranked 15th out of 256 industries. In other words, it's in the top 6%.On Wednesday, the company reported adjusted earnings per share of 47 cents for the first quarter, which was nearly 12% better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate at 42 cents. UCTT has now beaten expectations in 11 of the past 12 quarters, including the last four with an average surprise of practically 28%. Revenue of $204.6 million was 82.3% better than last year and also beat Zacks expectations. Semiconductor revenue increased 80.4% from last year and 22.4% sequentially. Looking toward the second quarter, UCTT expects earnings between 49 cents and 55 cents with revenue at $210 million to $220 million.In just the past seven trading days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 has climbed 2.5% to $1.21 per share, while 2018 is up 5.5% in that time to $1.34. So for the moment, analysts expect next year to improve 10.7% over this year. We may see even more analyst activity in the days ahead following its solid quarterly performance. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased by 44% for this year and 39.6% for next. (NASDAQ:  )The semiconductor - analog & mixed area is another chip industry with a high position on the Zacks Industry Rank. Specifically, it is in the top 11% with the 28th spot out of 256 industries. It's year-to-date (YTD) return is approximately 9.83%. That's a respectable performance so far in 2017. But it's not as good as Microchip Technology, which is up approximately 19.6% YTD with an expanding product portfolio that suggests it can continue to outperform its industry and the overall market for the foreseeable future.MCHP is one of the fastest-growing providers of microcontrollers, specifically of the 16-bit and 32-bit types. Microcontrollers accounted for 63.1% of revenue in its fiscal third quarter, where net sales of $881.2 million soared by nearly 60% year over year. Earnings per share reached $1, or 23.5% better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of only 81 cents. MCHP is less than a dollar from its 52-week high of $77.32, and seems all set to move past that number given solid performances like this one.Over the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the year ended in March is up 13.2% to $3.60. Earnings estimates for the fiscal year ending March 2018 are up 16.8% to $4.24, which suggests a year-over-year improvement of more than 17.8%. MCHP is not expected to report again until after the close on May 9th. We are expecting 99 cents per share.Today you are invited to download the full, up-to-the-minute list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 ""Strong Buys"" free of charge.

At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the MCHP options chain for the new June 16th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $72.50 strike price has a current bid of $1.40. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $72.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $71.10 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of MCHP, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $75.23/share today.Because the $72.50 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 67%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.93% return on the cash commitment, or 15.32% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Microchip Technology Inc, and highlighting in green where the $72.50 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $77.50 strike price has a current bid of $1.30. If an investor was to purchase shares of MCHP stock at the current price level of $75.23/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $77.50. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 4.75% if the stock gets called away at the June 16th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if MCHP shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Microchip Technology Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing MCHP's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $77.50 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $77.50 strike represents an approximate 3% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 63%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.73% boost of extra return to the investor, or 13.71% annualized, which we refer to as the  .The implied volatility in the put contract example is 25%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 24%.

nvestors on the lookout for stocks that have the potential to offer the best growth as well as value investing may consider the growth at a reasonable price or GARP strategy.This well-liked strategy helps investors gain exposure to stocks that have impressive growth prospects but are trading at a discount. Unlike the blend strategy, a portfolio created on the GARP way of investing is expected to help find stocks that offer the best of both value and growth investing.The GARP approach prefers stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.Both strong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is also a tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the GARP strategy.Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.GARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics - price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios compared to value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. Moreover, the price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is another value metric that is considered.Using the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.Along with the criteria discussed in the above section, we have considered a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) to make the strategy foolproof. (Only Strong Buy and Buy-rated stocks can get through.) (Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business.) (Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks.) (P/E and P/B ratios less than that of the industry indicates that the stocks are undervalued.)These few criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only six.Here are four stocks that made it through the screen:Pasadena, CA-based  is the holding company for East West Bank, East West Capital Trust I, East West Capital Trust II and Risk Services Inc. The company has an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 9.35% and sports a Zacks Rank #1.

 (NASDAQ:  ) - The last time I reviewed MCHP was  , when I said that it looked cheap at $57, and that traders should consider buying it for a target of $64. But in January, the stock broke from $66.75 to consolidate in the mid-$70s before smashing through $74.50 last week.On Feb. 8 Standard & Poor's Capital IQ renewed its four-star Buy opinion on the stock and raised its 12-month target to $85 from $75. They also increased their fiscal year (March) 2017 estimate by 15 cents to $3.76 and their FY 2018 to $4.11 from $3.97. These changes were due to an earnings and top-line surprise in the December quarter when the company reported EPS of $1.05, which beat the Capital IQ consensus of 90 cents.Sales rose 0.8% above the September quarter due to higher microcontroller and analog revenues. S&P said in their February note that the  acquisition contributed to the earnings and revenue surprise.Last week's breakout is supported by fundamental and technical factors: Technically the breakout from $74.50 followed a premature high-volume breakout in February. After a one-day decline, MCHP consolidated for two months before breaking out last week from the consolidation at $72 to $74.50. Accumulation has been steady since February, and an MACD buy signal was triggered last week when the price broke through the 50-day moving average at about $73.Yesterday's close ($76.73) exceeded the February high at $76.50 and is predictive of a higher near-term ascent. Therefore traders may wish to capitalize on this favorable pattern by attempting to buy MCHP at $75 with a target of $85 for a proposed gain of over 13%.Click to EnlargeThe post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Trade of the Day: Microchip Technology Inc.

"emiconductor-related industries have been doing  good in 2017 that you'd think most of the profits have been made. Yet our  premium screen still has several chip companies with room to grow.So what is this screen all about? The parameters of this list include many of Zacks' best investment tools. Zacks Rank #1s and #2s? Check. Top 50% of the Zacks Industry Rank? Check. Zacks Growth Style Scores of As and Bs? Check. Plus, it also uses average broker ratings, positive surprises, favorable valuations and positive price momentum to round out its list.Below are three semiconductor-related companies from the list that are worth a look.A company that outperforms its industry is always worth noting, but it's all the more impressive when that industry is Semiconductor Equipment - Wafer Fabrication. The space is currently seventh out of 256 spots in the Zacks Industry Rank, which places it in the top 3%. Over the past year, it has returned more than 65%. But Applied Materials (AMAT) has soared more than 90% in that time, so it is really making the most out of its prosperous ""neighborhood"".AMAT has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 14 straight quarters. In fact, the only miss was back in August of 2013. In mid February, the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.5% while revenues jumped more than 45% year over year to $3.28 billion. New orders were up 86% to $4.24 billion. The company won't report again until mid-way through May, but it offered fiscal second quarter guidance ranges with midpoints that suggest revenue growth of 44% year over year and adjusted EPS growth of 124%.The long-term growth prospects for its silicon and display segments are encouraging for the future, especially since the strength of its industry is likely to continue. AMAT is a global leader in semiconductor equipment sales and, therefore, has a strong pipeline of enabling technologies and a very solid balance sheet. Analysts like what they see and boosted expectations after its latest report. Over the last three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for this fiscal year (ending October 2017) grew 10% to $2.65, while next fiscal year (ending October 2018) advanced 11.1% to $2.80. | Shares of Ultra Clean Holdings (UCTT) soared by 13% yesterday in the wake of another strong quarterly performance for this semiconductor equipment services company. The stock continues to capitalize on the ""extraordinary"" demand for anything that has to do with semis. UCTT is part of the Electronics - Manufacturing Machinery space, which is ranked 15th out of 256 industries. In other words, it's in the top 6%.On Wednesday, the company reported adjusted earnings per share of 47 cents for the first quarter, which was nearly 12% better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate at 42 cents. UCTT has now beaten expectations in 11 of the past 12 quarters, including the last four with an average surprise of practically 28%. Revenue of $204.6 million was 82.3% better than last year and also beat Zacks expectations. Semiconductor revenue increased 80.4% from last year and 22.4% sequentially. Looking toward the second quarter, UCTT expects earnings between 49 cents and 55 cents with revenue at $210 million to $220 million.In just the past seven trading days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 has climbed 2.5% to $1.21 per share, while 2018 is up 5.5% in that time to $1.34. So for the moment, analysts expect next year to improve 10.7% over this year. We may see even more analyst activity in the days ahead following its solid quarterly performance. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased by 44% for this year and 39.6% for next. | The semiconductor - analog & mixed area is another chip industry with a high position on the Zacks Industry Rank. Specifically, it is in the top 11% with the 28th spot out of 256 industries. It's year-to-date (YTD) return is approximately 9.83%. That's a respectable performance so far in 2017. But it's not as good as Microchip Technology (MCHP), which is up approximately 19.6% YTD with an expanding product portfolio that suggests it can continue to outperform its industry and the overall market for the foreseeable future.MCHP is one of the fastest-growing providers of microcontrollers, specifically of the 16-bit and 32-bit types. Microcontrollers accounted for 63.1% of revenue in its fiscal third quarter, where net sales of $881.2 million soared by nearly 60% year over year. Earnings per share reached $1, or 23.5% better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of only 81 cents. MCHP is less than a dollar from its 52-week high of $77.32, and seems all set to move past that number given solid performances like this one.Over the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the year ended in March is up 13.2% to $3.60. Earnings estimates for the fiscal year ending March 2018 are up 16.8% to $4.24, which suggests a year-over-year improvement of more than 17.8%. MCHP is not expected to report again until after the close on May 9th.

" .  is set to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings on May 9. We note that on average the company has delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the trailing four quarters, including a massive beat of 23.46% in the last quarter.Moreover, adjusted earnings (excluding stock-based compensation) advanced 64.1% year over year and 11.7% sequentially to $1.05 per share in the quarter. The strong growth was driven by higher net sales, which surged 59.6% from the year-ago quarter to $881.2 million. On a sequential basis, net sales increased almost 1%.The impressive result has helped the shares outperform the Zacks  industry on a year-to-date basis. Microchip has returned 17% while the industry has witnessed a gain of 7.7%.Meanwhile, the company revised sales and earnings guidance for the going-to-be-reported quarter in late February. The company now forecasts non-GAAP net sales to be in the range of down 0.5% to up 2.5% as compared with the earlier guidance range of down 1% to up 3%.Further, non-GAAP earnings are now expected to be in the range of $1.02-$1.10 per share compared with previous guidance range of $1.01-$1.11 per share. | Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Microchip's microcontroller business (63.1% of revenues) continues to outperform the industry and has enabled it to gain significant market share. Launch of new innovative products and frequent of updates of existing portfolio are also key catalysts.Recently launched products like - PIC18F ""K42"" family and hardware cryptography-enabled microcontroller - CEC1702 - are expected to boost the company's presence in high demanding markets of touch sensing, automotive, industrial control, Internet of Things (IoT), medical and white goods.Moreover, the memory business presents growth opportunities based on the expanding portfolio. We note that the newly introduced solution EERAM is a significant addition due to unlimited endurance and safe data storage in case of a power loss.However, our proven model does not conclusively show that Microchip is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below. : Microchip's Earnings ESP is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 99 cents per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . : Microchip carries a Zacks Rank #2, which when combined with Earnings ESP of 0.00%, makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some stocks which, as per our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Identiv  with an Earnings ESP of +6.67% and a Zacks Rank #2.

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the First Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF (Symbol: FTXL), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $26.36 per unit.With FTXL trading at a recent price near $24.00 per unit, that means that analysts see 9.82% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of FTXL's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Analog Devices Inc (Symbol: ADI), Microchip Technology Inc (Symbol: MCHP), and NVIDIA Corp (Symbol: NVDA). Although ADI has traded at a recent price of $76.87/share, the average analyst target is 18.61% higher at $91.18/share. Similarly, MCHP has 18.16% upside from the recent share price of $72.15 if the average analyst target price of $85.25/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting NVDA to reach a target price of $114.00/share, which is 17.15% above the recent price of $97.31. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of ADI, MCHP, and NVDA:Combined, ADI, MCHP, and NVDA represent 7.11% of the First Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF. Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
  
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past.

" recently collaborated with Renesas Electronics Corporation on a system-level 77/79-GHz RADAR sensor. The new radar sensor will offer better processing capabilities and reduce risks in advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) applications andautonomous driving vehicles.Coming to the price performance, over the last one year, shares of the company underperformed the Zacks characterized  industry. The stock returned 28.53% against the industry's gain of 29.94%.Analog Devices' new system-level sensor, 77/79-GHz RADAR, includes the RH850/V1R-M microcontroller (MCU) from the Renesas autonomy Platform and Drive360 advanced 28nm CMOS RF-to-bits technology.The new sensor is designed especially for applications in the automotive space that are safer and more connected. The technology used in these sensors will make driving safer by enabling earlier detection of smaller and faster moving objects at greater distances. It will also lower RADAR system integration efforts and reduce evaluation risks for automotive OEMs and Tier One suppliers.RADAR is sensor technologies that ADAS systems today are increasingly using to provide advanced safety features like forward collision warning, pedestrian detection, blind spot detection and autonomous driving mode. The new sensor is specifically designed keeping in mind the safety requirements and robustness in the automotive space.The company is witnessing steady improvement in certain fast-growing segments of the automotive market, which is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.8% between 2016 and 2022, according to a marketsandmarkets.com report.Analog Devices focuses on infotainment, safety and ADAS, body electronics (including lighting), hybrid electric vehicles and powertrain segments of the automotive market. The company has made significant progress on ADAS, shipping millions of chips to this market. The company intends to keep the momentum alive as the electronic content in cars (currently around $350 or 1% of average car price) continues to improve.Management's continuous collaboration with innovative brands, development of new technology along with a stronger foothold in Europe and China should benefit the company. We expect the company to leverage its already strong market position to penetrate deeper into the automotive market.The new deal with Renesas Electronics will enhance Analog Devices' differentiated product pipeline and is expected to improve its market share in the auto market. However, Analog Devices operates in an intensely competitive industry and companies such as Texas Instruments  give stiff competition.Currently, Analog Devices carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

 , an original equipment manufacturer of positioning, surveying and machine control products, recently acquired Canadian-based BOS Forestry. The financial details of the deal have been kept under wraps.The company's share price increased 22.61% in the last two years compared with the Zacks  industry's gain of 12.85%. This was largely backed by the company's aggressive merger and acquisition strategy.Acquisitions have helped Trimble to build a comprehensive portfolio, enter new markets and generate additional revenues.The acquisition of BOS Forestry complements Trimble's Connected Forest solutions that provide full raw materials lifecycle management solutions and is expected to boost the company's forestry division.The acquisition, effective immediately, will extend Trimble's capabilities in serving its customers in the forestry business. The deal will focus on advanced technologies for better forest management, traceability and processing of timber.BOS Forestry is a leading provider of forestry software. The company's suite of applications will provide processes for scale site, log load, yard inventory, contractor settlement, finished goods sales and distribution.The acquisitions appear to be a part of Trimble's bid to expand its international business, sustaining its focus on commercial applications that, while being more macro-sensitive, allow a more stable revenue stream and better profits.Trimble has added a large number of companies over the past few years. In 2014, 2015 and 2016, it acquired 10, five and three companies, respectively, as well as important assets of several others to complement its current business and capabilities.These acquisitions are small in comparison to Trimble, so there have been no integration issues. Rather, the acquisitions facilitated market expansion and revenue buildup. The company also forms joint ventures to build positions in strategic areas. We expect acquisitions to remain an important growth driver going ahead. | Currently, Trimble has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are ON Semiconductor Corporation  , Analog Devices  and Microchip Technology Incorporated  . Each of these stocks sporta a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see  .For the current year, estimates for ON Semiconductor were up 7.8% in the last 60 days.

"Aggregate short interest on the  companies rose for the third reporting period in a row. This is the first time that we've seen a build in short interest over three periods since May of 2016, ahead of a relatively short and fast correction in the market.We're taking a look at the model results from our short interest analysis of the S&P 500 companies to identify those that have the potential for short squeeze rallies as prices continue to edge higher. The table below identifies the top 15 companies that matched our short squeeze criteria. Today, the additions to total short interest represent some concern, as the market is showing weakness as we head into the first-quarter earnings season. That said, there are a number of companies that are showing signs that the ""wall of worry"" is strong enough to maintain their rallies.After that, we chose three companies to highlight, ones that look primed to push out their short sellers.They are, in no particular order…Home builders and home-building-related stocks have been on the rise as the outlook for the economy and consumer spending continue to improve.  (NYSE:  ) shares were one of those that spent the entirety of the last home-building-driven rally leading the market higher, and it looks ready to do it again.Click to Enlarge Leggett & Platt shares are only trading about 4% higher on a year-to-date basis, as the stock has been jammed in a trading range. The trading range has brought the short sellers into the mix, as we've seen short interest on LEG shares increase to their highest levels in more than two years.The current short interest represents roughly 10 times the average daily volume for Leggett & Platt stock, indicating an elevated probability that a short squeeze will occur - all that's needed is a trigger.That trigger may come in the form of a breakout of the stock's range. The stock is in the process of challenging $51. A move above this mark would break the top of the range that has been in place since December, triggering a potential covering rally. Our models are suggesting a target of $56 at the hands of short sellers covering their positions.Healthcare companies have been stuck in a rut as possible regulatory changes have been uncertain. The recent failure to replace Obamacare has resulted in some strength in the sector, including  (NASDAQ:  ) stock.Click to Enlarge Year-to-date, Cerner shares are up more than 25%, but you wouldn't know it by looking at the number of shares that have been shorted. Short sellers increased their bearish bets on the stock over the last two weeks by 4%. This took the current short interest to its highest readings in more than two years.The high short interest results in a short interest ratio of 8.8, or nearly 9 days to cover, which is above our model's trigger level indicating a higher-than-normal probability of a short covering rally.In Cerner's case, the price trigger for a covering rally appears to be any move above $60. The stock has spent the last two weeks bumping its head against this round numbered resistance, rejected each time.A break of $60 will start to shake the short sellers out of the stock as the chart's next target price is $65. Our model suggests a similar level for a short covering rally to target.The semiconductor sector has been on fire for more than a year, leading the technology and broader markets higher. Microchip Technology has been right there as the stock has gained more than 50% over the last twelve months and 15% so far in 2017.Click to Enlarge Microchip Technology is holding strong trendline support as the shares are above their 50-day moving average which is also trending higher. Our historical back testing shows that this combination is bullish for a stock over the intermediate-term (one-to-three-month) outlook.Short sellers aren't aware of the performance, though, as we've seen bets against Microchip Technology increase an incredible 50% since the beginning of the year, while the stock has been in strong rally mode. This builds a strong case for a short covering rally to move Microchip Technology even higher.The stock surged above $76 after its last earnings report, but quickly moved back below $74.50, which has acted as resistance since then. This level is the likely trigger price for a potential short covering rally.Microchip Technology won't announce earnings until May 3, but a ""buy the news"" rally is likely to occur before that date based on the company's performance last quarter. Given this, we would definitely expect to see them making a covering rally materialize over the next few weeks.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@3 Stocks About to Get Rocket Boosters from Short Sellers@2017-04-07@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-stocks-about-to-get-rocket-boosters-from-short-sellers-2017-04-07
"Chicago, IL - April 05, 2017 - Stocks in this week's article include  (NASDAQ:  -  ),  . (NASDAQ:  -  ),  (NYSE:  -  ),  (NASDAQ:  -  ) and  . (NYSE:  -  ).Growth at a reasonable price or GARP is the ideal strategy for investors on the hunt for stocks at bargain prices. This well-liked strategy helps investors gain exposure to stocks that have impressive growth prospects but are trading at a discount. Unlike the blend strategy, a portfolio created on the GARP way of investing is expected to have stocks that offer the best of both value and growth investing.The GARP strategy seeks to offer great returns by utilizing the best features of both value and growth investing. Investors adopting the GARP approach will prefer stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.Both strong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is also a tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the GARP strategy.Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.GARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics - price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios compared to value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. Moreover, the price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is another value metric that is considered.Using the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.Along with the criteria discussed in the above section, we have considered a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) to make the strategy foolproof. (Only Strong Buy and Buy-rated stocks can get through.) (Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business.) (Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks.) (P/E and P/B ratios less than that of the industry indicates that the stocks are undervalued.)These few criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only six.Here are five of the six stocks that made it through the screen: (NASDAQ:  -  ) develops and manufactures specialized semiconductor products for a wide variety of embedded control applications. The company has an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 12.2% and sports a Zacks Rank #1. You can see  .Microchip's one-year return of 50.6% is higher than the Zacks  industry's addition of 36.5%.Pasadena, CA-based  . (NASDAQ:  -  ) is the holding company for East West Bank, East West Capital Trust I, East West Capital Trust II and Risk Services Inc. This Zacks Rank #2 company has an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 7.63%.East West Bancorp's one-year return of 59.9% outpaces the Zacks  industry's addition of 42.7%.Los Angeles CA-based  (NYSE:  -  ) operates as a commercial real estate services and investment company. It has an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 8.24% and carries a Zacks Rank #2.Notably, CBRE rallied 16.6% in the last one year, while the Zacks  industry gained 8%.Toronto-based  (NASDAQ:  -  ) is a provider of commercial real estate services.

" (NASDAQ:  ) - I last reviewed MCHP on  and suggested that it be bought at $57 with a trading target of $64. Standard & Poor's recently raised their 12-month target to $85, and for long-term investors, that price may be achievable. However, traders have exceeded my original target and a retreat back to the 50-day moving average appears more likely than a breakout through the bullish resistance line at about $75.This mid-cap semiconductor company supplies micro-controllers and analog and other semiconductor products to many companies specializing in high-volume embedded control applications. The company is on a March fiscal year and reported $1.49 in FY 2016.S&P increased their earnings estimate for FY 2017 from $3.61 to $3.76 and FY 2018 from $3.97 to $4.11. As a result, they have retained a five-star ""strong buy"" on MCHP. They see order improvement and view the recent completion of the Atmel acquisition as being highly accretive and boosting MCHP's microcontroller portfolio.S&P also projects that the company will gain share in the 8- and 16-bit and 32-bit markets. The stock pays a dividend of $1.44 providing a dividend yield of 2%.Technically, the stock is in a bull market after breaking from a double top in May on high volume (not shown). The break followed several consolidations, all holding at the 50-day moving average (blue line), which is where I recommended the stock on Sept. 14.A right triangle's resistance line was broken by buyers in January, and the trend evolved into a narrow bull channel with support at the 20-day moving average (green line). The green line flattened, and late last week volume fell to below average, and the MACD indicator issued a sell signal at midweek. These technical signals suggest that a consolidation below the bull channel is likely, thus my suggestion to sell MCHP at $73.50-plus.If MCHP falls below $70, traders should review it for a potential purchase. Now, however, this stock has achieved our goal and should be sold.Click to EnlargeThe post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Trade of the Day: Microchip Technology Inc.

 is firing on all cylinders, which is evident from the stock's gain of 64.2% in the last one year, which comfortably surpassed the Zacks  industry's increase of 41.3%. The outperformance is more obvious when compared with S&P 500 market that has gained 18.1% in the same period.The significant upside can be attributable to the company's expanding product portfolio, improving end markets, completion of the Fairchild acquisition along with diversification across end markets & geographies.Notably, the addition of Fairchild has positively impacted revenues, which jumped 33% sequentially and 50.1% year over year to $1.26 billion in fourth-quarter 2016. (Read More:  )We believe that ON Semi's planned focus on smartphone, automotive and industrial end markets is a key catalyst.

he semiconductor industry has been red hot since Election Day. A shifting tech landscape is creating huge new surges in demand, helping to boost pricing and underpin strength across the industry. There are two very popular ways to invest in semiconductors. You either buy the actual chip designing companies themselves or you can buy companies that do the manufacturing. While the reward may be greater by buying the chip designers, there is still a huge opportunity on the manufacturing side.One of these companies that helps on the design and manufacturing end is today's  Microchip Technology Inc. is a leading provider of microcontroller and analog semiconductors, providing low-risk product development, lower total system cost and faster time to market for thousands of diverse customer applications worldwide. Headquartered in Chandler, Arizona, Microchip offers outstanding technical support along with dependable delivery and quality.They just reported quarterly results exceeding the high end of original guidance in revenue, Gross Margins and EPS.

Three analysts increased their EPS estimates for the current quarter, next quarter, current year and next year. The bullish attitude pushed up our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter up from 83 cents to 99 cents.

"In more car showrooms, consumers are hearing a high-tech sales pitch. And, it's not just about having a DVD player for kids.The next car that consumers buy will have more electronics packed into it than ever and many semiconductor companies - with  (  ),  (  ),  (  ),  (  ),  (  ) and  (QCOM) among them - aim to take advantage.Consumers nowadays figure on crash air bags, anti-lock brakes, and perhaps even onboard navigation systems as standard features. More vehicles are being equipped with ADAS (automated driver assistance systems) that improve safety, as well as having infotainment and internet-connected technology.That rising market is part of what has continued to drive chip stocks higher this year as many leading industries have paused their year-end rallies, or pulled back while the political environment establishes some clearer momentum.Stocks like Nvidia, Maxim and On Semi are pecking away at new highs. Microchip spiked more than 6% to a new high on Wednesday, following a healthy Q3 report.Automotive is a relatively small piece, about 10%, of the global semiconductor market. But Gartner Group forecasts that automotive semiconductor revenue will grow through 2020 at twice the rate of the overall chip market.Some chipmakers are using acquisitions to gain traction in automotive, which ""is a horrible market to break into,"" said Malcolm Penn, CEO of consultancy Future Horizons.""The automotive market is probably the hottest market right now,"" said Penn. ""More electronics is going into cars, for safety and other reasons. Automakers want cars to be better performers and that takes electronics. But, it takes a long time to break into the market and market share doesn't change quickly. Pricing is demanding. Automakers want the highest performance at the lowest possible cost.""ADAS provides lane-keeping assist, automatic braking, adaptive cruise control, blind-spot alerts, and other features. ADAS requires more sensors and data-crunching processing power, says Chris Webber, analyst at Strategy Analytics.""ADAS is the real growth driver in automotive right now,"" said Webber, adding that self-driving cars will be a more formidable goal. ""It will be a long and evolutionary road to truly autonomous vehicles on the main highways and city streets.""As it stands, luxury cars have about $1,000 worth of built-in silicon, midrange cars about $350 to $400 and low-end models about $100, says John Pitzer, analyst at Credit Suisse. As ADAS and other features become options and then standard, low- and midrange cars will close the silicon gap. Luxury cars, meanwhile, will evolve to feature even more advanced safety bells-and-whistles.""Electronics are becoming an important differentiator at the point-of-sale (in showrooms),"" Pitzer said in a report.Gartner projects that the automotive chip market will grow 6.2% in 2017, to $34.3 billion, and 7.2% in 2018, to $36.8 billion - though it also recently increased its forecast for the overall semiconductor chip market owing to higher memory chip prices for suppliers like  (MU).Many chipmakers are banking on future growth from automotive.  (NXPI) grabbed a large piece of auto market share with its $11.8 billion acquisition of Freescale Semiconductor in 2015. Qualcomm piggybacked on the strategy, announcing in October that it would acquire NXP for $47 billion.Following the Freescale deal, NXP garners over 40% of revenue from sales to the automotive industry. Some 34% of revenue at ON Semiconductor comes from automotive, 25% at Microchip, 19% at Maxim Integrated and 15% at Texas Instruments, says a Citigroup report.The growth rates of those revenues are well above industry average in many cases. Nvidia's automotive revenue rose 52% in fiscal 2017, according to results reported after Thursday's close. Texas Instruments' auto sales jumped 23% to $4 billion in 2016. Maxim's automotive revenue will rise nearly 20% in fiscal 2017 to over $450 million, estimates RBC Capital.Citigroup has estimated that Nvidia's auto revenue will hit $1 billion in 2018, owing largely to a partnership with Germany's Audi.From its roots in producing chips for car infotainment systems, Nvidia expanded into ADAS safety technology. It's now pushing into more complex, self-driving cars.Nvidia's powerful processors are well-suited for the AI - artificial intelligence - software that enables ADAS systems. Self-driving cars map and monitor their surroundings to detect hazards. At the Consumer Electronics Show in early January, Nvidia and Germany's Bosch said they would team up to develop cars that can sense when drivers are falling asleep or texting on phones.""It's going to take an enormous amount of engineering to transform the entire automotive industry into an autonomous industry,"" Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang said in a CES keynote address.Gartner forecasts that 18% of automobiles produced in 2020 will be equipped with ADAS, up from 7% in 2015.JPMorgan forecasts that the autonomous driving market will boom to $7.3 billion by 2025. Harlan Sur, a JPMorgan analyst, estimates that during that period ADAS-related chip content will increase by $300 to $400 per vehicle.ADAS requires sensors and ""analog"" chips to monitor real-world driving conditions, digital processing for mapping, and microprocessors to take over driving functions when needed, Sur says.""We believe winners in our semi universe for autonomous driving will include  (MBLY), NXP, Nvidia,  (INTC), ON Semiconductor,  (XLNX),  (CY), Texas Instruments, Microchip, and Maxim,"" said Sur in a report.Xilinx's programmable chips are used for prototyping next-generations ADAS platforms, for example.For semiconductor firms, the automotive market is much different from wireless or consumer electronics. For starters, there's volume to consider.Smartphones are a huge-volume market, with roughly 1.5 billion units sold worldwide last year. Global auto sales meanwhile inched up last year to around 88-89 million units.Chip content within the auto industry is growing at a faster rate than actual auto sales and is just in the early innings, says Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer.""Semi content growth is outpacing unit growth, a trend we see as sustainable as vehicles transition from mechanical to increasing electronic,"" Schafer wrote in a report.Many chipmakers live or die based on whether their devices are built into the latest  (AAPL) iPhone, with new versions rolled out annually. Such ""socket"" wins are harder to come by as Apple and its rival Samsung design more of their own chips in-house.In automotive, though, design cycles take years. Chips, modules and subsystems are designed to handle harsh conditions with 100% reliability. The payoff? Popular models also stay in production for years.""The growth and stability of the automotive market has not been lost on semiconductor vendors, like Nvidia and Qualcomm,"" said Webber at Strategy Analytics.Qualcomm's purchase of NXP, the industry's biggest acquisition in 2016, is expected to close in Q1. After the Freescale merger, NXP is the biggest seller of automotive chips, followed by Germany's  (IFNNY), Japan's Renesas, STM and Texas Instruments.Acquiring NXP diversifies Qualcomm's customer base as wireless competition intensifies and it's mired in a legal spat with Apple over licensing fees.""There's no doubt acquisitions and consolidation will continue as well as entry opportunities for niche technology vendors,"" added Webber.Automotive market share has also been a leading motive in other deals.  (ADI) in July gobbled up Linear Technology for $14.8 billion. Almost one-fourth of Linear's revenue comes from automotive customers. In September, Renesas agreed to pay $3.2 billion for  (ISIL).Texas Instruments, with its focus on industrial and automotive, is a possible consolidator, says Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer.Dave Pahl, Texas Instruments VP of investor relations, on its Q4 earnings call said the company expects that ""industrial and automotive will be the fastest-growing semiconductor markets due to their increasing semiconductor content.""""These are long-tail type of design wins and revenue streams,"" he said, indicating that products tend to have a long life, in environments with slow redesign cycles. ""And … we're not just seeing growth in one sector or at one customer,"" he added, referring to the auto market.Texas Instruments has the highest dividend growth in semiconductors, says a Citigroup report, so it's looking for long-term bets like autos.The auto opportunity for semiconductor firms goes beyond ADAS and autonomous vehicles, says Webber at Strategy Analytics.South Korea's Samsung, one of the biggest smartphone makers, in October agreed to buy U.S. auto-parts supplier Harman International Industries (HAR) for $8 billion. Harmon makes infotainment systems and connected-car technology. Japan's Panasonic in December bought ZKW Group for $880 million.Another area of automotive opportunity, Webber says, is the emergence of powertrains built for electric and hybrid vehicles. Powertrains, which control engines and handle other tasks, account for about 30% of all chip content in cars.Powertrain chip revenue will grow more than 7% annually to $7.68 billion in 2020, says Strategy Analytics. Infineon, STMicroelectronics and NXP are the biggest providers of powertrain technology, followed by Germany's Bosch and Texas Instruments.Gartner forecasts that in-vehicle infotainment systems will be included in 22% of cars by 2020, up from 13% in 2015. Infotainment systems, about a $6.5 billion market, account for about 25% of chip content in autos. Automakers are pushing to add music, internet and wireless features, since they charge $3,000 and up for infotainment and navigation packages.Many semiconductor firms, such as Maxim, sell chips into different categories. Maxim makes chips for infotainment, battery management and other areas. Maxim has told analysts that it has 20 auto customers above $10 million in annual revenue.

"Shutterstock photoIn more car showrooms, consumers are hearing a high-tech sales pitch. And, it's not just about having a DVD player for kids.The next car that consumers buy will have more electronics packed into it than ever and many semiconductor companies - with  (  ),  (  ),  (  ),  (  ),  (  ) and  (QCOM) among them - aim to take advantage.Consumers nowadays figure on crash air bags, anti-lock brakes, and perhaps even onboard navigation systems as standard features. More vehicles are being equipped with ADAS (automated driver assistance systems) that improve safety, as well as having infotainment and internet-connected technology.That rising market is part of what has continued to drive chip stocks higher this year as many leading industries have paused their year-end rallies, or pulled back while the political environment establishes some clearer momentum.Stocks like Nvidia, Maxim and On Semi are pecking away at new highs. Microchip spiked more than 6% to a new high on Wednesday, following a healthy Q3 report.Automotive is a relatively small piece, about 10%, of the global semiconductor market. But Gartner Group forecasts that automotive semiconductor revenue will grow through 2020 at twice the rate of the overall chip market.Some chipmakers are using acquisitions to gain traction in automotive, which ""is a horrible market to break into,"" said Malcolm Penn, CEO of consultancy Future Horizons.""The automotive market is probably the hottest market right now,"" said Penn.

rowth at a reasonable price or GARP is the ideal strategy for investors on the hunt for stocks at bargain prices. This well-liked strategy helps investors gain exposure to stocks that have impressive growth prospects but are trading at a discount. Unlike the blend strategy, a portfolio created on the GARP way of investing is expected to have stocks that offer the best of both value and growth investing.The GARP strategy seeks to offer great returns by utilizing the best features of both value and growth investing. Investors adopting the GARP approach will prefer stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.Both strong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is also a tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the GARP strategy.Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.GARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics - price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios compared to value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. Moreover, the price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is another value metric that is considered.Using the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.Along with the criteria discussed in the above section, we have considered a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) to make the strategy foolproof. (Only Strong Buy and Buy-rated stocks can get through.) (Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business.) (Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks.) (P/E and P/B ratios less than that of the industry indicates that the stocks are undervalued.)These few criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only six.Here are five of the six stocks that made it through the screen: develops and manufactures specialized semiconductor products for a wide variety of embedded control applications.

"Chicago, IL - February 27, 2017 - Stocks in this week's article include  (NASDAQ:  -  ),  (NYSE:  -  ),  (NASDAQ:  -  ),  (NASDAQ:  -  ) and  (NASDAQ:  -  ).Richard Driehaus, better known as the pioneer of momentum investing, developed a ""buy high and sell higher"" strategy. The best thing about Driehaus' strategy is that it has the potential to yield impressive returns. Notably, the success of the investing strategy earned Driehaus a place in Barron's All-Century Team.The American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) proved that the strategy has the potential to offer high returns. AAII's portfolio, which was developed following the strategy, returned 13.5% and 18.1% in the five- and 10- year timeframe, respectively, compared with -1.1% and 4.2% returns registered by the S&P 500. Thus, investors with high risk appetite may think of using the Driehaus strategy to boost their portfolio returns.Regarding the strategy, Driehaus once said: ""I would much rather invest in a stock that's increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that's already in a decline and try to guess when it will turn around."" In line with this insight, AAII took into account the percentage 50-day moving average as one of the key criteria before designing a portfolio based on Driehaus' philosophy.It is calculated by dividing the numerator (month-end price minus 50-day moving average of month-end price) by the 50-day moving average of the month-end price. Another momentum indicator - positive relative strength - has also been included. A positive percentage 50-day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50-day moving average level, indicating an uptrend.Moreover, AAII found that Driehaus primarily focused on strong earnings growth rates and impressive earnings projections to pick potential outperformers. Companies with a strong history of beating estimates are also given importance in this strategy, which was made to provide better returns over the long term.In order to make the strategy more profitable, we have considered only stocks that have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a momentum score of 'A' or 'B.' Our research shows that stocks with a  of 'A' or 'B' when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.(Only Strong Buy-rated stocks can get through. You can see  .)• (Strong EPS growth history ensures improving business.)• (Higher EPS growth compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks.)• (Positive EPS surprise indicates potential.)• (High % 50-day moving average and relative strength signal uptrend.)• (Favorable momentum score indicates that it is ideal to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success.)These few parameters narrowed down the universe of over 7,896 stocks to only 19.Here are five of the 19 stocks that passed the screen: (NASDAQ:  -  ) distributes swimming pool supplies and related products in South America, North America, Australia and Europe.

"hares of  declined more than 3% in the last couple of trading sessions following the company's fourth-quarter 2016 results. The fall apparently exhibited investor disappointment in first-quarter 2017 guidance, which forecasts revenue decline on a sequential basis.The company reported adjusted earnings (including stock-based compensation) of 40 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a nickel. Notably, the company registered an earnings beat after two consecutive misses.Moreover, earnings (excluding stock-based compensation) surged 27.5% from the year-ago quarter to 65 cents per share. The year-over-year growth in earnings was primarily driven by top-line growth and margin expansion. | Revenues advanced 19.2% year over year to $103.6 million. Gross and operating margin expanded 50 basis points (bps) and 600 bps, respectively driven by higher top-line base and stringent cost control measures.In 2016, earnings climbed 21.7% to $2.30 per share driven by revenue growth of 16.7%, which totaled $388.7 million. The company stated that the year-over-year revenue growth compared favorably with the analog industry, which SIA estimates grew 5.8% over 2015.However, we note that the revenue growth failed to boost share price return in the last one year.

"ichard Driehaus, better known as the pioneer of momentum investing, developed a ""buy high and sell higher"" strategy. The best thing about Driehaus' strategy is that it has the potential to yield impressive returns. Notably, the success of the investing strategy earned Driehaus a place in Barron's All-Century Team.The American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) proved that the strategy has the potential to offer high returns. AAII's portfolio, which was developed following the strategy, returned 13.5% and 18.1% in the five- and 10- year timeframe, respectively, compared with -1.1% and 4.2% returns registered by the S&P 500. Thus, investors with high risk appetite may think of using the Driehaus strategy to boost their portfolio returns.Regarding the strategy, Driehaus once said: ""I would much rather invest in a stock that's increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that's already in a decline and try to guess when it will turn around."" In line with this insight, AAII took into account the percentage 50-day moving average as one of the key criteria before designing a portfolio based on Driehaus' philosophy.It is calculated by dividing the numerator (month-end price minus 50-day moving average of month-end price) by the 50-day moving average of the month-end price. Another momentum indicator - positive relative strength - has also been included. A positive percentage 50-day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50-day moving average level, indicating an uptrend.Moreover, AAII found that Driehaus primarily focused on strong earnings growth rates and impressive earnings projections to pick potential outperformers. Companies with a strong history of beating estimates are also given importance in this strategy, which was made to provide better returns over the long term.In order to make the strategy more profitable, we have considered only stocks that have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a momentum score of 'A' or 'B'. Our research shows that stocks with a  of 'A' or 'B' when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.(Only Strong Buy-rated stocks can get through. You can see  .)• (Strong EPS growth history ensures improving business.)• (Higher EPS growth compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks.)• (Positive EPS surprise indicates potential.)• (High % 50-day moving average and relative strength signal uptrend.)• (Favorable momentum score indicates that it is ideal to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success.)These few parameters narrowed down the universe of over 7,896 stocks to only 19.Here are five of the 19 stocks that passed the screen: distributes swimming pool supplies and related products in South America, North America, Australia and Europe.The company has a Momentum Score of 'A' and an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 19.9%. is engaged in providing commercial real estate financial services in the U.S. The company has a Momentum Score of 'A' and an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 29.8%. is involved in operating as a global engineering and science consulting company.The company has a Momentum Score of B' and an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 9.4%. develops and manufactures specialized semiconductor products for a wide variety of embedded control applications.

"f there's one drawback of this epic bull market run, it's the feeling that all the profits have been made. How can you possibly make any money when the indices are almost daily making new highs? Well, if you can break out of the ""buy low, sell high"" mentality, then you'll find that a stock nearing its 52-week high does not mean it has run out of gas.The  premium screen can help you find those companies that have been moving upward…and should continue to do so. Along with the Zacks Rank and positive momentum parameters, this screen also seeks out stocks that have market-beating relative price strength and are trading in the top third of their 52-week price range.At the moment, there are 53 stocks that have passed this screen. That's 53 Zacks Rank #1s that are enjoying strong buying demand and are outpacing the market. Today's article highlights just three of them. When you're done reading these profiles, make sure you go to the screen for a look at its parameters and the full list. (  )You've probably heard that semiconductors is one of the best spaces in the market these days. For example, the semiconductor - analog & mixed area is in the top 7% of the Zacks Industry Rank with the 18th spot out of more than 256 industries. It's year-to-date (YTD) return is approximately 10.3%. That's a great performance so far in 2017. But it's not as good as Microchip Technology (MCHP). The stock is up approximately 12.4% YTD, and its expanding product portfolio suggests that it can continue to outperform its industry and the overall market for the foreseeable future.MCHP is one of the fastest-growing providers of microcontrollers, specifically of the 16-bit and 32-bit types. Microcontrollers accounted for 63.1% of revenue in its fiscal third quarter, where net sales of $881.2 million soared by nearly 60% year over year. Earnings per share reached $1, or 23.5% better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of only 81 cents. MCHP is still a few dollars below its 52-week high of $76.50, and seems all set to move past that number given solid performances like this one.Three of 4 covering analysts raised estimates for this year and next over the past 30 days. In that timeframe, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the year ending this month jumped 13.2% to $3.60. Earnings estimates for the fiscal year ending March 2018 are up 16.3% to $4.22, which suggests a year-over-year improvement of more than 17.2%. Earlier this week, MCHP narrowed its consolidated net sales guidance for the current quarter to between a loss of 0.5% and a gain of 2.5%, leaving the mid-point expectation unchanged at a 1% advance. |  (  )NetApp Inc. (NTAP) is a leading provider of innovative data management solutions that simplify the complexity of storing, managing, protecting and retaining enterprise data. OK, so in other words it's a data storage company, which means its part of a space in the top 9% of the Zacks Industry Rank. Specifically, it's number 23 out of 256. But much like Microchip Tech, this stock is beating its lofty industry year to date. NetApp is up approximately 18% so far in 2017, while the computer - storage devices industry has increased only 15.4%.The company is gaining a lot of ground with its flash-based solutions, which grew 160% in the quarter. One of its newest products was the NetAppTMAll Flash FAS (AFF) A200, an entry-level system that delivers enterprise-grade flash performance with an eye toward midsize businesses that are making the move to all flash. Such products helped the company report a solid fiscal third quarter, which included a 22% positive surprise and net revenues of $1.4 billion that improved 1% year over year. Its net revenues outlook for the current quarter is between $1.37 billion and $1.52 billion, giving it an excellent chance to beat expectations.Since the quarterly announcement in mid-April, analysts have been jumping at the chance to raise NTAP's earnings estimates. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this fiscal year, ending next month, improved 9.4% in the past 30 days to $2.09. Out of 12 covering analysts, nine of them raised estimates while none lowered. Earnings estimates for next fiscal year, ending April 2018, are up 11.7% in that time to $2.39 with 10 analysts boosting expectations. Therefore, next fiscal year is currently expected to grow by 14.4%. |  (  )You have to go back to July of 2014 to find a quarter where Owens Corning (OC) failed to beat expectations. This construction materials company is on a 10-quarter winning streak. Most recently, it beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 18% in its fourth quarter report from early February. The past four quarters has seen an average positive surprise of 35.1%. For all of 2016, adjusted earnings per share of $3.63 were an improvement on the previous year's $2.57. Revenue in the quarter topped expectations by 5% to $1.38 billion, while the full year saw an improvement of 6% to $5.7 billion from the previous year.All covering analysts raised their estimates for this year over the past 30 days, sending the Zacks Consensus Estimate higher by 4.9% to $3.89. Analysts are also raising for 2018, but the uptrend is not as dramatic. Still, Owens Corning is expected to earn $4.31 next year, which would mark a 10.8% improvement over 2017. Looking forward, the company stated that it ""expects an environment (in 2017) consistent with consensus expectations for U.S. housing starts and moderate global industrial production growth"".OC is big in insulation, roofing and siding products, along with other building materials systems and composite solutions. The company is up nearly 25% since the election. Interestingly though, its industry (building products - misc) is not highly ranked at the moment. Perhaps more specifics from President Trump on his infrastructure plans will help this space along moving forward. For now, OC remains the only Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) in its industry and enjoys a Zacks VGM Score of A. | Zacks' Aggressive Growth Strategist Brian Bolan explores autonomous cars in our latest Special Report, Driverless Cars: Your Roadmap to Mega-Profits Today.

 reported third-quarter fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings (including stock-based compensation) of $1.00 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 19 cents.Adjusted earnings (excluding stock-based compensation) advanced 64.1% year over year and 11.7% sequentially to $1.05 per share in the quarter. Atmel contributed 21 cents much better than management's expectation of 13-17 cents.The strong growth was also driven by higher net sales, which surged 59.6% from the year-ago quarter to $881.2 million. On a sequential basis, net sales increased almost 1%.We note that Microchip has outperformed the Zacks  industry in the last one-year. While the stock has gained 85.2%, the industry returned 59% over the same period. We believe that the better-than-expected result will help the stock to sustain momentum in the rest of fiscal 2017.In terms of product line, microcontroller business (63.1% of net sales) inched up 0.3% sequentially driven by robust performance from 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontroller businesses.

Europe and Americas contributed 22.7% and 18.7%, respectively.Microchip posted adjusted gross margin (including stock-based compensation) of 57.5%, which contracted 10 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis. Atmel gross margin improved 50 bps sequentially.Non-GAAP operating expenses declined 400 bps to 27.2%, primarily due to lower research & development (R&D) and selling, general & administrative (SG&A), which declined 260 bps and 130 bps, respectively.As a result, non-GAAP operating margin expanded 390 bps from the year-ago quarter. Atmel achieved operating margins of more than 26% in the quarter. | Cash generated in the reported quarter was $290.8 million as compared with $211.2 million at the end of Sep 30. As of Dec 31, cash and total investment position was $669.6 million as compared with $490.8 million.Microchip's borrowings under revolving line of credit were $1.683 billion, up $5 million from the prior-quarter level.Leverage continues to improve with net debt-to-EBITDA at 2.47 down from 2.91 at the end of the September quarter.Microchip forecasts fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 net sales to be in the range of $872-$908 million, which reflects a range of -1% to 3% growth on a sequential basis.Gross margin was anticipated to in the range of 58-58.5%, operating expense as percentage of 24-25% and operating margin 33-34.4%. Earnings are expected to be in the range of $1.01-$1.11 per share for the quarter.

ooking at the universe of stocks we cover at  , in trading on Thursday, shares of Microchip Technology Inc (Symbol: MCHP) were yielding above the 2% mark based on its quarterly dividend (annualized to $1.444), with the stock changing hands as low as $70.79 on the day. Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return. To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) back on 12/31/1999 - you would have paid $146.88 per share. Fast forward to 12/31/2012 and each share was worth $142.41 on that date, a decrease of $4.67/share over all those years. But now consider that you collected a whopping $25.98 per share in dividends over the same period, for a positive total return of 23.36%. Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.6%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 2% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable. Microchip Technology Inc (Symbol: MCHP) is an S&P 500 company, giving it special status as one of the large-cap companies making up the S&P 500 Index.In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Microchip Technology Inc, looking at the history chart for MCHP below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 2% annual yield.    According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, MCHP makes up 4.04% of the iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (Symbol: SOXX) which is trading lower by about 0.7% on the day Thursday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Microchip Technology (MCHP) Shares Cross 2% Yield Mark@2017-02-09@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/microchip-technology-mchp-shares-cross-2-yield-mark-2017-02-09
The Zacks Research Daily features the best research output of our analyst team. In today's write-up, we are featuring analyst reports on 16 major stocks, including reports on Dow Chemical (DOW), Shell (RDS.A) and HSBC Holdings (HSBC). These reports have been hand-picked from amongst the 70 or so stock research reports published by our analyst team today. You can see all of today's research reports In addition to these stock research reports, we are also giving you a real-time scorecard of the ongoing Q4 earnings season. We have a long history of closely monitoring earnings releases and presenting our analysis of emerging aggregate trends in the weekly Earnings Trends and Earnings Preview reports.Our latest Earnings Trends report is: Including all of this morning's releases, we now have Q4 results from 346 S&P 500 members, or 69.1% of the index's total membership. Total earnings for the 346 index members that have reported results already are up +5.8% on +4.6% higher revenues, with 68.8% beating EPS estimates and 53.8% beating revenue estimates.This is better earnings and revenue growth performance than we have seen from this group of 346 S&P 500 members in other recent periods, even after adjusting for the strong growth from the Finance sector (earnings growth would be +4.2% excluding the Finance sector on +4.4% higher revenues). The charts below compare the Q4 growth pace with what we had seen from the same group of 346 index members in other recent periods (right-hand chart shows ex-Finance numbers).The proportion of companies beating EPS and revenue estimates, however, is tracking below other recent periods. Only 40.5% of the index members are able to beat EPS and revenue estimates, which compares to 48% in the preceding quarter for the same sample of 346 S&P 500 members (the 4-quarter average is 45.7% & the 12-quarter average is 45%), as the chart below shows.The proportion of companies beating EPS and revenue estimates, however, is tracking below other recent periods. Only 40.5% of the index members are able to beat both EPS and revenue estimates, which compares to 48% in the preceding quarter for the same sample of 346 S&P 500 members (the 4-quarter average is 45.7% & the 12-quarter average is 45%), as the chart below shows.Looking at Q4 as a whole, combining the actual results from the 346 index members with estimates from the still-to-come 154 companies, total earnings are expected to be up +7.4% from the same period last year on +3.9% higher revenues. This is the best earnings and revenue growth pace in two years. Importantly, the strong Q4 growth is not a function of easy comparisons, but rather a result of actual gains. The fact is total earnings for the S&P 500 index are on track to reach an all-time quarterly record, surpassing the level achieved in 2014 Q4.The chart below shows the expected Q4 earnings tally for the index contrasted with what was actually earned in the preceding 8 quarters and what is expected to come in the following 4.Estimates for the current period (2017 Q1) are holding up fairly well; they are coming down, but not at the pace as would typically expected. Total earnings for the index are currently expected to be up +7.9% in Q1, which is down from +10.3% on January 4th. shares have gained +10.3% over the past three months, outperforming the Zacks Chemicals industry (up +7.6% over the same period), with the company's better-than-expected Q4 results helping sustain the stock's positive momentum. The Zacks analyst likes the imrpoved outlook for the company's core end-use markets and management's cost-cutting and aggressive portfolio management actions. The company is moving forward with its planned mega-merger with DuPont, which is expected to create significant synergies. However, Dow's agriculture business remains affected by depressed crop commodity prices. (You can  ) shares have modestly outperformed the Zacks Integrated Oil industry over the past one year (up +25.7% vs. +22.2% gainf for the industry). While the integrated behemoth's upstream unit swung to a Q4 profit from a year-ago loss, overall earnings fell far below estimates. The Zacks analyst likes the company's expense management and progress on its large divestment program. The most important take away from the earnings release was the remarkable speed of its BG integration that contributed significantly to production volumes. Still, there is limited upside potential for shares as weak downstream operations will hamper RDS.A's near-term results. (You can  )Strong Buy rated  shares outperformed the Zacks categorized Foreign Banks industry over the least six months, gaining +22% vs +17.5%. The Zacks analyst likes its extensive global network, strong capital position and a solid asset growth. Also, the company's plans to execute share buyback program and keep the dividend payout intact act as catalysts. Further, continued disposal of unprofitable/non-core operations has been successful in enhancing its efficiency, as operating costs continue to decline. Nonetheless, estimates have been going down ahead of the company's 2016 earnings release given the concern related to a dismal European economy, weak loan demand, litigation expenses and stringent regulations.

hareholders of Microchip Technology Inc (Symbol: MCHP) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 2.1% annualized dividend yield can sell the July covered call at the $67.50 strike and collect the premium based on the $4.20 bid, which annualizes to an additional 12.8% rate of return against the current stock price (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ), for a total of 15% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $67.50 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but MCHP shares would have to advance 0.5% from current levels for that to happen, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 6.7% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Microchip Technology Inc, looking at the dividend history chart for MCHP below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 2.1% annualized dividend yield.Below is a chart showing MCHP's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $67.50 strike highlighted in red:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the July covered call at the $67.50 strike gives good reward for the risk of having given away the upside beyond $67.50.

"nvestors in Microchip Technology Inc (Symbol: MCHP) saw new options begin trading this week, for the March 17th expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the MCHP options chain for the new March 17th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $67.50 strike price has a current bid of $1.90. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $67.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $65.60 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of MCHP, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $68.67/share today.Because the $67.50 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 58%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of MCHP stock at the current price level of $68.67/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $70.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 4.49% if the stock gets called away at the March 17th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if MCHP shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Microchip Technology Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing MCHP's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $70.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $70.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

" is set to release third-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings on Feb 7. We note that on average the company has delivered positive earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters, including a massive beat of 18.42% in the last quarter.Moreover, earnings of 90 cents per share jumped 52.5% from the year-ago quarter primarily driven by strong revenue growth. Following the news, shares jumped more than 6%.However, in late Nov 2016, the company revised its sales and earnings guidance for the yet-to-be-reported quarter. Non-GAAP net sales were projected to decline in the range of 1-4% with the mid-point to decrease 2.5% compared with the earlier guidance range of flat to down 6% with the mid-point declining 3%.Further, non-GAAP earnings were expected to be in the range of 87-94 cents per share compared with previous guidance range of 85-89 cents per share. | The narrowed guidance reflected the positive impact from the acquisitions of Atmel and Micrel. The closure of Micrel's 6-inch fab was also anticipated to drive gross margin expansion owing to higher cost inventory from the closed facility was sold and company realized sales from its low cost higher volume factories.Despite the raised earnings guidance shares dropped a massive 7.5% on Dec 1, 2016, reflecting uncertainty and lack of visibility over Trump administration's economic policy and its impact on the technology sector. We believe that these factors will impact company's results in the third quarter.However, we note that the shares have rebounded in the first month of 2017. On a year-to-date basis, Microchip has gained 7.3% as compared with the Zacks  Industry's return of 4.7%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.We believe that Microchip's growing influence in the automotive segment is a key catalyst. Our view is supported by the fact that many automotive companies like Aston Martin, Pagani Automobili, Audi and Daimler are using Media Oriented Systems Transport (MOST) technology based Intelligent Network Interface Controllers (INICs) chips in their cars. We believe that strong demand for microcontroller products will drive the company's results.Microchip is expanding its touch business beyond handsets and tablets into areas, such as automotive industrial applications, which is positive in our view. This is further expected to drive top-line growth in the rest of fiscal 2017. Moreover, stringent cost control is a catalyst for operating margin expansion.In fact, Microchip has noted that it remains on track to achieve long-term operating margin target of 33% by fourth-quarter fiscal 2018.However, our proven model does not conclusively show that Microchip is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below. : Microchip's Earnings ESP is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 81 cents per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . : Microchip carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some stocks which, as per our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Applied Optoelectronics  with an Earnings ESP of +15.87% and a Zacks Rank #1.

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the PowerShares QQQ ETF (Symbol: QQQ), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $135.63 per unit.With QQQ trading at a recent price near $123.04 per unit, that means that analysts see 10.23% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of QQQ's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Expedia Inc (Symbol: EXPE), PayPal Holdings Inc (Symbol: PYPL), and Microchip Technology Inc (Symbol: MCHP). Although EXPE has traded at a recent price of $119.34/share, the average analyst target is 20.06% higher at $143.28/share. Similarly, PYPL has 11.15% upside from the recent share price of $41.35 if the average analyst target price of $45.96/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting MCHP to reach a target price of $73.33/share, which is 10.28% above the recent price of $66.50. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of EXPE, PYPL, and MCHP:Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
  
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@We Did The Math QQQ Can Go To $136@2017-01-19@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/we-did-math-qqq-can-go-136-2017-01-19
"nce an investors' favorite in the semiconductor space, things have not been in favor of  for a while now.For the past one year, NXP Semiconductors has returned 26.8% compared with the Zacks categorized  industry's average return of 37.6%.Over the past several quarters, the company has been losing business to its rivals. NXP Semiconductors faces stiff competition from other well-established players in the semiconductor space, which includes ON Semiconductor Corporation  , Analog Devices, Inc.  and Microchip Technology Incorporated  . Also, consolidation in the telecom market, declining margins and volatility in the semiconductor market remain headwinds.Moreover, combined with other unfavorable factors like low return on equity (ROE) and low return on assets (ROA), the stock looks very unattractive. NXP Semiconductors currently trades at a ROE of 11.6%, much lower than the peer average of 18.6%. Notably, the company has an ROA of 5.2% compared with the peer average of 7.2%. Also, its return on capital (ROC) looks very dull. It has returned just 6.6% compared with the peer average of 10.8%Furthermore, the company delivered negative earnings surprises in two out of the last four quarters with an average miss of 5.6%.Adding to the woes, the company reported not so-encouraging third-quarter 2016 earnings of 26 cents, down from $1.49 per share reported in the year-ago quarter.NXP Semiconductors has a highly leverage balance sheet. The company had a long-term debt position of $8.76 billion at the end of third-quarter 2016 compared with $8.27 billion reported in the previous quarter. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to approximately just $1.57 billion compared with $1.33 billion reported in the previous quarter. Thus, the company has to constantly generate adequate amount of operating cash flow to service its debt.To counter the aforementioned challenges, NXP Semiconductors has taken a number of initiatives. The company is putting itself up for sale. Qualcomm Inc., the largest mobile chipset manufacturer globally, had entered into a definitive agreement in October last year to acquire the NXP Semiconductors. Per the deal, Qualcomm will pay $110 per NXP Semiconductor share in cash reflecting an enterprise value of approximately $47 billion (equity value of $39 billion) for the Dutch chipset maker.NXP Semiconductors is a leading manufacturer of high-performance, mixed-signal mobile chipsets. The company has a strong clientele serving more than 25,000 customers through its direct sales channel and global network of distribution channel partners.The deal could be particularly important for NXP Semiconductors, given its recent losses and stiff competition. If Qualcomm manages to win the bid and NXP Semiconductors accepts its offer, it will certainly strengthen its position as a chipset giant.Although the company's earnings comparison on a year-over-year basis was not so encouraging, its top line comparisons were favorable. NXP Semiconductors' revenues grew 62.2% year over year to $2.469 billion and marginally surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.465 billion.Revenues were boosted by a 62.5% increase in Product revenues and a 51.5% increase in Corporate & Other revenues on a year-over-year basis. Also, an increase in High Performance Mixed Signal (HPMS) segment revenues (up 80.3% on a year-over-year basis) positively impacted the quarter's results.The company also provided an encouraging fourth quarter revenue guidance. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, NXP Semiconductors expects revenues in the range of $2.390 billion to $2.490 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $2.439 billion.Continued strong adoption of tablets and smartphones, automotive electronics and the emergence of the new category of wearables boosted the demand for processing and sensing devices that run them. These factors are likely to drive the semiconductor industry this year.With the acquisition of Freescale Semiconductor, NXP Semiconductors has now become the world's leading provider of automotive semiconductor solutions and general purpose microcontroller products.NXP Semiconductors is currently trading at a lower price/earnings (P/E) multiple than the peer average. Therefore, we believe that NXP Semiconductors with its lower forward P/E valuation of 16.5x compared with the peer average of 30.4x may be a good bet.The stock's long-term earnings per share growth rate is 24.7% and it has a VGM Score of ""B"". These factors are also likely to aid the company's long-term results.We believe that the company's turnaround efforts will yield results in the long run. We are optimistic about NXP Semiconductors' recovery in 2017, given the positive factors and its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

"Chicago, IL - December 29, 2016 -  highlights  (NASDAQ:  -  ) as the Bull of the Day and  (NASDAQ:  -  ) as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on  (NASDAQ:  -  ),  (NYSE:  -  ) and  (NASDAQ:  -  ).Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:What an incredible run it has been for the semiconductor industry!The industry has produced numerous winners in recent months, while the space at large has easily crushed the S&P 500. In fact, the SOXX ETF tracking the market has gained nearly 40% year-to-date, easily crushing a still respectable gain of about 10.6% for the S&P 500.But with such big moves, investors have to be worried if this trend can continue in the New Year too. While it might not be such a sector-wide surge again in 2017, a few still look promising in this environment, such as Microchip Technology (NASDAQ:  -  ).While Microchip has also gained about 40% in 2016, the company still trades at a pretty reasonable valuation. It currently has a forward PE just above 20, and a PEG that is below the industry average and comes in at 1.65, suggesting the company isn't overvalued when compared to its industry peers.Additionally, Microchip has a great outlook on the momentum front too. The stock has a 'B' Grade for Momentum right now, while it has outclassed its peers on a 52-week price change, along with changes in earnings estimates too.In terms of estimates, it is hard not to like MCHP when you look at the company's trend from this perspective. Analysts tracking the company have not lowered their earnings estimates for the company's current quarter or current year in the past two months, while several have raised their outlooks.Expectations have actually increased pretty significantly in just the past two months, as the full year estimate has gone higher by about 7.8% and the next year consensus has increased by 7.7%. The company is actually now projected to see EPS growth of roughly 29.5% for the current year, and double digit growth the following year as well.Add in a pretty great track record in earnings season which includes just two misses since the start of 2013, and it shouldn't be a surprise that MCHP has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and that we are looking for more outperformance from the company in 2017 too.Anyone that has bought a new house or moved recently is familiar with Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:  -  ). The company has a wide range of home goods and key products for furnishing a new place, making it a go-to spot for a variety of gadgets and home needs.However, people are probably familiar with another aspect of Bed Bath & Beyond, their never-ending coupons. I know that my place is filled with unused Bed Bath & Beyond coupons, while I never even considering buying something from there without one. Sure, they have made some changes to this program over the years-such as reducing the percentage off after a certain time-but I know a new one is either in my mailbox right now, or is going to be there soon.Due to this heavy reliance on coupons and the increasing threat of online competition, it has been a pretty rough stretch for Bed Bath and Beyond investors. Shares are down about 16% year-to-date in what has otherwise been a great year for the markets, while the company has lost about 46% over the past two years as well.But as bad as things have been for BBBY, the pain might not be over just yet. That is at least the case if we look to recent earnings estimates for the stock, as these have been pretty negative across the board.In just the past week, we have seen ten analyst estimates go lower for the current quarter (compared to zero higher), while we have seen a dozen estimates go lower for the current year and next year, with zero higher in either time frame. And with a pretty sluggish history in earnings season-including three straight misses-it is hard to have confidence in BBBY for 2017.This is especially true when you consider what the recent estimate changes have done to the consensus estimate. In the past two months, the consensus estimate for BBBY has fallen by about 4.3% for the current quarter and 4.8% for the current year, while we also see even more significant drops for the next quarter and next year time frames too.Over the years, the dynamics of the software industry, the way organizations conduct their businesses and people connect with each other have changed, thanks to technological progress and innovation.As technology continues its rapid invasion into every corner of human existence, the need for improved software has increased manifold. The last few years witnessed breakthroughs in cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI) technology, chip shrinking technology, self-driving cars, personal assistants, high-speed Internet and home automation, thus setting the stage for strong growth in the software industry.With the U.S. economy rebounding, as evident from the recently released improved economic data for GDP, the Consumer Confidence Index, unemployment rate and factory activity data, we believe that there are tremendous growth opportunities for software stocks in 2017.Notably, as per Gartner, worldwide spending on software is expected to increase 6% year over year and reach $333 billion in 2016. The independent research firm also predicts that next year the industry will witness even higher growth of 7.2% to reach $357 billion. This is much higher than the projected growth rate of 2.9% for entire tech industry spending, which is likely to touch $3.5 trillion in 2017.As software promises a bright future for 2017, we believe adding some of these stocks to your portfolio will help boost your returns.With the help of our  , we have picked three software stocks that have performed well so far this year and have the potential to keep the momentum going in the next year. They also have a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy), a VGM Style Score of ""A"" or ""B"", and low P/E multiple than the industry average. You can see  . (NASDAQ:  -  ) is a leading provider of integrated Internet traffic and content management solutions designed to improve the availability and performance of mission-critical Internet-based servers and applications. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a VGM Style Score of ""B."" Moreover, F5 Networks currently trades at a forward P/E multiple of 22.3x, which is lower than the industry average of 35.7x. Year-to-date, the company has gained 50% compared with the Zacks categorized Computer-Software Services industry's average return of just 4.3%.Forget the gym, finding great stocks should be your New Year's resolution!

"odernity has given us many wonderful things. In fact, some things that were pretty much sci-fi in my growing-up years have transformed into ""technology"" today. One of the things that made this possible was advances in computational sciences that imparted intelligence to inanimate objects.As IoT, wearables, cloud, self-driving cars and such other things get increasingly bandied about by technology experts of every hue, it is apparent that we are standing on the cusp of an entirely new paradigm. Yes, this is where we accept the fact that together we are better. And that togetherness is possible only when all these intelligent pieces are somehow connected to draw from each other, support each other and thereby reach the full potential of what each can be.The intelligence comes from semiconductor devices, whether they're in your computer, or smartphone or health tracking wrist band, or smart thermometer, or the cloud, or the networks facilitating ""conversations"" between them.There are several aspects to this intelligence, i.e., the ability to perceive natural phenomena, compare it with other such phenomena previously experienced that is stored in the memory, checking the results of such experience, determining the probability that such experience will recur given the circumstances and deciding resultant activity.But whatever the natural phenomena (heat, light, sound, etc.) being processed, we have to remember that machines don't speak our language. So there has to be some mechanism that can read these things and transform them into signals that machines can in fact read. Thus we come to analog and mixed-signal processors that read raw data, change into digital form that machines process and then change the results back again into analog signals that we can read.So it's easy to see that the growing electrification of things and their growing interconnectedness would increase the demand for analog and mixed signal processing. Moreover, their attractiveness to the end customer is greatly reduced when they guzzle power, so all this processing has to be done in a highly energy efficient manner.The cost of processing also increases when discrete devices are used, so there is the need for a higher level of integration. The constraints increase the challenges of designing these chips but also create opportunities for differentiation and therefore, pricing power. Since they can be manufactured more effectively at higher process nodes, they are also cheaper to make. All this makes for better margins.Given this backdrop, both Microchip Technology (MCHP) and Monolithic Power (MPWR) look attractive because both are players in the Analog & Mixed Signal Semiconductor industry, which is ranked 51 out of the 265 industries in our coverage (top 19%). The broader Computer & Technology sector of which they are a part, is also positively placed at number 4 out of a total 16 sectors we cover (top 25%).But not all stocks are made the same, which is why we could profit from a closer look:Microchip Technology makes microcontrollers (computer-on-a-chip), which are systems combining processor, memory and peripherals to get specific jobs done. While currently embedded in a broad range of systems including automobiles, remote controls, home appliances, handhelds, security systems, motor controls, thermostats, computer peripherals etc, they are expected to be a major beneficiary of the IoT revolution because of the way they integrate different functionalities at low cost.Microchip also makes over 3K analog, interface, mixed signal and timing products used by its customers in a wide variety of embedded control applications.The company markets its products to the consumer, automotive, office automation, communications and industrial markets in Asia, Europe and the Americas. It has recently had some important auto wins.This Zacks Rank #1 company (you can see  ) has a four-quarter average surprise of 9.5% and reported particularly strong results in the last-reported quarter. It also raised its guidance for the next quarter. Estimates for the Dec 2016 and March 2017 quarters are up 8.0% and 6.4%, respectively over the last 60 days. For 2017 and 2018, they are up a respective 7.8% and 6.8%.Its expected average growth of 12.5% in the next five years is also significantly higher than growth of 7.8% in the last 5 years. The P/E of 20.07 trails the industry average of 25.40. The share price is up 24.2% in the last six months compared to 29.3% for the industry.Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. provides small, highly energy efficient, easy-to-use power solutions for systems found in industrial applications, telecom infrastructures, cloud computing, automotive, and consumer applications. MPS' mission is to reduce total energy consumption in systems and by offering greener, more practical and more compact solutions.The share price is up 22.7% in the last six months compared to 29.3% for the industry.This Zacks Rank #2 company has missed estimates in three of the last four quarters averaging a negative surprise of 3.03%. But that doesn't mean it's done badly: the company is on track to grow earnings 42.50% in 2016, which compares favorably with the 31.10% growth expected of the industry. 2017 is expected to be another strong year (projected EPS growth is currently 28.21%). While the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2016 hasn't moved in the last 60 days, it is up 2.8% for 2017.While both stocks are part of an exciting and happening industry, it's clear that MCHP has a better surprise history, which means it is more predictable. It is also a better buy because MPWR looks a bit overvalued at these levels.You are welcome to download the full, up-to-the-minute list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 ""Strong Buy"" stocks free of charge.

"Chicago, IL - November 30, 2016 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include  -  ,  -  ,  -  ,  -  and  -  .Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations. The U.S. stock market sentiment is extremely bullish with most of the stocks and ETFs hitting all-time highs. An improving U.S. economy, rising  , moderation of dollar strength, President-elect Donald Trump's proposals, return to earnings growth and holiday optimism triggered off risk-on sentiments over the last few weeks. Additionally, hopes of a sooner-than-expected rates hike (as soon as December) added to the strength.While there are winners in every corner of the space, we have highlighted four high-flying ETFs and stocks that could be compelling choices for investors seeking to ride out the holiday season rally in the weeks ahead. This is especially true given that these have a top Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy), suggesting their outperformance to continue. - Being a cyclical sector, semiconductor ETFs tend to move higher with market rallies. Ongoing consolidations, emerging technologies and impressive earnings from leaders in the industry added to the strength. SOXX follows the PHLX SOX Semiconductor Sector Index and offers exposure to 30 U.S. firms with heavy concentration on the top five firms at 40.2% of assets (read:  ).The fund has amassed $688 million in its asset base and trades in volume of about 548,000 shares a day. The product charges an annual fee of 48 bps a year from investors. The fund hit 52-week high of $120.84, representing a gain of 35.3% so far this year and has a Zacks Rank #2. - The defense sector has been roaring especially after Trump's victory. This is especially true as Trump intends to build a strong U.S. military base worldwide and vowed to increase military spending in U.S. and overseas. This ETF offers exposure to 51 companies that are involved in the development, manufacturing, operations as well as support U.S. defense, homeland security and aerospace operations. It tracks the SPADE Defense Index, charging 64 bps in annual fees from investors. Each security holds less than 7.2% of the portfolio.The fund has so far managed assets of $422.4 million while trades in a lower average daily volume of about 80,000 shares. It hit a fresh high of $42.72 per share, and has moved higher by about 21% in the year-to-date timeframe. It has a Zacks ETF Rank of #1 (read:  ). - With holiday optimism, an improving retail sales trend, and encouraging economic and industry fundamentals, consumer discretionary ETFs have been showing huge strength. This leisure and entertainment ETF surged to a new high of $40.67 per share, having gained 9.4% this year. The fund tracks the Dynamic Leisure and Entertainment Intellidex Index and holds a small basket of 29 stocks with none holding more than 6.71% share.

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the ProShares S&P 500 Ex-Health Care ETF (Symbol: SPXV), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $49.22 per unit.With SPXV trading at a recent price near $44.87 per unit, that means that analysts see 9.69% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of SPXV's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Albemarle Corp. (Symbol: ALB), Microchip Technology Inc (Symbol: MCHP), and Duke Energy Corp (Symbol: DUK). Although ALB has traded at a recent price of $77.08/share, the average analyst target is 11.44% higher at $85.90/share. Similarly, MCHP has 9.87% upside from the recent share price of $63.53 if the average analyst target price of $69.80/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting DUK to reach a target price of $81.78/share, which is 9.86% above the recent price of $74.44. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of ALB, MCHP, and DUK:Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
  
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past.

" (NASDAQ:  ) - This maker of micro-controllers and analog and semiconductor products for a variety of applications was last reviewed by me on  .

Continuation gaps are usually closed - in other words, look for MCHP stock's price to fall to under $57.13, which also is this stock's bullish support line.MCHP is still rated a five-star buy from Standard & Poor's - their highest evaluation - with a 12-month target of $70, recently raised from $59.EPS was increased from a fiscal year 2017 estimate of $3.25 to $3.40 and for FY 2018 to $3.80 from $3.78. For the June quarter, EPS of 84 cents was reported, beating an estimate of 75 cents. Sales rose 49% from the March quarter.Future growth is expected to be driven by the acquisition of  and growth in the industrial and automotive areas.MCHP is still a favored recommendation, and the recent market decline gives us an opportunity to purchase the stock at a price that is within its intermediate support line at the 20-day moving average ($61) and its bullish support line at $56.

nvestors eyeing a purchase of Microchip Technology Inc (Symbol: MCHP) stock, but tentative about paying the going market price of $61.15/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2018 put at the $50 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $2.90. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 5.8% return against the $50 commitment, or a 4.1% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to MCHP's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $50 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Microchip Technology Inc sees its shares fall 18.2% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $47.10 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $2.90 from $50), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 4.1% annualized rate of return.Worth considering, is that the annualized 4.1% figure actually exceeds the 2.4% annualized dividend paid by Microchip Technology Inc by 1.7%, based on the current share price of $61.15. And yet, if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downside because the stock would have to fall 18.19% to reach the $50 strike price.Always important when discussing dividends is the fact that, in general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Microchip Technology Inc, looking at the dividend history chart for MCHP below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 2.4% annualized dividend yield.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Microchip Technology Inc, and highlighting in green where the $50 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2018 put at the $50 strike for the 4.1% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Microchip Technology Inc (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $61.15) to be 28%. For other put options contract ideas at the various different available expirations, visit the  page of StockOptionsChannel.com.In mid-afternoon trading on Wednesday, the put volume among S&P 500 components was 531,935 contracts, with call volume at 531,935, for a put:call ratio of 0.72 so far for the day, which is above normal compared to the long-term median put:call ratio of .65. In other words, if we look at the number of call buyers and then use the long-term median to project the number of put buyers we'd expect to see, we're actually seeing more put buyers than expected out there in  so far today.  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Agree To Buy Microchip Technology At $50, Earn 5.8% Using Options@2016-08-24@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/agree-buy-microchip-technology-50-earn-58-using-options-2016-08-24
 recently launched the Explorer 16/32 Development Board, which has been developed for carrying out designing tasks with 16-bit as well as 32-bit microcontrollers.Compared to the company's leading Explorer 16 Development Board, the new motherboard costs less and features an in-built programmer/debugger along with new features that are in sync with the latest embedded systems design requirements. The new development board has a mikroBUS interface that makes the addition of new functionalities a seamless task. The new motherboard features an integrated USB for the purpose of powering the unit as well as communication. This eliminates the requirement of additional communication accessories and external power adapters. Notably, the new board is backwards compatible with the previous Explorer 16 Board meaning that customers will be able to use the existing libraries, codes, prototypes, PICtail Plus cards and PIMs interfaced with one another with the help of a side PICtail Plus connector.We believe the new motherboard is an important addition to Microchip's product portfolio, which will drive its top-line growth in the long run. The company is one of the fastest-growing providers of 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers in the world. The microcontroller business of the company continued to outperform the industry and enabled it to gain significant market share.Moreover, the company is increasingly expanding its touch business beyond handsets and tablets into areas such as automotive industrial applications. This is further expected to drive top-line growth through fiscal 2017.Meanwhile, Microchip recently revised its sales and earnings guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The company now forecasts non-GAAP net sales to increase in the range of 1% to 3% compared with the earlier guidance range of flat to up 4% up.However, the mid-point of the guidance remains unchanged at 2%. Further, non-GAAP earnings are now expected to be in the range of 85 to 89 cents per share compared with the previous guidance range of 83 to 91 cents per share.The revised guidance reflects the impact of the recent acquisitions of Atmel and Micrel. The company stated that integration of both the businesses is almost complete.Moreover, Microchip now anticipates operating expenses of the Atmel business, as a percentage of sales, to decline to 30% compared with 40% at the time of the acquisition. This will definitely help the company to report improved profitability in the second quarter. | At present, Microchip carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology space are Lantronix, Inc.  sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and NCR Corporation  and VASCO Data Security International Inc.  , each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The year-over-year decrease, despite a healthy top-line improvement, was primarily attributable to high operating expenses.Non-GAAP net income (from continuing operations) for the reported quarter was $194.0 million or 84 cents per share compared with $148.9 million or 69 cents per share in the year-earlier quarter. Recurring earnings (with stock-based compensation adjustments) were 67 cents per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.Net revenue (GAAP) for the reported quarter was $799.4 million, up 49.7% year over year, while non-GAAP revenues were up 58.1% to an all-time high of $844 million.

Microchip continued to gain market share with new product momentum and customer engagement across the industry.GAAP revenues from the analog products were $212.3 million. The company continued to develop and introduce a wide range of innovative and proprietary new linear, mixed signal, power, interface, and timing products to fuel the future growth of the analog business.The memory business recorded GAAP revenues of $45.9 million in the reported quarter.

Capital expenditure was approximately $18.5 million with a consolidated inventory of $518.4 million.Management provided guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2017.

The company expects to incur $30 million in capital expenditure in the next quarter, bringing its tally to about $141 million for fiscal 2017.Moving forward, management expects continued accretion from Micrel and Atmel acquisitions.

" (NASDAQ:  ) - Shares of MCHP stock fell almost 2% on Friday on what appeared to be profit-taking. This pullback could provide traders with an advantageous entry point.The mid-cap semiconductor company is scheduled to report quarterly earnings on Aug. 8, with analysts expecting a 7% increase in earnings to 74 cents per share on a 54% jump in revenue to $821.4 million. Microchip Technology has exceeded analysts' earnings estimates in each of the past three quarters.Capital IQ Equity Research rates MCHP stock a ""Strong Buy"" with a 12-month price target of $59. Its analysts believe Microchip Technology will benefit from the recently completed Atmel acquisition, as well as improving order trends and healthy consumer inventories.For the current fiscal year, which ends in March, the consensus expects earnings to grow 18%, followed by another 17% increase in the next fiscal year.Turning to the chart, we see that MCHP stock is in a bull market after breaking from a double-top in May on high volume after a 19-month consolidation between $40 and $50. The break was followed by a one-month consolidation, then another break in June, followed in July by two days of very high volume and a break to a new high at $58.74.MCHP stock is now consolidating in a bullish flag formation. MACD is bullish, having adjusted from an overbought condition.Traders should look to buy MCHP stock on continued profit-taking, which could drop its price close to $54 for a trade to $62. If successful, they could book a return of almost 15%.MCHP stock is also appropriate for long-term investors, who could see even high capital gains and also benefit from Microchip Technology's relatively high dividend yield.

eading semiconductor manufacturer  is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2017 results after the closing bell on Aug 8. In the last reported quarter, Microchip's adjusted earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by five cents. The company has beaten earnings estimates in each of the last four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 6.07%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Microchip is one of the fastest growing providers of 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers in the world. The microcontroller business of the company has historically outperformed the industry and is expected to record a solid performance in the upcoming quarter as well.The company remains bullish on the surging demand for 3D control displays in a gamut of industries ranging from home automation to IoT (Internet of Things). Microchip is also increasingly expanding its touch business beyond handsets and tablets in areas such as automotive industrial applications.During the quarter, Microchip revealed that General Motors Company (GM) was using its Media Oriented Systems Transport (MOST) Intelligent Network Interface Controllers to manage the infotainment system networking functions in their global compact car platform. In addition, the synchronous, flexible, and cost-effective MOST networking technology was also implemented in all of General Motors' mid-size, full-size, performance, cross-over and SUV, truck, and luxury platforms across all vehicle brands. | The MOST network supports multiple data types simultaneously, enabling car manufacturers to offer system and feature set flexibility for current and future automotive infotainment applications. This helps reduce the wiring harness weight for easier compliance with environmental regulations. Such wider acceptance of its products is likely to translate into higher revenues leading to bottom-line growth in the impending quarter.The Analog business of Microchip has also become one of the largest analog franchises in the market. In order to further capitalize on this burgeoning business potential, Microchip is developing and introducing a wide range of innovative and proprietary new products. In addition, with a diligent focus on right-sizing the various components of inventory holdings, Microchip has been able to reduce its inventory to further boost its operating results during the quarter.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Microchip is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) for a successful earnings beat. This is not the case here as you will see below: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is currently pegged at 0.00%. Microchip's Zacks Rank #3 when combined with 0.00% ESP makes an earnings beat uncertain. We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or #5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:LATAM Airlines Group S.A.  has an Earnings ESP of +166.67% and a Zacks Rank #3.Mylan N.V.  has an Earnings ESP of +1.75% and a Zacks Rank #2.CDK Global Inc.  has an earnings ESP of +2.08% and a Zacks Rank #1.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

ooking at the universe of stocks we cover at  , in trading on Monday, shares of Microchip Technology Inc (Symbol: MCHP) were yielding above the 3% mark based on its quarterly dividend (annualized to $1.438), with the stock changing hands as low as $47.93 on the day. Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return. To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) back on 12/31/1999 - you would have paid $146.88 per share. Fast forward to 12/31/2012 and each share was worth $142.41 on that date, a decrease of $4.67/share over all those years. But now consider that you collected a whopping $25.98 per share in dividends over the same period, for a positive total return of 23.36%. Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.6%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 3% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable. Microchip Technology Inc (Symbol: MCHP) is an S&P 500 company, giving it special status as one of the large-cap companies making up the S&P 500 Index.In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Microchip Technology Inc, looking at the history chart for MCHP below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 3% annual yield.

Gross profit margin is expected within 59.6-60.2% on a GAAP basis and 60.0-60.5% on a non-GAAP basis.Management projected SG&A expense within $32.2-$33.2 million and research and development expense in the $25.6 million to $26.6 million range, both on a GAAP basis. The company anticipates stock-based compensation expense of $6.1 million, amortization of acquired intangible assets of $6.4 million and interest and other expense of $2.2 million.Accordingly, based on a share count of 66.0 million, GAAP earnings per share are expected in the range of 12-17 cents, and non-GAAP earnings are projected within 30-36 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 23 cents.Also, the tax rate is projected in the range of 29-31% on a GAAP basis and 21-23% on a non-GAAP basis. Capital expenditure is anticipated to be roughly $8.0 million.Semtech Corporation manufactures a wide range of analog and mixed-signal semiconductors, including Standard Semiconductor Products, Rectifier and Assembly Products and Other Products. The company reported a decent quarter with both the top and the bottom lines exceeding our expectations.We believe that the company's new design wins, product introductions and solid execution will boost revenues and margins in the near term.

hareholders of Microchip Technology Inc (Symbol: MCHP) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 2.9% annualized dividend yield can sell the January 2018 covered call at the $60 strike and collect the premium based on the $2.75 bid, which annualizes to an additional 3.3% rate of return against the current stock price (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ), for a total of 6.2% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $60 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but MCHP shares would have to advance 19.2% from current levels for that to happen, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 24.7% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Microchip Technology Inc, looking at the dividend history chart for MCHP below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 2.9% annualized dividend yield.Below is a chart showing MCHP's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $60 strike highlighted in red:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2018 covered call at the $60 strike gives good reward for the risk of having given away the upside beyond $60.

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the WisdomTree Weak Dollar U.S. Equity Fund ETF (Symbol: USWD), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $26.05 per unit.With USWD trading at a recent price near $23.72 per unit, that means that analysts see 9.83% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of USWD's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Alcoa, Inc. (Symbol: AA), Illumina Inc (Symbol: ILMN), and Microchip Technology Inc (Symbol: MCHP). Although AA has traded at a recent price of $9.44/share, the average analyst target is 17.97% higher at $11.14/share. Similarly, ILMN has 14.99% upside from the recent share price of $136.94 if the average analyst target price of $157.46/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting MCHP to reach a target price of $53.81/share, which is 13.70% above the recent price of $47.33. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of AA, ILMN, and MCHP:Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
  
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past.

However, reported revenues were toward the lower end of the company's expected range of $800.0-$840.0 million. Revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $819.0 million.Revenues in the quarter were impacted by overall weakness in the computing and smartphone markets, partially offset by accelerating momentum in the automotive market.Automotive accounted for 40% of total revenue. Segment revenues were up 9% on a sequential basis, driven by strong demand for automotive image sensors. Also, power regulation solutions for infotainment and body electronic module applications led to the strong revenue performance in the first quarter.Industrial/Military/Aerospace/Medical contributed 22% to total revenue, down 7% from the prior quarter. The company witnessed broad-based weakness in the industrial market due to lower demand in the security segment.Communications (both networking and wireless) accounted for 17% of revenues and declined 10% on a sequential basis. The decline was attributed to weakness in the premium segment of the smartphone market and seasonality.Consumer brought in 11% of total revenue, down 11% sequentially. The decline was due to normal seasonality and steep inventory correction in the action and sports camera market.Computing generated 11% of total revenue, down 10% from the last quarter due to weakness in overall markets like hard disk drives and power supplies.Pro-forma gross margin was 33.7%, up 50 basis points (bps) sequentially but down 78 bps year over year. The sequential increase was largely driven by higher utilization rates and an improved product mix.ON Semiconductor incurred operating expenses of $189.2 million, 1.8% higher than the previous quarter but down 5.6% from the year-ago quarter. The company reported an operating margin of 10.6%, down 53 bps sequentially and 92 bps year over year.On a pro-forma basis, ON Semiconductor reported net income of $70.3 million or 17 cents per share compared with $78.9 million or 19 cents in the previous quarter and $87.1 million or 20 cents in the year-ago quarter.

The company also expects other income/expense within $38.0-$41.0 million on a GAAP basis and $7.0-$10.0 million on a non-GAAP basis.Taxes are expected in the band of $3-$7 million on a GAAP basis and $5-$9 million on a non-GAAP basis, with a share count of 416.0 million.ON Semiconductor has a well-diversified business and an end-market focus that would typically generate relatively steady revenues throughout the year. The company's bottom line exceeded our expectation while the top line missed the same.The company witnessed continued strength in orders in the reported quarter and expects the momentum to continue in the near- to mid-term based on a solid design win pipeline.Though macroeconomic conditions remain weak, the end-market demand trend is, however, favorable due to seasonality. Management expects all end markets, namely, communication, automotive, industrial and consumer to increase sequentially in the second quarter. However, the computing market is expected to remain flat in the upcoming quarter.During the quarter, the company also provided an update on its acquisition of Fairchild Semiconductor International Inc. The deal is expected to close by the middle of this year. The company has received approvals from regulators in Germany and Japan and the required financing for the transaction has also been secured. The acquisition will lead to the creation of a leader in the power semiconductor space with combined revenues of roughly $5 billion, diversified across manifold markets with a planned focus on smartphone, automotive and industrial end markets.The company has an attractive product portfolio and is an outstanding manufacturing and operational organization. Currently, it is streamlining its costs, which, in addition to its assets will boost revenues and cash flow.ON Semiconductor has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Investors may also consider stocks like M/A-Com Technology Solutions Holdings, Inc.  , Microchip Technology Inc.  and Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.  , each carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The top line was impacted by foreign currency movements to the tune of $22 million. North America sales grew 2% on the back of impressive Products and Services sales. Sales in Europe and Latin America were particularly disappointing and were primarily responsible for the 7.4% decline in product sales to $702 million in the quarter under review. Operating margin (on an adjusted basis) came in at 13.9% in the quarter, compared with 12.8% a year ago.Services revenues totaled $491 million, up 5.6% year over year.

arnings are perhaps the most significant metric for an organization. Substantial earnings growth indicates the affluence of a company. Earnings are essentially revenues that the company makes after subtracting cost of production over a given period of time. Upbeat earnings results generally lead to an increase in the share price.But instead of looking only at the most recent quarter's earnings, one should also focus on earnings acceleration. And why is this so? It's because earnings acceleration works even better in lifting the stock price.Earnings acceleration is basically incrementally growing earnings per share (EPS) of a company. In other words, if the rate of a company's quarter-over-quarter earnings growth increases over a considerable period, it can be called earnings acceleration.Moreover, picking stocks on the basis of earnings growth will lead you to pay for something that is already reflected in the stock price. However, earnings acceleration will help you to select stocks that have yet to see significant investor attention and the consequent solid price increase. This is because earnings acceleration considers both direction and magnitude of growth rates.Increasing the percentage of earnings growth can often be the difference between good stocks and great stocks. It means that the company is basically sound and has been on the right track for a sustained period of time. On the other hand, sideways percentage of earnings growth can potentially signal a period of consolidation or slowdown, while a decelerating percentage of earnings growth may at times send prices down.Hence, investment in stocks having solid earnings acceleration is a profitable strategy.Let's look for stocks for which the last two quarter-over-quarter percentage EPS growth rates are more than the growth rates of the previous periods. The projected quarter-over-quarter percentage EPS growth rate is also expected to be higher than the previous periods' growth rates. : The projected growth rate for the current quarter (Q1) over the completed quarter (Q0) has to be greater than the growth rate from the completed quarter (Q0) over one quarter ago (Q-1). : The growth rate for the completed quarter (Q0) over one quarter ago (Q-1) has to be greater than the growth rate from one quarter ago (Q-1) over two quarters ago (Q-2). : The growth rate from one quarter ago (Q-1) over two quarters ago (Q-2) has to be greater than the growth rate from two quarters ago (Q-2) over three quarters ago (Q-3).In addition to this, we have added: : This screens out the low-priced stocks. : High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity.Here are five of the 13 stocks that made it through the screen:Microchip Technology Inc.

nvestors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and  may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Microchip Technology is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings-with the most up-to-date information possible-is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for MCHP in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 62 cents per share for MCHP, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 60 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for MCHP, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of 3.33% heading into earnings season.A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more  ).Given that MCHP has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Microchip Technology, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

espite a challenging macroeconomic environment, premium semiconductor manufacturer  reported strong fourth-quarter fiscal 2016 results. GAAP net income for fourth-quarter fiscal 2016 (ended Mar 31, 2016) was $67.4 million or 31 cents per share compared with $99.4 million or 45 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year decrease in earnings, despite a healthy top-line improvement, was primarily attributable to high operating expenses.Non-GAAP net income for the reported quarter was $153.0 million or 70 cents per share compared with $148.8 million or 68 cents per share in the year-earlier quarter. Recurring earnings (with stock-based compensation adjustments) were 65 cents per share, which comfortably exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5 cents.For fiscal 2016, GAAP net income declined to $324.1 million or $1.49 per share from $369.0 million or $1.65 per share in fiscal 2015, largely due to high operating expenses. Non-GAAP earnings for fiscal 2016 were $583.3 million or $2.68 per share, compared with $593.9 million or $2.66 per share in the prior fiscal.Net revenue (GAAP) for the reported quarter was $557.6 million, up 2.7% year over year, while non-GAAP revenues were up 3.9% to an all-time high of $568.4 million. The non-GAAP revenues for fourth-quarter fiscal 2016 exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $564 million. For fiscal 2016, Microchip reported record high GAAP and non-GAAP revenues of $2,173 million and $2,214 million, respectively with solid microcontroller sales.In terms of product mix, revenues from Microcontroller products accounted for 61.0% of GAAP revenues in the quarter, while Analog, Memory and Licensing products generated 28.8%, 4.9% and 3.6% of the same, respectively. From the geographical perspective, bulk of the GAAP revenues were generated in Asia ($312.2 million, 56% of the total revenue), followed by Europe ($135.4 million, 24.3%) and Americas ($110.0 million, 19.7%).By product line, GAAP revenues from microcontrollers were $340.4 million, up sequentially in all three products (8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit microcontrollers) with a broad-based recovery in the overall microcontroller business. Microchip's microcontroller business continued to outperform the market with new product momentum and steady customer engagements.GAAP revenues from the analog products were up 34.6% year over year to $160.9 million. Over the last four quarters, the analog business was up 26.3% due to organic growth and accretive effect of the Micrel acquisition. Microchip has almost completed the integration of Micrel and expects the process to be completed by Dec 2016.With GAAP revenues of $27.2 million in the reported quarter, the memory business was down 1.8% sequentially. GAAP revenue from the licensing business was $20.0 million in the reported quarter.Microchip recorded GAAP gross margin of 54.3% for the reported quarter. Operating income declined to $79.9 million from $110.3 million in the year-ago period, due to high operating expenses. Operating margin stood at 14.3% in the reported quarter.During the quarter, Microchip acquired the touchscreen chipmaker Atmel Corporation for $8.15 per share, comprising $7.00 per share in cash and $1.15 per share in Microchip stock. This equated to a total equity value of about $3.56 billion and total enterprise value of about $3.40 billion.The buyout was funded through a combination of cash and common stock. The company expects the Atmel buyout to supplement its operational excellence and customer base. Microchip further believes that the acquisition will aid the launch of cutting-edge competitive products, going forward, helping it grab a higher market share in the microcontroller business.Cash and short-term investments were $2,446 million at fiscal end 2016 with $1,052 million under its long term line of credit, compared with the respective tallies of $1,958.9 million and $461.9 million in the prior-year period. Net cash generation for the quarter (excluding acquisition, dividend payment, and reduction in borrowings) was record high at $196.3 million.The company declared a quarterly cash dividend of 35.95 cents per share payable on Jun 6, 2016 to stockholders of record on May 23. Capital expenditure was approximately $16.5 million with a consolidated inventory of $306.8 million.Management provided guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. It expects non-GAAP net sales between $799.1 million and $845.9 million, while non-GAAP gross margin is expected in the range of 54.8% to 55.2%. Non-GAAP net income is anticipated in the range of $160.7 million to $181.2 million, with non-GAAP earnings of 70 cents to 79 cents per share. Microchip expects to generate approximately $140 million to $160 million cash in the upcoming quarter prior to the dividend payment and acquisitions. The company expects to incur $35 million in capital expenditure in the next quarter, bringing its tally to about $140 million for fiscal 2017.Moving forward, management expects the accretion from Micrel and Atmel along with healthy organic growth to lead to an 18% rise in non-GAAP EPS from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017. We remain impressed with the bullish outlook of this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock. Some other stocks that look promising in the industry include M/A-Com Technology Solutions Holdings, Inc.  , Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.  and Silicon Laboratories Inc.  , each sporting the same Zacks Rank as Microchip.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"Chicago, IL - May 10, 2016 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include  and Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.  .Earnings are perhaps the most significant metric for an organization. Substantial earnings growth indicates the affluence of a company. Earnings are essentially revenues that the company makes after subtracting cost of production over a given period of time. Upbeat earnings results generally lead to an increase in the share price.But instead of looking only at the most recent quarter's earnings, one should also focus on earnings acceleration. And why is this so? It's because earnings acceleration works even better in lifting the stock price.Earnings acceleration is basically incrementally growing earnings per share (EPS) of a company. In other words, if the rate of a company's quarter-over-quarter earnings growth increases over a considerable period, it can be called earnings acceleration.Moreover, picking stocks on the basis of earnings growth will lead you to pay for something that is already reflected in the stock price. However, earnings acceleration will help you to select stocks that have yet to see significant investor attention and the consequent solid price increase. This is because earnings acceleration considers both direction and magnitude of growth rates.Increasing the percentage of earnings growth can often be the difference between good stocks and great stocks. It means that the company is basically sound and has been on the right track for a sustained period of time. On the other hand, sideways percentage of earnings growth can potentially signal a period of consolidation or slowdown, while a decelerating percentage of earnings growth may at times send prices down.Hence, investment in stocks having solid earnings acceleration is a profitable strategy.Let's look for stocks for which the last two quarter-over-quarter percentage EPS growth rates are more than the growth rates of the previous periods. The projected quarter-over-quarter percentage EPS growth rate is also expected to be higher than the previous periods' growth rates. : The projected growth rate for the current quarter (Q1) over the completed quarter (Q0) has to be greater than the growth rate from the completed quarter (Q0) over one quarter ago (Q-1). : The growth rate for the completed quarter (Q0) over one quarter ago (Q-1) has to be greater than the growth rate from one quarter ago (Q-1) over two quarters ago (Q-2). : The growth rate from one quarter ago (Q-1) over two quarters ago (Q-2) has to be greater than the growth rate from two quarters ago (Q-2) over three quarters ago (Q-3).In addition to this, we have added: : This screens out the low-priced stocks. : High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity.Here are five of the 13 stocks that made it through the screen:Microchip Technology Inc.

 is set to report first quarter 2016 results on May 5. The company is a leading provider of payment processing, point-of-sale (POS), and marketing services worldwide. It completed its initial public offering (IPO) in Nov 2015.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Six-year old Square has gained popularity for its mobile payment and financial services offerings. While the company is not yet profitable, it reported strong fourth quarter revenues of $374 million that surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $341 million.The company's results were encouraging in both core payments (transaction and hardware) business and software and data products. Square's performance in the fourth quarter also got a boost from the holiday splurge. Excluding Starbucks (the deal is set to expire in 2016), the company's transaction revenues grew 44.7% year over year to $298.5 million.Square has positioned itself to take advantage of increasing adoption rates of contactless payment technologies such as EMV or NFC. If we look at the statistics, about 53% of the total cards swiped on Square were EMV chip-type in Dec 2015, in contrast to only 12% at the beginning of 2015. Moreover, this is despite mounting competition from players like Apple and Samsung.Investors seem particularly pleased with its growth trajectory. Square exited 2015 with growing demand for its latest version of contactless and chip reader (with 350,000 pre-orders for this $49 reader!). Moreover, the company has plans to expand its distribution from its own site and Apple Store at present to include most popular market places like Amazon, Staples, Best Buy and Target in a few months' time.Square is also doing remarkably well in terms of its new products like Square Capital (for lending capital to sellers) through which it extended $150 million in the quarter. Its more recent offerings like Instant Deposit, Square Invoices and Caviar also appear to be promising.Despite a strong performance and robust growth in Gross Payment Volumes (50% up in 2015 to $35.6 billion), the concern regarding profitability remains. This was due to increasing investments in product development and other expense including IPO-related stock compensation charges.While the euphoria surrounding above-expectation revenues and strong demand is justified, a little word of caution may be in order. The company remains in investment mode and is also trying to diversify, both of which will continue to tell on the bottom line. So any investment in the shares will carry a certain amount of risk because of the uncertainty related to the recovery of the amount invested.For the first quarter, the company expects adjusted revenue between 132 million to 137 million and adjusted EBITDA between negative 11 million to negative 9 million.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Square will beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at a loss of 14 cents. Hence, the difference is 0.00%. Square has a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a 0.00% ESP, makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.You could consider the following stock with a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank:Microchip Technology Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +3.33% and a Zacks Rank #2.Spectra Energy Partners, LP  ,with an Earnings ESP of +2.27% and a Zacks Rank #3Time Warner Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +1.55% and a Zacks Rank #3.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

 's  third-quarter fiscal 2016 adjusted earnings of 41 cents per share were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Revenues of $555.0 million were up 8.7% sequentially and down 3.8% year over year. The increase was driven by the strength in the majority of end markets.However, this was in line with the company's guidance range of $535 million to $575 million and below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $557.0 million.R The revenue mix in terms of major markets has been discussed below.The Consumer end market remained the largest revenue contributor, accounting for approximately 29% of revenues. This segment was up sequentially due to the ramp up of a flagship smartphone and higher-than-expected wearable shipments.Industrial, Maxim's second-largest segment, generated 28% of revenues, up sequentially. The improvement was driven by core industrial, with strength across various interface and power products.The Communications and data center end market accounted for 22% of revenues, up sequentially. A broad-based recovery across communications infrastructure markets led to the sequential increase.The Automotive end market generated 17% of revenues, up sequentially and year over year. The increase was driven by content growth and continued strong adoption of new products.The Computing business contributed the remaining 4%.The non-GAAP gross margin was 61.4%, up 91 basis points (bps) sequentially and 182 bps year over year. The increase was led by higher utilization rates.Non-GAAP operating expenses of $191.0 million increased 2.3% sequentially but decreased 4.4% year over year. The decline resulted from overall cost control, including the initial savings from the company's restructuring activities.GAAP net income was $139.8 million compared with $67.5 million in the last quarter and $79.4 million a year ago.Pro-forma net income was $117.7 million compared with $92.8 million in the last quarter and $114.2 million a year ago. Our pro-forma calculation excludes restructuring, intangibles amortization, asset impairments and other one-time charges on a tax-adjusted basis.During the quarter, cash flow from operations was $168.0 million compared with $182.0 million in the prior quarter. Important usages of cash during the quarter included $17.5 million on capex, $83.8 million for share repurchases and $85.7 million paid as dividends.Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $1.86 billion in the fiscal third quarter, up from $1.77 billion in the prior quarter.For the fiscal fourth quarter, Maxim expects revenues in the range of $555 million to $55 million based on a quarter-end backlog of $370.0 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $569.0 million.Gross margin is expected within 59-61% on a GAAP basis and 62-64% on an adjusted basis (excluding special items).Earnings per share are expected within 40-46 cents on a GAAP basis and 45-51 cents on an adjusted basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at 32 cents.Maxim delivered decent fiscal third-quarter 2016 results with earnings matching the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line slightly missing the same.The company expects improvement in the June quarter. Automotive and Industrial are likely to grow due to seasonality and Consumer market should expand due to diversification. Also, Communications and Data Center are expected to see a modest sequential increase.Maxim remains financially strong with convincing margin expansion opportunities through its cost-saving initiatives and R&D focus on high-return investments.The company is transforming the manufacturing footprint to enhance flexibility and profitability, while lowering capital expenditures. Management also plans to optimize the product lines and organization for better returns on R&D investments.In this regard, Maxim closed the sale of fab in San Antonio to TowerJazz in the fiscal third quarter. Also, the company completed the divestiture of the energy metering business to Silergy. These transactions will likely enable Maxim to improve the future utilization rates, reduce costs and improve gross margin performance to the mid 60% range.Based on these initiatives, management said that it is on track to achieve $180 million in annual savings over the long term.Maxim is shifting to advanced node process technology development through a recent collaboration with its foundry partners. Products launched under this initiative should expand margins.Currently, Maxim carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Other stocks in the same space that investors may consider are Inphi Corporation  , Microchip Technology Inc.  and Semtech Corporation  , all carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

 is set to report first-quarter 2016 results on May 5. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 76.47%. Notably, this cyber security solution provider has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the preceding four quarters with an average beat of $186.62%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.CyberArk is an Israeli company that specializes in protecting accounts from cyber-attacks. The company offers several products that protect passwords, close loopholes in security systems, and secure cloud-based assets.It is worth noting that CyberArk had delivered strong fourth-quarter 2015 results. Adjusted earnings of 30 cents per share comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 17 cents, while revenues of $51.5 million exceeded our estimate of $44 million.The company stated that a strong network security market had helped them win a large number of deals and expand customer base, which contributed to its tremendous growth.We are encouraged by CyberArk's sustained focus on offering industry-leading solutions and go-to-market business model.Furthermore, demand for cyber security is on the rise. With the advancement in technology, more organizations are adopting a bring-your-own-device policy, which has enhanced employee productivity with anytime, anywhere access, but made it all the more necessary to enforce stricter data security measures.According to the research firm, Markets and Markets, the cyber security space is expected to reach $170.21 billion by 2020 from $106.32 billion in 2015, growing at an annual rate of 9.8%. We believe that CyberArk Software is in a favorable position to tap the opportunities.Our proven model does not conclusively show that CyberArk Software is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 10 cents. Hence, the difference is 0.00%. CyberArk Software's Zacks Rank #3 when combined with a 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Note that, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or #5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are a few companies worth considering which, per our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Synopsys Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +6.38% and a Zacks Rank #1.Benefitfocus Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +4.00% and a Zacks Rank #2.Microchip Technology Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +3.33% and a Zacks Rank #2.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

 is set to report first-quarter 2016 results on May 3. Last quarter, the company posted narrower-than-expected loss.Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.MINDBODY develops cloud-based business management software and payments platform for the wellness services industry. The company currently provides its services to 42,000 businesses in over 124 countries worldwide. With such a huge client base, the company is expected to post impressive earnings numbers in the first quarter.Furthermore, significant investments in growth areas to improve implementation timelines, particularly for web and mobile application products, will boost profitability going forward. In fact, we expect these initiatives to have a favourable impact on the company's first-quarter earnings as well.However, continued investments toward enhancing product portfolio may undermine the company's near-term profitability. Moreover, stiff competition from the likes of Microsoft Corp.  and Oracle is likely to hurt the company's results in the to-be-reported quarter.Our proven model does not conclusively show that MINDBODY is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, this is not the case here as elaborated below.

" is set to report first-quarter 2016 results on May 5. Last quarter, the company posted narrower-than-expected loss. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.FireEye, headquartered in Milpitas, CA, is a global provider of web, email, file and malware security to both enterprises and governments.The company reported mixed fourth-quarter results, wherein its bottom line compared favorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate, but the top line missed the same. Despite the persistent macro uncertainty, the company seems optimistic based on a healthy security market, strong product line-up, deal wins and investment plans, which should boost results in the to-be-reported quarter.During the quarter, FireEye acquired iSIGHT Partners. David DeWalt, FireEye's CEO and chairman of the board stated, ""This acquisition extends FireEye's intelligence lead with an offering no one else in the industry can match"". Therefore, the deal will boost FireEye's cyber security suite and improve its competitive dynamics.Also, FireEye acquire Invotas, a firm specializing in improving response times after attacks, during the quarter. Invotas' lead product - Security Orchestrator - has been designed to compile information from a range of security products and automate responses when an incident occurs.Furthermore, FireEye recently launched a new product of its own, FireEye Essentials. This product is a lower-cost and simpler version of the FireEye Global Threat Management Platform. With this offering, the company intends to target smaller, midmarket companies.These moves are important as they indicate FireEye's efforts on moving past the enterprise-level end-point protection products it had started with. Also, these factors are likely to aid its results in the to-be-reported quarter.However, an uncertain economic environment, competition from the likes of Palo Alto Networks Inc.  and Juniper Networks, and unfavorable currency translations remain concerns.Our proven model does not conclusively show that FireEye is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in its upcoming release. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below. The Earnings ESP for FireEye is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at a loss of 89 cents. FireEye has a Zacks Rank #2. Though this increases the predictive power of ESP, the company's ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.Here is a company worth considering which, as per our model, has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Fitbit Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +175.00% and a Zacks Rank #2.Microchip Technology Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +3.33% and a Zacks Rank #2.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Today, you can downloadMicrochip recently closed the acquisition of its rival Atmel Corporation. The company expects the acquisition to supplement its operational excellence and customer base. The transaction is deemed to be strategic as Atmel's microcontrollers, wireless, touch, memory and automotive products complement and enhance Microchip's corresponding solutions. Management remained confident that Atmel would yield synergistic benefits to Microchip and would be immediately accretive to its non-GAAP earnings per share.With Atmel on board, Microchip expects revenues for the soon-to-be-reported quarter to be a record high and at the higher end of its earlier guided range of $552.0- $568.5 million. Non-GAAP earnings are also anticipated to be inclined towards the upper end of its previous expectations of 65-69 cents per share.Microchip also collaborated with Altis Semiconductor to make its Smartbit based antifuse one-time-programmable non-volatile memory (NVM) technology available on Altis platforms. This NVM technology offers industry-leading fast-read capability and Smartbit dynamic programming for high reliability. Such innovative and proprietary new products are expected to reinforce the product portfolio and consequently augment its revenues.Microchip is one of the fastest growing providers of 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers in the world. The microcontroller business of the company has historically outperformed the industry and is expected to record a solid performance in the upcoming quarter as well.Microchip also remains bullish on the surging demand for 3D control displays in a gamut of industries ranging from home automation to IoT (Internet of Things). The company is increasingly expanding its touch business beyond handsets and tablets in areas such as automotive industrial applications.The Analog business of Microchip has also become one of the largest analog franchises in the market. In order to further capitalize on this burgeoning business potential, Microchip is developing and introducing a wide range of innovative and proprietary new products. In addition, with a diligent focus on right-sizing the various components of inventory holdings, Microchip has been able to reduce its inventory to further boost its operating results during the quarter.With a strong operating framework, our proven model conclusively shows that Microchip is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it possesses the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is perfectly the case here as you will see below: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is currently at +3.33%. Microchip's Zacks Rank #2 when combined with a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat. On the other hand, the Sell-rated stocks (#4 and #5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Pattern Energy Group Inc.  , earnings ESP of +466.67% and a Zacks Rank #3.Hawaiian Electric Industries Inc.  , earnings ESP of +2.70% and a Zacks Rank #3.Consolidated Edison, Inc.  , earnings ESP of +0.82% and a Zacks Rank #3.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Short sellers helped to drive the market more than 12% higher through mid-March as indicated by large drops in some highly shorted names. Now, with the market trading in a tight range, short sellers remain quiet and generally inactive.Click to Enlarge  Total short interest on  stocks grew by a paltry 0.25% over the last two-week trading period - a lighter-than-average figure. From a contrarian perspective, the lack of current shorting activity may be signaling a bit of complacency that could come back to haunt stocks.However, even though short interest remains a bit boring at the aggregate level, there are still a number of individual companies that are sitting ready to benefit from their own short squeezes.Our most recent short squeeze uncovered a new list of names with high short interest and high potential.The table above identifies the top 15 stocks that are set up for a short squeeze rally based on their current technical strength. But as always, we'll take a closer look at a few of our current favorites. (  ) is a medical appliance company based in Kalamazoo, Michigan. The company is best known for its orthopedics division that supplies equipment for replacements of hips and knees.Like many in the medial industry, Stryker stock had a rough go through the second half of 2015 as the stock pulled back from its highs near $105 last July. most companies in the medical field, SYK is now trading back at its highs and even breaking higher.This is where the shorts come in.The short interest ratio on Stryker shares is above 6 - historically a trigger level, according to our model. In addition, short interest on the stock saw an increase of 20% for the last reporting period. The fact that SYK is breaking to new highs while the shorts are piling on their bearish bets will likely lead to a covering rally.We think shares will be driven 12% higher toward the $120 mark over the intermediate-term.We like more than a few things about this specialized semiconductor company.First,  (  ) deals in a segment of the industry that continues to grow; it provides chips for everything from wireless communications to audio applications to automotive networking.Second, MCHP generates a dividend yield of 2.9% at its current prices. This makes the stock attractive to investors that are trying to cope with the fact that lower interest rates really are here to stay for a while longer. So it has a dividend, and yet it's still a dynamic tech stock.Last, but certainly not least, is the current short squeeze setup on Microchip Technology. The stock saw a 10% increase to its short interest, which was already high. The current short interest ratio of 10.3 tells us that MCHP is ready to benefit from a short covering rally when the stock breaks above the $50 level.Our model is currently suggesting a price target of $56 on Microchip Technology as a result, or 15% higher from recent prices.The divergence between retail stocks continues to grow as the sector is drawing definitive lines between the haves and have-nots.  (  ) is back in the haves camp of late, as the fundamental changes it has been making for years are beginning to take hold, making Target stock one of the technical leaders in retail.The short sellers clearly don't see the comeback continuing, though, as short interest on TGT remains near its highest levels over the past two years. According to the last set of short interest data, shorts sellers added 6% to their bearish positions, driving the short interest ratio to 7.1.With Target stock nearing a breakout to new highs, a short squeeze is almost imminent. We see a break above the $84 level as the likely trigger for this rally, along with a price target of $96 - 15% higher - as the retail leader makes another move higher.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@3 Rally-Ready Stocks With Short Squeeze Potential – SYK MCHP TGT@2016-03-29@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-rally-ready-stocks-with-short-squeeze-potential-syk-mchp-tgt-2016-03-29
 is set to report first-quarter 2016 results on May 4. Last quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 2.82%. Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.CDW specializes in offering information technology products and services to business, government, education and healthcare customers primarily in the U.S. and Canada.Growth in customer channels and consistent strategic achievements are positive couple of factors that should drive the company's performance. Additionally, CDW's robust product portfolio and product refreshes continue to drive growth.The company's exposure in the high-end corporate desktop and digital education implementation space also remains a positive. Moreover, its strong position at medium to large businesses, focus on small & medium businesses and customer additions to grow market share are encouraging.However, the latest report on worldwide IT spending by Gartner raises concerns about CDW's near-term performance. The research firm expects worldwide IT spending to increase just 0.6% year over year in 2016 to $3.54 trillion due to the stronger dollar.Notably, 2015 witnessed the largest U.S. dollar drop in IT spending, since the research firm started tracking the expenses. Last year, the worldwide IT spending declined approximately 5.8% year over year or $216 billion to $3.52 trillion.Gartner also predicts that 2014 worldwide IT spending levels of about $3.74 billion will not be surpassed until 2019. These predictions may undermine CDW's to-be-reported quarterly results.Moreover, a highly leveraged balance sheet, competition from Insight Enterprises Inc. (NSIT) and PC Connection, Inc., and pricing pressures remain headwinds.Our proven model does not conclusively show that CDW will beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 63 cents. Hence, the difference is 0.00%. CDW carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). As it is, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some companies that you may consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Fitbit Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +175.00% and a Zacks Rank #2.Benefitfocus Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +4.00% and a Zacks Rank #2.Microchip Technology Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +3.33% and a Zacks Rank #2.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

 is slated to release third-quarter fiscal 2016 results on May 3, before the market opens.Last quarter, Harris had posted a positive earnings surprise of 9.56%. Moreover, the company's earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the previous four quarters, with an average beat of 7.08%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.We expect the company's revenues to remain under pressure in the third quarter due to foreign currency issues. However, the Exelis acquisition, completed last year, will boost results in the quarter. This was the third full quarter at Harris following the closure of the Exelis acquisition. With effect from the first quarter of fiscal 2016, the company has been reporting results through four operating units, namely, Communication Systems, Critical Networks, Electronic Systems and Space and Intelligence Systems. We expect a commentary on the integration process of the Exelis acquisition at the conference call.Moreover, Harris has won multiple contracts in the recent past which is expected to aid results. However, it is worth noting that the company primarily depends on U.S. government contracts for a major portion of its revenues. Thus, any federal budgetary pressure can result in substantial cuts in defense spending, which in turn, will significantly impact the company's operations.However, the company's efforts to reward shareholders through dividends/buybacks encourage us. We expect an update on such shareholder friendly activities during the conference call.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Harris is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below: : The ESP for the company stands at 0.00% as the Most Accurate estimate is in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.40 per share. : Harris has a Zacks Rank #3 which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, that alone is not sufficient to secure an earnings beat.As a caution, we advise investors not to consider Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement.Here are some companies in the broader Computer & Technology sector worth considering instead as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Agilent Technologies  , with an earnings ESP of +2.56% and a Zacks Rank #2.

e expect  , a leading manufacturer of wearable health and fitness tracking devices, to beat expectations when it reports first quarter 2016 results on May 4.Our proven model shows that Fitbit is likely to beat estimates this quarter. A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Fitbit has the right combination of two key components. Fitbit currently has an Earnings ESP of +175.0%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at earnings of 3 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of 4 cents. : Fitbit currently carries a Zacks Rank #2, which when combined with an ESP of +175.0% make us reasonably confident of a positive surprise.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Fitbit posted solid fourth-quarter results with both the top line and the bottom line exceeding the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate.Several factors are expected to drive results in the first quarter. Fitbit is rolling out Blaze and Alta on a global scale. This will, most likely result in additional manufacturing and marketing costs in the first quarter that will not impact revenues until the second quarter. So there will be significant pressure on earnings.On a positive note, there is significant untapped potential in China that Fitbit can target with its recent partnership with Tmall. The deal, which is expected to facilitate the distribution of Fitbit products in China encompasses devices, apps, social and motivational features, advice and personalized coaching. The personal coaching will be designed to bring behavioral changes in exercise, food, sleep and weight management thereby making the company a top fitness brand in the region with 10 million plus fans as soon as possible.For the first quarter Fitbit expects revenue between $420 million and $440 million. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is expected between breakeven to 2 cents.Fitbit is not the only firm looking up this earnings season.

remier semiconductor manufacturer  recently closed the acquisition of rival Atmel Corporation and updated its guidance for fourth-quarter fiscal 2016, soon after. The company also offered a sneak preview of Atmel's performance for the first quarter of 2016.For the quarter ended Mar 31, 2016, Microchip expects revenues to be record high and at the higher end of earlier guided range of $552.0-$568.5 million. Non-GAAP earnings are also anticipated to be near the upper end of its previous expectations of 65-69 cents per share.However, Atmel's sales are expected to decline on a sequential basis to $219-$221 million, down 15.8% at the mid-point from its December sales. Revenues are likely to be affected by weaker-than-anticipated billings, mostly in Asia, as distributors reduced inventory levels due to uncertainties associated with the just concluded acquisition process. In addition, foreign currency headwinds and a general slowdown in the overall semiconductor industry are expected to result in lower demands in almost all the major end markets.Despite the short-term hiccups, management remained confident that Atmel would yield synergistic benefits to Microchip and would be immediately accretive to its non-GAAP earnings per share. Microchip expects the acquisition to supplement its operational excellence and customer base. The transaction is deemed to be strategic as Atmel's microcontrollers, wireless, touch, memory and automotive products complement and enhance Microchip's corresponding solutions.Microchip is one of the fastest-growing providers of 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers in the world.

Notably, the company has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 92.59%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Gigamon's product launches continue to drive growth at the company. The GigaSMART and GigaVUE-HC2 platforms are witnessing increased adoption. Moreover, the company is adding clients, which should boost its first-quarter results.However, in addition to intensifying competition from Juniper Networks Inc.  and Cisco, the company is witnessing pricing challenges. Therefore, to retain market share, Gigamon may have to lower the prices of its products and services, which will, in turn, hurt its profitability.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Gigamon will beat earnings this quarter.

 is scheduled to release first-quarter 2016 earnings on May 5, after market close.In the fourth quarter of 2015, Motorola Solutions had posted a positive earnings surprise of 7.14%. In fact, the company has an impressive track record with respect to earnings, having outshined the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters, the average being 24.67%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.This Schaumburg, Illinois-based company is expected to grapple with foreign currency issues on the revenue front in the first quarter, as has been the case in the preceding quarter. Mirroring this apprehension, Motorola Solutions anticipates a 4% to 6% decline in revenues in the first quarter on a year-over-year basis (assuming a $20 million adverse currency impact).However, the acquisition of Airwave Solutions Ltd, completed in February this year, will boost results in the quarter. Moreover, the company's efforts to reward shareholders through dividends/buybacks encourage us.

ooking at the universe of stocks we cover at  , in trading on Monday, shares of MicroChip Technology, Inc. (Symbol: MCHP) were yielding above the 3% mark based on its quarterly dividend (annualized to $1.436), with the stock changing hands as low as $47.80 on the day. Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return. To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) back on 12/31/1999 - you would have paid $146.88 per share. Fast forward to 12/31/2012 and each share was worth $142.41 on that date, a decrease of $4.67/share over all those years. But now consider that you collected a whopping $25.98 per share in dividends over the same period, for a positive total return of 23.36%. Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.6%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 3% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable. MicroChip Technology, Inc. (Symbol: MCHP) is an S&P 500 company, giving it special status as one of the large-cap companies making up the S&P 500 Index.In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of MicroChip Technology, Inc., looking at the history chart for MCHP below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 3% annual yield.    According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, MCHP makes up 3.19% of the SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF (Symbol: XSD) which is trading lower by about 0.4% on the day Monday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@MCHP Crosses Above 3% Yield Territory@2016-03-14@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/mchp-crosses-above-3-yield-territory-2016-03-14

To further capitalize on this growing business potential, Microchip is developing a wide array of innovative and proprietary new products.Additionally, the company is continuing strategic acquisitions to broaden its product portfolio. Earlier this year, Microchip inked a definitive agreement to acquire touchscreen chipmaker Atmel Corporation  for $8.15 per share, comprising $7.00 per share in cash and $1.15 per share in Microchip stock. This equates to a total equity value of about $3.56 billion and total enterprise value of about $3.40 billion. The acquisition, expected to close in the second quarter of 2016, is subject to customary closing conditions and approval from Atmel's shareholders. Microchip's stockholders have already given their assent.Microchip expects the acquisition to supplement its operational excellence and customer base. The transaction is deemed to be strategic as Atmel's microcontrollers, wireless, touch, memory and automotive products complement and enhance Microchip's solutions in these areas.

ouchscreen chipmaker  reported fourth-quarter 20Array5 GAAP net income of $4.7 million or a penny per share basis compared with net loss of $6.5 million or loss of 2 cents per share in the year-earlier quarter. The year-over-year improvement in earnings, despite lower revenues, was primarily attributable to lower operating expenses during the reported quarter.Non-GAAP earnings for fourth-quarter 20Array5 were $24.9 million or 6 cents per share compared with $49.2 million or Array2 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted earnings (including stock-based compensation expenses) for the reported quarter were 3 cents per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.For full-year 20Array5, Atmel recorded GAAP net income of $26.9 million or 6 cents per share compared with $32.2 million or 8 cents per share in 20Array4. The year-over-year decrease in earnings was largely driven by lower revenues in 20Array5. Non-GAAP net income was $Array38.4 million or 32 cents per share in 20Array5 compared with $Array66.4 million or 39 cents per share in 20Array4.Atmel reported net revenue of $26Array.3 million for the quarter compared with $345.9 million in the prior-year quarter. Revenues were adversely affected by weaker-than-anticipated billings mostly in Asia, as distributors reduced inventory levels due to uncertainties associated with the ongoing acquisition process. In addition, foreign currency headwinds and a general slowdown in the overall semiconductor industry resulted in softness in almost all the major end markets. Net revenue missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $27Array million. For full-year 20Array5, revenues declined Array7% year over year to $Array.Array7 billion from $Array.4Array billion in 20Array4.By segments, revenue from the Microcontroller business declined 23.6% year over year to $Array83.Array million. Revenue from the Automotive business segment decreased Array9% on a year-over-year basis to $3Array.6 million due to weak demand. Non-volatile Memory segment recorded revenues of $29.7 million, down 32.5% year over year. Revenues from Other business segment were $Array6.9 million, down 27.2% compared to the fourth quarter of 20Array4, primarily due to decline in legacy businesses and the adverse impact of foreign exchange rates.GAAP gross margin improved to 46.3% in the fourth quarter of 20Array5 from 40.6% in the fourth quarter of 20Array4. Successful execution of planned cost-reduction strategies, healthy product mix and a solid business model led to the notable margin expansion. Non-GAAP gross margin, however, decreased to 47.5% from 49.0% in the prior-year period.Subsequent to the quarter end, US-based premier semiconductor manufacturer Microchip Technology Incorporated  inked a definitive agreement to acquire Atmel for $8.Array5 per share, comprising $7.00 per share in cash and $Array.Array5 per share in Microchip stock. This equated to a total equity value of about $3.56 billion and total enterprise value of about $3.40 billion.The acquisition, expected to close in the second quarter of 20Array6, is subject to customary closing conditions and approval from Atmel's shareholders, as Microchip's stockholders have already given their assent. The company expects the Atmel buyout to supplement its operational excellence and customer base. Microchip further believes that the acquisition will aid the launch of cutting-edge competitive products, going forward; thereby helping it grab a higher market share in the microcontroller business.The transaction also brings a lot to the table for Atmel shareholders as it is clearly superlative to the proposal of Dialog Semiconductor PLC, which had also shown interest in buying Atmel. Shareholders of Atmel will receive greater cash consideration per share, along with the inherent benefit of the upside potential associated with the ownership of Microchip stocks.The company ended the quarter with combined cash balance (cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments) of $2Array0.3 million, down $8.5 million sequentially. The decrease in the cash balance was due to lower cash flow from operations, a reduction in trade accounts payable and a $9.0 million repayment of European loans, partially offset by a reduction in inventories, receivables, and capital expenditures. Cash provided by operations totaled $9.Array million in the reported quarter, compared to $37.2 million for the fourth quarter of 20Array4, bringing the respective tallies for the years to $Array05.8 million and $Array79.8 million.Long-term debt at the end of 20Array5 decreased significantly to $55 million from $75 million in 20Array4. During the reported quarter, Atmel did not repurchase any shares due to its pending acquisition by Microchip.Industry experts are anticipating a broad slowdown in the semiconductor space, and such negative macroeconomic conditions have led to an increased rate of market consolidation. Whether such industry consolidation will indeed be beneficial for the market players in the future could only be answered in due course of time. Meanwhile, the strategic move by this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock and Microchip appear to be enterprising.A couple of players in the industry that are worth reckoning at the moment include Himax Technologies, Inc.  and Mellanox Technologies, Ltd.  , both carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"ou might not think of ""Nasdaq"" as synonymous with big dividends. The Nasdaq Composite index, which essentially consists of every domestic and foreign stock that trades on the exchange, has long been heavy on technology. And technology companies have historically shown a bias for reinvesting their profits to finance future growth, rather than returning cash to shareholders. None of the FANGs -- Facebook (symbol  ), Amazon.com (  ), Netflix (  ) and Google (  ), now called Alphabet -- pays a dividend.But if you dig a little deeper, you'll find some rich payouts. Here are eight Nasdaq-listed companies with generous dividends that have the potential to grow. Even better, many of the stocks are dirt cheap. Several of the companies have similar profiles: large technology firms that are past their years of rapid growth but still throw off a lot of cash, which can be used to boost distributions. But the Nasdaq holds more than just tech, so we've also included a few companies from other sectors, as well as some less-well-known tech firms.52-week range: $92.00 - $134.54Market capitalization: $544.0 billionAnnual dividend rate per share: $2.08Yield: 2.1%Price-earnings ratio: 11Sure, the fate of Apple (symbol  , $98.12) has become closely tied to the fate of the iPhone. And with our lives already saturated with Apple products, it's hard to see how the company can grow as rapidly in the future as it has over the past 10 years.But that saturation works to the company's advantage. ""Apple has created an ecosystem that makes its customers sticky,"" says Burns McKinney, comanager of the AllianzGI NFJ Dividend Value Fund (  ). Because of hurdles Apple has built to transferring content from Apple products to other companies' products, and because of the ease with which Apple products work together, Apple customers tend to stay Apple customers, and so far they continue to be willing to pay a premium price for Apple products.Apple still has room to grow in developing nations, as evidenced by record iPhone sales in China during the company's most-recent quarter, which ended December 26. Emerging countries accounted for 34% of the $76 billion in revenues Apple generated in the quarter.Finally, the stock is shockingly cheap, and Apple's balance sheet is pristine. The stock sells for 11 times estimated year-ahead earnings, well below the S&P's P/E of 16. The company holds about $216 billion in cash and securities, which works out to about $39 per share. If you subtract that cash from the share price, Apple's P/E falls to just 6. ""It's a deal in broad daylight,"" says McKinney. Since Apple resumed paying a dividend in 2012, it has boosted its payout at a 9.5% average annual pace.52-week range: $22.47-$30.31Market capitalization: $134.3 billionAnnual dividend rate per share: $1.04Yield: 3.9%Price-earnings ratio: 12Cisco (  , $26.46) remains the industry leader for the routers and switches that carry the Internet's traffic over networks. But the stock has been treading water for more than a decade. Some of the stock's mediocre performance stems from flagging growth rates; Cisco's sales have grown at an annualized rate of just 4.2% over its past five fiscal years (Cisco's fiscal year ends in July). That compares with average annual sales growth of 10% for the five years through its 2010 fiscal year. The company has also been grappling with how to meet the long-term challenges of cloud computing and software-defined networking (in which programmers can direct their network's traffic using software, rather than relying on routers and switches themselves to direct traffic), both of which threaten to obviate the needs of Cisco customers for miles of expensive gear. More immediately, a slowing economy poses the threat of businesses delaying their routine gear upgrades.But Cisco has the resources to meet its challenges. In its most recent quarter, which ended January 23, revenues from the Application Centric Infrastructure line - essentially Cisco's answer to the rise of software-defined networking - more than doubled from the same period a year earlier. And the company has a strong track record of making the right acquisitions when it needs to boost its in-house capabilities.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Best Nasdaq Stocks for Dividends@2016-02-18@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/best-nasdaq-stocks-dividends-2016-02-18
"he  formula at  ranks a coverage universe of thousands of  , according to a proprietary formula designed to identify those stocks that combine two important characteristics - strong fundamentals and a valuation that looks inexpensive. MicroChip Technology, Inc. (Symbol: MCHP) presently has an above average rank, in the top 50% of the coverage universe, which suggests it is among the top most ""interesting"" ideas that merit further research by investors.But making MicroChip Technology, Inc. an even more interesting and timely stock to look at, is the fact that in trading on Thursday, shares of MCHP entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $39.35 per share. We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30. In the case of MicroChip Technology, Inc., the RSI reading has hit 29.3 - by comparison, the universe of dividend stocks covered by  currently has an average RSI of 38.1. A falling stock price - all else being equal - creates a better opportunity for dividend investors to capture a higher yield. Indeed, MCHP's recent annualized dividend of 1.436/share (currently paid in quarterly installments) works out to an annual yield of 3.57% based upon the recent $40.27 share price.A bullish investor could look at MCHP's 29.3 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. Among the fundamental datapoints dividend investors should investigate to decide if they are bullish on MCHP is its dividend history. In general, dividends are not always predictable; but, looking at the history chart below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue.According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, MCHP makes up 2.93% of the SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF (Symbol: XSD) which is trading lower by about 1.9% on the day Thursday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@MicroChip Technology Enters Oversold Territory@2016-02-11@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/microchip-technology-enters-oversold-territory-2016-02-11
 recently announced its decision to hike quarterly dividend by 2 cents to 42 cents per share, representing a 5% increase from the prior amount. The new dividend will be paid on Mar 8, 2016, to stockholders of record as of Feb 26.Additionally, the company increased its stock buyback authorization to $1 billion. As of Jan 30, 2016, the company had $415 million remaining under the previous authorization.The strength of Analog Devices' business model is reflected in its strong cash generation capabilities and commitment to return value to shareholders.Analog Devices' strong balance sheet and cash flows provide financial flexibility to offer dividend hikes, repurchase shares and pursue strategic acquisitions. During the last quarter, Analog Devices spent $111.7 million on share repurchases and paid $125.6 million as dividends. The cash and short-term investments balance was $3.03 billion, down from $3.09 billion in the prior quarter. The debt to total capital ratio, including long-term liabilities and short-term debt, was 19.0%. We remain encouraged by Analog Devices' strong cash position and its ability to service long-term debts.Analog Devices is slated to report first-quarter fiscal 2016 results on Feb 17. Last month, the company lowered the first-quarter revenue expectation to a range of $745-$765 million, from the $805-$855 million range. Management blamed the weaker-than-expected demand in the portable consumer business unit for the guidance cut, which it expects to linger in the second quarter as well.Though we remain concerned about the competitive pressures across several markets, Analog Devices is solidly positioned in secular growth markets. Also, continued share buybacks and dividend hikes will inspire investors' loyalty.Analog Devices carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some well-ranked stocks in the same space are MaxLinear, Inc.  , Inphi Corporation  and Microchip Technology Inc.  .

ith less than two weeks before its third-quarter fiscal 2016 earnings release, the U.S.-based semiconductor firm  has come up with two headlines that will likely receive heavy investor scrutiny. These include the company's announcement of offering a sneak peek into its third-quarter fiscal 2015 results and the materialization of the Atmel Corporation  buyout.Overall, Microchip's preliminary third-quarter 2015 results can be described as largely satisfactory, in view of the ongoing macroeconomic turmoil across the globe. The company expects non-GAAP net sales of $552 million (compared with the earlier expectation of $539.7-$563.5 million) and earnings per share of 62-63 cents, (previously predicted in a range of 58-64 cents), both of which come above the midpoint of the guidance provided in Nov 2015.The expected EPS and sales figures may offer some respite to investors who had enough reasons to worry given the exchange rate volatility and sluggishness of customer spending amid a challenging global economic scenario.Based on the resiliency of its business model, in an otherwise distressful global economic environment, Microchip also inked a definitive agreement to acquire touchscreen chipmaker Atmel for $8.15 per share, comprising $7.00 per share in cash and $1.15 per share in Microchip stock. This equates to a total equity value of about $3.56 billion and total enterprise value of about $3.40 billion. However, Atmel's cash and investments, net of debt of approximately $155.0 million exiting the fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 2015, have been excluded from the acquisition price.The buyout will be funded through a combination of cash and common stock. Also, to facilitate the transaction, Microchip's directors have simultaneously authorized an increase in the existing share repurchase program to 15.0 million shares from approximately 11.4 million shares remaining under the prior authorization. The acquisition, expected to close in the second quarter of calendar year 2016, is subject to customary closing conditions and approval from Atmel's shareholders, as Microchip's stockholders has already given their assent.This acquisition also brings a lot to the table for Atmel shareholders as it is clearly superlative to the proposal of Dialog Semiconductor PLC, which had also shown interest in buying Atmel. Shareholders of Atmel will receive greater cash consideration per share, along with inherent benefit of upside potential associated with ownership of Microchip stocks.Apart from the impressive preliminary results which hint at the company's resiliency, this acquisition, on Microchip's part, reflects its ongoing consolidation strategy. Under the latter, the firm has a pipeline of acquisitions to multiply its organic revenue growth by twofold. The company expects Atmel buyout to supplement its operational excellence and customer base. Microchip believes the acquisition of Atmel will aid the launch of cutting-edge competitive products, going forward; thereby helping it grab a higher market share.Microchip also revealed that the Atmel buyout will be immediately accretive to its non-GAAP earnings per share. Earlier, the company had acquired 83.5% of ISSC Technologies Corporation, a low power Bluetooth and advanced wireless solutions provider for the Internet of Things, to supplement its presence in these niche markets. Amid the present market scenario, the company expects to achieve $170 million in synergies from cost-savings and incremental revenue growth by fiscal year 2019.Microchip currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the industry include M/A-Com Technology Solutions Holdings, Inc.  and MaxLinear, Inc.  .

ouchscreen chipmaker  recently reported preliminary fourth-quarter 2015 results.Non-GAAP earnings per share for the soon-to-be-reported quarter are expected to be 6 cents per share. Atmel expects net revenue in the range of $261 and $262 million for this quarter, compared to the earlier expectations of $266 million - $286 million. Revenues were adversely affected by weaker-than-expected billings and fall in inventory levels due to uncertainties associated with the company's ongoing acquisition process in the Asian market.Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be between 47.3 to 47.7% in comparison to the anticipated 47-48%. Atmel's non-GAAP operating expenses however are expected to be around $98 to $100 million, below the midpoint of the original outlook of $98 to $102 million.Subsequent to the fourth-quarter, US-based leading semiconductor manufacturer Microchip Technology Incorporated  has proposed a deal to acquire shares of Atmel at $8.15 per share. This proposal is superior to that of Dialog Semiconductor PLC. The company is looking forward to a revised proposal from Dialog which should be superior to that of Microchip. However, in case Dialog fails to do so, the company will cancel the merger agreement and join hands with Microchip.Microchip and Atmel are looking forward to create a microcontroller, analog and internet of things (IoT) powerhouse. Atmel's microcontrollers, wireless, touch, memory and automotive products complement and enhance many of Microchip's solutions in these areas. This collaboration looks very promising from the point of view of the shareholders of these two companies since this can give rise to more innovative products and help the companies expand their customer base in the respective markets.Industry experts are anticipating a slowdown in the semiconductor space and such negative macroeconomic conditions have led to an increased rate of market consolidation. Whether such industry consolidation will indeed be beneficial for the market players in the future could only be answered in due course of time.Presently Atmel carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. A couple of players in the industry that are worth reckoning at the moment include Diodes Inc  and Infineon Tech  each carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"or the second time in four months, rumors are circulating that  is the target of a China-based group interested in acquiring it. Similar to the first murmurings, which arose in late September, the board of the up-and-coming maker of mobile touch screens, fingerprint sensors, and similar technologies, was supposedly offered $110 per outstanding share.When the ""news"" broke, Synaptics stock was sitting at $62.05 a share: It closed the following trading day above $78. Synaptics' stock has since eased a bit, but such a rapid jump might be cause for concern for growth investors afraid they missed the boat. What makes Synaptics still such an intriguing opportunity, however, is that even at these price levels it's a screaming steal with a world of upside.Image courtesy of  Much has been made of the expected slowdown in sales of high-end smartphones this year. The leading manufacturers are feeling the pressure, and that angst has spilled over to their suppliers, including Synaptics and competitor  .The recent news that Microchip is acquiring  for $8.15 a share puts it directly in Synaptics sights as it relates to sensors, security, and the fast-growing smart car market. But Synaptics offers investors more upside than Microchip and others in the space, it's continuing to grow revenue -- albeit slowly for the time being -- and is focused on diversifying its product offerings.Last quarter's $470.5 million in revenue was just a 2% improvement over the prior year. But thanks to strong management of expenses, gross margin grew about 30%, and net income rose to $0.96 a share, more than 60% higher than a year earlier. And Synaptics' financial results don't tell the whole story. Going forward -- with or without a strong smartphone market -- forays into cutting-edge technologies will determine Synaptics future, and it's looking awfully bright. About 87% of Synaptics revenue last quarter was derived from its mobile division, and that figure is expected to rise to 90% in the current period. Consumers are making it clear that ""mobile"" doesn't apply to just smartphones and tablets: Connectivity is quickly becoming a must-have feature in a new car for many buyers.A survey was conducted recently in which consumers who had just purchased cars were asked what they valued more: the vehicle's performance, or a connected infotainment system. Performance took a backseat to ""connected."" That's good news for Synaptics and its recently ramped-up automotive solutions business.Synaptics boosted its smart car initiatives even further following the announcement that it had inked a deal with auto parts mega-supplier  . The collaboration with France-based Valeo will result in the industry's ""first automotive touchscreen that combines capacitive touch, ClearForce ™ force sensing technology and haptic feedback (enhanced touch sensing).""Another opportunity Synaptics is tackling head-on is the fast-growing wearables market. The popularity of fitness bands, smartwatches, and other wearable devices is expected to explode in the coming months and years. And Synaptics newest touchscreen solution is suitable for all those small devices and is already in production. It's worth monitoring what impact these new efforts will have in boosting Synaptics' top line in the coming quarters.Yes, smartphone sales will be under pressure this year, but Synaptics will still prosper thanks to its product diversification efforts. There's also Synaptics' relative value for growth investors to consider. As of this writing, Microchip is trading at over 14 times future earnings, hardly expensive for one of the larger competitors in Synaptics' sandbox. But Microchip's current valuation appears steep when compared to Synaptics. At just 9.5 times projected revenue, Synaptics is an absolute bargain, and it looks even better from the eyes of industry analysts.Synaptics has an average price target of over $86 a share, which is approximately 30% above its current price. No need to rely on rumors to justify giving Synaptics a good, long look. Its foray into burgeoning markets combined with its bargain-basement valuation are more than enough reasons to put Synaptics on your buy list.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

eading semiconductor manufacturer  is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2016 results after the closing bell on Feb 3. In the last reported quarter, Microchip's adjusted earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents. The company has beaten earnings estimates in each of the last four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 4.3%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Microchip is one of the fastest growing providers of 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers in the world. The microcontroller business of the company has historically outperformed the industry and is expected to continue this feat in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Microchip also remains bullish on the surging demand for 3D control displays in a gamut of industries ranging from home automation to IoT (Internet of Things). The company is increasingly expanding its touch business beyond handsets and tablets in areas such as automotive industrial applications.The Analog business of Microchip has also become one of the largest analog franchises in the market. In order to further capitalize on this burgeoning business potential, Microchip is developing and introducing a wide range of innovative and proprietary new products. In addition, with a diligent focus on right-sizing the various components of inventory holdings, Microchip has been able to reduce its inventory. Microchip expects to record solid top- and bottom-line growth in the upcoming quarter.Microchip has offered a sneak peek at its third-quarter fiscal 2016 results in a preliminary update. Despite the challenging macroeconomic environment, the company expects non-GAAP earnings per share of 62-63 cents (previously predicted in a range of 58-64 cents) on non-GAAP sales of $552 million ($539.7-$563.5 million prior guidance), both of which come above the midpoint of the earlier guidance.Despite expectations of healthy bookings on the back of strong demand and robust product designs, our proven model does not conclusively show that Microchip is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it lacks the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is currently at 0.00%. Microchip's Zacks Rank #2 when combined with 0.00% ESP makes an earnings beat prediction uncertain. On the other hand, the Sell-rated stocks (#4 and #5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:American Capital, Ltd.  , earnings ESP of +12.50% and a Zacks Rank #1.Gilead Sciences Inc.  , earnings ESP of +2.75% and a Zacks Rank #1.Valero Energy Corporation  , earnings ESP of +8.96% and a Zacks Rank #2.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

remium semiconductor manufacturer  reported relatively solid third-quarter fiscal 2016 results despite a challenging macroeconomic environment. GAAP net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2016 (ended Dec 31, 2015) was $61.2 million or 28 cents per share compared with $86.1 million or 39 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year decrease in earnings, despite a healthy top-line improvement, was primarily attributable to high operating expenses.Non-GAAP net income for the reported quarter was $138.4 million or 64 cents per share compared with $143.3 million or 64 cents per share in the year-earlier quarter. Recurring earnings (with stock-based compensation adjustments) were 61 cents per share, which comfortably exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6 cents.Net revenue (GAAP) for the reported quarter was $540.3 million, up 2.2% year over year, while non-GAAP revenues were up 3.0% to $552.0 million. The non-GAAP revenues for third-quarter fiscal 2016 were in sync with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.In terms of product mix, revenues from microcontroller products accounted for 59.7% of the total revenue in the quarter, while analog and memory products generated 29.7% and 5.1%, respectively. From the geographical perspective, bulk of the revenues were generated in Asia ($323.9 million, 60% of the total revenue), followed by Europe ($113.7 million, 21%) and Americas ($102.8 million, 19%).By product line, GAAP revenues from microcontrollers were $322.7 million, down 3.5% sequentially due to broad-based weakness in the semiconductor industry. The microcontroller business of the company declined 1.4% year over year in 2015.GAAP revenues from the analog products (including Micrel results) were up 4.1% sequentially to $160.3 million. Over the last four quarters, the analog business was up 22.4% due to organic growth and accretive effect of the Micrel acquisition. Microchip has almost completed the integration of Micrel and expects the full integration to be complete by August 2016.With GAAP revenues of $27.7 million in the reported quarter, the memory business was down 8.3% sequentially. GAAP revenue from the licensing business was $22.7 million in the reported quarter.Microchip recorded GAAP gross margin of 54.2% for the reported quarter. Operating income declined to $76.1 million from $98.0 million in the year-ago period, due to high operating expenses. Operating margin stood at 14.1% in the reported quarter.Subsequent to the quarter end, Microchip inked a definitive agreement to acquire touchscreen chipmaker Atmel Corporation  for $8.15 per share, comprising $7.00 per share in cash and $1.15 per share in Microchip stock. This equated to a total equity value of about $3.56 billion and total enterprise value of about $3.40 billion.The buyout will be funded through a combination of cash and common stock. Also, to facilitate the transaction, Microchip's directors have simultaneously authorized an increase in the existing share repurchase program to 15.0 million shares from approximately 11.4 million shares remaining under the prior authorization. The acquisition, expected to close in the second quarter of calendar year 2016, is subject to customary closing conditions and approval from Atmel's shareholders, as Microchip's stockholders has already given their assent.The company expects the Atmel buyout to supplement its operational excellence and customer base. Microchip further believes that the acquisition will aid the launch of cutting-edge competitive products, going forward; thereby helping it grab a higher market share in the microcontroller business.Cash and short-term investments were $1,007.9 million at quarter end, with $1,008.4 million under its long term line of credit. Net cash generation for the quarter (excluding acquisition, dividend payment, and reduction in borrowings) was $172 million.The company declared a quarterly cash dividend of 35.9 cents per share payable on Mar 7, 2016 to stockholders of record on Feb 22. Capital expenditure was approximately $17.9 million with consolidated inventory at $319.5 million.Management provided guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. It expects non-GAAP net sales between $552.0 million and $568.5 million, while non-GAAP gross margin is expected in the range of 57.9% to 58.1%. Non-GAAP net income is anticipated in the range of $141.1 million to $150.5 million, with non-GAAP earnings per share of 65 cents to 69 cents per share. Microchip expects to generate approximately $140 million to $160 million cash in the upcoming quarter prior to the dividend payment and acquisitions. The company expects to incur $28 million in capital expenditure in the next quarter, bringing its tally to about $110 million for fiscal 2016.Moving forward, management expects the triple effect resulting from organic growth, accretion from Micrel and accretion from Atmel will lead to a 23% non-GAAP EPS growth from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017. We remain impressed with the bullish outlook of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock. A couple of other stocks that look promising in the industry include Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.  and Silicon Laboratories Inc.  , both carrying the same Zacks Rank as Microchip.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

all Street was limping into another open, holding on to heavy losses as more bad news from China triggered a selling spree in oil and global equity markets. After data showing that Chinese foreign exchange reserves fell by a record amount in December, Beijing orchestrated a 0.5% devaluation in the beleaguered yuan, setting in motion a swoon in Chinese equities that was quickly exported overseas. In less than 15 minutes of trade, the Shanghai plummeted more than 7%, permeating Europe and the U.S. where Dow futures were already more than 300 points below fair value.Commodities were also taking it on the chin with oil at a 12-year low of $32.10, copper nearly 3% lower and struggling to hold onto a $2 handle, and nickel and zinc nearly 4% in the red.

 revealed that its RN2483 LoRa module had passed the LoRa Alliance's LoRaWAN Certification Program, and it is the first of its kind to do so.The module was independently tested by Espotel's accredited test laboratory, to confirm if it satisfied the functional requirements of the latest LoRaWAN 1.0 protocol specification. In fact, Espotel said that it will use Microchip's RN2483 module as a standard in the further development of the LoRaWAN certification, interoperability and performance testing.The module was tested for operation in the 868 MHz license-free band.The assessment ensures that designers can swiftly and effortlessly integrate their application-specific end devices into any LoRaWAN network - which is a critical prerequisite for the global deployment of the IoT (Internet of Things) using low-power wide area networks (LPWANs).The LoRaWAN standard enables low-data-rate Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine-to-Machine (M2M) wireless communication with a range of up to 10 miles, a battery life of 10 years, and the ability to connect millions of wireless sensor nodes to LoRaWAN gateways.Before the commencement of the certification program, Microchip's LoRa development team had conducted extensive verification and interoperability tests with major LoRaWAN network infrastructure vendors. For instance, the RN2483 module had already been accepted as the reference device by leading LoRa Core Network provider OrbiWise.The launch of an accredited certification program is a key step toward the LoRa Alliance's mission to standardize an open specification for secure, carrier-grade, low-power wide area networks (LPWAN).According to research firm Gartner, the burgeoning IoT market is expected to grow to a whopping 25 billion connected things in 2020. However, the explosive growth presents a challenge for developers as they strove to set up a simple, robust infrastructure with their limited resources. They require a solution that is easy to design, has a short time to market and comes with minimum total cost of ownership. Also, it should have great interoperability and be able to handle nationwide deployment.Microchip's LoRaWAN module enables accelerating development time while minimizing development costs. Additionally, it offers the flexibility to connect and control a huge number of sensors and actuators, and takes up minimal space.The RN2483 module's scalability, mobility, robust communication and the capability to operate in harsh outdoor environments makes it perfect for a wide range of low-data-rate wireless monitoring and control designs.Microchip currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks that look promising in the semiconductor space include MaxLinear, Inc  , NVIDIA Corporation  and Texas Instruments Inc.  , each carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"he  formula at  ranks a coverage universe of thousands of  , according to a proprietary formula designed to identify those stocks that combine two important characteristics - strong fundamentals and a valuation that looks inexpensive. MicroChip Technology, Inc. (Symbol: MCHP) presently has an above average rank, in the top 50% of the coverage universe, which suggests it is among the top most ""interesting"" ideas that merit further research by investors.But making MicroChip Technology, Inc. an even more interesting and timely stock to look at, is the fact that in trading on Thursday, shares of MCHP entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $42.39 per share. We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30. In the case of MicroChip Technology, Inc., the RSI reading has hit 29.3 - by comparison, the universe of dividend stocks covered by  currently has an average RSI of 40.6. A falling stock price - all else being equal - creates a better opportunity for dividend investors to capture a higher yield. Indeed, MCHP's recent annualized dividend of 1.434/share (currently paid in quarterly installments) works out to an annual yield of 3.20% based upon the recent $44.93 share price.A bullish investor could look at MCHP's 29.3 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. Among the fundamental datapoints dividend investors should investigate to decide if they are bullish on MCHP is its dividend history. In general, dividends are not always predictable; but, looking at the history chart below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue.According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, MCHP makes up 2.61% of the SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF (Symbol: XSD) which is trading lower by about 3.4% on the day Thursday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Relative Strength Alert For MicroChip Technology@2016-01-07@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/relative-strength-alert-microchip-technology-2016-01-07
nvestors considering a purchase of MicroChip Technology, Inc. (Symbol: MCHP) stock, but cautious about paying the going market price of $45.01/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2018 put at the $30 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $1.80. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 6% return against the $30 commitment, or a 2.9% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to MCHP's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $30 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless MicroChip Technology, Inc. sees its shares fall 33.5% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $28.20 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $1.80 from $30), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 2.9% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for MicroChip Technology, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $30 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2018 put at the $30 strike for the 2.9% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for MicroChip Technology, Inc. (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $45.01) to be 26%.

"ollowing a string of so-so to disappointing quarters through most of 2015, social media giant Facebook (  ) posted very impressive Q3 earnings after the bell Wednesday. Earnings per share of 36 cents in the quarter (accounting for stock-based compensation and other non-recurring items [BNRI]) beat the Zacks consensus estimate of 35 cents, and revenues reached $4.50 billion, easily topping the $4.39 billion we had expected.Of course, the real story of Facebook is in its user growth and increased ad revenues, not the bottom line (this is what has accounted for 38 percent growth in  year over year despite missing EPS numbers in the previous 3 quarters). And on this score, Facebook has done extremely well: Daily Active Users (DAU) topped 1 billion, mobile DAU gained 27 percent year over year to 894 million and mobile Monthly Active Users (MMAU) increased 23 percent to 1.39 billion users.Importantly, 78 percent of Facebook's advertising revenues in Q315 came from mobile, way up from 66 percent in Q314. Average revenue per user is now closing in on $3 at $2.97. Facebook's Instagram business performed particularly well in the quarter; you may recall Facebook paid $1 billion to acquire the social media competitor early in Facebook's public existence, and this looks to have already paid off quite nicely.CEO Mark Zuckerberg commented on the earnings press release: ""We had a good quarter and got a lot done... We're focused on innovating and investing for the long term to serve our community and connect the entire world."" Not too shabby. After-market trading is sending Facebook shares up another 2.75 percent after an initial pop of around 5 percent. It would appear its economies of scale have yet to catch up to Facebook's impressive growth.Within the Internet-based family of companies reporting after the bell, cyber-security firm FireEye (  ) also reported Q3 results, but the stock is selling off more than 14 percent in late trading. Although FireEye posted an improved loss of 75 cents per share from the Zacks consensus of -88 cents per share (again, including stock-based compensation and other BNRI) on sales of $166 million in the quarter (just a smidge light of the $167 million we'd expected), but Q4 guidance was disappointing. While the Zacks consensus had been expecting $202 million for the final 3 quarters of the year, FireEye now expects between $182-190 million.Finally, Microchip Technology (  ) announced earnings of 59 cents per share (ex-BNRI, etc.) on sales of $559.4 million in its fiscal Q2 of 2016. This beats the Zacks estimates of 57 cents per share and $552 million, respectively. However, while the company did point out it has now posted profits in 100 straight quarters, CEO Steve Sanghi also remarked, """"We believe that industry conditions continue to be very weak.""Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"Chicago, IL - November 05, 2015 -  highlights  (  ) as the Bull of the Day and  (  ) as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ).Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: (  ) recently delivered a solid ""beat and raise"", driven by expanding profit margins. This prompted analysts to revise their earnings estimates significantly higher for both 2015 and 2016, sending the stock to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).The valuation picture looks attractive too with shares trading at just 11x forward earnings.Celanese Corporation produces specialty materials and chemical products which are used in most major industries and consumer applications. It is one of the world's largest producers of acetyl products, which are intermediate chemicals for nearly all major industries. Celanese is also a leading producer of high performance engineered polymers, which are used in various high-value applications.The company has a large and diverse customer base, with sales approximately equally divided between North America, Europe and Asia.Celanese reported solid third quarter results on October 19. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.50, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.38.Net sales actually fell 20% to $1.413 billion, missing the consensus. However, approximately six percentage points (p.p.) of this decline was due to foreign currency headwinds from the strong dollar. Lower prices contributed 10 p.p. while volume contributed 5 p.p.Nonetheless, profit margins improved as the segment income margin expanded 150 basis points to Q3 record of 21.6%. This was driven in large part by record margin in the 'Materials Solutions' segment, along with productivity improvements across the company. This more than offset lower profits in the 'Acetyl Chain' segment due to higher methanol costs. It's worth noting, too, that Celanese completed construction and began methanol production at a joint venture in Clear Lake, Texas in October. : (  ) recently reported disappointing third quarter results as both sales and earnings fell short of consensus. Weakness in the emerging markets more than offset growth in North America and Europe in Q3.Management also lowered its full year sales and EPS guidance, prompting analysts to revise their estimates lower too. In fact, the drop in consensus estimates has been significant enough to send the stock to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), placing it in the bottom 5% of all stocks that Zacks ranks based on earnings momentum.The valuation picture doesn't look very compelling either with shares trading at more than 23x forward earnings. It sports a Zacks Value Style Score of 'F'.Mead Johnson Nutrition Company is a pediatric nutrition that makes more than 70 products. Its ""Enfa"" family of brands, includes Enfamil infant formula.Mead Johnson reported its third quarter results on October 22. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $0.80, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5 cents. It was a 14% decline over the same quarter last year.Net sales fell 10% to $977.5 million, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.041 billion. A decline in volume contributed 4 percentage points (p.p.) while foreign currency accounted for the other 6 p.p.Strength in North America and Europe was more than offset by weak performance in emerging markets, including China.The adjusted gross profit margin actually expanded from 60.1% to 64.9%. But this was more than offset by a higher tax rate, as the effective tax rate jumped from 17.2% to 28.1%.Following a string of so-so to disappointing quarters through most of 2015, social media giant Facebook (  ) posted very impressive Q3 earnings after the bell Wednesday. Earnings per share of 36 cents in the quarter (accounting for stock-based compensation and other non-recurring items [BNRI]) beat the Zacks consensus estimate of 35 cents, and revenues reached $4.50 billion, easily topping the $4.39 billion we had expected.Of course, the real story of Facebook is in its user growth and increased ad revenues, not the bottom line (this is what has accounted for 38 percent growth in  year over year despite missing EPS numbers in the previous 3 quarters). And on this score, Facebook has done extremely well: Daily Active Users (DAU) topped 1 billion, mobile DAU gained 27 percent year over year to 894 million and mobile Monthly Active Users (MMAU) increased 23 percent to 1.39 billion users.Importantly, 78 percent of Facebook's advertising revenues in Q315 came from mobile, way up from 66 percent in Q314. Average revenue per user is now closing in on $3 at $2.97. Facebook's Instagram business performed particularly well in the quarter; you may recall Facebook paid $1 billion to acquire the social media competitor early in Facebook's public existence, and this looks to have already paid off quite nicely.CEO Mark Zuckerberg commented on the earnings press release: ""We had a good quarter and got a lot done... We're focused on innovating and investing for the long term to serve our community and connect the entire world."" Not too shabby. After-market trading is sending Facebook shares up another 2.75 percent after an initial pop of around 5 percent. It would appear its economies of scale have yet to catch up to Facebook's impressive growth.Within the Internet-based family of companies reporting after the bell, cyber-security firm FireEye (  ) also reported Q3 results, but the stock is selling off more than 14 percent in late trading. Although FireEye posted an improved loss of 75 cents per share from the Zacks consensus of -88 cents per share (again, including stock-based compensation and other BNRI) on sales of $166 million in the quarter (just a smidge light of the $167 million we'd expected), but Q4 guidance was disappointing. While the Zacks consensus had been expecting $202 million for the final 3 quarters of the year, FireEye now expects between $182-190 million.Finally, Microchip Technology (  ) announced earnings of 59 cents per share (ex-BNRI, etc.) on sales of $559.4 million in its fiscal Q2 of 2016. This beats the Zacks estimates of 57 cents per share and $552 million, respectively. However, while the company did point out it has now posted profits in 100 straight quarters, CEO Steve Sanghi also remarked, """"We believe that industry conditions continue to be very weak.""Every day, the analysts at Zacks Equity Research select two stocks that are likely to outperform (Bull) or underperform (Bear) the markets over the next 3-6 months.Updated throughout every trading day, the  provides analysis from Zacks Equity Research about the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets.Zacks Equity Research provides the best of quantitative and qualitative analysis to help investors know what stocks to buy and which to sell for the long-term.Continuous analyst coverage is provided for a universe of 1,150 publicly traded stocks.

eading semiconductor manufacturer  recently revised its second-quarter fiscal 2016 guidance to better reflect an improving business environment and strong earnings potential with the expedited integration of the Micrel acquisition.Earlier in concurrence with the first-quarter fiscal 2016 earnings release, management had provided initial guidance for the second quarter. Management had then expected non-GAAP net sales between $532 million and $569 million, while non-GAAP gross margin was expected in the range of 57.6% to 57.8%. Non-GAAP net income was anticipated in the range of $127.3 million to $145.4 million, with non-GAAP earnings per share of 58 cents to 66 cents per share.Along with the first-quarter fiscal 2016 earnings release, Microchip had also announced the acquisition of Micrel for approximately $430 million in cash and issuance of 8,626,795 shares of Microchip's stock. Consequently, based on the current projections, Microchip now anticipates non-GAAP earnings per share to lie within 60 and 66 cents on revenues of $545 million to $563 million. Non-GAAP gross margin is currently expected in the range of 57.5% to 57.7%, while non-GAAP net income is anticipated to come in the band of $129.2 million to $143.0 million.With better-than-expected bookings and expediting requests in its business, driven by strong demand and robust product designs, Microchip anticipates continuing its bull run in the coming quarters. We also remain encouraged by its bullish guidance.Microchip develops and manufactures microcontrollers, memory and analog and interface products for embedded-control systems, which are small, low-power computers designed to perform specific tasks. Striking features like quality, performance, reliability, ease of use, pricing and diversity of products have been the forte of Microchip and helped it to become one of the better-positioned companies in the semiconductor universe.Microchip presently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Other players in the industry that are worth mentioning include Pixelworks, Inc.  , Maxim Integrated Products, Inc.  and EZchip Semiconductor Ltd.  , each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

" recently joined forces with Taiwan-based semiconductor firm Silicon Integrated Systems Corp. (SiS) to develop comprehensive projected-capacitive touch (""PCAP"") and 3D-gesture interface modules. These will help improve the performance of smart applications while reducing costs.Microchip's proprietary GestIC technology, currently the most cost-effective 3D gesture technology in the market, has been deployed in the modules, thereby adding features such as multi-touch and 3D gesture displays. PCAP controllers can easily be integrated with GestIC technology to improve operational performance of applications.With over three decades of experience in PC chipset products, eMMC, eMCP and projected-capacitive touch solutions, Sis is offering its ""electronic developer"" and ""sensor integration provider"" expertise to Microchip. Moreover, Microchip and SiS have pioneered the integration of 2D PCAP and 3D gesture technologies, thus expanding the array of display solutions in the market. The companies believe the jointly developed modules will help reduce ""time-to-market"" duration, the time period between a product being conceived and its commercial launch, for both automotive and consumer industries.Microchip, enthusiastic about the surging demand for 3D control displays in a gamut of industries ranging from home-automation to IoT, is constantly seeking ways to capitalize on this trend. Echoing this sentiment, market research firm Markets and Markets projects that the total display market will reach the $155.54-billion mark by 2020, with a modest compounded annual growth rate of 6% for 2015-2020. The company believes the recent collaboration with Sis will allow it to venture into the next generation of intuitive, gesture-based user interfaces that are increasingly being deployed in a wide range of end products.Having established itself as one of the fastest-growing providers of 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers in the world, Microchip's microcontroller business continues to outperform peers to gain higher market share in the industry. Microchip expects this momentum to continue and strengthen its position as the best-performing microcontroller franchise in the industry.Of late, the company is increasingly expanding its touch business beyond handsets and tablets in areas such as automotive industrial applications. We believe the recent partnership will support this effort and thereby boost the company's growth trajectory.Microchip currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the industry include MaxLinear, Inc.  , NXP Semiconductors NV  and Silicon Laboratories Inc.  .

ooking at the universe of stocks we cover at  , in trading on Wednesday, shares of MicroChip Technology, Inc. (Symbol: MCHP) were yielding above the 3% mark based on its quarterly dividend (annualized to $1.432), with the stock changing hands as low as $47.53 on the day. Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return. To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) back on 12/31/1999 - you would have paid $146.88 per share. Fast forward to 12/31/2012 and each share was worth $142.41 on that date, a decrease of $4.67/share over all those years. But now consider that you collected a whopping $25.98 per share in dividends over the same period, for a positive total return of 23.36%. Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.6%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 3% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable. MicroChip Technology, Inc. (Symbol: MCHP) is an S&P 500 company, giving it special status as one of the large-cap companies making up the S&P 500 Index.In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of MicroChip Technology, Inc., looking at the history chart for MCHP below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 3% annual yield.    According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, MCHP makes up 3.38% of the iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (Symbol: SOXX) which is trading up by about 0.8% on the day Wednesday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@MicroChip Technology (MCHP) Shares Cross 3% Yield Mark@2015-10-28@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/microchip-technology-mchp-shares-cross-3-yield-mark-2015-10-28

eading semiconductor manufacturer  is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2016 results after the closing bell on Nov 4. In the last reported quarter, Microchip's adjusted earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Along with the first-quarter fiscal 2016 earnings release, Microchip had announced the acquisition of Micrel for approximately $430 million in cash and issuance of 8,626,795 shares of Microchip's stock. With rapid integration and completion of the share repurchase, Microchip expects the full accretion from this acquisition to be reflected in the financial results by the second half of fiscal 2017. The transaction is also expected to have some effect on the impending results, due to which it has revised its quarterly guidance.Based on the improving business environment and strong earnings potential with the expedited integration of the Micrel acquisition, Microchip now anticipates non-GAAP earnings per share within 60 cents and 66 cents on revenues of $545 million to $563 million. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected in the range of 57.5% to 57.7%, while non-GAAP net income is anticipated in the band of $129.2 million to $143.0 million.Microchip is one of the fastest growing providers of 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers in the world. The microcontroller business of the company has historically outperformed the industry and is expected to continue the same feat in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.The Analog business has also become one of the largest analog franchises in the market. In order to further capitalize on this burgeoning business potential, Microchip is developing and introducing a wide range of innovative and proprietary new products. In addition, with a diligent focus on right-sizing the various components of inventory holdings, Microchip has been able to reduce its inventory. With a diligent focus on right-sizing the various components of inventory holdings, Microchip expects to record solid top- and bottom-line growth in the upcoming quarter.Despite healthy bookings on the back of strong demand and robust product designs, our proven model does not conclusively show that Microchip is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it lacks the key ingredients for a success recipe. , which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is currently pegged at 0.00%. Microchip carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Though a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 or #3 (Hold) increases the predictive power of ESP, the company's ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.The Sell-rated stocks (#4 and #5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Callon Petroleum Co.  has an Earnings ESP of +66.67% and carries a Zacks Rank #2.Aquinox Pharmaceuticals Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +43.90% and holds a Zacks Rank #1.Merrimack Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +2.44% and carries a Zacks Rank #3.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"n the latest look at stocks ordered by largest market capitalization, Russell 3000 component Federal Realty Investment Trust (Symbol: FRT) was identified as having a larger market cap than the smaller end of the S&P 500, for example MicroChip Technology, Inc. (Symbol: MCHP), according to  .Market capitalization is an important data point for investors to keep an eye on, for various reasons. The most basic reason is that it gives a true comparison of the value attributed by the stock market to a given company's stock. Many beginning investors look at one stock trading at $10 and another trading at $20 and mistakenly think the latter company is worth twice as much - that of course is a completely meaningless comparison without knowing how many shares of each company exist. But comparing market capitalization (factoring in those share counts) creates a true ""apples-to-apples"" comparison of the value of two stocks. In the case of Federal Realty Investment Trust (Symbol: FRT), the market cap is now $8.9B, versus MicroChip Technology, Inc. (Symbol: MCHP) at $8.89B.Below is a three month price history chart comparing the stock performance of FRT vs. MCHP:Another reason market capitalization is important is where it places a company in terms of its size tier in relation to peers - much like the way a mid-size sedan is typically compared to other mid-size sedans (and not SUV's). This can have a direct impact on which indices will include the stock, and which mutual funds and ETFs are willing to own the stock. For instance, a mutual fund that is focused solely on Large Cap stocks may for example only be interested in those companies sized $10 billion or larger. Another illustrative example is the S&P MidCap index which essentially takes the S&P 500 index and ""tosses out"" the biggest 100 companies so as to focus solely on the 400 smaller ""up-and-comers"" (which in the right environment can outperform their larger rivals). And ETFs that directly follow an index like the S&P 500 will only own the underlying component of that index, selling companies that lose their status as an S&P 500 company, and buying companies when they are added to the index. So a company's market cap, especially in relation to other companies, carries great importance, and for this reason we at TheOnlineInvestor.com find value to putting together these looks at comparative market capitalization daily.According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, FRT and MCHP collectively make up 1.15% of the First Trust Value Line Dividend Index Fund ETF (  ) which is lower by about 0.2% on the day Monday.At the closing bell, FRT is up about 0.2%, while MCHP is up about 0.1% on the day Monday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Federal Realty Investment Trust Moves Up In Market Cap Rank, Passing MicroChip Technology@2015-09-14@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/federal-realty-investment-trust-moves-market-cap-rank-passing-microchip-technology-2015-09

"eading semiconductor manufacturer  launched the MEC14XX family of highly configurable low-power embedded controllers, designed to meet the needs of x86-based notebook and tablet platform designers.The MEC14XX family is scalable and one of the first to support both Intel's new Enhanced Serial Peripheral Interface (eSPI) and the existing Low Pin Count interface (""LPC"") to enable communication with the system host. This is also Microchip's first embedded controller family designed for general x86 computing, which boasts its award-winning MPLAB development tool support.The devices facilitate a seamless migration of intellectual property reuse across multiple x86 computing platform architectures, such as Intel iCore, Intel Atom and AMD-based systems. Also, to ensure a smooth evolution of the mobile computing industry to the new interface and lower-voltage designs, the MEC14XX devices also offer a flexible arrangement that enables the configuration of multiple I/O signals to support either 3.3V or 1.8V. This removes the need for external voltage translators, thus reducing the system bill-of-materials cost.The LPC interface, which is currently in the market, has served the computing market for over 15 years. However, it is struggling to keep up as computing platforms go on transitioning to lower voltages and devices transition to smaller lithographies. The new eSPI interface is well-suited to meet the market's future needs.Microchip is committed to staying ahead of the industry in defining, implementing and validating the new eSPI system interface.Microchip presently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

"nvestors in MicroChip Technology, Inc. (Symbol: MCHP) saw new options begin trading this week, for the April 2016 expiration. One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 228 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the MCHP options chain for the new April 2016 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $41.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.50. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $41.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $37.50 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of MCHP, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $42.76/share today.Because the $41.00 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 59%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 8.54% return on the cash commitment, or 13.67% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for MicroChip Technology, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $41.00 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $43.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.30. If an investor was to purchase shares of MCHP stock at the current price level of $42.76/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $43.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 8.28% if the stock gets called away at the April 2016 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if MCHP shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for MicroChip Technology, Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing MCHP's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $43.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $43.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 49%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).

"he  formula at  ranks a coverage universe of thousands of  , according to a proprietary formula designed to identify those stocks that combine two important characteristics - strong fundamentals and a valuation that looks inexpensive. Microchip Technology, Inc. (Symbol: MCHP) presently has an excellent rank, in the top 25% of the coverage universe, which suggests it is among the top most ""interesting"" ideas that merit further research by investors.But making Microchip Technology, Inc. an even more interesting and timely stock to look at, is the fact that in trading on Tuesday, shares of MCHP entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $41.44 per share. We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30. In the case of Microchip Technology, Inc., the RSI reading has hit 28.9 - by comparison, the universe of dividend stocks covered by  currently has an average RSI of 46.4. A falling stock price - all else being equal - creates a better opportunity for dividend investors to capture a higher yield. Indeed, MCHP's recent annualized dividend of 1.432/share (currently paid in quarterly installments) works out to an annual yield of 3.35% based upon the recent $42.785 share price.A bullish investor could look at MCHP's 28.9 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. Among the fundamental datapoints dividend investors should investigate to decide if they are bullish on MCHP is its dividend history. In general, dividends are not always predictable; but, looking at the history chart below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue.According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, MCHP makes up 2.42% of the SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF (Symbol: XSD) which is trading lower by about 1.3% on the day Tuesday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Microchip Technology is Oversold@2015-08-04@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/microchip-technology-oversold-2015-08-04

eading semiconductor manufacturer  is scheduled to report its first-quarter fiscal 2016 results after the closing bell on Aug 3. In the last reported quarter, Microchip's adjusted earnings comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents on broad-based product growth. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Microchip is one of the fastest growing providers of 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers in the world. The microcontroller business of the company has historically outperformed the industry and enabled it to gain significant market share.Microchip expects to continue this momentum and strengthen its position as the best-performing microcontroller franchise in the industry. The company is increasingly expanding its touch business beyond handsets and tablets in areas such as automotive industrial applications.The Analog business has also become one of the largest analog franchises in the market. In order to further capitalize on this burgeoning business potential, Microchip is developing and introducing a wide range of innovative and proprietary new products. In addition, with a diligent focus on right-sizing the various components of inventory holdings, Microchip has been able to reduce its inventory.High quality standards, solid performance, reliability features, ease of use, pricing and diversity of products make Microchip one of the better-positioned companies in the semiconductor universe. The company registered record revenues in fourth-quarter fiscal 2015, driven by broad-based growth across all product lines. With a diligent focus on right-sizing the various components of inventory holdings, Microchip has been able to reduce its inventory and expects to record solid top- and bottom-line growth in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Despite healthy bookings on the back of strong demand and robust product designs, our proven model does not conclusively show that Microchip is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it lacks the key ingredients for a success recipe. Expected Surprise Prediction or  , which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is currently pegged at 0.00%. This indicates a likely in-line earnings for the shares. Microchip's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) combined with a 0.00% ESP reduces the predictive power of ESP. Note that stocks with a Zacks Ranks of #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) and #3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. The Sell-rated stocks (#4 and #5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Investors Bancorp Inc.  , earnings ESP of +8.33% and Zacks Rank #2.Ashford Hospitality Trust, Inc.  , earnings ESP of +4.35% and Zacks Rank #1.Diana Containerships Inc.  , earnings ESP of +200.00% and Zacks Rank #1.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return. To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) back on 12/31/1999 - you would have paid $146.88 per share. Fast forward to 12/31/2012 and each share was worth $142.41 on that date, a decrease of $4.67/share over all those years. But now consider that you collected a whopping $25.98 per share in dividends over the same period, for a positive total return of 23.36%. Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.6%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 3% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable. Microchip Technology, Inc. (Symbol: MCHP) is an S&P 500 company, giving it special status as one of the large-cap companies making up the S&P 500 Index.In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Microchip Technology, Inc., looking at the history chart for MCHP below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 3% annual yield.    According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, MCHP makes up 2.42% of the SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF (Symbol: XSD) which is trading lower by about 2.2% on the day Monday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@MCHP Dividend Yield Pushes Past 3%@2015-06-29@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/mchp-dividend-yield-pushes-past-3-2015-06-29
eading semiconductor manufacturer  revealed that it had received antitrust clearance in U.S. and Germany in relation with its proposed acquisition of Micrel Inc.  , another mature semiconductor player.The waiting period under the provisions of the amended Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 had expired on Jun 15, and the deal received approval from the Federal Cartel Office in Germany on Jun 17. There is no additional antitrust clearance required for the transaction. However, the closure of the deal is still subject to other conditions, including merger approval by Micrel shareholders.The merger was announced in early May, and Microchip expects it to close in the third quarter. Micrel which was facing pressure from activist investor Starboard Value LP since last summer, agreed to be acquired by fellow chipmaker Microchip in an $839 million deal. Microchip agreed to pay $14 a share to Micrel stockholders, who can opt for either cash or Microchip stock. Excluding the cash and investments in Micrel's books, the transaction would be worth $744 million.However, just a couple of days ago, a Micrel investor filed a lawsuit in an attempt to prevent the proposed takeover by Microchip, alleging that the board at Micrel violated their fiduciary duties to the stockholders by consenting to sell Micrel too cheap via an unfair process to Microchip.Micrel is better-known for its chips based on analog rather than digital technology. The transaction would bring together two mature semiconductor players that manufacture thousands of different chips that are used in cars, office and industrial equipment and a wide range of consumer products.The deal will likely unlock considerable synergies and cross selling opportunities for the two chipmakers.The semiconductor sector is seeing massive consolidation as companies increasingly seek to reduce costs and gain economies of scale. Just recently, computer chipmaker Avago Technologies Limited  snapped up Broadcom Corp.  for $37 billion in a record-breaking move. Earlier in March, chipmaker NXP Semiconductors NV entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Freescale Semiconductor, another chipmaker, for $11.8 billion.We believe that semiconductor stocks are likely to have a smooth ride this year, driven by robust demand for technology-based devices among consumers and enterprises alike.Microchip presently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

road-based growth across all product lines helped  deliver solid fourth-quarter fiscal 2015 results with record revenues. Microchip reported GAAP net income of $99.4 million or 45 cents per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 compared with $111.5 million or 50 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year decrease in GAAP earnings, despite higher revenues, was largely attributable to higher operating expenses for the reported quarter.Non-GAAP net income for the reported quarter was $148.8 million or 68 cents per share compared with $141.3 million or 64 cents a share in the year-earlier quarter. Recurring earnings (with stock-based compensation adjustments) were 65 cents per share, which comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 62 cents.For fiscal 2015, GAAP net income came in at $369.0 million or $1.65 per share, down 6.6% from net income of $395.3 million or $1.82 in fiscal 2014. Despite top-line improvement, earnings decreased year over year owing to sharp increase in operating expenses in fiscal 2015. Non-GAAP earnings for the reported fiscal were $593.9 million or $2.66 per share compared with $531.0 million or $2.45 a share in fiscal 2014.Net revenue (GAAP) for the reported quarter was $543.2 million, up 10.1% year over year, aided by strong sales of microcontrollers and analog products. Non-GAAP sales for fourth-quarter fiscal 2015 were a record high of $547.2 million compared with $493.4 million in the prior-year period. The quarterly non-GAAP revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $546 million.For fiscal 2015, both GAAP and non-GAAP sales were record high at $2.147 billion and $2.161 billion, respectively aided by stellar performances by the microcontroller businesses.In terms of product mix, revenues from microcontroller products accounted for 64.6% of the total non-GAAP revenue in the quarter ($353.6 million). Microcontroller revenues in fiscal 2015 were up 11.4% year over year and crossed $1.4 billion for the first time in the company's history, setting an all-time record for each of the three microcontroller segments. The company registered record sales of 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers in fiscal 2015.The microcontroller business continued to outperform the industry and enabled Microchip to gain significant market share. Microchip expects to continue this momentum to further strengthen its position as the best-performing microcontroller franchise in the industry.Revenues from the analog products were up 18.7% from the year-ago quarter to $127.6 million, representing 23.3% of the total non-GAAP revenue. With strong design win momentum in a broad range of applications, revenues from the analog business were up 17.6% in fiscal 2015 and set an all-time record by crossing the $0.5 billion benchmark for the first time.With revenues of $33.2 million in the reported quarter, memory business was up 0.2% year over year. It represented 6.1% of Microchip's overall non-GAAP revenue in the quarter. Revenue from the licensing business was $23.6 million in the reported quarter, accounting for 4.3% of the total non-GAAP revenue. By geography, $314.9 million of total non-GAAP revenue was generated from Asia, followed by $126.0 million from Europe and $106.2 million from the Americas. Bulk of the revenues was generated in Asia as most of the contract manufacturing business takes place in this continent.Microchip recorded gross margin (non-GAAP) of 58.3% for the reported quarter, while operating income (non-GAAP) was $177.4 million, compared with the respective figures of 59.3% and $161.5 million in the year-ago period. Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 32.4% and Microchip was confident of achieving its long-term goal of 35% non-GAAP operating margin in the near future. The reported quarter was the 98th consecutive profitable quarter for Microchip.In concurrence with the quarterly results, Microchip announced a definitive agreement to acquire Micrel Inc.  for $14.00 per share that equates to a total equity value of about $839 million. With a complementary portfolio, Micrel is likely to be a strategic fit for Microchip. The acquisition is anticipated to be completed by the third quarter of calendar 2015.In order to facilitate the transaction, Microchip has authorized an increase in the existing share repurchase program to 20.0 million shares from the approximately 2.5 million shares remaining under the prior authorization. Under this share repurchase program, Microchip intends to repurchase the approximate number of shares it issues in the Micrel acquisition in the next few months. The acquisition is expected to be mildly dilutive to Microchip's non-GAAP earnings per share immediately after the close, but is expected to be accretive in the first full quarter after completion of the repurchase of the number of shares issued in the transaction.With a diligent focus on rightsizing the various components of inventory holdings, Microchip's consolidated inventory at the quarter end was $279.5 million or 111 days. The company hiked its quarterly cash dividend from 35.70 cents to 35.75 cents per share, representing the 45th dividend increase since its inception. Microchip has returned over $2.52 billion to shareholders as dividends and $1.4 billion in share repurchases since the inception of its dividend program.Cash and short-term investments were $2.34 billion at quarter end, with $462 million debt under its revolving line of credit. Net cash generation for the quarter (excluding ISSC acquisition, dividend payment, and reduction in borrowings) was $155.5 million.Concurrent with the fourth quarter earnings release, management provided guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Management expects non-GAAP net sales between $547 million and $564 million, while non-GAAP gross margin is expected in the range of 58.3% to 58.5%. Non-GAAP net income is anticipated in the range of $149.8 million to $157.8 million, with non-GAAP earnings per share of 69 cents to 73 cents.Microchip expects to generate approximately $160 million to $180 million cash in the first quarter prior to the dividend payment and acquisitions. The company expects to incur $40 million in capital expenditure in the next quarter, bringing its tally to about $160 million for fiscal 2016.With solid revenues from microcontroller and analog products, better-than-expected bookings and increasing requests on the back of strong demand and robust product designs, we expect Microchip to continue its bull run in the coming quarters.Microchip presently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

"eading semiconductor manufacturer  unveiled the 14-member dsPIC33EP ""GS"" family of Digital Signal Controllers (DSCs). These DSCs have applications in a broad range of industries, from computer to industrial to automotive.The DSC family is powered with the performance to handle more sophisticated non-linear, predictive and adaptive control algorithms at higher switching frequencies.These advanced algorithms help in building more energy-efficient power supply designs that have better power supply specifications. Also, higher switching frequencies facilitate the development of power supplies that are physically smaller, offer higher densities and involve lower costs.In comparison to the previous generation of DSCs, the new devices consume up to 80% less power in any application, and offer less than half the latency, when used in a three-pole three-zero compensator. The new family also boasts advanced features such as Live Update Flash capability. Live Update is helpful in changing the firmware of an operating power supply while maintaining continuous regulation. It is especially applicable for high-availability or ""always-on"" systems.The new devices enable higher-precision designs and also save cost and board space. These features, along with the overall high performance of the dsPIC33EP ""GS"" family, make it ideal for an extensive range of applications, including industrial (e.g., solar inverters, HID lighting, projectors, battery chargers, LED lighting and welders) computer & telecom (e.g., AC/DC and DC/DC power supplies), and automotive (e.g., DC/DC converters, LED and HID headlights).The new product line builds upon Microchip's existing dsPIC33 digital power families, offering better performance and advanced integrated features, and is thus optimized for digital power applications. The new family will enable next-generation designs to accomplish superior efficiency and more compact form factors, with smaller footprint and lower power consumption.Microchip presently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

eading semiconductor manufacturer  is scheduled to report its fourth-quarter fiscal 2015 results after the closing bell on May 7. In the last reported quarter, Microchip's adjusted earnings comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 cents on broad-based product growth. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.In February this year, Microchip sold $1.5 billion worth convertible senior subordinated notes due 2025 to increase its liquidity and reduce its debt burden. The transaction resulted in net proceeds of $1.47 billion, part of which were utilized to repurchase $575 million in principal amount of convertible junior subordinated debentures due 2037. Microchip used the remainder of the proceeds to repay debt under its credit facility.The repurchase of the convertible junior subordinated debentures is expected to provide higher earnings per share benefit compared to the increase in interest expense from the refinancing transactions. Microchip expects its share count to reduce by approximately 10.5 million to 11 million shares on a quarterly basis.Consequently, the company revised its earnings guidance for fourth-quarter fiscal 2015. Non-GAAP earnings are currently anticipated to be within 66 cents to 68 cents per share compared with the earlier expected range of 65 cents to 67 cents.Microchip expects to generate approximately $160 million cash in the fourth quarter prior to the dividend payment and acquisitions. The company expects to incur $40 million in capital expenditure in the fourth quarter, bringing its tally to about $160 million for fiscal 2015.Microchip is one of the fastest growing providers of 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers in the world. The microcontroller business of the company continued to outperform the industry and enabled it to gain significant market share.Microchip expects to continue this momentum and strengthen its position as the best-performing microcontroller franchise in the industry. The company is increasingly expanding its touch business beyond handsets and tablets in areas, such as automotive industrial applications.The Analog business has also become one of the largest analog franchises in the market. In order to further capitalize on this burgeoning business potential, Microchip is developing and introducing a wide range of innovative and proprietary new products. In addition, with a diligent focus on right-sizing the various components of inventory holdings, Microchip has been able to reduce its inventory.Despite healthy bookings on the back of strong demand and robust product designs, our proven model does not conclusively show that Microchip is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it lacks the key ingredients for a success recipe. Expected Surprise Prediction or  , which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is currently pegged at 0.00%. This indicates a likely in-line earnings for the shares. Microchip's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) combined with a 0.00% ESP reduces the predictive power of ESP. Note that stocks with a Zacks Ranks of #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) and #3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. The Sell-rated stocks (#4 and #5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Sunoco LP Common Units  , earnings ESP of +1.59% and a Zacks Rank #2.Intrawest Resorts Holdings, Inc.  , earnings ESP of +2.17% and a Zacks Rank #2.TC PipeLines, LP  , earnings ESP of +10.67% and Zacks Rank #2.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

ooking at the universe of stocks we cover at  , in trading on Thursday, shares of Microchip Technology, Inc. (Symbol: MCHP) were yielding above the 3% mark based on its quarterly dividend (annualized to $1.428), with the stock changing hands as low as $46.89 on the day. Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return. To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) back on 12/31/1999 - you would have paid $146.88 per share. Fast forward to 12/31/2012 and each share was worth $142.41 on that date, a decrease of $4.67/share over all those years. But now consider that you collected a whopping $25.98 per share in dividends over the same period, for a positive total return of 23.36%. Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.6%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 3% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable. Microchip Technology, Inc. (Symbol: MCHP) is an S&P 500 company, giving it special status as one of the large-cap companies making up the S&P 500 Index.In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Microchip Technology, Inc., looking at the history chart for MCHP below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 3% annual yield.

hares of  touched a 52-week high of $19.23 in the last trading session, before sliding a notch lower to close at $19.13. The company's share price has been on an upward trajectory since management announced a significant shift in the company's manufacturing strategy and an aggressive share buyback program.About 1.6 million shares exchanged hands in the session, higher than the company's average trading volume of 1.4 million. Over the past year, the stock gained 41.5%, significantly higher than the S&P 500's increase of 12.9% over the same time frame.Despite the strong price appreciation, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has plenty of upside left, given its fundamental strength, strong free cash flow generation ability and shareholder-friendly capital allocation strategies.The chipmaker has undergone a transformative shift in its manufacturing strategy over the past year or so, as it winded down outdated facilities and continues to streamline its manufacturing footprint. The consolidation of its capabilities is expected to improve supply chain flexibility as the company shifts production to external manufacturers. Also, in addition to being financially favorable, the strategy will also increase the company's flexibility and responsiveness to clients' demands, going forward.Dramatic reduction in capital expenditure and operating costs is expected to translate into a significant boost to the company's free cash flow. Fairchild, in the most aggressive share buyback program in the semiconductor industry, is committed to deploy 100% of its free cash flow for share repurchases. This strategy will create value and enhance shareholder wealth, and will likely be reflected in the company's share price soon.The company saw solid growth momentum in the automotive, battery charging, communication infrastructure and data center end markets in 2014, and expects to continue increasing its exposure to these sectors in 2015. Even its mobile segment, which has suffered lately as the company shifted its focus from interface to power management, is expected to return to the growth path this year. These growing end markets will prove to be strong catalysts for the company, going forward.Fairchild is also taking steps to enter into the burgeoning wearables market, which could prove to be a lucrative step for the company.Also, the semiconductor space is in a consolidation phase, with the latest deal being the acquisition of Freescale Semiconductor, Ltd.  by NXP Semiconductors NV  . With its impressive free cash flow and strong net cash attributes, Fairchild could be a compelling takeover target.We believe that Fairchild's initiatives to improve operational efficiency and rationalize manufacturing facilities will result in margin expansion and improve the company's supply flexibility and profitability. Also, a favorable capital allocation strategy and repurchase programs will boost the company's share price, going forward.A better-ranked semiconductor stock is Microchip Technology Inc.  , sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

road-based growth across all product lines helped  (  ) deliver healthy third-quarter fiscal 2015 results. Microchip reported GAAP net income of $86.1 million or 39 cents per share in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 compared with $105.4 million or 48 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year decrease in GAAP earnings was largely attributable to higher operating expenses and higher number of shares outstanding for the reported quarter.Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted net income for the reported quarter was $143.3 million or 64 cents per share compared with $132.9 million or 61 cents a share in the year-earlier quarter. Recurring earnings (with stock-based compensation adjustments) were 60 cents per share, which comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 56 cents.Net revenue (GAAP) for the reported quarter was $528.7 million, up 9.6% year over year, aided by strong sales of microcontrollers and analog products. The quarterly revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $526 million.In terms of product mix, revenues from microcontroller products accounted for 64.5% of the total revenue in the quarter ($345.5 million). Microcontroller revenues in calendar year 2014 were up 13.8% year over year, setting an all-time record for each of the three microcontroller segments. The company also registered record sales of 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers in calendar year 2014. While the 16-bit microcontroller business climbed 27.7% for the year, 32-bit microcontroller revenues were up 41.3% with new design wins and applications.The microcontroller business continued to outperform the industry and enabled Microchip to gain significant market share. Microchip expects to continue this momentum to further strengthen its position as the best-performing microcontroller franchise in the industry.Revenues from the analog products were up 15.3% from the year-ago quarter to $125.5 million, representing 23.4% of the total revenue. With strong design win momentum in a broad range of applications, revenues from the analog business were up 15.7% in calendar year 2014 and set an all-time record.With revenues of $33.2 million in the reported quarter, memory business was up 2% year over year. It represented 6.2% of Microchip's overall revenue in the quarter. Revenue from the licensing business was $22.9 million in the reported quarter, accounting for 4.3% of the total revenue. By geography, $325 million of total revenue was generated from Asia, followed by $105.9 million from Europe and $104.9 million from the Americas. Bulk of the revenues was generated in Asia as most of the contract manufacturing business takes place in this continent.Microchip recorded gross margin (non-GAAP) of 58.2% for the reported quarter, while operating income (non-GAAP) was $169.3 million. Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 31.6% and Microchip was confident of achieving its long-term goal of 35% non-GAAP operating margin in the near future.With a diligent focus on right-sizing the various components of inventory holdings, Microchip's consolidated inventory at quarter end was $276.1 million or 111 days. The company hiked its quarterly cash dividend from 35.65 cents to 35.70 cents per share, representing the 44th dividend increase since its inception. Microchip has returned over $2.4 billion to shareholders as dividends and $1.4 billion in share repurchases since the inception of its dividend program.Cash and short-term investments were $1.1 billion at quarter end, with $981.3 million debt under its revolving line of credit. Net cash generation for the quarter (excluding ISSC acquisition, dividend payment, and reduction in borrowings) was $145.7 million.Concurrent with the third quarter earnings release, management provided guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. Management expects non-GAAP net sales between $541.2 million and $551.9 million, while non-GAAP gross margin is expected in the range of 58.2% to 58.4%. Non-GAAP net income is anticipated in the range of $144.9 million to $151.7 million, with non-GAAP earnings per share of 65 cents to 67 cents.Microchip expects to generate approximately $160 million cash in the fourth quarter prior to the dividend payment and acquisitions. The company expects to incur $40 million in capital expenditure in the next quarter, bringing its tally to about $160 million for fiscal 2015.With solid revenues from microcontroller and analog products, better-than-expected bookings and increasing requests on the back of strong demand and robust product designs, we expect Microchip to continue its bull run in the coming quarters.Microchip presently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Other players in the industry that are worth mentioning include Analog Devices, Inc. (  ), Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. (  ) and NXP Semiconductors NV (  ), each carrying the same Zacks Rank as Microchip.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

 's (  ) second quarter fiscal 2015 adjusted earnings of 33 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 cents. Moreover, earnings surpassed management's guided range, primarily attributable to lower-than-expected operating expenses and higher-than-expected revenues.Shares were up over 5% to $34.80 during afterhours trading, primarily due to strong earnings and a positive guidance indicating enhanced growth prospects in all the segments.Revenues in the reported quarter were $566.8 million, down 2.3% sequentially and 8.6% year over year. The sequential decrease in revenues was primarily due to weaker demand for communications infrastructure products. Revenues however came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and within management's guidance range.Consumer and automotive were the strong points while other segments softened. The revenue mix in terms of major markets in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 was as follows:The  end market remained the largest revenue contributor, accounting for approximately 33% of revenues, up 7.4% sequentially. The sequential increase was due to improved performance at the company's leading mobility customer and an increase in revenue from other mobility customers in both tablets and in shipments for a wearable product.Also, the company's diversification efforts and strong demand helped to increase revenues. Its biggest mobility customer currently represents around 15% of revenues, up from 13% in the prior quarter but down from 28% of revenues in fiscal 2013. , Maxim's second largest segment generated 27% of revenues, reflecting a 5.8% sequential decline. This was in line with management's expectations and was primarily due to normal seasonal trends in the core Industrial end market.The  end market accounted for 23% of revenues, reflecting a 13.6% decrease sequentially. The sequential decline was primarily attributable to weakness in the enterprise server business and also the weakness in optical infrastructure equipment.The  end market generated 12% of revenues, reflecting a 6.6% increase sequentially, in line with management's expectations.

The sequential decrease was driven by overall cost controls, which included the initial savings from the company's restructuring activities.The pro forma net income was $93.7 million, or 16.5% of sales compared with $108.6 million or 18.7% in the prior quarter and $102.5 million or 16.5% in the year-ago quarter.

New products from this initiative could help it expand margins.It is also taking steps to restructure operations by the closure of the San Jose fab and discontinuation of investment in its MEMS and touch lines of business. The reduced investment will take out an additional $3-4 million of costs. The company's steps to streamline costs will help it increase its profitability and therefore drive margins.Maxim's diversification strategy is starting to reap fruits in Consumer and its automotive and industrial businesses are also seeing growth. The latest pipeline of automotive technologies in infotainment, safety and driver assistance applications will further enhance the company's financial position.The company remains committed to growing its Mobility business by increasing diversifying the business, broadening the customer base and targeting new opportunities like wearable devices.

eading microcontroller solutions provider  recently announced the expansion of its Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) product line with non-volatile memory and I2 Compatible Serial Interface.The new MCP47FEBXX devices feature 8-, 10- and 12-bit resolution, thereby providing design and cost flexibility. The new DAC devices consume less power and will feature integrated EEPROM (electrically erasable programmable read-only memory). These devices are available in 8-pinTSSOP (Thin-Shrink Small Outline Packages) and the various shutdown modes reduce the current consumption for power critical applications.These devices provide different voltage references with internal band gap, thus facilitating easier development. This provides flexibility for system designers and helps reduce costs suitable for a diverse range of applications and serve the consumer and industrial markets such as wireless microphones, mp3 player accessories and blood glucose test devices and applications.The Analog business of Microchip has become one of the largest analog franchises in the market. In order to further capitalize on this burgeoning business potential, Microchip is developing and introducing a wide range of innovative and proprietary new products. The new invention will reinforce the company's product portfolio and consequently augment its revenues in the near future.Microchip develops and manufacturers microcontrollers, memory and analog and interface products for embedded control systems, which are small, low-power computers designed to perform specific tasks.Microchip currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

eading semiconductor manufacturer  (  ) is scheduled to report its third-quarter fiscal 2015 results after the closing bell on Jan 29. In the last reported quarter, Microchip's adjusted earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Microchip is one of the fastest growing providers of 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers in the world. The microcontroller business of the company continued to outperform the industry and enabled it to gain significant market share.Microchip expects to continue this momentum and strengthen its position as the best-performing microcontroller franchise in the industry. The company is increasingly expanding its touch business beyond handsets and tablets in areas, such as automotive industrial applications.The Analog business has also become one of the largest analog franchises in the market. In order to further capitalize on this burgeoning business potential, Microchip is developing and introducing a wide range of innovative and proprietary new products. In addition, with a diligent focus on right-sizing the various components of inventory holdings, Microchip has been able to reduce its inventory.The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) has projected significant growth for the sector in the coming quarters, driven by robust demand for smartphones and automotive electronics. As one of the better-positioned companies in the semiconductor universe, Microchip looks well set to capitalize on the industry's growth prospects and fortify its position in the industry.With accelerating bookings in its business driven by robust industry demand and impressive product designs, we remain encouraged by Microchip's prospects and bullish guidance for the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Despite healthy bookings on the back of strong demand and robust product designs, our proven model does not conclusively show that Microchip is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it lacks the key ingredients for a success recipe. Expected Surprise Prediction or  , which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is currently pegged at 0.00%. This indicates a likely in line earnings. Microchip's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) combined with a 0.00% ESP reduces the predictive power of an earnings beat for the company. Note that stocks with a Zacks Ranks of #1(Strong Buy), #2 and #3 (Hold) coupled with a positive ESP have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. The Sell-rated stocks (#4 and #5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Kemper Corp. (  ), earnings ESP of +2.78% and a Zacks Rank #3.The Kroger Co. (  ), earnings ESP of +2.27% and a Zacks Rank #2.Arch Capital Group Ltd. (  ) earnings ESP of +1.92% and Zacks Rank #1.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

ooking at the universe of stocks we cover at  , on 2/18/15, Diebold, Inc. (Symbol: DBD), FLIR Systems, Inc. (Symbol: FLIR), and Microchip Technology, Inc. (Symbol: MCHP) will all trade ex-dividend for their respective upcoming dividends. Diebold, Inc. will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.2875 on 3/6/15, FLIR Systems, Inc. will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.11 on 3/6/15, and Microchip Technology, Inc. will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.357 on 3/9/15. As a percentage of DBD's recent stock price of $35.78, this dividend works out to approximately 0.80%, so look for shares of Diebold, Inc. to trade 0.80% lower - all else being equal - when DBD shares open for trading on 2/18/15. Similarly, investors should look for FLIR to open 0.34% lower in price and for MCHP to open 0.71% lower, all else being equal.Below are dividend history charts for DBD, FLIR, and MCHP, showing historical dividends prior to the most recent ones declared. : : :In general, dividends are not always predictable, following the ups and downs of company profits over time. Therefore, a good first due diligence step in forming an expectation of annual yield going forward, is looking at the history above, for a sense of stability over time.

 (  , or TI) reported fourth-quarter earnings that grew 22.5% year over year and were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.TI reported revenue of $3.27 billion, which was down 6.6% sequentially and up 8.0% year over year (in line with the guidance of $3.26 billion at the mid-point) and in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Distributor resales jumped 14% from last year, with distributor inventories dropping by a week to 4.5 weeks. Internal inventories were up slightly.Industrial and personal electronics remained the two most important end markets for the company, although communications equipment and automotive also made sizeable contributions.Management has successfully steered the business into analog and embedded processing applications, which typically yield a more stable business as well as stronger margins.The Analog, Embedded Processing and Other Segments generated 65%, 20% and 15% of quarterly revenue, respectively.The  business grew -1.2% sequentially and 13.6% year over year. Power management was the main driver of growth from the year-ago quarter although HPA, HVAL and SVA also grew.The  segment, which includes the processor, microcontroller and connectivity product lines, was down 5.8% sequentially and up 10.9% from last year. Growth from the year-ago quarter was fairly broad-based across product lines.The  segment, which includes DLPs, custom ASICs, calculators, royalties and some legacy wireless products was down 25.7% sequentially but down 14.2% year over year. Legacy wireless products again impacted the year-over-year decline and custom ASICs were also down.Net product orders were $3.18 billion in the last quarter, down 4.8% sequentially and up 12.3% year over year. Backlog declined 12.0% sequentially and was 16.1% below the year-ago level. Turns sales dropped 2.7% sequentially, growing as a percentage of sales from the previous quarter.TI's gross margin of 58.0% was down 41 bps sequentially and up 381 bps from the year-ago quarter. The gross margin benefited from higher volumes, higher utilization and a better mix of analog and embedded processing revenue (now 85% of revenue). TI exceeded its long-term gross margin target of 55% in the last quarter and its low-cost manufacturing capacity will continue to expand margins as long as loading remains high.Operating expenses of $760 million were down 4.4% sequentially. The operating margin was 34.7%, down 96 bps sequentially and up 721 bps from the year-ago quarter. All expenses increased as a perentage of sales from the previous quarter but were down from the year-ago quarter.The Analog, Embedded Processing and Other segments generated operating margins of 38.7%, 17.0% and 34.5%, respectively. The Analog margin expanded 140 bps sequentially, Embedded Processing 98 bps with Other declining 595 bps. Margin increases from the year-ago quarter were significant across all segments.Management called out two adjustments (a 5 cent gain from the re-instatement of the federal research tax credit and a 2 cent gain from the sale of assets) excluding which the pro forma net income came to 69 cents,Ongoing restructuring gains and acquisition charges (that will remain steady over the next five years) were around 5 cents.The pro forma net income was $730 million, or a 22.3% net income margin compared to $826 million, or 23.6% in the previous quarter and $618 million, or 20.4% in the year-ago quarter.On a GAAP basis, the company reported a net profit of $ 76 cents a share compared to a net profit of 77 cents in the previous quarter and a net profit of 46 cents in the comparable prior-year quarter.Inventories increased 1.9% sequentially to around $1.78 billion, with inventory turns remaining up from 3.3X to 3.08X. Days sales outstanding (DSOs) went from 39 to around 35. TI generated $1.27 billion in cash from operations, spending $125 million on capex, $698 mllion on share repurchases and $356 million on cash dividends. During the quarter, spending on share repurchases dropped 1% while dividends increased 13%.At quarter-end, TI had $3.64 billion in long-term debt and $1.00 billion in short-term debt. During the quarter, the net debt position dropped by $358 million. It also had net underfunded retirement plans of $98 million.TI provided guidance for the first quarter.Accordingly, TI expects revenue between $3.07 billion and $3.33 billion (up 7.3% sequentially at the mid-point) and in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.20 billion.Restructuring charges will be negligible and non-cash amortization charges related to acquisitions will remain in the range of $80- $85 million for the next five years. The annual effective tax rate will be around 30%.The EPS for the quarter is expected to be 57 to 67 cents, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 62 cents.Texas Instruments is prudently investing its R&D dollars into several high-margin, high-growth areas of the analog and embedded processing markets. This is gradually increasing its exposure to the industrial and automotive markets, while reducing its exposure to the volatile consumer/computing markets.TI, along with chipmaker Intel (  ) remains one of the few semiconductor companies that depend on internal capacity for manufacturing the bulk of its devices. But since it has the policy of building out capacity ahead of demand, it is able to make opportunistic purchases. As a result, it is able to contain capex at up to 4% of sales even while on any expansion plan.We remain optimistic about TI's compelling product line, the differentiation in its business and lower-cost 300mm capacity that should in combination drive earnings. We note that channel inventories remain very low, meaning that demand is likely to remain strong, driving factory loadings and therefore, sustainable margins.TI shares carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Other semiconductor stocks worth considering include Microchip (  ), Monolithic (  ) and Maxim (  ), all of which have a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

 (  ) recently announced that it would partner with American pop star Katy Perry to develop a new mobile game.The company also announced very solid results. It posted a positive earnings surprise of 400% and revenues jumped 78% from the year-ago quarter to $76.2 million. Following the strong results and this partnership, shares surged 30.7%.Though details about the new game have not been revealed, Glu CEO, Niccolo de Masi, stated that the game will include Perry's voice, likeness and personality. Perry's latest performance in the Super Bowl XLIX Halftime Show has gained enormous popularity on the Internet. Reportedly, Perry has more than 170 million fans on various social platforms as against Kardashian's 78 million, justifying Glu's recent deal.Glu Mobile is probably best known for  , a freemium game released in Jun 2014. The game enables players to live the life of an A-list celebrity and make in-house purchases to upgrade their characters. Since its launch, the game has been downloaded over 22.8 million times worldwide. In fact, according to analysts, the game is set to generate more than $200 million in revenues annually.Glu Mobile, a leading developer and publisher of free-to-play games for smartphones and tablet devices, remains well positioned to benefit from the strength in the global mobile game market.The company continues to launch mobile games to boost its top-line growth.The company's latest game,  , launched last November, along with  drove the recently reported fourth-quarter results.In September, the company launched  on Facebook's app center as well as on Apple's App Store and Google Play. The company expects to launch the next version of its popular franchise,  on mobiles in 2015.Glu Mobile also announced a partnership with Skydance productions to develop a free-to-play Terminator mobile game. The game is scheduled for a summer 2015 release simultaneously with the Terminator reboot movie.We believe that Glu Mobile's robust and innovative product pipeline is a major growth driver. Moreover, its aggressive acquisition policy should boost results, going ahead. However, growing competition from established players will make it difficult for the company to register strong growth in the near term.Currently, Glu Mobile has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some stocks that have been performing well are Electronic Arts Inc. (  ), Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. (  ) and Microchip Technology Inc. (  ).

hares of technology company  (  ) hit a new 52-week high of $10.49 on Jan 9, eventually closing at $10.35. The company returned 22.11% last year and delivered a year-to-date return of roughly 1.56%. Average volume of shares traded over the last three months was roughly 6,682K.ON Semiconductor has a well-diversified business and an end-market focus that would typically generate relatively steady revenues throughout the year. The company stands to benefit from recent product introductions and numerous design wins in the automotive market. Also, the company has increased its market share growth in the CMOS Image Sensor market. According to the IHS Image Sensor Market Tracker, the company held approximately 6% of the $3.12 billion image sensor market in 2013.The price appreciation may also be attributed to ON Semiconductor's impressive record of returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. Most recently, the company declared that it will repurchase $1.0 billion shares. Additionally, the company announced its decision to return approximately 80% of free cash flow, after repaying long-term debts.We remain positive on the company's strong cash position and ability to service its long-term debts. Moreover, continuous share buybacks will inspire investors' loyalty through high returns.Additionally, the company gained momentum from strong fundamentals and better-than-expected third-quarter results released on Oct 30. Since then, the stock has moved up more than 29.3%.ON Semiconductor's third-quarter top line increased 10% sequentially and 16.5% year over year to $833.5 million. The company benefitted from the broad-based strength in its end markets. However, non-GAAP earnings of 21 cents missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny due to order slowdowns.For fourth-quarter 2014, ON Semiconductor projects revenues in the range of $835.0-$875.0 million, up 2.6% sequentially at the mid-point, driven by design wins across multiple markets and possible share gains. The relatively improved top-line projection further indicates that the company's growth momentum is likely to continue.Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings jumped 32.3% for fiscal 2014 from the prior year. Additionally, the company has delivered an average earnings surprise of nearly 8.9% over the trailing four quarters.

n Jan 6, Zacks  upgraded  (  ) to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) from a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The upgrade came largely on the back of the company's enhanced capital deployment policies. The stock is currently trading at a forward P/E of 11.5x with long-term earnings growth expectation of 16.6%.ON Semiconductor continues to focus on disciplined capital allocation, strong and flexible balance sheet position, and cash flow enhancement to support dividend growth. The company recently announced that it will repurchase $1.0 billion shares immediately. Additionally, the company announced its decision to return approximately 80% of free cash flow, after deducting repayments of long-term debt.We remain positive on the company's strong cash position and ability to service its long-term debts. Moreover, continuous share buybacks will inspire investors' loyalty through high returns.The current optimism surrounding the stock may also be attributed to some extent to the product launches and the company's growth in the CMOS Image Sensor market. According to the IHS Image Sensor Market Tracker, the company held approximately 6% of the $3.12 billion image sensor market in 2013.ON Semiconductor expects to steadily improve operating profitability and consistently invest in new products and technologies.Moreover, the company gained momentum from strong fundamentals and better-than-expected third-quarter results released on Oct 30. Since then, the stock has moved up more than 23%.ON Semiconductor's top line increased 10% sequentially and 16.5% year over year to $833.5 million. The company benefitted from the broad-based strength in its end markets. However, non-GAAP earnings of 21 cents missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny due to order slowdowns.For fourth-quarter 2014, ON Semiconductor projects revenues in the range of $835.0-$875.0 million, up 2.6% sequentially at the mid-point, driven by design wins across multiple markets and possible share gains. The relatively improved top-line projection further indicates that the company's growth momentum is likely to continue, going ahead.ON Semiconductor has a well-diversified business and an end-market focus that would typically generate relatively steady revenues throughout the year. Also, we expect the recent product launches and numerous design wins in the automotive market to act as strong growth catalysts over the long term.Other stocks that look promising in the industry and are worth a look include M/A-Com Technology Solutions Holdings, Inc. (  ), sporting a Zacks Rank #1, and CSR plc (  ) and Microchip Technology Inc. (  ), with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"espite hiccups in the recent past, semiconductor stocks remain a favorite among investors. Stocks from this sector have advanced appreciably this year. At the same time, the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) has projected significant growth for the sector in the years ahead.Recently, some market watchers were of the opinion that the semiconductor sector was headed for a correction. Microchip Technology Inc. (  ) CEO Steve Sanghi issued a warning after the trading session ended on Oct 9. Sanghi said: ""Another industry correction has begun."" Chip stocks suffered average losses of around 7% the next day.Since then, they have staged an impressive recovery. One of the key developments that aided such a recovery was the recent U.S.-China agreement. The two countries agreed to eliminate tariffs on high tech products across 54 members of the Information Technology Agreement.According to U.S. estimates, these products could be worth around $1 trillion. SIA CEO Brian Toohey hailed the agreement as a ""victory for the U.S. semiconductor industry."" After all, over 80% of U.S. semiconductors are sold abroad.Ultimately, the PHLX Semiconductor Sector index, better known as the SOX jumped 27% over the year. This is more than twice as much as the S&P 500. This increase is a result of gains made by some of its heavy-weight constituents. Micron Technology, Inc. (  ) is among the largest gainers this year, increasing 63.9% year-to-date. The company has a weight of 8.1 on the SOX.Similarly, Applied Materials, Inc. (  ) has gained 35.1%, and carries a weight of 6.3. Only some stocks, like QUALCOMM Inc. (  ) registered losses, and even so it has slipped only marginally, by 2.1%. Intel Corp. (  ) and Texas Instruments Inc. (  ), which carry weights of 8.1 and 8.6, have gained 44.7% and 23.8% respectively.The SIA has said that worldwide sales of semiconductors have increased 9.6% year-over-year to $29.7 billion for Oct 2014. This is also 1.5% higher than last month's sales of $29.2 billion. Additionally, sales across the Americas lead all regions after registering a 12.2% increase compared to the same period last year. These figures are compiled by the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS) organization.Also, the SAI has validated the WSTS Autumn 2014 global semiconductor sales forecast. According to these projections, worldwide industry sales are expected to increase 9% to $333.2 billion in 2014, compared to total sales in 2013. Additionally, the WSTS projects global growth of 3.4% for 2015 and 3.1% for 2016.Below we present three stocks which will gain from these trends, each of which also has a good Zacks Rank. 's third quarter earnings exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate and forward guidance did not disappoint. Intel's promise of success in the mobile segment is encouraging. This is likely to be mitigated by conservative spending by individuals and corporations, competition from ARM-based devices, and the impact of new product ramp-up costs.However, its leading position in PCs, strength in servers, growing position in software and IoT segments and headway in process technology is undeniable.Intel holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has expected earnings growth of 18.8%. The forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) for the current financial year (F1) is 16.74. ' third-quarter earnings were above the Zacks Consensus Estimate and forward guidance was very strong. Demand appears to be picking up, with the higher mix of analog and embedded processing products contributing to profits. The company's compelling product line, market share gains, strategic refocus on high-growth areas of the analog and embedded processing markets are some its major strengths.Apart from a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), the company has expected earnings growth of 41.3%. It has a P/E (F1) of 21.57x. 's (  ) second quarter bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Aided by growth in Tegra Processor, Enterprise GRID, GeForce GPU, and Tesla sales, the year over year comparisons were favorable. Moreover, third quarter revenue guidance was encouraging. The company also gained significant traction in the Tegra segment due to its Tegra 4 and Tegra K1 shipments.Moreover, NVIDIA's innovative product pipeline that consists of the recently introduced SHIELD 2 and mobile processor, Tegra K1, will boost top-line growth, going forward.NVIDIA holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has expected earnings growth of 34.3%.

very week, Marc Chaikin applies his groundbreaking analysis to an ETF or a sector. Today, he looks at Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF ()The Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF () was a market leader until the stock market peaked on September 18, at which time XLK was at 40.51. Then there was a 10% drop in the XLK to a low of 36.58. In the subsequent snap-back rally in the market, the XLK retraced almost all of its decline; only the weakness in the Semiconductor Group has held back the XLK from making new highs on the strength in Microsoft and Apple.Semiconductors will continue to hold back the XLK so it is better to concentrate technology purchases in the strongest Power Gauge stocks in the XLK. The Chaikin Power Bar below indicates that 10 stocks in the XLK have a  with 16 have a bearish rating. These are mainly semiconductor stocks while networking stocks like NetApp () and Brocade () have bullish ratings. The sell-off in the Semiconductor group was triggered by a negative earnings report on 10/9 from Microchip Corp. () in which they blamed weakness in demand from China and overall weakness in the semiconductor group. This turned out to be very misleading as Intel (), the market leader in semiconductors, subsequently came out with a positive earnings surprise and raised their guidance for the next quarter citing improving trends in PC sales and in tablet sales as well.The broader Technology Sector should do well going forward but with the sector overbought, wait for a pullback to buy the strongest stocks in the XLK like , , NTAP as well as BRCD. Buying the XLK itself holds an investor hostage to the price action in semiconductor stocks.The Chaikin Portfolio Health Check is an excellent tool to help zero in on the weakest stocks in any ETF, and in the SPDR Technology ETF (XLK) there are 10 bullish rated stocks.By looking at the individual component stocks through the lens of the 20 factor , you can easily find the stocks in the XLK ETF with the strongest price potential over the next 3-6 months. These are the stocks to buy as they are likely to outperform the XLK as well as the overall market.The Chaikin Power Grid in  (see below) maps stocks and industry groups from strong to weak so you can easily determine the best and worst stocks in any ETF. To find the strongest stocks in the XLK, we look to the upper right quadrant of the Power Grid (strong Power Gauge stocks in strong industry groups) where we find stocks with the best potential for price gains over the next 3-6 months. There we see stocks like Apple (AAPL), NetApp (NTAP), Lam Research (), Microsoft (MSFT) and Symantec ().Over time, strong stocks in strong industry groups will outperform the market.One stock to sell in the XLK is Microchip Technology (MCHP), which has a bearish Power Gauge rating and reports earnings after the close on Thursday 10/30. On October 15, the company reported preliminary sales for the 2nd quarter of 2015 that were significantly below previous company guidance. The stock dropped 20% the next day but has retraced half of that decline. MCHP is overbought and should be sold, with a swap into strong Power Gauge stocks in the technology sector like Lam Research (LRCX) or NetApp (NTAP).Sell MCHP ahead of Thursday’s earnings report.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@ETF Outlook: Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK)@2014-10-29@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/etf-outlook-technology-select-sector-spdr-etf-xlk-2014-10-29
"t's been an up-and-down year for semiconductor stock  . Its stock price fell significantly in September after a warning from one of its peers in the chip industry. However, Texas Instruments' stock price has recovered from that and then some, because its underlying business has sailed through 2014 unscathed. Texas Instruments is growing -- and rewarding its shareholders with lots of cash flow through billions of dollars in share buybacks and dividend payments.Here are two things Texas Instruments investors should keep in mind. Texas Instruments is not a very diverse business. While other technology companies manufacture a wide range of products, Texas Instruments is focused on two key businesses. These are analog and embedded processing, which collectively comprise 82% of the company's total revenue. The concentrated nature of its business is the result of a change of strategic direction. A few years back, Texas Instruments management decided to unload underperforming businesses, such as wireless, to instead focus on its core competencies. From there, the company reduced its exposure to wireless virtually entirely. Management felt that analog and processing were far more lucrative, higher-growth opportunities, and it's clear this was the right strategy.Texas Instruments holds a differentiated position that separates it from the competition because its remaining core areas of focus have high-value assets and products, with long life cycles. This has created sustained revenue and free cash flow growth during the past several years. For example, Texas Instruments' total revenue grew 8% last quarter. Over the preceding 12-month period, free cash flow was up 20%.With this cash flow, Texas Instruments is very friendly to shareholders by buying back lots of its own stock and paying a high dividend. The company returned $670 million to shareholders through share repurchases and paid $319 million in dividends just last quarter. Texas Instruments is an aggressive dividend growth stock as well. Earlier this year, management bumped up the dividend by 13%. The stock has a dividend yield of 2.6%.Because of its efficient business structure and high cash flow generation, investors should know that Texas Instruments appears to have a bright future going forward. In early October, peer semiconductor company  warned investors that quarterly revenue would come in below its previous forecast as well as analyst projections. That sent semiconductor stocks crashing. Microchip fell 10% after the warning, but its announcement dragged down other chip stocks, too, including Texas Instruments, which saw its stock price drop dramatically in a span of just a few weeks. On Sept. 18, Texas Instruments traded for $49 per share. By Oct. 13, four days after Microchip's warning, Texas Instruments fell all the way to $41 per share, representing an approximately 16% decline.Microchip blamed its poor quarter on sluggish demand in China and inventory buildups at its distributors. The reason the sell-off spread to Texas Instruments is that Microchip management also warned about industrywide conditions in general. However, Microchip's announcement served as a weak attempt to mask its own problems as an industrywide problem. That was realized soon enough, as Texas Instruments posted strong growth when it released its own quarterly numbers.Consequently, Texas Instruments shareholders shouldn't be overly concerned. Management expects between $3.1 billion and $3.3 billion of revenue for the current quarter. The midpoint of that forecast range would represent 8% growth year over year. Clearly, this does not indicate any sort of slowdown. Texas Instruments is in a strong financial position as well, which should give shareholders a certain degree of confidence. The company has $3.4 billion of cash and marketable investments on its balance sheet and generates more than enough cash flow to continue its practice of share buybacks and paying a high dividend yield.Texas Instruments now operates a lean organization with high-value products. Its financial success is evident in its quarterly results. Investors should know that as long as the company continues to grow, it will keep distributing lots of cash flow in the months ahead.One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World-Wide-Web to bed.

road-based growth across all product lines helped  (  ) deliver record second-quarter fiscal 2015 revenues. However, despite record top-line growth, the company faltered on earnings primarily due to high operating expenses.Microchip reported GAAP net income of $93.6 million or 42 cents per share in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 compared with $99.8 million or 46 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year decrease in GAAP earnings per share was largely attributable to higher operating expenses and higher number of shares outstanding for the reported quarter.Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted net income for the reported quarter was 62 cents per share compared with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 64 cents.Net revenue (GAAP) for the reported quarter came in at an all-time high of $546.2 million, up 10.9% year over year, aided by record sales of microcontrollers. The quarterly revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $553 million.In terms of product mix, revenues from microcontroller products accounted for 66.2% of the total revenue in the quarter ($361.6 million). Net sales of microcontroller products were up 12.7% year over year in the quarter driven by record sales of 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers. While the 16-bit microcontroller business climbed 23.3% for the reported quarter, 32-bit microcontroller revenues were up 38.6% with new design wins and applications.The microcontroller business continued to outperform the industry and enabled Microchip to gain significant market share. Microchip expects to continue this momentum to further strengthen its position as the best-performing microcontroller franchise in the industry.Microchip recorded gross margin (non-GAAP) of 59.1% for the reported quarter, while operating income (non-GAAP) was $177.3 million. Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 32.5% and Microchip was confident of achieving its long-term goal of 35% non-GAAP operating margin in the near future.With a diligent focus on right-sizing the various components of inventory holdings, Microchip's consolidated inventory at quarter end was $275.7 million. The company hiked its quarterly cash dividend from 35.60 cents to 35.65 cents per share, representing the 43rd dividend increase since its inception.Cash and short-term investments improved to $2.12 billion, with $624.4 million debt under its revolving line of credit. Net cash generation for the quarter (excluding ISSC acquisition, dividend payment, and reduction in borrowings) was $156.2 million.Concurrent with the second quarter earnings release, management provided guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2015. Management expects net sales between $500.9 million and $528.2 million, while non-GAAP gross margin is expected in the range of 58.0% to 58.2%. Non-GAAP net income is anticipated in the range of $131.1 million to $142.5 million, with earnings per share of 59 cents to 64 cents.Microchip expects to generate approximately $110 million to $140 million cash in the third quarter prior to the dividend payment. The company expects to incur $40 million in capital expenditure in the next quarter, bringing its tally to about $150 million for fiscal 2015.With record revenues, better-than-expected bookings and increasing requests on the back of strong demand and robust product designs, we expect Microchip to continue its bull run in the coming quarters.Microchip presently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Other players in the industry that are worth mentioning include Ambarella, Inc. (  ), FormFactor Inc. (  ) and SunEdison, Inc. (  ), each carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

"hipmaker  (  ) is to report second-quarter fiscal 2015 results on Oct 30. Last quarter, the company failed to spring any surprise as earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. It is worth noting that Microchip has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the four preceding quarters, with a positive earnings surprise average of 4.3%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Earlier this month, Microchip revised its revenue forecast downward for the quarter, citing feeble chip demand from China in September as the primary drag. Its sales for the quarter are now projected to come at around $546 million, down roughly 3.9% from the average of the earlier forecast range of $560 million-$575.9 million. (Read:  ). September has traditionally been a strong month for the company, and weak demand will put pressure on top and bottom line figures.Late in the quarter, Microchip's efforts to establish a foothold in the ""Internet of Things"" by acquiring British semiconductor company CSR plc failed, as the latter rejected the company's bid.Some developments in the quarter that could favorably impact Microchip's quarterly results include the purchase of an 83.5% stake in ISSC Technologies Corporation, a developer of wireless solutions, and the closing of the Standard Microsystems acquisition. These deals are expected to expand Microchip's addressable markets and boost revenues. Microchip expects the Standard Microsystems buyout to be accretive to earnings by roughly 3 cents for the September-ending quarter.Furthermore, Microchip continues to expand its product portfolio by developing a broad range of innovative and proprietary new products, such as launching its new PIC32 Bluetooth Starter Kit and expanding its range of ultra-high data rate WLANs. These product launches are expected to enhance the top line.Microchip has also been witnessing negative earnings estimate revisions of late. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter has declined 3% over the past month to 64 cents, while that of fiscal year 2015 fell 3.5% to $2.49 over the same time frame.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Microchip Technology will beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below. Microchip Technology has an Earnings ESP of -3.13%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at 62 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at 64 cents. Microchip Technology has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which when combined with a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution particularly against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or #5 (Sell-rated stocks) when going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some companies that are about to report which you may consider instead, as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Kennedy-Wilson Holdings, Inc. (  ) has an earnings ESP of +35.00% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).JAVELIN Mortgage Investment Corp. (  ) has an earnings ESP of +8.89% and a Zacks Rank #1.Gentherm Inc.

emiconductors have enjoyed a strong rally this year on encouraging industry fundamentals as well as investors' continued acclaim for value-centric traditional stocks. This trend is likely to continue in the coming months on a string of earnings and revenue beats that trumped the worst sell-off seen early in the month after the diversified chipmaker Microchip Technology (  ) warned of frailty in the broad-based semiconductor industry (read:  ).This is especially true as industry primes such as Micron Technology (  ), Intel (  ), Broadcom (  ) and Texas Instruments (  ) reported strongly and guided higher, easing the concerns of an industry downturn. In addition, the industry has a solid Zacks Industry Rank at the time of writing, suggesting smooth trading for the space over the coming months.The memory chipmaker,  , has been the major gainer in the industry as the stock climbed nearly 10% to hit a 52-week high of $34.85 in just two days after it reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2014 earnings on September 25 after the market closed. This is primarily thanks to an encouraging revenue guidance of $4.45-$4.70 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2015; the mid-point of which was well above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.48 billion at the time of issuing the guidance.Though earnings per share of 82 cents came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate, revenues of $4.23 billion outpaced our estimate by $4.17 billion. The shares are nevertheless down 2% since the earnings announcement. , the world's largest chipmaker, has gained nearly 3% since its third-quarter earnings announcement on October 14 after the closing bell. The company topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny on earnings and $0.17 billion on revenues thanks to a stabilizing PC market and improving data center business. Further, the company projects revenues in the range of $14.2-$15.2 billion, the mid-point of which is in line with our current estimate (read:  ). reported earnings of 76 cents surpassing our estimate by a nickel. Revenues of $3.50 billion were also above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.46. Additionally, the company provided an upbeat guidance for the fourth quarter. Earnings per share are expected in the range of 64-74 cents, well above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 62 cents at the time of issuing the guidance while revenues will likely be between $3.13 billion and $3.39 billion. The stock is up 7.1% post earnings announcement on October 20 after the bell. also surprised the market in its latest earnings release on October 21 after the bell. Earnings per share came in at 76 cents on $2.26 billion revenues, strongly outpacing our earnings estimate of 66 cents and revenue estimate of $2.17 billion. The company guided higher with revenue of $2-$2.15 billion for the fourth quarter of 2014 while the current Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $2.086 billion. BRCM shares rose 6.3% post earnings to date.The impressive performances and bright industry outlook put semiconductor ETFs in focus for the next few days. Investors seeking to ride out the surging space in a diversified way could consider the following ETFs.This ETF follows the PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index and offers exposure to 16 domestic firms. It is highly concentrated on the top three firms with heavy allocations to TXN, MU and Applied Materials (  ) that make up for a combined 22% share. Broadcom takes the fourth position in the basket with 4.25% allocation. Further, about two-thirds of the portfolio is dominated by large cap stocks while mid caps take the remainder with just 4% going to small caps.The fund has amassed $499 million in its asset base and trades in average volume of roughly 219,000 shares a day. The product charges 47 bps in fees a year from investors and has gained about 11.8% over the past 10 days. The fund has a Zacks Rank of 3 or 'Hold' rating with Medium risk outlook (read:  ).This fund provides exposure to 26 securities by tracking the Market Vectors US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index. Of these, two firms - Intel and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (  ) - dominate the fund's return with a combined 34.7% of total assets. MU, TXN and BRCM are among the fund's top six holdings making up for 5.41%, 5.04% and 4.54%, respectively.From a market cap look, the product focuses on large cap stocks, as these account for three-fourth of the portfolio. The product has managed assets worth $306.5 million and charges 35 bps in annual fees and expenses. It is heavily traded with a volume of more than 2.2 million shares per day and has gained about 10% in the past 10 days. SMH has a Zacks ETF Rank of 2 or 'Buy' rating with Medium risk outlook.This fund tracks the S&P Semiconductor Select Industry Index, holding 49 stocks in its portfolio. It is widely spread across each security as none of these allocates more than 2.7% of the assets. The product has a definite tilt toward small cap stocks at 61%, followed by 26% in mid caps and 13% in large caps (see:  ).The fund is less popular and illiquid with AUM of $129 million and average daily volume of roughly 114,000 shares. It charges 35 bps in fees per year and has added nearly 10.7% over the past 10 trading sessions. The fund has a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 or 'Hold' rating with a High risk outlook.This fund tracks the Dynamic Semiconductor Intellidex Index, holding 30 securities in the basket with none holding more than 5.7% of assets. The in-focus four firms are among the top 10 holdings. The ETF is widely diversified across various market spectrums as about 44% goes to small caps, 31% to large caps and the rest to mid caps.The product, with AUM of $28.2 million is often overlooked by investors and hence sees a lower average daily volume of 19,000 shares. Expense ratio came in at 0.63%. PSI is up nearly 11.6% in the same time period and has a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 or 'Hold' rating with a High risk outlook (read:  ).These products could make compelling investments given their robust earnings growth and solid industry trends like an improving PC market and rising global industry sales. Further, these are clearly outpacing the broad tech fund (  ) and broad market fund (  ) by wide margins over the past 10 days, suggesting continued outperformance in the coming months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

 (  ) recently announced the launch of Digitally Enhanced Power Analog (DEPA) controllers titled MCP19118 and MCP19119 for easy integration and flexibility for diverse applications. The innovative products offer unmatched configurability in DC-DC controllers and functionality for battery-charging, power-conversion or LED-drive applications that no other product solution provides in the industry.The products enable manufacturers to create programmable power supplies by integrating a supervisory microcontroller. These minimize design, production and inventory requirements across multiple platforms. The DEPA controllers also provide high conversion efficiency and excellent transient response for reduced system power losses, smaller heat-sinks and longer battery life in portable applications.The newly launched products from Microchip are a testament to the relentless pursuit of the company to offer state-of-the-art products that are simple yet effective for the manufacturers. Microchip is also currently reorganizing its production levels to match its inventory levels. Although production levels of wafer fabs and assembly and test facilities have been reduced, Microchip is continuing to ramp production of new technologies that are capacity constrained. This is likely to bring uniform production levels for all products with normal lead times during the December quarter, which is seasonally the weakest quarter of the year.Microchip expects net sales of $546.2 million for second-quarter fiscal 2015, which includes about $16.9 million from the recent ISSC acquisition. Earlier, concurrent with the first quarter earnings release, management provided net sales guidance for the second quarter between $560.0 million and $575.9 million, including $18 million from the ISSC acquisition. The fall in revenue expectations is primarily attributable to weaker-than-expected sales in China.Microchip develops and manufacturers microcontrollers, memory and analog and interface products for embedded control systems, which are small, low-power computers designed to perform specific tasks.Microchip is scheduled to report its second-quarter fiscal 2015 results on Oct 30, 2014.

he semiconductor space has been the sweet spot in the overall technology space this year. About 57.8% of technology earnings growth came from semiconductor electronics (with 80% beating earnings), followed by 31.8% growth in miscellaneous technology. Q2 earnings were robust for some of the giants in the space including Intel (  ), Micron Technology (  ), Broadcom (  ) and Texas Instruments (  ) (read:  ).However, the golden days for semiconductors seem to be passing by as  Technology Inc. (  ) came up with a downbeat second-quarter fiscal 2015 preliminary net sales report on October 9. The off-hand top-line numbers had an extremely adverse effect on the share price, which fell about 12.3% as of October 10 (read:  ).Microchip expects net sales of $546.2 million for the second quarter ending September 30, 2014 which takes into account nearly $16.9 million from the latest ISSC acquisition. Weaker-than-expected sales in China were indicated for the lowered revenue expectation. China has been witnessing industrial slowdown for quite some time and this is starting to trickle through into the space.To add to the woes, the company indicated that  is a busy business month, especially in China. But management cited that sales failed to live up to its expectation. Not only this, management cautioned of yet another industry correction that has started and will spread broadly over the near future.The very comment spurred investors to sell their semiconductor holdings as soon as they could. As of October 10, INTC was down 5.1%, MU was down 9.3%, BRCM lost about 5.5% and TXN has retreated about 7.1%.The same vibes were prevalent in the ETF industry as well with every semiconductor ETF literally bleeding though Microchip did not have its presence in any semiconductor ETF directly. MCHP has only 0.83% exposure in  which was down about 1.1% on October 10 (read:  ). (  ) - the biggest semiconductor ETF - lost about 6.9% on October 10.  has shed over 6.6% while  plunged 7.9% and  fell about 8%.Semiconductors had to go through such brutality as the space became arguably overvalued. XSD is presently trading at a P/E (ttm) of 25 times while the ratio for PSI stands at 20 as of October 10. This goes against the biggest U.S. ETF  's  P/E of 17 times which itself does not call for a cheap valuation.Though we had a bullish view on most of the semiconductor ETFs as most of the products carry top ranks (though with High risk outlook), we believe the downtrend for this overvalued space will stay for some time. Investors should note that the upcoming quarter is seasonally soft which poses another round of threat to these stocks.Thus, at present it may be better to hold off semiconductor ETFs. Everything depends on the earnings results of the other companies which will make or break the fate of the space for the next season.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"ividend-paying tech stocks are often considered ""old men"" in an industry in which investors prefer to chase high P/Es and promises of explosive growth. However, long-term investors know that solid dividend-yielding stocks are valuable during market downturns, since they generate steady income for investors riding out the near-term volatility.Therefore, let's look at three tech stocks --  ,  , and  -- that all offer annual yields exceeding 3%.Source: YCharts. Networking giant Cisco has consistently boosted its dividend since introducing the payout in 2011.
  
Source: Cisco annual reports.Looking ahead, Cisco has a forward annual yield of 3.1% and trades at 11 times forward earnings. While its dividend and valuation look tempting, there are problems with Cisco's core business.Cisco's two biggest businesses -- switches and routers -- respectively comprised 38.9% and 21.2% of its revenue in fiscal 2014. But sales of switches fell 4.8% while revenue from routers dropped 7%. The main bright spots of growth for Cisco were its data center, wireless, and security segments, but those three businesses only accounted for 17.9% of the company's top line. Cisco's data center business, which uses its high-end UCS servers, is considered an opportunity to tap into the growing need for cloud-based solutions. Unfortunately, Cisco entered that market quite late -- IDC estimates the company only controls 5.9% of the server market, compared to  's 25.4% and  's  23.6%.However, Cisco has been leveraging its dominant position in networking equipment (about 60% of the ethernet switch market) to bundle other products and services at discounts to gain market share among enterprise customers. This could impact the company's bottom line in the short term, but it could also help its top-line growth get back on track. Hard-drive maker Seagate pays a forward annual yield of 3.4%, has been increasing payouts since 2011, and is also trading at 11 times forward earnings.
  
Source: NASDAQ.Seagate's earnings per share has declined dramatically since 2012. Between fiscal 2012 and 2014, Seagate's annual net income plunged 45% to $1.57 billion, although its revenue only fell 8% during that period. The company has compensated for those top- and bottom-line declines by repurchasing shares. In 2014 alone, it spent $1.9 billion on stock buybacks and another $557 million paying out dividends, which together represented about 97% of its free cash flow.Seagate is in the middle of two technological transitions -- the first from slower HDD (platter-based hard drives) to faster SSD (solid-state drives), and the second from PCs to cloud servers. Seagate controls 40% to 50% of the global HDD market, but barely has a presence in the SSD market, which is dominated by  . This is problematic, since many newer laptops and convertible devices use SSDs. However, both Seagate and its main rival,  , have found new life in media-hosting cloud servers, in which cheaper HDD capacity, not access speed, matters the most.As a result, only about half of Seagate's revenue comes from PCs, while the rest is derived from cloud-based server drives and new investments in SSDs and hybrid (SSD/HDD) drives. If Seagate stays on that path, its growth on the top and bottom lines could stabilize. Microchip Technology, a manufacturer of specialized semiconductor products, offers a forward annual dividend yield of 3.3%, and trades at 15 times forward earnings. Between fiscal 2011 and 2014, the company's annual revenue rose 30% while it boosted its dividend through thick and thin earnings.
  
Source: NASDAQ.Microchip Technology's business can be volatile because its chips, which are used across a wide variety of industries, can experience seasonal ups and downs. Microchip's main products are MCUs (microcontrollers) -- tiny all-in-one computers that can be installed in smart appliances, driver-assistance systems for cars, digital thermostats, and other devices connected to the Internet of Things, or IoT.MCUs accounted for 66% of the company's top line last quarter, when its generally accepted accounting principles-adjusted revenue climbed 10.9% year over year to $528.9 million. However, net income fell 6.2% to $99.8 million as operating expenses jumped 20.3%.Looking to the near future, Microchip has rocky expectations for the MCU business, citing an ""industry correction"" for itself and its competitors. Despite these problems, investors interested in the growth of the IoT market, which Gartner expects to increase by 36.2% next year, should take a closer look at Microchip Technology, which pays out a decent dividend for those willing to ride out its near-term volatility. The smartest investors know that dividend stocks simply crush their nondividend-paying counterparts over the long term. That's beyond dispute. They also know that a well-constructed dividend portfolio creates wealth steadily, while still allowing you to sleep like a baby.

ncluding all of today's results, we now have now Q3 results from 115 S&P 500 members that combined account for 35.5% of the index's total market capitalization. Total earnings for these 115 companies are up +6.4% from the period last year, with 69.6% beating earnings estimates. Total revenues for these companies are up a much stronger +4.9%, with 48.7% beating top-line estimates.Here is the updated scorecard for the 115 S&P 500 companies that have reported results; we include results that came after the close today (October 21, 2014):The charts below compare the earnings and revenue growth rates for the 115 S&P 500 members that have reported results with what we saw from the same group of companies in 2014 Q2 and the average for the preceding four quarters (though Q2).Looking at the above comparison charts, three things stand out:The unfavorable earnings growth comparison is solely due to Bank of America (  ); the picture looks a lot better once BofA is excluded from the data. The chart below reproduces the above growth comparison chart, but excludes Bank of America from the reported resultsThe bottom line from this analysis is that Q3 results are broadly in-line with what we have been seeing in other recent quarters, though the growth pace appears to have improved a bit at this stage.Four sectors -- Conglomerates, Technology, Finance and Finance -- have the most earnings reports at this stage. Please look at the second column in the scorecard table that shows the percentage market cap of each sector that has reported results.For the Finance sector, the largest earnings contributor to the S&P 500 index, total earnings for the 28 sector companies that have reported results already (out of 80 total) are down -1.8% on +4.9% higher revenues, with 60.7% of the companies beating EPS estimates and 46.4% coming ahead of top-line estimates.As mentioned earlier, Bank of America was a drag on the sector's growth picture; the growth rate looks better once BAC is excluded from the sector's results. That said, the sector's beat ratios are the weakest not only relative to what we have been seeing from the sector in other recent periods, but also relative to the broader market.Results from the all-important Technology sector are on the weak side, with both growth rates and beat ratios tracking below levels that we become used to seeing from the sector. With results from more than half of the sector's market cap already out, the results thus far are fairly representative of the sector as whole.Total earnings for the 54.6% of the Tech sector's market cap that has reported Q3 results are up +9.3% on +6.5% higher revenues, with 64.7% beating on earnings and a very low 35.3% coming ahead of top-line estimates.Thus far, Apple's (  ) strong report seems to be an outlier in the group, though admittedly Intel's (  ) results were good enough as well. IBM's (  ) problems may be company specific, but its comment about the weak September essentially confirmed what we had heard from Microchip (  ) a few days earlier.The charts below compare the Tech sector's results thus far with what we have seen from the sector in other recent quarters.Looking at Q3 expectations as a whole, combining the actual results from the 115 S&P 500 members that have reported with estimates for the remaining 385, total earnings are expected to be up +3.4% on +2.9% higher revenues. The composite growth has started going up as more companies report and beat estimates.The table below provides a summary view of composite Q3 expectations and compares them to actual results in Q2.Our weekly Earnings Trends report, coming out tomorrow, provides a detailed update on the Q3 earnings season and expectations for the coming quarters.

emiconductors have been the darlings of investors over the past few months and stocks skyrocketed on investors' continued acclaim for the value-centric traditional stocks of semiconductors and encouraging industry fundamentals. The sentiment seems to have reversed following the heavy sell-off in the broad semiconductor space in Friday's session.The worst decline came after the diversified chipmaker Microchip Technology (  ) lowered its revenue outlook for the recently concluded quarter and warned of the health of the broad-based semiconductor industry. This suggests more pain for the company as well as others in the space as Q3 earnings unfold.This is especially true, as U.S. semiconductor makers have seen soft sales from Asia to Europe in recent weeks. The major culprits are China, which is suffering from weak semiconductor demand, and Euro zone, which faces danger of falling into another recession and thus weighs on the demand for semiconductors.Further, the earnings from the broad technology sector look disappointing as earnings are expected to grow only 2.8% in Q3, down from 12% reported in Q2, as per  . Revenue growth will also likely recede to 4.7% from 6.1% on negative net margins (see:  ).As a result, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index fell as much as 7.7%, representing the worst one-day decline since 2009 with Microchip Technology plunging 12.3% at the close on the day. Other stocks also scored double-digit losses with Ambarella Inc. (  ) dropping 13%, NXP Semiconductors (  ) down 12.4%, Avago Technologies (  ) down 11.5% and Freescale Semiconductor (  ) down 10.8%.Industry primes such as Intel (  ), Micron Technology (  ), Broadcom (  ) and Texas Instruments (  ) dropped 5.1%, 9.3%, 5.5% and 7.1%, respectively.The terrible trading in the stock world also sent the semiconductor ETFs space into deep red on the day. In particular,  ) and  ) stole the show, tumbling nearly 8% at the close on a single trading day. Below we profile the two ETFs and discuss some of the specifics behind their recent slump (read:  ).This fund tracks the Dynamic Semiconductor Intellidex Index, holding 30 securities in the basket with a diversified exposure to various market caps and a number of securities. About 45% goes to small caps, 32% to large caps and the rest to mid caps. Additionally, none of the firms account for more than 5.5% of assets.The product has so far amassed $28.2 million in its asset base while charges a bit higher fee of 63 bps per year from investors. PSI saw trading volume of more than 2.5 times than the normal average daily volume on the day.This fund provides exposure to 49 firms by tracking the S&P Semiconductor Select Industry Index. Here, the product is tilted toward small cap stocks at 61%, followed by 26% in mid caps and 12% in large caps. However, the ETF is well spread out across various securities with none holding more than 2.6% share in the basket (read:  ).The fund has accumulated $139.4 million in AUM and charges 35 bps in fees per year. Volume on the day came at nearly two times the average daily volume.Despite this slide, the outlook for the sector is quite promising. This is because the semiconductor sector is still clearly outpacing the broad market index from the year-to-date look by wide margins. This trend is likely to continue thanks to encouraging industry trends, which point to a solid global semiconductor industry sales of 6.5% for this year, as per the  . Sales will likely slowdown over the next two years with growth of 3.3% and 4.3%.Additionally, capacity utilization, advanced technologies and new gadgets will continue to fuel demand for the chips and other semiconductor products. The PC market is also showing signs of stabilization and will likely see accelerated growth in the remaining part of the year due to replacement of older devices and upgrades from Windows XP.Further, the two products detailed above have a top Zacks Rank of 1 or 'Strong Buy' with a High risk outlook, suggesting that these will likely outperform the broad market index over a one-year period (read:  ).Given the solid long-term outlook but some concerns on Q3 earnings growth, investors may want to consider staying on the sidelines for the time being. However, risk-tolerant, long-term investors may want to consider this recent slump a buying opportunity, provided they have the patience for extreme volatility.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"ollowing the recent earnings warning from  , just about every stock in the semiconductor space saw mild to dramatic declines on Oct. 10.This wasn't due  to Microchip's missing its quarterly estimates, though. CEO Steve Sanghi stated that this weakness is likely to be industrywide and that it ""will be seen more broadly across the industry in the near future.""Ouch.However, while this claim from Microchip is bold and, in general, bad news for chip stocks if true, it's not clear that Microchip's results are relevant to  semiconductor companies.There are, however, three companies' earnings reports that will be critical to either confirming or countering the ""industry correction"" that Microchip's CEO alleged in Microchip's earnings warning.Intel will report its third-quarter earnings and fourth-quarter guidance on Oct. 14. While there is a very low chance that Intel will ""miss"" its third-quarter numbers (Intel probably would have negatively pre-announced in this case), the fourth-quarter guidance is now what investors seem to be worried about.Much of Intel's business comes from the PC industry, so if Intel reports that overall PC demand should remain healthy for the fourth quarter, then this could be a sigh of relief for investors not just in Intel, but also in other chip companies that have non-trivial dependence on the PC market.Note, too, that Intel sells a lot of chips into the data center. This includes not only traditional enterprise servers, but also cloud servers, wireless infrastructure, and high-performance computing. Plenty of chip companies depend heavily on these end markets, so if Intel reports continued strength here, those companies' stock prices could rebound.Qualcomm is a company that depends very heavily on sales of chips into mobile and wireless products such as smartphones and tablets. Many other chip companies are highly levered to the mobile-device market, which makes Qualcomm's report, scheduled for Nov. 5, particularly important to chip stock investors.If Qualcomm comes out and says it's seeing healthy demand from its customers, then this could be a sigh of relief for investors in other mobile-related chip stocks. However, if the company hints that there is a demand slowdown (perhaps because of high inventory levels at its customers), then this could serve as a  of Microchip's claims.The final, and perhaps most important, chip bellwether is  . The company is the world's largest contract manufacturer of chips, which means that it's exposed not only to a broad array of chip companies, but also to many different sectors within the chip industry.Taiwan Semiconductor usually provides a breakdown of its quarterly revenue by sub-segment and by technology generation in its earnings presentations. This will help investors more accurately determine which chip stocks should be bought on the dip and which ones should be avoided or even shorted.While the company will report its third-quarter results and fourth-quarter guidance on Oct. 16, keep in mind that the company already reported revenue for September, which was up 35.1% year over year. The key thing to watch, as it will be with Intel's report, is the company's guidance for the fourth quarter. recently revealed the product of its secret-development ""dream team"" -- the Apple Watch. The secret is out, and some early viewers are claiming that its everyday impact could trump the iPod, iPhone,  the iPad. In fact, ABI Research predicts that 485 million of this type of device will be sold per year. But one small company makes Apple's gadget possible. And its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in-the-know investors.

" (  ) - considered a harbinger when it comes to big changes in the semiconductor industry - has slashed its sales forecast and announced that an inventory correction is underway. The revenue miss for the second quarter was mainly attributable to China, which is typically strongest in the September quarter.Microchip manufactures semiconductors that are utilized in products ranging from home appliances to computer network hardware to cars. Owing to its broad market exposure, the company's results are often a harbinger of things to come. Its China market exposure also acts as an indicator, since China is the biggest market for key products like smartphones.Microchip reports sales from distribution on a sell-through basis worldwide. This basically means that sales are reported when distributors sell to end customers. But many of its peers currently report on a sell-in basis, i.e. they report sales to distributors instead of end customers.Since Microchip's sales to distributors were higher than their sales to end customers, Microchip management gathered that channel inventory was building up. They therefore warned of slowing demand and an upcoming ""correction"" to bring channel inventory back to optimal levels.This naturally implies that revenues across the industry will decline, though this may be reflected later, depending upon how and when companies account for transactions.Microchip is currently reducing its production levels. This hints at the possibility that chipmakers may have assembled huge stockpiles of parts that they may soon be struggling to sell.Semiconductor downcycles tend to affect all chip firms in some way or the other.Texas Instruments Inc. (  ), the largest maker of analog chips, and Micron Technology Inc. (  ) have seen sharp declines in their share prices.U.S. technology companies will start reporting their third-quarter performance beginning next week. Intel Corp. (  ), the world's prime chipmaker, will declare its results on Oct 14.Chipmakers have a noteworthy track record as a leading indicator for market ups and downs. That explains the tumult in the semiconductor industry brought about by Microchip's slashed sales forecast. Microchip, in particular, has a history of leading the way to where the market for semiconductors is headed.However, it is seen that during inventory corrections within the industry, sequential growth normally returns after two quarters and Microchip expects the same to happen this time as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"ne of the industries that really helped push the S&P 500 into a correction this month was Semiconductors. On October 9,  (MCHP) warned and their CEO, Steve Sanghi, essentially ""called the top"" in the Semi cycle. Here's what he said...""We believe that another industry correction has begun and that this correction will be seen more broadly across the industry in the near future.""This caused the SOX, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, to drop 8.8% in two days, especially after a Goldman Sachs chip analyst issued a report agreeing with Sanghi.But a curious thing happened as the S&P 500 began its own deeper correction last week, falling over 4% in 3 days: the SOX stopped going down and didn't go any lower while the big cap index was dropping.And this made more confident about my purchase of  (AVGO) when it was on sale in the $70s again, especially as other Semi analysts chimed in that Microchip's woes and insight were unique. And it doesn't hurt that Avago is making great, in-demand technology for  (AAPL) right now either.Avago, a Singapore incorporated company with joint headquarters in San Jose, California, is a leading designer, developer, and supplier of a broad range of analog semiconductor devices and digital, mixed signal, and optoelectronics components and subsystems. These innovations are used in wide range of wireless, wireline, and industrial applications.The company started as a  (HPQ) semiconductor division in the 1960's and was later a part of Agilent that was spun-off from HP with an IPO in 2009. The $18 billion company makes radio frequency chips that are used in smartphones by Apple, Samsung and other mobile device manufacturers.Avago products primarily serve four markets: Enterprise Storage (38% of FY 2013 revenue), Wireless Communications (25%), Wired Infrastructure (23%), and Industrial & Other (14%). It has a diversified revenue model with 37% of its FY 2013 revenue derived from China, 20% from North America, 10% from Europe and 33% from the rest of the world.On May 6, Avago closed the acquisition of LSI Corporation. Subsequent to the acquisition Avago joined the S&P 500 index, replacing LSI Logic.Oppenheimer analysts estimate that Apple represents about 15% of Avago sales, and that the company saw a doubling of content in iPhone 6/6+ vs iPhone 5s/5c by securing the ultra-high- and high-band LTE PADs. Clearly, the super strong iPhone 6 sales reported on Monday helped drive AVGO shares up 6% the next day.Here's what Stern, Agee analysts had to say after the MCHP-GS ""top call"" in the Semi cycle...We are buyers on AVGO,  (SWKS), and NXP Semiconductors here as strong product cycles with EMV, Automotive, and upcoming multiple iPhone-iPad launches position the names very attractively into 1H15. For AVGO, we see another strong 2015 wireless and datacenter into China.Also, these 3 names are trading at 11-13x with significant product cycles and earnings visibility presenting attractive opportunities. While a broader macro weakness will be an overhang in the vanilla names with no specific product cycles - we believe the sell-off is an opportunity to build positions in some of the leaders in Semis with solid execution and product cycles.In the past 60 days, earnings estimates for Avago for this year have gone from $3.31 to $4.12, a 24.5% increase. And 2015 projections have vaulted from $4.59 to $5.86, a 27.7% jump. These numbers represent 58% earnings growth for this year and 42% for next year. Here's a look at the potential ""earnings path"" based on analyst estimates...You can also see that these are the kind of implied growth rates that make growth stock portfolio managers salivate. What this graph doesn't show you is where those consensus EPS estimates were before the most recent company guidance in August. In May, 2014 estimates were raised from $3.01 to $3.31 (+10%) and 2015 estimates were hiked a whopping 31% from $3.50 to $4.59. That was already a powerful bump in the company's earnings momentum and outlook.After AVGO's second-quarter earnings report in May, and the subsequent estimate bumps, I took a look at this Zacks #1 Rank to see if it had something else that makes it a buy for me: strong institutional interest. I found that the $275 billion Capital Research Investors disclosed a big position of 25.8 million shares (10% of the company) in early May in a 13G filing.This was likely in reaction to the company being added to the S&P 500 after they closed their acquisition of LSI. But knowing some of the holdings and strategies of Capital Research, a sister fund of the equally large Capital World Investors, this is a growth play for them as well.All these facts made me a buyer of AVGO in mid-July in the low $70s. We didn't have to wait long to sell in the high $80s on the price surge into early September, for a gain of over 20%. So you can imagine why I couldn't resist the chance to buy the shares on sale again in the low $70's last week.Finally, here's where most of Wall Street stands on AVGO shares, with recent dates when they raised their outlook and/or their price targets (PT)...OCT 16 Brean Capital: Upgrade to Buy, PT $87.00 OCT 06 Canaccord Genuity: Buy, Boost PT to $97.00 SEP 30 Nomura: Buy, Boost PT to $95.00 SEP 09 Barclays: Overweight, Boost PT to $100.00 SEP 05 Citigroup: Buy, Boost PT to $100.00 SEP 02 DA Davidson: Neutral, Boost PT to $84.00 AUG 29 RBC Capital: Buy, Boost PT to $99.00 AUG 29 Jefferies Group: Buy, Boost PT to $84.00 AUG 29 Barclays: Buy, Boost PT $90.00 AUG 29 Morgan Stanley: Positive, Boost PT to $97.00 AUG 29 Pacific Crest: Outperform, Boost PT $90.00 AUG 29 Oppenheimer: Outperform, Boost PT $100.00 AUG 29 Deutsche Bank: Buy, Boost PT $90.00Bottom line: In a ""semi-strong"" Semi industry, this is one large cap name I want to own for growth with solid business footholds in both enterprise networking and mobile devices. They would seem to benefit from all dimensions of a more connected world.Disclosure: I own AVGO shares for the Zacks FTM Portfolio.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"hip stocks like Intel (  ), Texas Instruments (  ) and Micron (  ) took a tumble last week as Microchip (  ) warned of an inventory correction in the industry; GT Advanced Technology (  ) filed for bankruptcy.Microchip Technology led semiconductor stocks down as its CEO warned investors of an inventory correction. Semiconductor companies and investors in these companies have been very much on edge about a fallback in demand.After the last downturn, companies have been very conservative about building inventory and placing orders, and channel inventories have been lean for the most part. A few companies had just started talking about some channel filling this year, but it may be too soon if Microchip CEO Steve Sanghi is to be believed.The warning shouldn't have had such a broad impact, but many semiconductor bellwethers had swooning share prices following the CEO comments. Some of the worst affected were Microchip itself, Intel, Texas Instruments, STMicroelectronics, Micron, Analog Devices and Freescale.This could be because of Microchip's broad exposure to different markets using semiconductors. Moreover, the weakness was attributed particularly to China and a lot of these companies have been pinning their hopes on growth in the region. Sanghi also said that companies reporting on a sell-in basis may not feel the effect immediately.GT Advanced Technologies is paying the price for placing all its eggs in one basket. But the company probably can't be blamed because of the funding required to develop sapphire technology. Apple (  ) agreed to pay $578 million for the purpose last year, of which $439 million was paid as a first installment. The remaining $139 million was to be paid only if GTAT met certain criteria, which aren't public.GTAT says the terms of the agreement were ""burdensome and oppressive."" First, it filed for Chapter 11 protection, then it requested the court permission to wind down the sapphire crystal operations in Arizona and keep the terms of its agreement with Apple undisclosed because it could be required to pay $50 million in damages per disclosure. After that, it filed another document asking the court to end its agreement with Apple because it was an unnecessary drain on its resources.Apple did two things that could have put the final nail in GTAT's coffin. First, it rescinded the contract without paying the $139 million. Second, it didn't use what GTAT was making in its devices, since the contract didn't impose any obligations on it to buy although GTAT was obligated to produce and meet its quality and volume requirements.The nature of Apple devices necessitates huge volumes, and Apple wouldn't be able to use the material if volume targets weren't reached. Apple said that it was focused on preserving jobs in Arizona and would continue to work with state and local officials as it considered its next steps.

The Facebook (  ) CEO was also supposed to meet the new government to discuss the issue of limited connectivity and invest a million dollars for innovative ideas to connect women, students, farmers and migrant workers. India has roughly 1.2 billion people, of which 108 million have Facebook accounts. While that's up from just 8 million back in 2010, the scope for growth appears considerable. : Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella must have made a few enemies with his comments about women's pay. When asked about his advice to women that were not comfortable asking for a raise or promotion, he said that they should wait for the system to take its own course and trust that their karma would deliver the goods. But he must have missed the report from the American Association of University Women that found women received 78% of what was paid to equally qualified males. At any rate, he apologized. : Adam Sharp is replacing Vivian Schiller as head of news and government partnerships. Sharp's role appears broader than Schiller's who was in charge of partnerships with news and journalism organizations. Schiller came from NBC News. : Oracle has announced that it has employed former Snapchat and Google engineer Peter Magnusson to work on its Oracle Cloud Platform as its SVP of cloud development. Oracle's efforts are intended to help big companies modernize their technology enabling more tasks in the cloud. He will report to Thomas Kurian, its head of product development. : The European Commission will start a formal probe into allegations that Amazon has used its Luxemberg unit to illegally minimize the taxes it pays in Europe. Amazon leases its technology licenses to a tax-exempt partnership in Luxemberg, which then operates in Europe on its behalf. Amazon received a favorable tax ruling in 2003, which limited its total tax to less than 1% of its European income. If it is found that Amazon gained competitive advantage as a result of this mechanism, it may be required to pay off the resultant gains over the past 10 years. : Investment research firm Probes Reporter has issued a report pointing to inadequate disclosure in Cisco's filings about SEC enforcement activities. The report says that Cisco made choices regarding timing, venue and language that appear designed to mislead investors and/or keep material information from them regarding SEC exposures. : The new sales productivity solution combines Dynamics CRM Online Professional with Office 365 and Power BI facilitating seamless operation between different productivity tools to make them more effective. The promo price is $65 a user but existing Office 365 users can upgrade for $45. The pricing is competitive. : Rumor has it that Facebook is developing an app that will allow users to connect and share views anonymously. Facebook needs true identities of users for proper customer profiling and ad serving, so it has spent some time defending its ID requirements. But recently, the company made peace with drag queens and trans-gender folks because it didn't want to alienate users.Its intention to get into healthcare may also have influenced this move since some people may be reluctant to share such sensitive information publicly. The app could solve these problems, but how or if at all it allows integration with the main network could have an effect on its uptake. : Privacy advocates may well sit up and take notice. Google Now is now able to scan your email for the bills you need to pay during the week and tell you the amounts and dates. Google on its part has only made the feature available to those turning on Google Now and giving Google express permission to access information from their Gmail accounts. It also displays the words ""only you can see these results"" when pulling up the bills. : Its now being rumored that Google will launch its Nexus 9 on Oct 15, just a day ahead of Apple's new iPad announcement. The device will be manufactured by HTC (allowing Google to continue expanding its partner base) and it now appears that it will sell for $399. : In its first public letter to the company, activist investor Eliott Management Corp asked EMC to spin off its VMware unit or pursue other M&A options. EMC said that its leadership had already had several discussions with Eliott reps and they were looking forward to open dialogue with shareholders to determine the best course of action for the company. EMC has seen weakening demand for its higher-priced older generation products sue to the availability of cheaper alternatives, modular structures and combining flash memory. : Application performance management company Compuware has announced the spin-off of its single-point BTB cloud platform Covisint to help it better focus on its growth opportunities. All shares that Compuware holds in Covosint will be distributed as a pro rata dividend on Compuware shares and will be taxable in the U.S. : Pandora has gone a step forward in its international expansion with the announcement of a partnership with Ford Australia. Pandora has around 2 million listeners in the country and estimates that 60% of Australians listen to radio in their cars each week, with 35% of all music-listening happens inside cars. Other automakers it has partnered with in Australia include Holden and Mazda. : Groupe BPCE, the French bank with the second largest number of customers, has tied with Twitter to enable its customers in France to make simple person-to-person money transfers through tweets. The service, which doesn't require the sharing of bank details is called S-Money. : Mixpanel estimates that iOS 8 uptake is a good bit slower than its predecessor iOS 7, which was already in 70% of Apple devices in the first 2.5 weeks. This could be because of the bugs in the system at the time of launch. But iOS 8.1 is not that far off, and upgrades could pick up at that time. A sluggish uptake also slows down the app development process since developers have fewer devices to address, which makes it less lucrative for them. : Market research firm IDC sees limited growth in the market for video conferencing and telepresence equipment through 2018 due to the presence of a growing number of cheaper alternatives. The firm estimates that market leader Cisco was the worst-hit in the second quarter of 2014, followed by the number two player Polycom. Both these companies appear to be losing out to the leading Chinese vendor Huawei, which saw a jump in its market share based on strength in emerging markets. :  , a company offering cloud-based sales and marketing tools for businesses using social media networks like Facebook, LinkedIn, Google and Twitter raised $125 million at its initial public offering. The company issued 5 million shares at $25 each, higher than the expected $22-24. : Intel, Google, eBay, AMD and Netflix are among the top guns expected to report this week.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

"n Oct. 9,  kneecapped semiconductor stocks following its earnings warning. According to the company, the weakness that it saw wasn't  , but instead the result of an impending ""industry correction"" that it expects ""will be seen more broadly across the industry in the near future.""While many chip stocks, particularly small caps, were down high single digit to low double-digit percentages,  , a company that has  exposure to  only sold off modestly.Being highly dependent on a single customer is, as seen in this price action, can have its upsides. It has been widely reported that Cirrus Logic derives over 80% of its revenue from chip sales to Apple. Now, as I highlighted in an  , there are real risks associated with having such a high proportion of a company's revenue come from a single customer.However, if a company's said major customer is doing  in an industry that is otherwise uncertain or simply doing poorly, then that concentration becomes a source of  .In this case, there seems to be very robust demand for Apple's iPhone products (and Digitimes reports that Apple is ordering enough chips from its suppliers for 200 million units of iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus), and new iPads (reportedly coming on Oct. 16) could help drive iPad unit growth, helping Cirrus Logic. A look at current sell-side estimates for Cirrus' earnings per share for fiscal years 2015 and 2016, respectively, reveals expectations of $1.99 in the former and $1.54 in the latter. On the other hand, analysts expect that the company's revenue will  3.2% during fiscal 2016.What's going on here?Well, Feltl's Jeffrey Schreiner pointed out back in April that while he expects Cirrus to see top-line growth during fiscal year 2016, the company will also experience ""headwinds from the full utilization of deferred tax assets.""In other words, Cirrus is likely to see its tax rate move up, hurting net income (and thus earnings per share) even as revenue grows. So, let's assume that the high tax rate kicks during fiscal year 2016, leading to the drop in earnings-per-share that consensus estimates generally expect. This means that, at $19.13 per share (the most recent close as of writing), the stock is trading at roughly 12.4 times expected earnings.Not  , but it's certainly a significant discount to the current S&P 500 multiple of 18.47.While there are no guarantees, I expect that Cirrus will report solid results on Oct. 29 for the most recent quarter, and I'm even optimistic that it will issue strong guidance.Further, since Apple customers are well-known to be ""loyal,"" any share gains on Apple's part  lead to a  uptick in revenue for Cirrus. Of course, the big risk here is that Apple forces Cirrus' margins down given that Cirrus, which is highly dependent on Apple, likely has little power to say ""no.""In light of my expectations of share gains on Apple's part, a low likelihood that Apple will switch chip vendors, and a very low forward multiple that seems to bake in a lot of the risk, I feel comfortable owning the shares. Small-cap chip component plays aren't the safest investments around -- not by a long shot. However, given that the rest of the chip space has just taken a beating, and given that Cirrus is likely immune to these weaknesses in light of the fact that most of its sales come from Apple, it may be worth considering for investors with higher-than-average risk tolerance.Apple recently revealed the product of its secret-development ""dream team"" -- Apple Watch. The secret is out, and some early viewers are claiming its everyday impact could trump the iPod, iPhone,  the iPad. In fact, ABI Research predicts 485 million of this type of device will be sold per year. But one small company makes Apple's gadget possible. And its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in-the-know investors.

(  ) reduced its sales projection for the September quarter. Microchip also believes the sector had entered ""another industry correction.""Microchip forecasted its second quarter revenue for fiscal 2015 to be $546.2 million. Earlier, management provided net sales guidance for the second quarter between $560.0 million and $575.9 million. The drop in revenue expectations is mostly attributable to dismal sales figures in China. Shares of the semi-conductor maker plunged 12.3%.Shares of rival chipmakers also took a beating. Shares of Avago Technologies Limited (  ), Intel Corporation (  ) and Texas Instruments Inc. (  ) plummeted 11.5%, 5.1% and 7.1%, respectively.

This disappointing report increased fears about recession in Europe's biggest economy.Germany's industrial production and factory orders data, released earlier this week, were also disappointing. Germany's economic ministry reported the country's industrial production suffered 4% drop in August, its biggest fall in five and a half years. Additionally, factory orders dropped 5.7% in August, its biggest decline since 2009.Investors also remained concerned about dismal economic data from China and Spain.

 (  ) recently offered a glimpse of second-quarter fiscal 2015 net sales tally when it announced preliminary expectations for the soon-to-be-reported quarter. The bearish top-line expectations had a knee-jerk reaction on the share prices, which declined sharply in the after-market trading.Microchip expects net sales of $546.2 million for the second quarter, which includes about $16.9 million from the recent ISSC acquisition. Earlier, concurrent with the first quarter earnings release, management provided net sales guidance for the second quarter between $560.0 million and $575.9 million, including $18 million from the ISSC acquisition. The fall in revenue expectations is primarily attributable to weaker-than-expected sales in China.In addition, unlike most of its peers in the industry, Microchip reports sales from distribution on a sell-through basis worldwide and not on a sell-in basis to distributors. Consequently, the company has a huge pile-up of inventory at the distributor level, which is sold according to demand. Management argues that if sales are realized on a sell-in basis to distributors, it would have been significantly higher for the quarter.The company is reorganizing its production levels to match its inventory levels. Although production levels of wafer fabs and assembly and test facilities have been reduced, Microchip is continuing to ramp production of new technologies that are capacity constrained. This is likely to bring uniform production levels for all products with normal lead times during the December quarter, which is seasonally the weakest quarter of the year.Microchip develops and manufacturers microcontrollers, memory and analog and interface products for embedded control systems, which are small, low-power computers designed to perform specific tasks.Microchip currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

 (  ) has approved a share repurchase authorization of up to $100 million. Microsemi expects this program to be complete before Sep 30, 2016.The number of shares to be repurchased and the timing will depend on the prevailing market conditions and other corporate considerations. Microsemi plans to use the available working capital to fund the current share repurchase authorization.The strength of Microsemi's business model reflects its commitment toward returning value to shareholders using strong cash generation capabilities. We believe that the continued share buybacks will increase investors' enthusiasm regarding the shares, while retaining its strong financial position.Microsemi's strong balance sheet and cash flows provide financial flexibility for share repurchases and accretive acquisitions. During the last concluded quarter, cash and cash equivalents were $183.3 million, down $21.9 million from previous quarter. The company generated cash from operations of $54.4 million and free cash flow of $46.4 million.Microsemi Corporation is an original equipment manufacturer of a broad range of high-reliability and analog/mixed signal integrated circuits. The company's fiscal third-quarter revenues were up 1.8% sequentially and 20.5% from the year-ago period to $292.3 million. However, earnings of 46 cents missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny due to higher-than-expected operating expenses.Microsemi continues to undertake various initiatives and develop products, keeping in mind the interest of the organization over both the long and short run. The new share repurchase program indicates that the company is confident about its steady cash flows.Additionally, Microsemi recently announced its decision to purchase Centellax, a California-based provider of high-speed semiconductor products. The acquisition will allow the company to better serve its customers by leveraging Centellax's optical capabilities and its Ethernet data center offerings.Microsemi holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

ooking at the universe of stocks we cover at  , in trading on Friday, shares of Microchip Technology, Inc. (Symbol: MCHP) were yielding above the 3% mark based on its quarterly dividend (annualized to $1.424), with the stock changing hands as low as $47.38 on the day. Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return. To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) back on 12/31/1999 - you would have paid $146.88 per share. Fast forward to 12/31/2012 and each share was worth $142.41 on that date, a decrease of $4.67/share over all those years. But now consider that you collected a whopping $25.98 per share in dividends over the same period, for a positive total return of 23.36%. Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.6%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 3% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable. Microchip Technology, Inc.

road-based growth across all product lines helped  (  ) deliver record first-quarter fiscal 2015 revenues and adjusted earnings. Not only did this leading semiconductor manufacturer beat our estimates, but the company also reported at the high-end of its guidance with respect to sales, non-GAAP gross margin and adjusted earnings.Microchip reported GAAP net income of $89.9 million or 40 cents per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 compared with $78.6 million or 37 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. The healthy 14.4% year-over-year increase in GAAP earnings is primarily attributable to record quarterly sales.Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted net income for the reported quarter was a record high of $151.6 million or 68 cents per share, significantly up from $120.4 million or 57 cents per share in the year-earlier quarter. The quarterly adjusted earnings well exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 62 cents.Net revenue (non-GAAP) for the reported quarter came in at an all-time high of $531.3 million, up 14.8% year over year, aided by record sales of microcontrollers and analog products. The quarterly revenues were also ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $527 million.In terms of product mix, revenues from microcontroller products accounted for 64.7% of the total revenue in the quarter ($343.8 million), while analog revenues, memory chip and licensing business represented 24.1% ($127.8 million), 6.3% ($33.4 million) and 3.8% ($20.4 million) of total revenue, respectively. By geographical regions, the bulk of the revenues came from Asia ($318.3 million), followed by Europe ($109.7 million) and the Americas ($103.3 million).Net sales of microcontroller products were up 14.5% year over year in the quarter driven by record sales of 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers. While the 16-bit microcontroller business climbed 26.5% for the reported quarter, 32-bit microcontroller revenues were up 59.8% with new design wins and applications.The microcontroller business continued to outperform the industry and enabled Microchip to gain significant market share. Microchip expects to continue this momentum to further strengthen its position as the best-performing microcontroller franchise in the industry.Analog revenues, including the contribution from Supertex, increased 23.8% in the reported quarter on a year-over-year basis. The Analog business has evolved as one of the best performing analog franchises in the industry. In order to further capitalize on this burgeoning business potential, Microchip is developing and introducing a wide range of innovative and proprietary new products.During the quarter, Microchip acquired 83.5% of ISSC Technologies Corporation, a low power Bluetooth and advanced wireless solutions provider for the Internet of Things, to supplement its presence in these niche markets. The company expects to complete the acquisition by December this year. The transaction is expected to be accretive to Microchip's non-GAAP earnings from the very first quarter of its operation. The strategic purchase complements Microchip's initiatives in the wireless market, by leveraging ISSC's deep domain knowledge in Bluetooth and wireless technologies to enable significant cross-selling opportunities.Microchip recorded gross margin (non-GAAP) of 59.8% for the reported quarter, while operating income (non-GAAP) was $176.3 million. Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 33.2% and Microchip was confident of achieving its long-term goal of 35% non-GAAP operating margin in the near future.With a diligent focus on right-sizing the various components of inventory holdings, Microchip's consolidated inventory (including Supertex) at quarter end was $264.5 million or 109 days. Inventory at distributors was at 31 days. The company hiked its quarterly cash dividend from 35.55 cents to 35.60 cents per share, representing the 42nd dividend increase since its inception.Cash and short-term investments improved to $2.29 billion, with $980 million debt under its revolving line of credit. Capital expenditures aggregated $44.6 million for the quarter.Concurrent with the first quarter earnings release, management provided guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2015. Management expects net sales between $560.0 million and $575.9 million, while non-GAAP gross margin is expected in the range of 59.2% to 59.6%. Non-GAAP net income is anticipated in the range of $155.7 million to $164.8 million, with earnings per share of 70 cents to 74 cents.Microchip expects to increase cash and investments by approximately $160 million to $180 million in the second quarter prior to the dividend payment. The company expects to incur $50 million in capital expenditure in the next quarter, bringing its tally to about $175 million for fiscal 2015.With record revenues, better-than-expected bookings and increasing requests on the back of strong demand and robust product designs, we expect Microchip to continue its bull run in the coming quarters as well.Microchip presently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

 (  ) is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2015 results after the closing bell on Jul 31. In the last reported quarter, Microchip's earnings comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9 cents. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.High quality standards, solid performance, reliability features, competitive pricing and diversity of products make Microchip one of the better-positioned companies in the industry. Microchip recently inked an agreement to acquire ISSC Technologies Corporation, a low power Bluetooth and advanced wireless solutions provider for the Internet of Things to supplement its presence in these niche markets.The strategic purchase complements Microchip's initiatives in the wireless market, by leveraging ISSC's deep domain knowledge in Bluetooth and wireless technologies to enable significant cross-selling opportunities.However, Microchip derives a significant proportion of its revenues from outside America, subjecting it to exchange rate volatility. Any unfavorable movement in exchange rates continue to adversely impact the top line of the company. Also, lead times (the period of time between the initiation of any process of production and the completion of that process) continue to increase due to manufacturing constraints. This is likely to impact the profitability of the company to some extent.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Microchip will beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, #2 or #3 for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is pegged at 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and Zacks Consensus Estimate currently stand at 62 cents.Zacks Rank #3 (Hold): Microchip's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) when combined with 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 and #5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the future.Arch Capital Group Ltd.

eading semiconductor manufacturer  (  ) recently inked an agreement to acquire ISSC Technologies Corporation, a low power Bluetooth and advanced wireless solutions provider for the Internet of Things, to supplement its presence in these niche markets. The acquisition is likely to be completed by the fourth quarter of calendar-year 2014, subject to the fulfillment of mandatory closing conditions.Taiwan-based ISSC had net sales of $69.2 million with an operating margin of 18.9% in 2013. The transaction is expected to be accretive to Microchip's non-GAAP earnings from the very first quarter of its operation.Under the terms of the agreement, Microchip will initiate a tender offer to acquire all the outstanding shares of ISSC for approximately $4.74 per share in cash. This equates to a total equity value of about $328.5 million and a total enterprise value of about $294.3 million, after excluding cash and investments of approximately $34.2 million.The transaction offers ISSC the opportunity to reap the benefits of economies of scale owing to the much stronger sales and manufacturing platforms of Microchip. On the other hand, the strategic purchase complements Microchip's initiatives in the wireless market, by leveraging ISSC's deep domain knowledge in Bluetooth and wireless technologies to enable significant cross-selling opportunities. The transaction, therefore, is a win-win deal for both the companies.This is the first major foreign acquisition by Microchip. The transaction is expected to be funded with Microchip's foreign cash reserves and will not entail any additional borrowings from its line of credit.Microchip develops and manufacturers microcontrollers, memory and analog and interface products for embedded-control systems, which are small, low-power computers designed to perform specific tasks.

If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $49.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $47.80 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of MCHP, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $49.39/share today.Because the $49.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

road-based growth across all product lines helped  (  ) deliver record fourth-quarter and fiscal 2014 revenues and earnings. Not only did this leading semiconductor manufacturer beat our estimates, but the company also exceeded the mid-end of its guidance with respect to net sales, gross margin, operating margin and adjusted earnings per share.Microchip reported GAAP net income of $111.5 million or 50 cents per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 compared with $59.7 million or 28 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. The stellar 86.8% year-over-year increase in GAAP earnings is primarily attributable to record quarterly sales and lower operating expenses.Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted net income for the reported quarter was a record high of $141.3 million or 64 cents per share, significantly up from $109.3 million or 52 cents per share in the year-earlier quarter. The quarterly adjusted earnings well exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 55 cents.For fiscal 2014, Microchip reported GAAP net income of $395.3 million or $1.82 per share compared with $127.4 million or 62 cents per share in fiscal 2013. The phenomenal 210.3% year-over-year increase in GAAP earnings was largely driven by record fiscal revenues.Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted net income for the reported fiscal was $531.0 million or $2.45 per share compared with $388.5 million or $1.89 per share in fiscal 2013. The adjusted earnings for fiscal 2014 comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.19.Net revenue for the reported quarter came in at $493.4 million, up 14.7% year over year, aided by all-time high sales of microcontrollers. The quarterly revenues were also ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $491 million. For fiscal 2014, Microchip's net sales were $1.93 billion compared with $1.58 billion in fiscal 2013.In terms of product mix, revenues from microcontroller products accounted for 66.2% of the total revenue in the quarter ($326.4 million), while analog revenues, memory chip and licensing business represented 21.8% ($107.5 million), 6.7% ($33.1 million) and 4.7% ($23.2 million) of total revenue, respectively. By geographical regions, the bulk of the revenues came from Asia ($284.6 million), followed by Europe ($115.9 million) and the Americas ($92.8 million).Net sales of microcontroller products were up 18.3% year over year in the quarter and 20.8%, respectively, driven by robust sales of 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers. While the 16-bit microcontroller business climbed 38.3% and 44.2% for the reported quarter and fiscal, respectively, 32-bit microcontroller revenues were up 66% and 73% with new design wins and applications.The microcontroller business continued to outperform the industry and enabled Microchip to gain significant market share. Microchip expects to continue this momentum to further strengthen its position as the best-performing microcontroller franchise in the industry.Analog revenues increased 10.6% and 32% in the quarter and fiscal 2014, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. The Analog business has become one of the best performing analog franchises in the industry. In order to further capitalize on this burgeoning business potential, Microchip is developing and introducing a wide range of innovative and proprietary new products.Microchip recently completed the acquisition of integrated circuits (IC) manufacturer Supertex Inc., which will operate as one the divisions of its analog business. This strategic purchase will enable Microchip to expand in the Medical, Industrial and Lighting verticals. Microchip is also expected to leverage Supertex' strong domain knowledge in high voltage analog and mixed signal technologies to achieve significant operating synergies and create cross-selling opportunities.Microchip recorded gross margin (non-GAAP) of 59.3% for the reported quarter, while operating income (non-GAAP) touched a record high at $161.5 million. Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 32.7% and Microchip was confident of achieving its long-term goal of 35% non-GAAP operating margin in the near future. Gross margin (non-GAAP) for fiscal 2014 was 58.8%, while operating income (non-GAAP) was at an all-time high of $613.2 million.With a diligent focus on right-sizing the various components of inventory holdings, Microchip's consolidated inventory at quarter end was $262.7 million or 118 days. Inventory at distributors was at 33 days. The company hiked its quarterly cash dividend from 35.50 cents to 35.55 cents per share, representing the 41st dividend increase since its inception.Cash and short-term investments improved to $2.14 billion, with $650 million debt under its revolving line of credit. Capital expenditures aggregated $34.7 million for the quarter.Concurrent with the fourth quarter and fiscal 2014 earnings release, management provided guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2015. Management expects net sales between $519.8 million and $534.6 million, while non-GAAP gross margin is expected in the range of 59.3% to 59.5%. Non-GAAP net income is anticipated in the range of $143.7 million to $151.7 million, with earnings per share of 64 cents to 68 cents.Microchip expects to increase cash and investments by approximately $140 million to $160 million in the first quarter prior to the dividend payment. The company expects to incur $40 million in capital expenditure in the next quarter, bringing its tally to about $125 million for fiscal 2015.With better-than-expected bookings and increasing requests on the back of strong demand and robust product designs, we expect Microchip to continue its bull run in the coming quarters as well.Microchip presently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Other players in the industry that are worth mentioning include  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ). While Montage currently holds a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), MaxLinear and On Semiconductor carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) each.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Record Q4 Earnings and Revs for Microchip - Analyst Blog@2014-05-07@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/record-q4-earnings-and-revs-for-microchip-analyst-blog-2014-05-07
eading semiconductor manufacturer  (  ) is scheduled to report its fourth-quarter fiscal 2014 results after the closing bell on May 6. In the last reported quarter, Microchip's adjusted earnings exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7 cents. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Microchip recently completed the acquisition of integrated circuits (IC) manufacturer Supertex Inc. for a cash consideration of $33 per share. This strategic purchase will enable Microchip to expand in the Medical, Industrial and Lighting verticals. Microchip is also expected to leverage Supertex' strong domain knowledge in high voltage analog and mixed signal technologies to achieve significant operating synergies and create cross-selling opportunities. Consequently, the acquisition is anticipated to be accretive to Microchip's non-GAAP earnings per share.Microchip is one of the fastest growing providers of 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers in the world. Microcontroller business continues to grow at a rapid pace and accounts for a large chunk of the company's total business. The company shipped its 13 billionth cumulative microcontroller in Nov 2013 - a milestone reached just seven months after shipping its 12 billionth microcontroller in April. Microchip expects to continue this momentum to further consolidate its position as the best performing microcontroller franchise in the industry.With nine consecutive quarters of sequential growth, the Analog business has also become one of the largest analog franchises in the industry. In order to further capitalize on this burgeoning business potential, Microchip is developing and introducing a wide range of innovative and proprietary new products. All these initiatives augur well for the long-term growth prospects of the company.Despite healthy bookings on the back of strong demand and robust product designs, our proven model does not conclusively show that Microchip is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it lacks the key ingredients for a success recipe.Zero  : Expected Surprise Prediction or ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is at 0.00%. This indicates a likely in line earnings for the shares.Zacks Rank #2 (Buy): Microchip's Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP. Note that stocks with Zacks Ranks of #1, #2 and #3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. However, when combined with 0.00% ESP, we fail to conclusively predict an earnings surprise for Microchip. Meanwhile, we caution against stocks with Zacks #4 and #5 Ranks (Sell rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter: (  ), earnings ESP of +8.22% and Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

ooking at the universe of stocks we cover at  , in trading on Wednesday, shares of Microchip Technology, Inc. (Symbol: MCHP) were yielding above the 3% mark based on its quarterly dividend (annualized to $1.42), with the stock changing hands as low as $47.07 on the day. Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return. To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) back on 12/31/1999 - you would have paid $146.88 per share. Fast forward to 12/31/2012 and each share was worth $142.41 on that date, a decrease of $4.67/share over all those years. But now consider that you collected a whopping $25.98 per share in dividends over the same period, for a positive total return of 23.36%. Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.6%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 3% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable. Microchip Technology, Inc. (Symbol: MCHP) is an S&P 500 company, giving it special status as one of the large-cap companies making up the S&P 500 Index.In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Microchip Technology, Inc., looking at the history chart for MCHP below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 3% annual yield.    According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, MCHP makes up 2.76% of the PowerShares Dynamic Semiconductors Portfolio ETF (Symbol: PSI) which is trading lower by about 1.6% on the day Wednesday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Microchip Technology (MCHP) Shares Cross 3% Yield Mark@2014-03-26@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/microchip-technology-mchp-shares-cross-3-yield-mark-2014-03-26

eading semiconductor manufacturer  (  ) recently inked a definitive agreement to acquire integrated circuits (IC) manufacturer  (  ) for $33 per share in cash. The purchase price equates to a total equity value of about $394 million and a total enterprise value of approximately $246 million, after excluding Supertex' cash and investments to the tune of $148 million.The acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter of 2014, subject to the fulfillment of mandatory regulatory approvals. The strategic purchase will enable Microchip to expand in the Medical, Industrial and Lighting verticals. Microchip is also expected to leverage Supertex' strong domain knowledge in high voltage analog and mixed signal technologies to achieve significant operating synergies and create cross-selling opportunities. Consequently, the acquisition is anticipated to be accretive to Microchip's non-GAAP earnings per share in the very first quarter of its operation post-merger.However, Supertex' decision to merge with Microchip has stirred up a hornet's nest as to whether the proposed deal is made in the best interest of Supertex' shareholders. As such, Robbins Arroyo LLP, which represents individual and institutional investors in shareholder rights litigation, is investigating the transaction to find whether Supertex is undertaking a fair process to obtain maximum value and adequately compensate its shareholders.In the third quarter of fiscal 2013 (results declared on Jan 21, 2014), Supertex had recorded healthy year-over-year increases in net sales, net income and net margin. Net sales increased 21% year over year to $17.4 million, while GAAP earnings almost doubled to 23 cents per share from 12 cents per share in the year-ago period. Earnings also comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5 cents. In addition, net margin increased 10% for the first nine months of fiscal 2013 from the comparable year-ago period.Given the impressive numbers, it is believed that Supertex could well have prospered on its own instead of merging with Microchip. Even if the deal is closed, Supertex shareholders possess the right to file a lawsuit to ensure that the board of directors obtains the best possible price for its shareholders.Despite the hoopla, Supertex shares have soared 35.1% to $32.95 at close of trading on Feb 10, while Microchip shares remained almost flat at $44.76.Microchip presently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The year-over-year increase was primarily due to increased royalty revenues from SK Hynix, Inc. and greater episodic revenues in the reported quarter.DigitalOptics total revenue from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2013 was $7.2 million compared with $4.9 million in the prior quarter and $4.6 million in the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year increase was due to a one-time license fee related to a legacy DOC license agreement.Owing to the high percentage of licensing revenues, Tessera usually generates very strong gross margins. Accordingly, in the last quarter, its pro forma gross margin was 97.05%, 407 bps higher than 92.98% reported in the year-ago quarter.Its pro forma operating loss was $44.2 million, or 78.3% of revenue, compared with a loss of $18.6 million or 39.2% of revenue in the year-ago quarter.Tessera's pro forma net income was $4.3 million compared to net loss of $17.7 million in the year-ago quarter. Our pro forma calculations are adjusted for restructuring, amortization and acquisition-related charges on a tax-adjusted basis. Our calculations may not match management presentation, because of the addition/deletion of some items that were not considered by management.Net loss on a GAAP basis was $47.9 million compared with net loss of $23.6 million in the year-ago quarter.Tessera exited the fourth quarter with current assets worth $393.3 million, down $16.8 million during the quarter. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $359.6 million, down from $376.8 in the prior quarter. Tessera has no debt.For the first quarter of 2014, Tessera expects revenues in the range of $33 million-$36 million. The revenue guidance happens to be much below the midpoint of the revenue guidance of the prior quarter. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be between $51- $53 million. Management expects approximately $12.0 million of restructuring charges and other related exit costs, amortization of intangibles of approximately $4.7 million and stock based compensation expense of approximately $4.0 million.Tessera remains a company with good intellectual property, which it has protected with great difficulty. However, management is keen on shifting to a lower-margin but safer product-oriented model involving camera modules for mobile devices.We believe the company is on the right track as this could reduce if not eliminate the significant litigation expenses it has been incurring. The fact that the target market is fast-growing is an added bonus.Tessera is steadily progressing toward achieving its milestone of conducting an in-depth analysis of its DOC intellectual property portfolio. Tessera's DOC portfolio leads the semiconductor manufacturing technology category, ahead of companies such as Samsung,  (  ), Foxconn and  (  ).Tessera shares currently carry a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

 (  ) announced its agreement to acquire LaPrairie, Inc. for an undisclosed amount. The deal is expected to be closed in January.Headquartered in Canada, LaPrairie distributes high-voltage electrical products and services for transmission, distribution and substation needs for utilities and utility contractors across Ontario, Quebec and Atlantic Canada. The company generates annual sales of approximately $30 million from a single location in Newmarket, Ontario.The LaPrairie acquisition will bolster WESCO's presence in Canada through the expanded utility business and customer base. WESCO has been operating in the Canadian market since 1922 with employee strength of about 1,100. In 2012, the company generated approximately 17% of revenues in Canada with annual sales of $1.08 billion ($900.6 million in 2011 or up 20% year over year).The acquisition is also expected to be accretive to WESCO's earnings. It will likely add 3 cents per share to the company's profit in the first year of operation.WESCO is quite active on the M&A front. Last year, WESCO acquired RS Electronics, which expanded the company's industrial OEM (original equipment manufacturer) customer base and enhanced its electronic-based product offerings. In July, WESCO acquired British Columbia-based Trydor Industries (Canada) Ltd., a distributor of high-voltage electrical, industrial, utility products to strengthen its industrial and utility market position in Canada.The company's acquisition pipeline remains quite robust with opportunities to further expand and strengthen its portfolio.WESCO is one of the largest suppliers and distributors of electrical construction products in the United States. The company's third-quarter earnings and revenues were up a respective 17.8% and 16.6% year over year. The improvement was aided by acquisitions, partially offset by a reduction in organic sales and unfavorable currency movements.Currently, WESCO has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Other better-ranked stocks that are performing well at current levels include  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ). All these stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@WESCO to Acquire LaPrairie - Analyst Blog@2013-12-26@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/wesco-to-acquire-laprairie-analyst-blog-2013-12-26
road-based growth across all product lines helped  (  ) deliver solid third-quarter fiscal 2014 revenues and earnings. Not only did this leading semiconductor manufacturer beat our estimates, but the company even exceeded the mid-end of its guidance with respect to net sales and adjusted earnings per share.Microchip reported GAAP net income of $105.4 million or 48 cents per share in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 compared with $10.2 million or 5 cents per share in the year-ago quarter.Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted net income for the reported quarter was $132.9 million or 61 cents per share, significantly up from $84.5 million or 41 cents per share in the year-earlier quarter. The year-over-increase in non-GAAP earnings was primarily attributable to solid top-line growth. The quarterly adjusted earnings well exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 54 cents.Net revenue for the reported quarter came in at $482.4 million in third quarter fiscal 2014, up 15.9% year over year, aided by a healthy microcontroller business. The quarterly revenues were also ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $480 million.In terms of product mix, revenues from microcontroller products accounted for 64.9% of the total revenue in the quarter ($313.3 million), while analog revenues, memory chip and licensing business represented 22.6% ($108.9 million), 7.1% ($32.5 million) and 5.0% ($24.1 million) of total revenue, respectively. By geographical regions, the bulk of the revenues came from Asia ($296.3 million), followed by Europe ($95.4 million) and the Americas ($90.7 million).Net sales of microcontroller products were up 17.8% year over year, driven by robust sales of 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers. While the 16-bit microcontroller business climbed 27.9% year over year, 32-bit microcontroller revenues were up 29.5% in the reported quarter, driven by new design wins and applications.Microchip shipped its 13 billionth cumulative microcontroller in November - a milestone reached just seven months after shipping its 12 billionth microcontroller in Apr 2013. The company is gaining significant market share with continued new product innovations and customer engagements. Microchip expects to continue this momentum to further strengthen its position as the best performing microcontroller franchise in the industry.Analog revenues increased 16.7% year over year and gained a healthy market share. With nine consecutive quarters of sequential revenue growth, the Analog business has become one of the best performing analog franchises in the industry. In order to further capitalize on this burgeoning business potential, Microchip is developing and introducing a wide range of innovative and proprietary new products.Gross margin (non-GAAP) for the reported quarter was 59.0%, while operating income (non-GAAP) was $153.8 million.With a diligent focus on right-sizing the various components of inventory holdings, Microchip's consolidated inventory at quarter end was $274.6 million or 126 days. Inventory at distributors was at 33 days with a healthy book-to-bill ratio. The company hiked its quarterly cash dividend from 35.45 cents to 35.50 cents per share, representing the 40th dividend increase since its inception.Cash and short-term investments at quarter end were $1.3 billion, with $650 million debt under its revolving line of credit. Capital expenditures aggregated $24.3 million for the quarter. Free cash flow at quarter end was $110.3 million prior to the dividend payment.Concurrent with the third quarter earnings release, management provided guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. Management expects net sales between $482.4 million and $496.8 million, while GAAP gross margin is expected to be in the range of 58.6% to 58.8%. GAAP net income is anticipated to be in the range of $97.1 million to $104.0 million, with earnings per share of 43 cents to 47 cents.Microchip expects to increase cash and investments by approximately $135 million to $155 million in the fourth quarter prior to the dividend payment. The company expects to incur $30 million in capital expenditure in the next quarter, bringing its tally to about $115 million for fiscal 2014.With better-than-expected bookings and increasing requests on the back of strong demand and robust product designs, we expect Microchip to continue its bull run in the coming quarters as well.Microchip presently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

ecently,  (  ) lowered its revenue and earnings expectations for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014.The company now expects sales of $120.0-$130.0 million versus its previous guidance of $132.0-$144.0 million. The GAAP earnings outlook has been trimmed to 0-8 cents from the previous guidance of 9-18 cents, while non GAAP earnings outlook is down to 18-24 cents from the previous guidance of 29-37 cents.Management stated that the guidance cut was on account of continuous delays in capital expenditure by telecom companies and the release of a new consumer mobile platform.Additionally, the company announced that it is combining its Advanced Communications and Gennum Product Groups into one new group named Signal Integrity and Timing Product Group to make better use of natural synergies. Gary Beauchamp will lead the new Product Group.In order to improve its competitive position in both the long and short run, it is imperative that Semtech continues to undertake various initiatives and develop new products. We believe the restructuring of its product groups will have positive implications on the company's financials, going forward.Semtech manufactures a wide range of analog and mixed-signal semiconductors, including Standard Semiconductor Products, Rectifier and Assembly Products and Other Products. Though we remain encouraged by the company's new design wins and various product introductions, the slowing demand and challenges in several key end markets will likely weigh on the near-term growth prospects.The company reported a weak quarter, with revenues of $141.0 million, down 14.5% sequentially and 12.4% year over year. However, earnings of 27 cents per share were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Currently, Semtech has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

"eportedly,  (  ) is planning to launch an online grocery shop called ""Pantry,"" mainly aimed at Amazon Prime members. The Pantry service would offer items such as cleaning supplies, kitchen paper rolls, canned goods like pet food, dry grocery items like cereal and some beverages.Some of the goods are expected to meet with challenges related to shipping but Amazon seems to have come up with something to overcome this shortcoming. Pantry will carry around 2,000 grocery items to start with. All of these items will be sold at low cost to end users.Amazon already runs a service ""Subscribe and Save,"" which provides some discounts to shoppers. Customers are provided additional discounts when they purchase more than five items in the same month.Of late, Amazon has been on an expansion spree, expanding its warehousing network in all lines. It recently launched Amazon Fresh same-day grocery service in San Francisco. The company is also investing in drones to automate the delivery process.Grocery is one of the most difficult sectors to crack, especially when it comes to online shopping as is evident from the now defunct business of Webvan. These endeavors often meet with failure as the operational cost (cost incurred in maintaining infrastructural facilities for delivery on time, warehousing facilities for storage of goods, etc) is exorbitant while margins are low. Since grocery items are mostly perishable in nature, it further increases the chances of wastage.Amazon is one of the leading players in an extremely fast-growing market. In the last reported quarter, Amazon's revenues of $17.09 billion were up sequentially as well as from the year-ago quarter. Management attributed the revenue increase to the growing consumption of digital content across different categories owing to the advantageous value proposition Amazon provides to its customers.Currently, Amazon has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Formalities are minimal: a person, organization or gallery wishing to use the service is required to send Google a request.It's not clear yet whether Google filters the content or not, but it would seem reasonable, since some kinds of pictures may be considered objectionable.Google Open Gallery has options not only for adding photos but also for adding videos, text and Street View imagery. Google hosts the actual content on the /culturalspot.org domain, which, in turn, has a bar at the top that can link back to the curator or parent organization.Renowned museums can also make good use of Open Gallery's full-screen introductory image and a powerful zoom tool that zeroes in on details of complex illustrations or primitive photos for exhibitions. Google has already declared its plan of adding additional and improved features to the Gallery soon.In the past, Google collaborated with museums to make their exhibits available online through the Google Cultural Institute. Open Gallery happens to be the first time that Google is making this technology openly available to anyone with cultural content.Google reported gross revenue of $14.89 billion in the third quarter of 2013, up 5.6% on a year-over-year basis.

n Dec 5, we downgraded, Vocus Inc.

Fourth quarter revenue guidance of $45.1 - $45.5 million was also disappointing.Vocus' expansion plans are taking a toll on its operating results. Adjusted gross margin decreased to 82.9% from 83.7% in the year-ago quarter. Moreover reported operating margin was 5.3%, down from 8.7% in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted operating expenses also increased 5.0% year over year, primarily due to growth in direct sales capacity, higher commission and investments.Additionally, Vocus lost 317 net customers as against 479 additions in the previous quarter and 1,015 additions in the year-ago period, primarily due to higher marketing suite prices and discontinuation of renewals for the small-business version.We believe international expansion is crucial to business growth and success. Vocus' significant exposure in Europe, risks of foreign currency fluctuations and changes in international businesses are expected to impact fourth quarter results. Further expansions could adversely impactthe results, going forward.Additionally, continuous decline in demand for its legacy PR solution, lesser focus on selling low-end solutions to small businesses, margin contraction, currency fluctuations and competition from Marketo, Inc.

eading semiconductor manufacturer  (  ) recently narrowed its third quarter fiscal 2014 guidance around the mid-point of its previously guided range to better reflect the market conditions. Investors turned somewhat bearish following the trimmed guidance and Microchip share prices fell 11 cents or 0.26% to close the trading session on Dec 3 at $42.64.Microchip now anticipates net sales to be down 1.5% to 4.5% sequentially. GAAP earnings per share are expected to be in the range of 41 cents to 45 cents, while adjusted (non-GAAP) earnings are anticipated to come within 58 cents to 62 cents per share. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for third quarter fiscal 2014 has remained static at 54 cents over the last 30 days.Concurrent with the second quarter fiscal 2014 earnings release, management had provided guidance for the impending quarter. Net sales were expected to be flat to down 6% on a sequential basis. GAAP earnings were then expected to be within 40 cents to 46 cents per share, while non-GAAP earnings were pegged to be in the range of 57 cents to 63 cents.In addition to a narrowed guidance, management also revealed that overall bookings for the company were stable currently and revenues for the fourth quarter were likely to be up sequentially. This gives us enough confidence to continue to remain bullish on the stock despite some momentary glitches.Microchip develops and manufactures microcontrollers, memory and analog and interface products for embedded-control systems, which are small, low-power computers designed to perform specific tasks.

 (  ) has opened its first International Business Exchange (IBX) data center - OS1 - in Osaka, Japan. The company is aggressively moving ahead with its plan of developing data centers across different geographical locations.The data center has been developed in collaboration with K-Opticom and Kanden Energy Solutions (KENES), the technology access providers in the Osaka/Kansai area. The first phase of OS1 will offer 320 cabinets, which is expected to increase to over 800 in 2014. Moreover, the new data center enables customers to access more than 950 domestic and international carriers.The company also expects that this data center will strengthen the global network connectivity in the Osaka region and maintain a direct connection with the network core in Dojima. Equinix already has four operational data centers in the country in order to tap into the increasing demand for data centers in the Asia-Pacific and Japan (APJ) region.The data center business is thriving across geographies and Equinix is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this opportunity. Being a major player in the data center space, the company is making an effort to grab a major share of this increased demand by renewing its focus on the APJ region.

" (  ) recently announced that its business unit Mashery has acquired Hacker League for an undisclosed sum. Mashery, a San-Francisco based company founded in 2006, was acquired by Intel in May, 2013. Mashery helps service developers in API tracking, metering and security to provide access to critical data.Hacker League is an organizer of ""hackathons"", or events organized to solve different programming problems within a specified time. The creations resulting from these events can be used to facilitate the app development process, which is what makes it such a good fit with Mashery. The process also identifies skilled programmers, which makes it all the more valuable.Hacker League's IP (intellectual property) platform and other assets will move to Intel, with the three co-founders of Hacker League, namely Mike Swift, Abe Stanway and Ian Jennings parting ways.The acquisition of Hacker League by the Intel unit seems to indicate the company's intent to work more closely with developers. Intel could use Hacker League's platform in its own hardware-owned hackathons. Mashery could utilize the platform to further its own internal development.Intel seems to have taken the same path as  (  ), which has been on an acquisition spree of late. Intel acquired the HTML5 assets of appMobi in February and followed it up with the acquisition of Mashery.Intel is poised to register growth in the future by emphasizing on its primary sphere of competencies, expanding its core business lines and by forging manufacturing agreements with other OEM manufacturers instead of adding new business lines and moving into the consumer electronics market with flashy new products as tools for achieving growth.Intel Corporation is one of the world's largest semiconductor chipmakers. Intel reported third-quarter revenues of $13.48 billion, within the guidance range of 13.5 billion (+/-$500 million). This was up 5.2% sequentially and 0.2% year over year.Currently, Intel has a Zacks Rank # 3 (Hold).

s per Verge,  (  ) is planning to make the Start menu available as an option in its next major Windows release, currently codenamed Threshold. It was not revealed, however, whether the Start menu will be available for all versions of Windows Threshold or just as an option to those that support desktop apps.The new Start menu is expected to be very much similar to the one that Windows users have known and loved since Windows 95. The new version will allow the Metro apps to run as floating windows on the desktop screen. The aforesaid feature is currently available in some third-party tools like Stardock's ModernMix.The current Windows OS does not allow multiple Metro apps such as Skype and Skydrive to float on the same screen without running a third-party app like ModernMix. Microsoft is adding such features as a measure to increase the level of flexibility for its new style apps.Currently, in Windows 8.1, a Start button appears at the lower left-hand corner of the screen which provides familiarity but not the functionality of the original Start button. On the contrary, it performs the same action that the Windows button does in Windows 8, ie. switching between desktop and the start screen.The new development is supposedly a move to bring the disparate versions of Windows for different devices closer together from an end user's point of view.Microsoft Corporation develops, manufactures, licenses, sells and supports software products.

Microchip reported healthy third-quarter fiscal 2015 results as adjusted earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $0.04. The company is one of the fastest growing providers of 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers. The quality and diversity of products make Microchip one of the better-positioned companies in the semiconductor universe and enable it to outperform the industry. The company is also gaining significant market share in Analog products with continued new product innovations and customer engagements. We are changing our long-term recommendation on the stock from Neutral to Outperform as we anticipate it to perform well above the broader market. However, an uncertain macroeconomic environment could hamper the growth momentum to some extent.Incorporated in Delaware in 1989, Microchip Technology Incorporated (MCHP) develops and manufacturers microcontrollers, memory and analog and interface products for embedded control systems, which are small, low-power computers designed to perform specific tasks. Embedded control systems typically incorporate a microcontroller as the principal active and sometimes sole component. A microcontroller is a self-contained computer-on-a-chip consisting of a central processing unit, non-volatile program memory, random access memory for data storage and various input/output peripheral capabilities. In addition to the microcontroller, a complete embedded control system includes application-specific software and may comprise specialized peripheral device controllers, non-volatile memory products such as serial electrically erasable programmable read only memory (EEPROMs) and various analog and interface products.The company primarily has five major product lines:Microcontrollers - Microcontrollers are currently available in 4-bit through 32-bit architectures. 4-bit microcontrollers make up the smallest segment of the microcontroller market and have been declining for several years. The powerful 8-bit microcontrollers remain very cost-effective for a wide range of high volume embedded control applications and consequently represent the largest portion of the overall microcontroller market. The more powerful 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers provide higher performance and functionality, and are generally found in more complex embedded control applications. The product portfolio for Microchip comprises 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit PIC microcontrollers and 16-bit dsPIC digital signal controllers. Microchip also offers a comprehensive set of application development tools, which enable system designers to program a microcontroller and dsPIC Digital Signal Controllers (DSC) for specific applications. These tools are hardware products that let these designers program Microchip's microcontrollers and other electronics products.Memory products Memory products consist of Serial EEPROMs, which are useful in embedded devices as they do not require power to keep data stored. Serial EEPROM products are used for non-volatile program and data storage in systems, where such data must be either modified frequently or retained for longer periods.Analog and Interface products These products consist of several families with approximately 800 power management, linear, mixed-signal, thermal management, RF Linear drivers, safety and security, and interface products. The line of mixed-signal products primarily includes data converters that convert data from analog to digital or vice versa. Linear products refer to Microchip's products that transfer either analog or digital data, without any conversions.Technology Licensing Technology licensing revenue from the recent acquisition of Silicon Storage Technology (SST) comprises a combination of license fees and royalties related to SST's technology licensed for SuperFlash technology, and fees for engineering services. Microchip licenses its SuperFlash technology to foundries, integrated device manufacturers and design partners across the world to produce advanced microcontroller products, gate array, RF and analog products that require embedded flash.Other This segment counts revenue from assembly and test subcontracting services as a result of the company's acquisition of Millennium Microtech Thailand (MMT) in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

 (  ) recently added Google Play Music to the list of apps supported by Glass.The Music app can be accessed from the MyGlass page by all except those who have already downloaded the app ahead of time. These users will have to first uninstall it through the Android Debug Bridge so that it can be successfully installed via MyGlass.It seems that the wait is finally over for Glass users who all this while wanted to make good use of their headsets to listen to music of their choice. It's also really convenient because once the glass is removed from the head, the playback automatically ceases and resumes only when the headset is put back on.However, the music app comes with its share of issues. Songs that have played once remain on the timeline but it provides no means by which new songs can be added without a voice search.Google is also offering stereo earbuds at $85 (very expensive, but they also happen to meet the exact requirements of Glass, so could be purchased for that reason). Google Glass is still not widely available, but the continued enhancements and app support make it a must-have.Google reported gross revenue of $14.89 billion in the third quarter of 2013, up 5.6% on a year-over-year basis.

 (  ) is set to report fourth-quarter 2013 results on Dec 9. Last quarter it posted a 5.1% positive earnings surprise. Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.In the last reported quarter, ABM Industries reported strong third quarter fiscal 2013 results (ended July 31, 2013) with net income of $16.1 million or 29 cents per share compared with $12.6 million or 23 cents per share in the year-earlier quarter.ABM Industries has a healthy pipeline of future businesses and is particularly going strong in government business. The company expects to continue its bull run in the coming quarters as well as healthy margin improvements and seamless integration of acquired businesses. Management also reiterated that corporate restructuring initiatives were well on track to have a sustained long-term growth momentum.The company has developed a platform to deliver an end-to-end service model to its clients by realigning its operational structure to an on-site, mobile and on-demand market-based structure. This realignment is likely to improve its long-term growth prospects and provide higher margin opportunities by enabling it to better deliver end-to-end services to its clients across urban, suburban and rural areas.Our proven model does not conclusively show that ABM Industries is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate both currently stand at 45 cents. Thus, the ESP is 0.00%.Zacks Rank #2 (Buy): ABM Industries carries a Zacks Rank #2 but a positive ESP would have made us confident about an earnings beat.We caution against stocks with Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the imminent future: (  ) with Earnings ESP of + 1.74% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) (  ) with Earnings ESP of +0.60% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) .

 (  ) recently sued Acacia Research Corp, claiming a breach of contract pertaining to smartphone technologies. The lawsuit has been filed under seal in Manhattan.Microsoft accused Acacia of claiming payments based on litigation tactics instead of demanding payments based on the actual valuation of its patents. The lawsuit has been filed by Microsoft following the seven patent infringement lawsuits that Acacia filed against Microsoft in October.Acacia purchases patents for the collection of royalties related to them or for taking legal action against the perceived infringers of this intellectual property. In 2007, Acacia had sued companies such as Oracle, Corel, Kodak, Nuance, Borland, Novell and others on grounds of patent infringement.However, Acacia never sues a company in its own name, on the contrary it makes good use of its subsidiaries in this regard. In this case too, the same tactic was adopted by Acacia while filing lawsuits against Microsoft. One of the lawsuits that Acacia recently filed against Microsoft was by Intercarrier Communications, which happens to be an Acacia subsidiary, keeping its image clean at the same time.Microsoft and Acacia have entered into agreements in the past too. In 2010, they entered into a definitive agreement over patents for smartphone technology and in 2011 struck a deal related to e-mail messaging.Microsoft Corporation develops, manufactures, licenses, sells and supports software products. The company operates in five segments: Windows & Windows Live Division, Server and Tools, Online Services Division, Microsoft Business Division, and Entertainment and Devices Division.

ccording to Bloomberg,  (  ) is looking to sell its yet-to-be-launched online pay-TV service, OnCue and has held talks with potential buyers like  (  ) in this regard. Intel reportedly needs $500.0 million to cover costs although it's not clear yet whether the service will fetch that price.Samsung Electronics and Liberty Global have expressed interest in the deal but Verizon could be the ultimate winner. Verizon is a renowned name in the pay-TV business, so OnCue would complement the business well, thereby consolidating its position.OnCue was developed to increase competition for cable companies by providing live TV, streaming and on-demand content over a high speed Internet connection. In order to test the efficiency of the service, Intel had already developed servers, set-top-boxes and applications for smartphones and tablets.However, Intel (and Otellini) probably did not anticipate the difficulty in securing content deals, which is the main reason the service never took off. Once Krzanich took his place, the company turned focus to core competencies.Intel will now focus on its core competencies, expanding its core business lines and by forging manufacturing agreements with other OEM manufacturers instead of adding new business lines and moving into the consumer electronics market with flashy new products as tools for achieving growth.Intel Corporation is one of the world's largest semiconductor chipmakers.

 's(  ) shares gained 1.01% on Wednesday, Nov 27, buoyed by the announcement of a patent cross-license agreement with Soitec. Sentiment turned bullish as the agreement ends all pending legal issues between these two companies. The companies will also have exclusive rights to use each other's patent related to silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer products. SOI is a technique by which bulk silicon wafers are substituted with wafers consisting of three layers in a chipmaking process.Soitec is a manufacturer of semiconductor materials for electronic and energy industries. The company's products are essential for producing semiconductor devices, which are used in computers, cellular phones and other mobile electronic devices, automobiles, as well as other consumer and industrial products.Soitec's portfolio of patents will strengthen SunEdison's SOI product competencies, which in turn will increase its overall market growth going forward.UK-based technology research firm Technavio projects that the global demand for silicon wafers will grow at a 5-year compound annual growth rate of 5.23% from 2011 to 2015. The demand will mostly be influenced by capacity expansion of semiconductor manufacturers. We believe that the current agreement is a positive move for SunEdison and is in sync with the company's strategy.SunEdison is expected to benefit from the rise in demand for solar energy, and the divestment of its semiconductor business would further enable it to concentrate on its core competencies.Though the Solar segment has not performed well in the last two quarters, we believe there is still immense potential due to its improving backlog and project pipeline. We also consider SunEdison's recent tie-up with Brazil's Petrobras, to build one of the largest solar photovoltaic power plants as a positive. This venture will help SunEdison to tap the Brazilian solar market and expand geographically.Currently, SunEdison has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

 (  ) recently entered into a partnership with Westfield Labs, a unit of Westfield Group to launch three digital storefronts in San Francisco. These are basically touch-sensitive store windows through which customers can select merchandise. The details are then sent to their mobile phones where they can pay for products using eBay's Paypal system.With the introduction of this connected glass digital shopping facility, shoppers can now browse or buy more than 100 selected products from Sony, TOMS and Rebecca Minkoff at the Westfield San Francisco Centre. Once the products are selected, they can be pushed to the customer's mobile phone and paid securely through PayPal.If the strategy proves to be a success, it may be tried out at other busy locations as well. However, while it sounds novel and helpful for the holiday season rush, it may not be that useful when the stores themselves are going empty. Unless of course customers are able to shop even after the stores are closed (since products may be delivered at any specified address as in online shopping). This interface looks like a meeting point for online and offline shopping, so it could be a very interesting development.eBay is one of the world's largest online marketplaces. Goods and services are sold on the platform by a large number of individuals and small businesses all over the world. Other than the U.S., it provides country-specific sites in the United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, Austria, France, Italy, Japan, Korea and Australia.eBay has taken all the necessary measures, beginning with the fixed price format to wooing big sellers and customers, improving technology and navigation of its properties, investing in better fulfillment services and focusing on mobile customers to boost profitability. Its drive to provide complete online solutions for traditional retailers should further add to its growth going forward.eBay reported third quarter revenues of $3.9 billion, up 14.3% from the year-ago quarter.

he world's largest chip-maker,  (  ), hosted its Analyst Day on Nov 21, 2013, following which shares of the company were up 2.7% and closed at $25.23.During the course of the event, management stated that expansion of its small contract manufacturing business will prove to be a major factor in driving long-term growth. Until recently, Intel had used its manufacturing capabilities to manufacture its own chips.However, this year, it signed up a couple of foundry customers and management now plans to open up for competitors as well. So Intel could now be making components even for its companies like graphics chipmaker  (  ) and mobile chipmaker  (  ).Intel launched two mobile chips from its Atom line with the high-end version named Broxton and the low-end version named SoFIA. These chips have been designed in such a way that they can easily interchange features and thus create different versions of the same component.Management has shifted its focus toward low-priced categories. Considering the sluggishness in the PC market, this seems to be a good move to grab market share. As a part of its new growth agenda, Intel will focus on manufacturing chips for a few phone makers but with large sales volumes.Intel intends to become more customer-centric in the near future, which means that it will manufacture chips keeping market demand in mind rather than trying to push its own designs.The company's focus on geographic expansion and addition of new customers to its existing sphere of businesses will help accelerate profit growth in the future.Intel expects revenues to remain approximately flat year over year in 2014. Gross margin is expected to be within 55% to 65%.Intel predicts the PC market to be down in low single-digit percent in the near future. Investments to help customers convert to Intel chips in tablets are expected to adversely impact profitability.Management targets 15% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for DCG (Data Center Group) by 2015, which will be brought about by an 8% CAGR in Enterprise IT and a much higher and more rapid rate of growth in emerging areas like private cloud, telecommunications and HPC.Currently, Intel has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

This card will be available to Google Wallet users free of cost and be acceptable at places that generally accept Mastercard. Cardholders will not be charged any monthly or annual fees.The debit card will enable consumers to access the funds stored in their Google Wallet accounts. Google Wallet is a smartphone app and online payment service that lets consumers buy goods and transfer money.The introduction of this card implies that a phone is no longer essential to make payment at stores. Instead customers can directly swipe their cards at POS (point of sale) terminals to make the necessary payments.The newly launched prepaid debit card is expected to play a major role in Google's expansion into the world of commerce. It should also provide valuable information about the shopping habits of consumers that can be used, in turn, to target ads.Google is a market leader in online advertising and it has been trying to explore various ways to diversify its revenues and fight competition.

 group of Chinese online video providers, including Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Sohu.com Inc., recently accused  (  ) of having infringed copyrights by providing access to pirated content.China has been in the news for its weak intellectual property legislation. It is only recently that the Chinese government has taken some stern measures regarding the protection of valuable intellectual properties. Due to this weak IP legislation, it had entered into innumerable disputes with the United States in the past.Baidu, which is China's largest search engine, has been investing funds in an attempt to build its video business. It now appears that the company feeds copyrighted content into its own web and mobile video services. The video search also leads users to places where they can download pirated material.The conglomerate of Chinese Internet firms, supported by the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), is seeking 300 million yuan ($49.2 million) as compensation for damages from Baidu and QVOD for copyright violation. They are claiming that some unauthorized content is available on Baidu's video search, Baidu Yingyin, Baidu Video App and Baidu TV Stick. They are accusing Baidu of using an automated process to obtain this content from other companies.Baidu maintains that it is against piracy, but according to a Reuters report, the company refused to negotiate with Sohu until QVOD agreed to stop pirating videos. QVOD denied any wrong-doing, saying that it was just a video player and did not provide content.Baidu, Inc. provides Internet search services in Chinese.

nalog Devices Inc. (  ) reported fourth-quarter 2013 earnings of 62 cents per share, which comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 58 cents. The earnings beat was driven by strong revenue growth in the automotive segment coupled with better gross margins.Adjusted earnings per share exclude one-time items but include stock-based compensation expense.Analog Devices generated revenues of $678.1 million, up 0.6% sequentially but down 2.4% year over year. The revenues were at the lower end of management's guidance of $675 million to $700.0 million. The sequential increase was driven by the strength in the automotive segment.Total end customer orders, which include both original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and distribution, were down sequentially. Also, the book-to-bill ratio was below one.The  market generated 46% of Analog Devices' total revenue (flat sequentially but up 2.0% year over year). This is a diversified market for Analog Devices, including the industrial automation, instrumentation, energy, defense and healthcare segments. The improved performance in the automation and process control business was offset by lower revenues from the instrumentation business, especially in smartphones, tablets and other devices with wireless connectivity. However, the defense and aerospace businesses recovered in the fourth quarter, growing by more than 10%. generated 21% of total revenue, flat sequentially but down 2% year over year. The modest sequential growth in the wireless infrastructure sub-segment driven by deployments in North America and Asia was partially offset by inventory reductions at some base-station customers, resulting in no sequential growwth.Encouraged by the intention of the operators in China and the U.S. to increase their 4G LTE deployments in 2014, management expects growth to resume in the next year.The  segment generated around 19% of Analog Devices' fourth-quarter revenues, up 9.0% sequentially and 19.0% from the year-ago quarter. The increase was driven by strength across new infotainment platforms, safety and powertrain applications. Additionally, the ramp up of next generation safety platforms including advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) radar saw higher adoption rates in the last quarter. In powertrain, stop-start battery monitoring technology gained traction in other higher-volume vehicles, increasing the the company's potential growth.Management continues to believe that growth in worldwide luxury vehicle will lead to solid automotive revenues in the near term. The growing electronic content in vehicles will remain a positive, with demand for products like driver assistance and powertrain efficiency systems remaining strong.The  segment, which Analog Devices clubbed with the computing and handset businesses, was down 6.0% sequentially and 31.0% year over year. It accounted for 14.0% of total fourth quarter revenues.On a sequential basis, revenues increased across all product lines, except in amplifiers and power management & reference products. However, on a year-over-year basis, the decline in revenues was broad-based across product lines.Analog signal processing products (91% of total revenue) were up 1.0% sequentially but down 3.0% year over year. Converters were up 2.0% sequentially but flat year over year. Amplifier revenues declined 1.0% sequentially but increased 1.0% year over year. Other analog products were flat sequentially but down 18.0% from the year-ago quarter.Power management and reference products contributed roughly 7% of revenues, down 3% both sequentially as well as from the year-ago quarter. These products are generally sold in the consumer/computing markets. Management has refocused the business over the last few years to concentrate on this fast-growing product line.Digital Signal Processing (DSPs) (9% of total revenues) was up 1.0% sequentially and 6.0% from the year-ago level.Reported gross margin for the quarter was 65.6%, up 110 basis points (bps) sequentially and 180 bps year over year. The primary reason for the increase in gross margin was attributable to higher factory utilization and lower manufacturing costs.Analog reported operating expenses of $245.0 million, up 7.5% from $228.0 million incurred in the year-ago quarter. Both research & development and selling, marketing and general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of sales from the year-ago quarter. The net result was a GAAP operating margin of 29.5%, down 150 bps from the year-ago quarter of 31.0%.On a GAAP basis, Analog Devices recorded a net profit of $201.6 million or 64 cents per share compared with $179.2 million or 58 cents per share in the year-ago quarter.The company generated adjusted net profit of $196.7 million compared with $178.6 million in the year-ago quarter. Pro forma earnings came in at 62 cents per share compared with 58 cents in the year-ago quarter.AnalogDevices exited the fourth quarter with cash and short-term investments of approximately $4.68 billion, up from $4.45 billion in the prior quarter. Trade receivables were $325.1 million, down from $345.4 million in the prior quarter.Cash generated from operations was around $282.2 million. Analog Devices spent $48.6 million on capex, $42.8 million on share repurchases and $105.9 million on cash dividends.During the quarter, the company declared a cash dividend of 34 cents per share to be paid on Dec 17, 2013, to all shareholders of record at the close of business on Dec 6, 2013.Management expects first-quarter 2014 revenues to decrease in the range of -5% to -10% sequentially. The company estimates gross margin in the range of 64.0%-65%, operating expenses to decrease approximately within $3 million to $226 million, tax rate to be approximately 13% and earnings per share in the range of 44 cents-52 cents.Analog Devices has a significant percentage of its revenues coming from the industrial and communication markets, both of which are expected to see strong demand in 2014. The increased 3G and 4G deployments in China and the U.S will revive growth in these markets, going forward.However, in the near term, management expects certain customer shutdowns and inventory reductions due to the upcoming holiday season. Given these negatives, it is not surprising that the revenue guidance was down sequentially. Also, with continued uncertainty in key markets, the shares may remain range-bound in the near term.Currently, Analog Devices has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Other stocks that are performing well at current levels include  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ).

 (  ) reported third-quarter 2013 net loss of 91 cents per share, significantly wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 18 cents.Tessera reported revenues of $37.3 million, down 20.0% sequentially and 38.3% year over year.Intellectual property total revenue was $32.3 million, down $10.5 million sequentially and $25.5 million on a year over year basis. The sequential decline was mainly due to lower episodic revenues while the year-over-year decline was attributable to the absence of royalty revenues in the quarter from  (  ) and PTI.DigitalOptics total revenue from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2013 was $4.9 million compared with $3.7 million in the prior quarter. The sequential increase was primarily due to higher revenues from image enhancement technologies including a one- time fee recognized in the quarter.In comparison to the year-ago quarter, third quarter 2013 DOC revenues from continuing operations were up $2.4 million, with the increase being driven by higher revenues from image enhancement technologies.DigitalOptics revenues from discontinued operations were $1.2 million in the third quarter of 2013 - related to the products and services sold from the Charlotte facility.Because of the high percentage of licensing revenues, Tessera usually generates very strong gross margins. Accordingly, in the last quarter, its pro forma gross margin was 95.5%, 157 bps higher than the 93.9% reported in the year-ago quarter.Its pro forma operating loss was $9.4 million, or 25.3% of revenue compared to a profit of $9.9 million 16.5% of revenue in the year-ago quarter. The decline was because of significantly lower revenues.Tessera's pro forma net loss was $49.5 million compared to net income of $11.5 million in the year ago quarter. Our pro forma calculations are adjusted for restructuring, amortization and acquisition-related charges on a tax-adjusted basis. Our calculations may not match management presentation, because of the addition/deletion of some items that were not considered by management.Net loss on a GAAP basis was $59.0 million compared to net loss of $24.0 million in the last quarter and profit of $4.2 million in the year ago quarter.Tessera exited the third quarter with current assets worth $410.2 million, down $7.8 million during the quarter.

Intellectual Property revenues are expected in the range $48-$50 million whereas Digital Optics revenues are expected to be in the range $8-$10 million. GAAP operating expense is expected to be between $59- $63 million.Tessera remains a company with good intellectual property, which it has protected with great difficulty. However, management is keen on shifting to a lower-margin but safer product-oriented model involving camera modules for mobile devices.We believe the company is on the right track as this could reduce if not eliminate the significant litigation expenses it has been incurring. The fact that the target market is fast-growing is an added bonus.Tessera is steadily progressing towards achieving its milestone of conducting an in-depth analysis of its DOC intellectual property portfolio. Tessera's DOC portfolio leads the semiconductor manufacturing technology category, ahead of companies such as Samsung, SanDisk, Foxconn and  (  ).

 's (  ) third-quarter 2013 earnings of 36 cents exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents.Trimble's third-quarter revenues of $556.5 million were down 3.4% sequentially but up 10.3% year over year and at the lower end of the guided range of $555 million-$565 million. The revenues in the last quarter was impacted by inconsistent market conditions and weak investments due to increased caution regarding government purchases in the U.S, partially offset by the strengthening U.S. commercial and residential construction markets.Trimble has also made a number of acquisitions in the recent months, which are helping it to build a strong product portfolio and position itself in markets with better growth prospects.The Engineering and Construction (E&C), Field Solutions (TFS), Mobile Solutions (TMS) and Advanced Devices (AD) segments generated 56.0%, 18%, 20% and 6% of the total revenue, respectively. unit revenues of $310.6 million were down 0.9% sequentially but up 8.1% year over year. The year-over-year increase was attributable to positive impact from acquisitions, higher sales in survey and heavy civil building construction products due to a revival in the residential and commercial market. The most important markets within E&C are heavy and highway, large-scale commercial, smaller-scale commercial and housing as well as survey instruments. Of these, the survey instruments business is currently under pressure due to unfavorable weather and economic uncertainties in Europe and political conditions in China.BIM-enabled tools are gaining traction as commercial and residential markets in the U.S. improve slowly. Trimble believes that it will witness strength in these markets in 2014. revenues of $99.5 million were down 14.2% sequentially and 3.4% year over year. Weaker sales of Geographical Information System (GIS) solutions and unfavorable weather impacted revenues in this segment partially offset by growth in agricultural solutions sales.Management expects the agricultural business revenues to grow at a double-digit rate, driven by the expansion in the new product categories and a higher rate of product introductions. revenues of $113.6 million were down 1.7% sequentially but up 35.5% from the comparable quarter of 2012. While the core business contributed to growth in the last quarter, most of the increase was on the back of acquisitions especially in the transportation and logistics market.The  segment was up 4.4% sequentially and 7.0% from the year-ago quarter to $32.9 million. The improved performance was on account of stronger sales of radio frequency identification (RFID) components and subsystems.Trimble's gross margin for the quarter was 53.0%, up 50 basis points (bps) sequentially and 90 bps year over year. The sequential increase was due to a favorable mix.Trimble reported operating expenses of $232.0 million, down 2.3% sequentially but up 16.4% from the year-ago quarter. As a percentage of sales, all expenses (R&D, S&M and G&A) increased from the year-ago quarter. As a result, the operating margin was 11.3%, flat sequentially but down 130 bps year over year.Pro-forma net income was $94.3 million compared to $80.6 million in the year-ago quarter. The pro-forma estimate in the last quarter excludes restructuring charges, amortization of intangibles and acquisition-related costs and other adjustments on a tax-adjusted basis but includes stock-based compensation. Our pro-forma estimate may not match management's presentation due to the inclusion/exclusion of some items that were not considered by management.On a GAAP basis, the company recorded a net profit (for Trimble shareholders) of $54.5 million (21 cents per share) compared with $54.6 million (21 cents per share) in the previous quarter and a net profit of $53.4 million (21 cents per share) in the comparable prior-year quarter.Inventories were down 6.6% sequentially to $241.5 million. Accounts receivables were $361.6 million, up from $356.3 million in the prior quarter. Days sales outstanding (DSOs) were up from around 56 days to 59 days.Trimble generated $106.4 million of cash from operations. The cash position at quarter-end decreased $7.1 million to $122.0 million in the last quarter. Long-term debt at quarter-end stood at $703.9 million, down from $789.6 million in the first quarter.Management expects fourth-quarter revenues in the range of $560 million-$580 million. Earnings on a GAAP basis are expected in the range of 17 cents-21 cents per share and on a non GAAP basis 35 cents-39 cents per share. The calculation of non-GAAP earnings per share excludes one-time charges such as amortization of intangibles of $42.0 million, anticipated acquisition costs of $3.5 million and stock-based compensation of $9.3 million. The tax rate is expected in the range of 16%-18%, while share count is likely to be 261.5 million.Trimble is seeing much stronger construction markets and a few of its businesses have started witnessing normal seasonality. Additionally, management's initiatives, such as the lowering of the cost structure, strategic acquisitions, product enhancements and international expansion appear to be paying off. The softness in certain areas of the business is related to macro concerns and the nature of new business acquired.However, quite a significant amount of its business, whether directly or indirectly, is dependent on government spending in the U.S., which has become uncertain, at least in the near term. This could weigh on the shares.Trimble has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Other stocks that have been performing well and are worth a look include  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ). All these stocks carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Trimble Beats on Q3 Earnings - Analyst Blog@2013-11-01@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/trimble-beats-on-q3-earnings-analyst-blog-2013-11-01

 (  ), or TI, recently unveiled the industry's first floating switch architecture to simplify offline LED drive design. The floating switch architecture with TI's TPS92411 requires no inductive components for power transfer, thus lowering cost and simplifying design at the same time.LED lamps most commonly feature flyback, buck and boost converters' SMPS technologies, which operate at high frequencies, need inductive components and expensive custom components. The implementation of phase dimming therefore requires multiple iterations. TI's solution is targeted at achieving fade LED lighting within a fixed voltage range and without the use of inductors or isolation transformer.TI's constant endeavor to develop products targeting different applications such as microcontroller, factory automation, smart grid, high-voltage power, and LED lighting and control should help it grow revenue even as it moves away from some traditional markets.In the third quarter of fiscal 2013, TI generated revenues of $3.24 billion that were up both sequentially and year over year.The Analog business grew 10.7% sequentially and 4.8% year over year. All product lines contributed to the sequential increase in analog revenues although power management products saw the strongest increase. TI attributed the year-over-year increase to very strong SVA sales, supported by somewhat higher HPA and power management and flattish HVAL.Currently, Texas Instruments has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

 .'s (  ) first quarter fiscal 2014 earnings (excluding special items but including stock-based compensation expenses) of 41 cents per share, beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents.Revenues in the reported quarter were $585.0 million, down 3.8% sequentially and 6.1% on a year over year basis. Revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $590.0 million.The Consumer end market remained the largest revenue contributor, accounting for approximately 43.0% of revenues compared with 44.0% in the prior quarter. The sequential decline was due to weakness in smartphones. Samsung happens to be Maxim's largest customer.Maxim's expansion into sensors, motion control and other areas of smartphones, tablets and hybrid devices is proving to be beneficial as it secured design wins for its sensor technology. Further, Maxim is also expanding its mobile solutions toward mid-range smartphones as high-end smartphones are witnessing a slowdown globally.Industrial, Maxim's second largest segment, generated 29.0% of revenues, thus remaining flattish sequentially. Although Automotive grew for the third straight quarter, Industrial business declined slightly due to seasonal weakness lower revenue growth in Smart Meter and Medical businesses...Revenues from the Communications end market were 16.0% of revenues compared with 15% in the prior quarter. The sequential increase was driven by robust performance from Networking and Datacom segment.Revenues from the Computing business contributed 12.0% of revenues, flattish sequentially. Revenue from Volterra in the September quarter was $ 36.0 million.Non-GAAP gross margin was 60.7%, down 160 basis points (bps) sequentially and 270 bps year over year. The decline in gross margin was attributed to unfavorable product mix, lower factory utilization and higher inventory reserves.Non-GAAP operating expenses of $207.3 million were down 3.2% sequentially and 2.7% from the year-ago quarter due to stringent cost control.Pro forma net income was $119.5 million compared with $129.5 million in the prior quarter and $139.1 million in the year-ago quarter. Our pro forma calculation excludes restructuring, intangibles amortization, asset impairments and other one-time charges on a tax-adjusted basis but includes stock based compensation charges in the last quarter.Including these items, the company recorded GAAP net income of $103.1 million compared with $119.0 million in the previous quarter and $127.9 million in the year-ago quarter.During the quarter, cash flow from operations was $96.0 million, down from $214.4 million in the prior quarter due to the payment of the annual employee bonus.

 (  ) is set to report first quarter fiscal 2014 results on Oct 23. Last quarter it posted a 2.94% negative surprise. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.In the fourth quarter of 2013, Molex missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 cents or 6.8% as a result of weaker-than-expected revenue and a higher tax rate. Rising costs coupled with stronger growth in low-margin segments made matters worse.Molex expects revenue of $890-$930 million in the first quarter of 2014. The EPS is expected to be 35 to 39 cents a share, assuming a tax rate of 30%-32%.Molex should do well in the longer-term, as its customers introduce new products targeting the BRIC countries, as well as Vietnam and Thailand, where growth is expected to be stronger than in other parts of the world.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Molex will beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.

 's (  ) fourth quarter fiscal 2013 earnings of 44 cents, excluding special items, but including stock-based compensation expenses, missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents or 6.4%.Revenues in the reported quarter were $608.2 million, up 0.5% both sequentially and year over year. Revenues missed management's guidance range of $610-$640 million.The  end market remained the largest revenue contributor, accounting for approximately 44% of total revenue, down 9.7% sequentially but up 2.9% year over year. The sequential decline was due to weakness in smartphones as it was impacted by inventory correction for Samsung's S III, which is also Maxim's largest customer.Maxim is expected to face slowdown due to weakness in demand for Samsung's latest flagship device Galaxy S4 and inventory correction. However, Maxim is making in-roads into several other Samsung offerings.Maxim's expansion into sensors, motion control and other areas of smartphones, tablets and hybrid devices is proving to be beneficial as it secured design wins for its sensor technology. Further, Maxim is also expanding its mobile solutions toward mid-range smartphones as high-end smartphones are witnessing a slowdown globally. , Maxim's second largest segment, generated 29% of revenues, up 16.6% sequentially and 12.1% year over year. Maxim benefited from strong order bookings in the automotive, smart meter and medical end market segments, which was offset by weakness in control and automation segment orders.Currently, Maxim is focusing on ASSP solutions as it provides highly integrated products in select end market segments such as automotive, smart meters and medical. It is also trying to strengthen its position in the general purpose market by providing high-performance analog building block products.Revenues from the  end market were up 7.7% sequentially but down 5.7% year over year to 15% of total revenue. The sequential increase was the result of improvement in the Networking and Datacom segment, which was offset by decline from base stations. Maxim is witnessing strength in sales in cable infrastructure products. Maxim is also witnessing improvements in its fiber optics business due to improvements in the Chinese markets. It also secured a new design win for PON deployments with a major Chinese vendor.Maxim is focusing on delivering next-generation networks with improved coverage, capacity and reduced power consumption. Further, management expects the introduction of highly integrated solutions across its broad range of technologies to help drive network performance going forward.Revenues from the  business were up 0.5% sequentially but fell 19.6% year over year and contributed 12.0% of revenues. The weakness was due to the decline in notebook sales.GAAP gross margin was 61.1%, down 111 basis points (bps) sequentially and 42 bps year over year. The decline in gross margin was related to lower factory utilization and higher inventory reserves.GAAP operating expenses of $220.3 million were down 0.7% sequentially and 6.6% from the year-ago quarter. Sequentially, lower research and development (R&D) expenses as a percentage of sales as well as lower restructuring and asset impairment charges positively impacted the gross margin. As a result, GAAP operating margin decreased 67 bps sequentially but rose 236 bps from the year-ago quarter to 24.8%.Pro forma net income was $129.5 million or a 21.3% net income margin compared with $134.6 million or 22.3% in the previous quarter and $134.7 million or 22.3% of sales in the year-ago quarter. Our pro forma calculation excludes restructuring, intangibles amortization, asset impairments and other one-time charges on a tax-adjusted basis but includes stock based compensation charges in the last quarter.Including these items, the company recorded GAAP net income of $119.0 million or 40 cents per share compared with $128.8 million or 43 cents per share in the previous quarter and $110.6 million or 37 cents per share in the year-ago quarter.Inventories were up 2.8% to $275.6 million.

stimates have been falling for  (  ) after the company reported soft second quarter results and provided weak third quarter guidance. It is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock.Despite the negative earnings momentum, shares of Silicon Labs still trade at a premium valuation. Investors may want to wait for earnings momentum to turn around before establishing a long position.Silicon Labs develops analog-intensive, mixed-signal integrated circuits used in a wide range of applications such as set-top boxes, televisions, and cell phones. The company was founded in 1996 and has a market cap of $1.7 billion.Silicon Labs reported its second quarter results on July 25. Adjusted earnings per share came in at 33 cents, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents.Revenues declined 3% from the previous quarter to $141.5 million, which was also below the consensus at $143.0 million. This decrease was driven by steep declines in some of the company's legacy products.Following the soft Q2 results, management guided Q3 EPS significantly below the consensus at the time. This prompted analysts to revise their estimates significantly lower for both 2013 and 2014, sending the stock to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2013 is now $1.46, down from $1.73 just 30 days ago.

"he semiconductor sector may be worth examining due to signs of firming global growth and the backdrop of favorable expectations for electronic sales. The U.S. manufacturing PMI has posted readings in the mid 50's over the past two months recovering from a recent low of 49.0 in May. At the same time, the August JP Morgan Global Composite Output Index rose 1.2 to 55.0, hitting a two and half year high and suggesting the growth picture is not limited to the U.S.The upswing in economic growth is complemented by a favorable outlook for the sale of technology product. The International Data Corporation recently forecast that global smartphone shipments would rise 40% in 2013 to over 1.0 bln phones. Carrier subsidies and lower cost devices were expected to fuel growth. By 2017, smart phone shipments are projected to hit 1.7 bln units. However, the IDC did cut its outlook for 2013 tablet sales by about 2 mln units to 227.4 mlu. None-the-less, longer term growth is expected to be healthy with worldwide shipments projected at 407 mlu by 2017.The SEMI World Fab Forecast suggests that spending on fab equipment will rise 25% to a record $39.4 bln in 2014. Moreover, spending is expected to rise 30% to 40% in the second half of 2013 compared to the first half of 2013. Strong capital spending will be supported by healthy sales, as Semiconductor revenues are projected to rise 8% in 2014. Aggressive capital spending plans are a vote of confidence in sales and the semiconductor industry's health.The book to bill ratio in North America has been 1.00 or above since January 2013 and points to healthy activity in the semiconductor sector. Moreover, the growth in bookings rose into positive territory on a year over year basis in July and may be pointing to an upswing in demand. Comparisons are easy and the rise in bookings could benefit investor interest in the sector.Looking at the chip sector from another angle, the Commerce Department's unfilled orders for computers and electronics products continues to trend higher and work above the old peak established in 2000. The growth rate is also positive on a year over year basis pointing toward continued expansion. The trend in backlog is a positive sign for future business activity.In order to narrow down the candidates for investment in the semiconductor sector, a handful of companies with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) were examined. The table displays the names, ticker symbols, and valuation measures for each of the companies in the sector. Three valuation measures were chosen to screen the companies for investment value.(click table to enlarge) : This valuation looks at the price relative to the theoretical breakup value of the company. Because of the cyclical nature of earnings in the chip sector, the tangible book value of the company should gradually work higher over time if the company is successful in generating profits. Intangible assets, like goodwill, are taken out of the equation as they have little impact on breakup value. Because of the cyclical nature of the chip sector, earnings can be negative or small at times which makes it more difficult to use a price to earnings ratio to analyze valuation. Companies with low price to tangible book values are deemed as inexpensive or possessing value. s: This measure uses the share price divided by sales per share to determine if a company is cheap or expensive. The semiconductor sector is cyclical and as a result companies can swing from being unprofitable to profitable. The price to sales ratio may be a stronger indicator of company valuation and potential profitability. A low price to sales figure is a sign of cheap valuation. : The PEG ratio measures the price to earnings ratio relative to the growth rate of earnings per share. Semiconductor shares can be fast or slow growing companies at times, so high PE ratios must be viewed in the context of the growth rate in earnings. Looking at the PE ratio by itself may distort the valuation. A PEG ratio of 1.0 suggests that the price to earning s ratio is in line with the growth rate. Values near or below 1.0 would been seen attractive. An investor would not be ""over paying"" for growth.In order to provide a summary or conclusion, each stock was given a position number for each of the valuation measures. A 1 indicates the most attractive valuation or lowest value in the table, while a 9 indicates the most expensive valuation or the highest value in the table. The position numbers were averaged. The lowest average is in theory the most attractive stock, while the highest average would be the least desirable stock.On the basis of the price to tangible book ratio, Triquint (  ) is the cheapest, while Cyprus (  ) is most expensive.Looking at the PEG ratio, MagnaChip (  ) is the most inexpensive, while Supertex (  ) is the most expensive. However, MaxLinear (  ) has a negative or non-meaningful value, which puts it in the highest position of 9.Based on the price to sales ratio, Monliithic Power (  ) is most richly priced, while Magnachip has the lowest ratio and appears most attractive.MagnaChip and Triquint posted the lowest average values at 2.00 and 3.00 respectively. They appear most attractive based on the combination of valuation measures. MagnaChip is priced well below its expected growth rate and less than 1.0 times sales. MagnaChip designs and manufactures analog and mixed signal semiconductor products with applications in the tablet, mobile phone, automotive, and power supply space, to name a few. Triquint makes chip products with applications in the defense/aerospace, networking, and mobile device industries.SanDisk (  ) and Intersil (  ) were also on the cheap side. Their PEG ratios were near or below 1.0 and their price to sales ratios were below 2.50. SanDisk makes flash memory and storage devices, while Intersil is a designer and manufacturer of high performance analog semiconductors. It has exposure to a broad range of telecom, broadcast, solar, energy, industrial, and auto industries.When choosing a stock, earnings may be as important or more important than valuation. Just looking at valuation can lead to a ""value trap"". In a value trap, a stock looks cheap based on measures of valuation, but is priced with a discount for a reason - there is a limited growth outlook.(click table to enlarge)There has not been great movement in earnings estimates in the chip sector - see the table. Monolithic Power has actually shown the greatest upward revision to 2013 and 2014 earnings per share estimates. Its valuation was toward the poor side of the group, and it appears the market is pricing strong growth. Notice that EPS estimates have been increased $.07 to $0.62 this year and $.08 to $.90 next year. It is forecast to post a vibrant 45% increase in earnings growth, but is priced at 5.41 times sales.Magnachip saw its 2013 EPS estimate cut by $.01 for 2013, but the 2014 EPS forecast was raised $.06 to $3.00. It is expected to post a 20% growth rate.

 's (  ) second-quarter 2013 earnings of 35 cents beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.Trimble's second-quarter revenues of $576.3 million were up 3.6% sequentially and 11.3% year over year, within the guided range of $575-$580 million.Strengthening U.S. commercial and residential construction markets helped Trimble's business in the last quarter. Trimble has also made a number of acquisitions in the recent months, which are helping it to build a strong product portfolio and position itself in markets with better growth prospects.The Engineering and Construction (E&C), Field Solutions (TFS), Mobile Solutions (TMS) and Advanced Devices (AD) segments generated 54%, 20%, 20% and 5% of the total revenue, respectively. unit revenues of $313.4 million were up 17.5 % sequentially and 10.3% year over year. The year-over-year increase was attributable to higher sales of heavy and highway and building construction products due to a revival in the residential and commercial market. The most important markets within E&C are heavy and highway, large-scale commercial, smaller-scale commercial and housing as well as survey instruments. Of these, the survey instruments business is currently under pressure due to unfavorable weather and economic uncertainties in Europe, political conditions in China and increased caution regarding government purchases in the U.S.BIM-enabled tools are gaining traction as commercial and residential markets in the U.S. improve slowly. Trimble believes that it will witness strength in these markets at the end of 2013 and in 2014. revenues of $115.9 million were down 21.4% sequentially and 6.1% year over year. Unfavorable weather and government sequestration-related uncertainties impacted revenues in this segment. Government spending has a significant impact on GIS sales. The agricultural business outside North America was up in strong double-digits from the year-ago quarter. But the unusual weather condition delayed the sowing season, impacting sales in North America and also in Europe. revenues of $115.5 million were up 4.9% sequentially and 41.9% from the comparable quarter of 2012. While the core business contributed to growth in the last quarter, most of the increase was the impact of acquisitions specially in the transportation and logistics market.The  segment was down 0.4% sequentially but up 10.0% from the year-ago quarter. The improved performance was on account of stronger sales of military and RFID components and subsystems.North America remains the largest segment for Trimble, with a 56% revenue share. Revenues from the region were up 5.5% sequentially and 13.4% from the year-ago quarter, reflecting continued recovery in the market.Approximately 23% of revenues came from Europe, which was down 0.7% sequentially but up 22.0% from last year.The Asia/Pacific region accounted for 14% of Trimble's revenues in the second quarter, up 3.6% sequentially but down 8.3% year over year.The rest of the world contributed 7% of the total revenue, up 3.6% sequentially and 11.3% year over year.Trimble's gross margin for the quarter was 52.5%, up 88 basis points (bps) sequentially and 75 bps year over year.Trimble reported operating expenses of $237.5 million, up 3.1% sequentially and 13.8% from the year-ago quarter. The operating margin was 11.3%, up 111 bps sequentially but down 12 bps year over year. All expenses (R&D, S&M and G&A) decreased sequentially as a percentage of sales. However, R&D increased significantly from last year although other expenses were flattish.Pro forma net income was $91.8 million or a 15.9% net income margin compared to $90.0 million or 16.2% in the previous quarter and $85.3 million or 16.5% net income margin in the year-ago quarter. The pro forma calculations in the last quarter exclude restructuring charges, amortization of intangibles and acquisition-related costs and other adjustments on a tax-adjusted basis. Our pro forma estimate may not match management's presentation due to the inclusion/exclusion of some items that were not considered by management.On a GAAP basis, the company recorded a net profit (for Trimble shareholders) of $54.6 million (21 cents per share) compared to $49.8 million (19 cents per share) in the previous quarter and a net profit of $53.7 million (21 cents per share) in the comparable prior-year quarter.Inventories were down 0.7% sequentially to $258.7 million. Days sales outstanding (DSOs) were down from around 64 to 56.Trimble generated $172.0 million of cash from operations. The company spent $179.0 million on acquisitions, $39.4 million on capex and did not repurchase any shares in the last quarter. The cash position at quarter-end decreased $14.5 million to $129.1 million. Long-term debt at quarter-end stood at $789.6 million, down from $829.3 million in the first quarter.Management expects third-quarter revenues in the range of $555-$565 million. Earnings on a GAAP basis are expected to be 18 cents-20 cents per share and on a non GAAP basis 36 cents-38 cents per share. The calculation of non-GAAP EPS excludes one-time charges such as amortization of intangibles of $42.0 million and stock-based compensation of $9.3 million. The tax rate is expected to be in the range of 16%-18% while share count is likely to be 261.0 million.Trimble is seeing much stronger construction markets and a few of its businesses have started seeing normal seasonality. Additionally, management initiatives, such as the lowering of the cost structure, strategic acquisitions, product enhancements and international expansion appear to be paying off. The softness in certain areas of the business is related to macro concerns and the nature of new business acquired. However, quite a significant amount of its business, whether directly or indirectly, is dependent on government spending in the U.S., which has become uncertain, at least in the near term. This could weigh on the shares.Trimble has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Cisco Systems (  ),Microsoft (  ) andOracle (  ) are not the only tech companies that pay shareholder dividends.Microchip Technology (  ), a maker of semiconductor products for the automotive, communications and computer and other markets, also does so.The Chandler, Ariz.-based firm has rewarded stockholders with cash dividends since the third quarter of its fiscal 2003. Microchip has long paid dividends before Cisco and Oracle.Microchip has raised its dividends by small increments in just about every quarter since it started paying them. In May, the company lifted its dividend to 35.35 cents a share from 35.3 cents. That marked its 37th hike since the inception of its dividend program.On an annual basis, Microchip pays $1.414 a share. This works out to a yield of about 3.5%, which is higher than the 2.4% in the S&P 500. Microchip has one of the highest yields out of the 16 dividend-paying stocks in the Electronics-Semiconductor Manufacturing group.The chip industry is highly cyclical, and this is reflected in Microchip's earnings history. Profit fell in two of the past five fiscal years. In May, the company reported flat earnings for its fiscal 2013 ended March. In fiscal 2012, profit and revenue dropped 21% and 7%, respectively.But Microchip has had some good news recently. In June , the company raised guidance on profit and revenue for its fiscal Q1 2014, which ended June 30. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see earnings rising 21% to $2.28 a share for the current fiscal year.Microchip is trading near its best levels since May of 2011 after bouncing off its 10-week moving average.

 (  ) reported second-quarter 2013 net loss of 30 cents per share, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 27 cents.Tessera's reported revenues of $46.6 million, up 49.8% sequentially but down 46.6% year over year, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.In the second quarter,  continued to generate the bulk of Tessera's revenues (92%) compared to just 8% for Digital Optics. Intellectual Property revenues were up 67.6 % sequentially but down 19.1% year over year.The  line declined 32.7% sequentially and 56.0% from last year. The sequential decline was due to reduced focus on fixed camera module sales as management shifted focus to core MEMS products.The broadening of its relationship with SK Hynix with new licensing agreements should help revenues in the future. Tessera exited the lens manufacturing business and its internal high-volume camera module assembly in Zhuhai.Tessera entered into a contract with Liteon, one of the leading camera module integrators globally. Liteon ships roughly 20 million camera modules per month to leading phone OEMs. Tessera also received multiple 100,000 unit camera module purchase orders.The GAAP gross margin was 97.8%, up 2334 basis points (bps) sequentially and 145 bps from a year ago. A high gross margin is typical for a technology company that is largely dependent on the licensing model.Tessera's quarterly operating expenses were $68.2 million, down 22.3% from $87.7 million reported in the previous quarter but up 32.2% from $51.5 million in the year-ago quarter. The operating margin improved 15888 bps sequentially to -48.4%, impacted by much lower research and development (R&D) and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses (as a percentage of sales) in the quarter.Tessera's pro forma net loss was $15.9 million or 34.1% of revenues compared to loss of $21.4 million or 68.9% of revenues in the Mar 2013 quarter and a profit of $3.3 million or 10.2% of revenues in the Jun quarter of 2012. Our pro forma calculation excludes restructuring charges and intangibles amortization charges on a tax-adjusted basis but includes stock-based compensation. The pro forma estimates may not match management's presentation due to the inclusion/exclusion of some items that were not considered by management.Net loss on a GAAP basis was $24.0 million (45 cents per share) compared to net loss of $44.6 million (85 cents per share) in the Mar 2013 and profit of $1.2 million (10 cents per share) in the Jun quarter of 2012.Tessera's balance sheet remains strong, despite the $22.2 million reduction in cash and short-term investments to $380.5 million. It has no debt. Capital expenditure in the quarter was $55.9 million, down from the first quarter capex of $68.1 million.Management also paid a special dividend of 30 cents per share during the quarter.Further, management declared a cash dividend of 10 cents per share for the third quarter, payable on Sep 19, 2013 to stockholders of record at the close of business on Aug 29, 2013.For the third quarter of 2013, Tessera expects revenues in the range of $35 million-$38 million. Intellectual Property revenues are expected in the range $30-$33 million whereas Digital Optics revenues are expected to be $5 million. GAAP operating expense is expected between $59- $63 million with a tax rate of 30%.Tessera remains a company with good intellectual property, which it has protected with great difficulty. However, management is keen on shifting to a lower-margin but safer product-oriented model involving camera modules for mobile devices.We believe the company is on the right track as this could reduce if not eliminate the significant litigation expenses it has been incurring. The fact that the target market is fast-growing is an added bonus. We are encouraged by the fact that Samsung and SK Hynix have entered into new licensing agreements with Tessera.Tessera shares currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The sequential increase was led by improved sales into automotive and industrial markets.Book-to-bill ratio was greater than 1 in the quarter.Gross margin for the quarter was 75.2%, up 35 basis points (bps) sequentially and down 23 bps from the comparable quarter of the prior year.Operating expenses of $98.9 million were up 2.0% from the previous quarter's $97.0 million. Operating margin of 44.9% expanded 90 bps sequentially owing to a slight decline in research and development (R&D) as well as selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses (as a percentage of sales).Net income for the quarter was $101.9 million or 31.2% of sales compared to $111.0 million or 35.3% in the previous quarter and $103.3 million or 31.3% of sales in the year-ago quarter. Earnings, including a couple of cents of debt discount amortization, were 44 cents, down from 48 cents in the previous quarter and 45 cents in the June quarter of 2012.Inventories increased 0.8% sequentially, with inventory turns staying relatively flat at 3.7X. Days sales outstanding (DSOs) was flat at 41. The company ended with cash and short-term investments of $1.52 billion, up $70.2 million during the quarter.Management repurchased 944000 shares worth $34.0 million and declared a cash dividend of 26 cents, which will be paid on Aug 28, 2013.Management provided limited guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2014. Revenues are expected to increase 2-5%, much better than normal seasonality. The improved revenue guidance reflects better book-to-bill ratio.Linear's fourth-quarter earnings were helped by a positive mix. Lower-margin segments softened while higher-margin segments grew strongly. The company's business is well-diversified among core markets, such as industrial, automotive and communications infrastructure. However, its computing business has been hit by weakness in the PC and notebook areas.Another positive is the extreme caution that distributors have shown in recent times, which indicates that distributor inventories remain very lean.

"ecently,  (  ), or ""TI,"" narrowed its revenue and earnings expectations for the second quarter of 2013. Following the announcement, itsshare price dropped 1.69% in after-hours trading.The chipmaker now expects sales of $2.99-$3.11 billion versus its previous guidance of $2.93-$3.17 billion. The earnings outlook has also been narrowed to 39-43 cents per share from the previous guidance of 37-45 cents.Though the chipmaker has tightened its guidance range, the midpoint remains unchanged. According to data compiled by Bloomberg, analysts expect sales of $3.06 billion, slightly above the midpoint of management guidance of $3.05 billion. However, earnings expectations of 41 cents were in line with management guidance.Management stated that it is seeing improving demand for its chips from industrial customers with automotive continuing to grow sequentially in the second quarter. TI said that the demand for chips used in tablets and smartphones was better-than-expected but revenues from legacy wireless product lines would decline sequentially in the second quarter as the company continues to wind it down.However, the company admitted that it was still seeing weak demand for the chips used in personal computers and consumer devices such as game consoles.Additionally, the company stated that the inventories remain lean at all customers and particularly at distributors. Also, the company expects to keep capex at about 4% of revenue until the revenue reaches 18 billion a year. We believe that the slight increase in demand will increase the orders for the company, which will have a positive impact on the company's sales.Like other chipmakers, TI has struggled in recent quarters due to a slow global economy and weak consumer spending. To maintain momentum, the company responded in part by cutting costs and trying to expand the use of its application processors on embedded solutions for the automobile, industrial and other non-consumer markets, which have a longer life cycle.Texas Instruments is one of the largest suppliers of analog and digital signal processing (DSP) integrated circuits.

welve stocks will reach their ex-dividend date next Friday, which is significant for investors as the seller of the stock on that date, not the buyer, receives the most recent dividend.A  stock must be bought one day before the ex-dividend date to claim any dividends that have been announced but not yet paid. The company determines on the record date, which usually occurs two days after the ex-dividend date, which shareholders qualify for the dividend. Shareholders listed as holders of record after the record date then receive their dividend on the date of payment established by the company. Those purchasing right before the record date forfeit the dividend and normally get the stock for a reduced amount.It may seem an anachronism in this era of high frequency trading, but the dividend rate rules are in force since it can still take up to three business days for transactions to be credited to and settled in an investor's account.Below are five stocks that schedule May 17 as their ex-dividend date.

e recently downgraded our recommendation on chipmaker  (  ) to Underperform from Neutral, following dismal results for the second quarter of fiscal 2013 and disappointing guidance.Earlier in the month, Microchip reported its second quarter 2013 results, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and represented the second consecutive quarter of estimate miss.Sales continued its downward trend, hurt by weak European markets and uncertain economic environment in the U.S. and China. Margins were also hit by increased acquisition charges.Consequently, all the seven analysts covering the stock reduced their estimates for 2013, leading to a significant decline in earnings estimates.Similarly, for 2014, all the six analysts covering the stock reduced their estimates causing a steep decline in estimates.We do not foresee a significant improvement in business in the near term. The company's guidance was also weak. The weak economic environment coupled with deceleration in worldwide GDP growth continues to plague Microchip. All the three product lines of Microchip - microcontroller, analog and memory along with Standard Microsystems business - are projected to be soft.In addition, high level of inventory also remains a matter of concern. Microchip is reducing wafer starts in the fabs and putting fab personnel on a rotating time-off schedule in order to reduce costs and maintain staff to ramp up production as and when required. This process is expected to impact gross margins till June 2013, by which time management expects to see end of inventory correction and recovery in business.We are also skeptical about the company achieving the targeted synergies from the recent Standard Microsystems acquisition as the weak economic environment continues to adversely impact the business of Standard Microsystems.Although Microchip Technology, which competed with the likes of  (  ), is one of the fastest growing providers of 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers and has one of the highest dividend yields in the industry, the current economic scenario compels us to have a negative stance on the company.Our Underperform recommendation is supported by a Zacks #5 Rank, which translates into a short-term rating of Strong Sell.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Microchip Down to Underperform - Analyst Blog@2012-11-27@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/microchip-down-to-underperform-analyst-blog-2012-11-27

 (  ), an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of a broad range of high-reliability and analog/mixed signal integrated circuits, announced the launch of SmartFusion 2 Starter Kit, a platform for its SmartFusion2 system-on-chip (SoC) field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs).Field programmable gate arrays are semiconductor devices that allow programming/reprogramming even after the device has been installed. This flexibility makes the devices more expensive relative to regular programmable logic devices (PLDs), so their use is relatively restricted.Systems on Chips or SoCs are integrated circuits that incorporate programmable logic, temperature or power sensing and management plus communication functions into a single, low power device.The starter kit comes with a USB and a WiFi adapter, so users can access a SmartFusion2 device via any smartphone web browser or other wireless device.Microsemi's SmartFusion2 SoC FPGA is designed for challenging and critical operations in industrial, defense, aviation, communications and medical applications where accurate, reliable and flawless results are vital. Microsemi has developed its next generation SoC FPGA to meet the requirements of industry manufacturers, which include security, power efficiency and speed at the lowest possible cost for each application.The FPGA market is witnessing growth, as it is proving useful in wireless communications. Further, the vendors are adopting this technology for complex designs. According to a report by TechNavio, the global FPGA market will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.4% from 2011 to 2015, driven by the growing demand for customizable integrated circuits (ICs). Therefore, Microsemi's new products could do quite well.Microsemi's revenue in the first quarter of 2013 was $247.6 million, down 5.9% sequentially but up 2.8% year over year. The defense, aerospace and medical markets largely consume Microsemi's high reliability chips, while the other markets use its analog/mixed signal products.Microsemi has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). However, not all semiconductor companies are in the doldrums. A few that are currently doing well include  (  ),  (  ) and  . While MagnaChip and Silicon carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Microchip carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Microsemi's New Starter Kit - Analyst Blog@2013-02-04@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/microsemis-new-starter-kit-analyst-blog-2013-02-04
 (  ) recently updated its integration activities with Standard Microsystems. Microchip Technology signed a definitive agreement in May 2012 to acquire Standard Microsystems Corporation for $37.00 per share in cash for about $939 million. The net value stood at $766 million, excluding Standard Microsystems cash and investments on its balance sheet of approximately $173 million.The merger was approved in July 2012. Concurrent with the second quarter 2013 earnings release last week, Microchip updated the integration process of Standard Microsystems's operations.Microchip remains on track to ship products of Standard Microsystems from its operational system by January 1, 2013 and converge all business tracks by the first quarter of calendar year 2013.Microchip intends to exploit the assembly and test infrastructure in Thailand to obtain synergies. The company has combined its supply chains and hence has identified a number of opportunities to improve its cost structure.Microchip has already identified a number of synergy opportunities in the area of IP acquisition and development, CAD infrastructure, reference design, joint marketing and joint development.Meanwhile, Microchip continues to maintain its focus on the different product lines to ensure customer focus and continuity as the sales teams work together to cross-train and identify cross-selling opportunities as the integration progresses further.Microchip has combined the distribution networks of the two companies and franchised  (  ), which was distributing Standard Microsystems products, to sell Microchip products as well and franchised Future Electronics, which was the distributor for Microchip products, to sell Standard Microsystems products.Consequently, all the three global distributors,  (  ), Arrow and Future Electronics, are now distributing Microchip's complete product line globally.Standard Microsystems is expected to contribute approximately $87 million to $94 million to the top line in the December quarter. However, the business is expected to be weak due to the global macroeconomic uncertainty.Excluding one-time items, Microchip currently assumes that the acquisition will add approximately 4-5 cents in the December quarter, down from the earlier projection of 6-7 cents due to the soft business conditions. The acquisition will add 5- 6 cents in the March quarter next year and 6-7 cents in the June quarter next year, down by a penny from the earlier projection.Microchip is also undertaking actions to improve the gross margin of the combines business portfolio, lower operating expenses and substantially increase its operating profit.Last week, the company reported its second quarter of 2013, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5 cents.We believe the integration process will be a difficult affair and the company might not be able to achieve the targeted synergies. We continue to maintain a Neutral recommendation on Microchip. However, the near-term weakness enforces us to have a Zacks #5 Rank on Microchip, which translates into a short-term rating of Strong Sell.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Microchip Progresses with Merger - Analyst Blog@2012-11-14@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/microchip-progresses-with-merger-analyst-blog-2012-11-14

 (  ) expects to report net sales of $407 million - $408 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2012.Last month, the company lowered its forecast citing weak economic environment, which continues to adversely impact the company's business as well as the overall semiconductor industry.Microchip had earlier projected sales between $412 million and $430 in the second quarter. However, management stated that the lower-than-anticipated net sales activity in the September quarter was driven primarily by macroeconomic and industry conditions.This apart, Microchip, which competes with companies like  (  ), did not provide any further details.Consequently, earnings estimates for fiscal 2012 have declined significantly in the last few days as most analysts have decreased their estimates based on the company's lowered guidance.Six out of the eight analysts have reduced their estimates in the last 30 days resulting in a 12 cent decline in earnings estimates for fiscal 2013. For the second quarter of fiscal 2013, earnings estimates have gone down by 3 cents.For fiscal 2014, four out of the seven analysts covering the stock lowered their estimates leading to a 14 cent decline in earnings estimates.On August 2, 2012, Microchip acquired Standard MicroSystems Corporation to expand its smart mixed-signal connectivity solutions for embedded applications in markets such as automotive, industrial, computing, consumer and wireless audio.

Including sell-through inventory held by distributors of Roving Networks, net sales of $407.8 million were up 15.7% sequentially and 19.7% year over year.The decline in sales was primarily due to weak European markets and uncertain economic environment in the U.S. and China. The results were in line with the preliminary results provided last month.On August 2, 2012, Microchip acquired Standard Microsystems in order to expand its smart mixed-signal connectivity solutions for embedded applications in markets such as automotive, industrial, computing, consumer and wireless audio.Microchip classified Standard Microsystems revenue into microcontrollers and analog products. Standard Microsystems generated revenues of $72.5 million from August 2 to September 30. 46.8% of this revenue or roughly $33.9 million was microcontroller revenue, and 53.2% or roughly $38.5 million came from analog business.In terms of product mix, revenues from microcontrollers were down 5.5% sequentially.

eading chipmaker  (  ) recently trimmed its net sales guidance to $407 million - $408 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2013, ending September 30, 2012, from $412 million - $430 estimated earlier.The reduction in guidance was primarily due to weak economic environment, which continues to adversely impact the company's business as well as the overall semiconductor industry. Management stated that the lower-than-anticipated net sales activity in the September quarter was driven primarily by macroeconomic and industry conditions.This apart, Microchip, which competes with companies like  (  ), did not provide any further details. On August 2, 2012, Microchip acquired Standard MicroSystems Corporation to expand its smart mixed-signal connectivity solutions for embedded applications in markets such as automotive, industrial, computing, consumer and wireless audio. The integration process is underway and management expects the acquisition to be accretive to the bottom line in the September quarter.Concurrent with the first quarter results, Microchip stated that it expects a contribution of about $65 million to $70 million from Standard MicroSystems Corporation products in the September quarter.Excluding one-time items, Microchip currently assumes that the acquisition will contribute approximately 3 cents a share to the bottom line in the September quarter and 6 cents-7 cents in the December quarter and 7 cents-8 cents in the March quarter next year and 8 cents-9 cents in the June quarter next year.The company's first quarter result missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Earnings estimates for fiscal 2013 have moved up marginally thereafter. Europe continues to be weak with no signs of revival in the coming months. China, which is touted as the company's growth engine, is also slowing down. Hence, a significant improvement in business is not in the cards in the near term.We, therefore, prefer to be on the sidelines and maintain a Neutral recommendation in the long run.

Management stated that the contract would not only broaden the company's product portfolio but also address the need of the customers more efficiently. Triad's exclusive IC technique is expected to provide cheaper and faster IC integration to the company's clients.The company's continuous contract wins and strategic acquisitions are expected to boost its long-term potential. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, revenues from Avnet's Electronics Marketing (EM) segment declined 5.0% from the year-ago quarter to $3.76 billion, albeit within management's guidance range of $3.75 billion to $4.05 billion. However, we can still be optimistic about a better performance from this segment in the upcoming quarters. For the first quarter of fiscal 2013, the segment's sales are likely to be within the management's guidance range of $3.55 billion - $3.85 billion.Avnet faces fierce competition from big players in the semiconductor industry. One of the stalwarts here is  (  ), which has recently inked two distribution agreements with  (  ) and Intematix Corporation. It remains a formidable rival, especially in the climate of proactive technological advances. In addition, there are several other big players such as  (  ) and  (  ) in the industry.The current Zacks Consensus Estimates for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 and for fiscal 2013 are 84 cents and $4.11, representing year-over-year growth of (6.79%) and 1.33%, respectively.

 (  ) has been consistently distributing dividends since fiscal 2003 and currently has a solid 4.0% dividend yield. Shares of this Zacks #2 Rank (Buy) semiconductor manufacturer have been trading higher on the successful completion of the SMSC acquisition, a distribution agreement with Arrow and new product launches.On August 2, Microchip Technology Inc. reported fiscal first quarter 2013 adjusted earnings per share (including stock-based compensation) of 43 cents, 2.3% behind the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 44 cents and 15.7% below the year-ago earnings. Net revenues were down 6.0% year over year to $352.1 million.However, things are expected to improve in the fiscal second quarter 2013 as management sees net sales between $412 million and $430 million, up 17% - 22% sequentially. This includes a contribution of about $65-$70 million from Standard Microsystems Corporation (SMSC) products. EPS is forecasted between 50 cents and 52 cents, an improvement from 48 cents in the fiscal first quarter.Along with the earnings release, Microchip Technology announced the acquisition of Standard Microsystems Corporation (SMSC) for $37 per share in cash. The acquisition expands the company's smart mixed-signal connectivity solutions for embedded applications in markets such as automotive, industrial, computing, consumer and wireless audio. Management expects the acquisition to be accretive to the bottom-line in the fiscal second quarter of 2013.Recently, Microchip entered into a global distribution agreement with Arrow Electronics, Inc., (ARW), whereby the former's broad range of embedded semiconductors and solutions will be offered through Arrow's components portfolio and Nu Horizons Electronics. Also, Microchip came up with four new devices for its serial SRAM portfolio.Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2013 moved up by 1.1% to $1.90 per share. Out of six total estimates, three moved higher and one moved lower in that time. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2014 increased 6.8% to $2.21 per share as all five estimates moved north.These estimates represent year-over-year earnings growth of 10.3% for fiscal 2013 and 16.3% for fiscal 2014.Regular dividend payments have been one the company's most attractive features since it started dividend distribution in 2003. A 5-Year average dividend yield for Microchip Technology stands at 4.5%, while the stock currently yields a solid 4.0% based on the annual dividend rate of $1.40 per share.Microchip Technology is currently trading at a forward P/E of 18.8x compared with 17.0x for the peer group. The company's PEG ratio is currently at 1.67. ROE stands at 17.1% compared with the peer group average of 17.8%.As can be observed from the Price & Consensus chart below; after plummeting in 2009, the company revived and reached a new peak in the mid 2011. Prospects appear bright as the Zacks Consensus Estimates are trending higher for future years.Despite weak fiscal first quarter results, its regular dividend payouts, strategic acquisitions, new product launches and promising outlook make Microchip an attractive investment option.Microchip Technology is headquartered in Chandler, Arizona, and was incorporated in 1989.

 (  ) recently announced the completion of its previously announced acquisition of Standard Microsystems Corporation.Concurrent with the 1Q13 earnings release last week, Microchip updated the integration process of Standard Microsystems's operations.Microchip currently reports in five different product lines -- microcontrollers, analog products, memory products, licensing and others -- while Standard Microsystem's product lines include automotive, wireless audio, USB, industrial networking and computing. Following the merger, Microchip will continue run these product lines as Standard Microsystems's business lines are more end market-based rather than product determined.Management expects that Microchip's microcontrollers, analog and memory products will find market in automotive, wireless audio and computing customers with Standard Microsystems's.Meanwhile, Standard Microsystems's mixed signal/analog products cater to a wide array of markets like automotive, PC, industrial and consumer, and management expects that this business will benefit from Microchip's strategy of expanding in the large horizontal customer base.Microchip will not create any additional product line for Standard Microsystems's products. Revenue from Standard Microsystems will be included with Microchip's microcontroller and analog revenue product line. With the addition of Standard Microsystems's business, Microchip will extend its reach to two additional vertical markets for Microchip namely - wireless audio and computing.On the manufacturing front, Standard Microsystems uses many of the same wafer foundries as Microchip for acquiring some of its wafers. Standard Microsystems subcontracts 100% of its assembly and 90% of its test operations. These packages are different from Microchip's. Hence, Microchip expects that the majority of the assembly and test of the Standard Microsystems products will remain with the subcontractors.However, some of the manufacturing systems such as wafer ordering, assembly and test management, shipments and warehouses are expected to be combined and management also expects shipment of all Standard Microsystems products from Microchip's manufacturing systems to start by January 1, 2013 or earlier.Excluding one-time items, Microchip currently assumes that the acquisition will add approximately 3 cents to the bottom line in the September quarter and 6-7 cents in the December quarter and 7-8 cents in the March quarter next year and 8-9 cents in the June quarter next year.Last week, the company reported its first quarter of 2013, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.We continue to maintain a Neutral recommendation on Microchip.

e recently upgraded our recommendation on  (  ) to Neutral from Underperform.We believe that Microchip was among the first to see the downturn as well as the industry's correction. December quarter results were in line with management expectations as the industry was going into a broad-based demand weakness and inventory correction. Management believes that the December quarter was a bottom quarter and the company should see sequential growth in March quarter.Orders have shown improvement of late and we expect Microchip to benefit from the sector's recovery in recent times.Microchip continues to be the fastest growing provider of 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers. The company is increasingly ramping its touch business beyond handsets and tablets in areas such as automotive industrial applications.Microchip acquired Silicon Storage Technology in 2010, a global leader in embedded flash technology along with licensing of these technologies. The company expects significant operational synergies from its memory business and technology synergies with Microchip's micro controller business.Meanwhile, the company continues to take steps to increase shareholder value as well. Microchip raised its dividend from $0.348 per share in the September quarter to $0.349 per share. The dividend yield of 3.91% is one of the highest in the industry.However, we remain concerned about high-levels of inventory and increasing lead times. Earnings estimates have been on static in the last few days.Nevertheless, based on improved outlook for the coming quarters, we upgrade our recommendation to Neutral from Underperform.

 (  ) intends to restructure its balance sheet in a manner that effectively increases its debt.The chip maker intends to offer $870.0 million notes in two equal parts (A and B), to institutional buyers registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933. There was no information regarding the interest rate applicable on the notes, although the repayment is to be made in 2032.To attract buyers, Micron would also offer an additional $65.0 million over-allotment option (for each part) to the initial purchasers. The decision for conversion into cash or equity will remain with Micron.The raised amount will enable Micron to solidify its cash position, finance its continuing working capital requirements and capital expenditure, facilitate the repayment of its convertible senior notes due in 2013 and also fund potential acquisitions.Earlier this month, the company announced that it will redeem its 4.25% convertible senior notes for an aggregate value of $138.0 million. The notes were due in 2013.While this increases Micron's financial flexibility, its debt burden necessarily increases. However, debt to capitalization ratio at the end of the last-concluded quarter was just 22.3%, up from 20.4% at the beginning of the quarter. Therefore, the debt level remains very comfortable and the financing actions make sense.What could be something of a concern is its liquidity, since Micron's net cash position remains negative despite the $2.09 billion it holds as cash and short-term investments. Particularly so, since growth opportunities look limited in the near term, given the sluggish demand environment.The recent issues in the PC supply chain have significantly impacted demand for components such as memory chips. This even impacted memory prices, leading to lower-than-expected revenue and a gross margin contraction of 640 basis points in the recently concluded second quarter 2012. As a result, Micron posted a loss per share of 23 cents, as against the Zacks Consensus Estimate of loss per share of 18 cents and earnings per share of 7 cents in the year-ago quarter.

Mike Conrad, CEO, Roving Networks, also added a panegyric to the venture by stating that Microchip's wide channel presence and client base would be key growth drivers for Roving Networks in the days forthcoming.The company has retained a proactive stance when it comes to making strategic and profitable acquisitions. In 2010, Microchip acquired Silicon Storage Technology (  ) to enhance its embedded flash technology market.

The stock is basically unchanged at the moment. The tech sector was a dark cloud throughout the session as earnings warnings from Microchip Technology (  ) and Novellus Systems (  ) dragged shares lower. The selling spread to other well-known tech plays in the semiconductor/wireless space, including Texas Instruments (  ), Analog Devices (  ), and Qualcomm (  ). There were some buyers putting some money to work in the gold mining space as gold prices rallied on further talk of quantitative easing. Goldcorp (  ) and Agnico-Eagle Mines (  ) led the way higher.As the government tries to avoid an unlikely debt default by month's end, there are several proposals on the table that could put another dent in people's retirement outlook, especially when it comes to Social Security benefits. The latest target is the current measure used to determine consumer price changes for current benefit calculations. I have always been skeptical of how the traditional CPI (Consumer Price Index) is calculated. For years it has appeared to fall heavily in favor of the government, which currently claims that the true cost of living expense increases are negligible. We all know that is a bunch of hogwash. The latest ploy to combat inflation claims is being called the ""Chained"" Consumer Price Index.What does this made-up statistic mean exactly? The easiest way to explain it is to relate the metric to the price of red meat. Traditionally, CPI was calculated by taking the average cost of red meat one year and measuring it against the cost one year later. Simple, right? Effective? Absolutely. Now let's look at the new method. The ""Chained"" CPI assumes that when the price of red meat goes up, people will simply buy lower-quality cuts of meat (which are, of course, lower-priced). Thus, consumers aren't suffering any ill effects of higher prices at all!Anyone with half a brain can clearly see these new cost measurement metrics are pure nonsense. The government wants us to believe that when the cost of necessities go up, people's costs don't actually go up?We all know the struggles regarding Medicare & Social Security in their present forms. There are still too many individuals who are ill-prepared for the later years. It gets even worse when you hear recent survey results that say three out of four people will file to claim Social Security benefits as soon as they're eligible at age 62. Taking benefits as soon as possible at age 62 locks in payments that are only 75 percent of what they would be at age 66, which is defined as the full retirement age for the current wave of retirees. Delaying benefits at age 66 will raise them by 8 percent a year until age 70, after which benefits do not increase with age. The solution isn't to worry yourself sick about it, but instead start to take action. Start cutting your debt immediately, especially high interest debt (credit cards, etc.). Keep your living expenses in line so you can free up money every month that can be invested into assets that produce income. You need to get the power of compound interest in place to begin generating long-term wealth.Dividend investing allows an investor the opportunity to put compound interest to work for them and it's never too early or too late to become a dividend investor. The key is once you start, you need to stay consistent and make money available to go to work for you. That's it. Don't count on the government or your employer to set you up for a remarkable retirement. Take control and do your own research and create one for yourself. It's great to hear from subscribers that have said they are seeing superb results, and for the first time feel like they have an actual game plan for building and maintaining their wealth. The best thing we can do as individual investors is look for opportunities where we receive great income (dividends) from the companies who can best weather the economic storms ahead. You can count on Dividend.com to be your guide in that arena. As always, you can find all of our current recommendations on our industry-leading  .Our main focus is on quality dividend names with attractive yields, and this should be the focus for all those that are hoping to build income for the long-term.

We do have Apple (  ) reporting after the bell today, and you can bet the name will be a market-mover in tomorrow's session. We'd love to hear Steve Jobs announce that Apple will start using some of the huge cash hoard to start paying a dividend, but we are not holding our breath. .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Market Wrap-Up for Apr.20 (GS, IBM, STT, NTRS, HOG, HAL, more)@2010-04-20@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/market-wrap-apr20-gs-ibm-stt-ntrs-hog-hal-more-2010-04-20
