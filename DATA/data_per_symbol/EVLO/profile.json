We refer to this relationship as the\r\nsmall intestinal axis, or SINTAX(TM). The importance of SINTAX as a therapeutic\r\ntarget has only recently become appreciated and we have built a platform to\r\ndiscover and develop novel oral biologics which target SINTAX. These\r\ntherapeutics have the potential to be effective, safe and affordable medicines\r\nand to transform the treatment of major diseases, driving profound benefits to\r\npatients and society.\r\nOur first product candidates are monoclonal microbials: orally delivered\r\npharmaceutical compositions derived from naturally occurring, specific single\r\nstrains of microbes.&nbsp;&nbsp;... <a href=\"http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/edgar_conv_html%2f2020%2f02%2f14%2f0001694665-20-000017.html#FIS_BUSINESS\" target=\"_blank\">More</a> ...&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n", "KeyExecutives": [{"name": "Andrea Itano", "title": "Senior Vice President & Head-Research"}, {"name": "Balkrishan Gill", "title": "President, Chief Executive Officer, CFO & Director"}, {"name": "Chun Zhang", "title": "Head-Technical Operations"}, {"name": "Duncan McHale", "title": "Chief Medical Officer"}, {"name": "Mark Bodmer", "title": "Chief Scientific Officer, President-R&D"}], "Number_of_employees": ["NO INFO"], "Subsidiaries": ["NO INFO"]}
