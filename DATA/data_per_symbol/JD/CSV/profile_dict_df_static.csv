online retail website in January 2004. He subsequently formed a company in
Beijing and another company in Shanghai and conducted his online retail business
through these two companies. In April 2007, we established a wholly-owned PRC
subsidiary, Beijing Jingdong Century Trade Co., Ltd., or Jingdong Century, and
we acquired certain intellectual property rights from the two companies Mr. Liu
had established earlier, which ceased business operations and were later
liquidated and dissolved.
