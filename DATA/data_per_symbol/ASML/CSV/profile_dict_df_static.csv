It is hard to imagine the world without microchips. They are at the heart of the
devices that we use to work, travel, stay healthy and be entertained - from
smartphones to cars, from MRI scanners to industrial robots. Delivering new
functionalities, better performance and lower cost with each generation,
advances in chips have spawned new products and transformed industries. New
technologies and trends, such as artificial intelligence, 5G connectivity,
augmented reality and the Internet of Things, result in additional demand for
semiconductor chips to generate, transfer, store, analyze and apply vast amounts
of data.
As one of the world's leading manufacturers of chip-making equipment, ASML
provides its customers with tools - hardware, software and services - to create
the patterns that define the electronic circuits on a chip. As we improve our
products, our customers can increase the value and reduce the cost of chips for
their customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;... <a href=""http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/edgar_conv_html%2f2019%2f02%2f06%2f0000937966-19-000007.html#FIS_BUSINESS"" target=""_blank"">More</a> ...&nbsp;&nbsp;
