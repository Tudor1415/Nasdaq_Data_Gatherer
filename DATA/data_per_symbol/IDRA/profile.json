Our\r\ncurrent focus is on our Toll-like receptor, or TLR, agonist, tilsotolimod\r\n(IMO-2125), for oncology. We believe we can develop and commercialize targeted\r\ntherapies on our own. To the extent we seek to develop drug candidates for\r\nbroader disease indications, we have entered into and may explore additional\r\ncollaborative alliances to support development and commercialization.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTLRs are key receptors of the immune system and play a role in innate and\r\nadaptive immunity. As a result, we believe TLRs are potential therapeutic\r\ntargets for the treatment of a broad range of diseases.&nbsp;&nbsp;... <a href=\"http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/edgar_conv_html%2f2020%2f03%2f12%2f0001558370-20-002458.html#FIS_BUSINESS\" target=\"_blank\">More</a> ...&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n", "KeyExecutives": [{"name": "Elizabeth A.
