Afib affects approximately 1% of the\r\npopulation in the United States. It is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, or\r\nirregular heartbeat, encountered in clinical practice and accounts for more\r\ndoctor visits and hospital days than any other cardiac arrhythmia. When a\r\npatient is in Afib, abnormal electrical impulses cause the atria, or upper\r\nchambers of the heart, to fibrillate, or beat rapidly, irregularly, and in an\r\nuncoordinated fashion. As a result, blood in the atria may be in stasis,\r\nincreasing the risk that a blood clot will form and cause a stroke or other\r\nserious complications. In patients with Afib, a significant percentage of those\r\nclots can form inside of the LAA. Symptoms of Afib may include heart\r\npalpitations, dizziness, fatigue and shortness of breath, and these symptoms may\r\nbe debilitating and life threatening in some cases.&nbsp;&nbsp;... <a href=\"http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/edgar_conv_html%2f2020%2f02%2f24%2f0001323885-20-000009.html#FIS_BUSINESS\" target=\"_blank\">More</a> ...&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n", "KeyExecutives": [{"name": "Douglas J.
