We are developing\r\na pipeline of proprietary glycomimetics, which are small molecules that mimic\r\nthe structure of carbohydrates involved in important biological processes, to\r\ninhibit disease-related functions of carbohydrates such as the roles they play\r\nin inflammation, cancer and infection. We believe this represents an innovative\r\napproach to drug discovery to treat a wide range of diseases. We are focusing\r\nour efforts on drug candidates for rare diseases that we believe will qualify\r\nfor orphan drug designation.\r\n\r\nOur proprietary glycomimetics platform is based on our expertise in carbohydrate\r\nchemistry and our understanding of the role carbohydrates play in key biological\r\nprocesses.&nbsp;&nbsp;... <a href=\"http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/edgar_conv_html%2f2020%2f02%2f28%2f0001558370-20-001723.html#FIS_BUSINESS\" target=\"_blank\">More</a> ...&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n", "KeyExecutives": [{"name": "Brian M.
