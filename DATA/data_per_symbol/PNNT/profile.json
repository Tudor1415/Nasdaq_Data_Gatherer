We\r\nseek to create a diversified portfolio that includes first lien secured debt,\r\nsecond lien secured debt, subordinated debt and equity investments by investing\r\napproximately $10 million to $50 million of capital, on average, in the\r\nsecurities of middle-market companies. We expect this investment size to vary\r\nproportionately with the size of our capital base. We use the term\r\n\"middle-market\" to refer to companies with annual revenues between $50 million\r\nand $1 billion.&nbsp;&nbsp;... <a href=\"http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/edgar_conv_html%2f2019%2f11%2f21%2f0001564590-19-044110.html#FIS_BUSINESS\" target=\"_blank\">More</a> ...&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n", "KeyExecutives": [{"name": "Arthur Howard Penn", "title": "Chairman & Chief Executive Officer"}, {"name": "Aviv Efrat", "title": "CFO, Treasurer & Principal Accounting Officer"}], "Number_of_employees": ["NO INFO"], "Subsidiaries": ["NO INFO"]}
