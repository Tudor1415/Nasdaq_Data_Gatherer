Our consolidated subsidiaries produce and sell certain raw\r\nmaterials some of which are used in our substrate manufacturing process and some\r\nof which are sold to other companies.\r\n\r\nOur substrate wafers are used when a typical silicon substrate wafer cannot meet\r\nthe performance requirements of a semiconductor or optoelectronic device. The\r\ndominant substrates used in producing semiconductor chips and other electronic\r\ncircuits are made from silicon. However, certain chips may become too hot or\r\nperform their function too slowly if silicon is used as the base material.&nbsp;&nbsp;... <a href=\"http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/edgar_conv_html%2f2020%2f03%2f12%2f0001558370-20-002561.html#FIS_BUSINESS\" target=\"_blank\">More</a> ...&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n", "KeyExecutives": [{"name": "Gary Lynn Fischer", "title": "Chief Financial Officer, Secretary & VP"}, {"name": "Morris S.
