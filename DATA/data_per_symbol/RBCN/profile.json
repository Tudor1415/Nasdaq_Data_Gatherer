We\r\ndesign, assemble and maintain our own proprietary crystal growth furnaces to\r\ngrow high-purity, low-stress, ultra-low-defect-density sapphire crystals. We use\r\nour proprietary crystal growth technology to produce high-quality sapphire\r\nproducts to meet our customers' exacting specifications. Sapphire is a desirable\r\nmaterial for high-performance applications due to its hardness and strength,\r\ntransparency in the visible and infrared spectrum, thermal conductivity, thermal\r\nshock resistance, abrasion resistance, high melting point and chemical\r\ninertness. As a result, it is ideally suited for extreme environments in a range\r\nof industries where material durability is just as important as optical\r\nclarity. We believe that we continue to have a reputation as one of the highest\r\nquality sapphire producers in the market.&nbsp;&nbsp;... <a href=\"http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/edgar_conv_html%2f2020%2f03%2f23%2f0001213900-20-007034.html#FIS_BUSINESS\" target=\"_blank\">More</a> ...&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n", "KeyExecutives": [{"name": "Mathew Rich", "title": "Chief Financial Officer"}, {"name": "Timothy Edward Brog", "title": "President, CEO, Secretary & Director"}], "Number_of_employees": ["NO INFO"], "Subsidiaries": ["NO INFO"]}
