There is a medical need for new\r\nantibiotics as resistance to existing antibiotics increases. In recognition of\r\nthis need, we developed our product, Xerava (eravacycline), a fully synthetic\r\nfluorocycline, as an intravenous, or IV antibiotic for use as a first-line\r\nempiric monotherapy for the treatment of MDR infections, including MDR\r\nGram-negative infections, such as those found in complicated intra-abdominal\r\ninfections, or cIAI. \r\n\r\nOn August 27, 2018, the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA,\r\napproved Xerava for the treatment of cIAI in adults. Approval of Xerava was\r\nbased on our IGNITE (Investigating Gram-Negative Infections Treated with\r\nEravacycline) phase 3 program.&nbsp;&nbsp;... <a href=\"http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/edgar_conv_html%2f2020%2f03%2f12%2f0001564590-20-010220.html#FIS_BUSINESS\" target=\"_blank\">More</a> ...&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n", "KeyExecutives": [{"name": "Larry Edwards", "title": "President, Chief Executive Officer & Director"}, {"name": "Maria D.
