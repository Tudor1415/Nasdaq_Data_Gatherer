Twirla, our first and only approved\r\nproduct, is a once-weekly prescription combination hormonal contraceptive patch.\r\nTwirla is designed using our proprietary transdermal patch technology, called\r\nSkinfusion\u00ae, designed with properties to optimize patch adhesion and patient\r\nwearability, which may help support compliance while, for the first time in a\r\ncontraceptive patch, delivering a dose of estrogen consistent with commonly\r\nprescribed combined hormonal contraceptives, or CHCs.
