(\"we,\" \"us,\" \"our,\" the \"Company,\" or \"Dicerna\")\r\nis a biopharmaceutical company using ribonucleic acid (\"RNA\") interference\r\n(\"RNAi\") to develop medicines that silence genes that cause or contribute to\r\ndisease. The Company's proprietary GalXC(TM) technology is being applied to develop\r\nwhat we believe will be potent, selective, and safe RNAi therapies to treat\r\ndiseases involving the liver, including rare diseases, chronic liver diseases,\r\ncardiometabolic diseases, and viral infectious diseases. As we further enhance\r\nour GalXC technology, we aim to extend our focus beyond the liver to include\r\ncentral nervous system (\"CNS\") diseases and diseases involving other bodily\r\ntissues. Dicerna aims to treat a broad range of diseases by addressing the\r\nunderlying causes of illness, focusing on target genes where connections between\r\ngene and disease are well understood and documented.&nbsp;&nbsp;... <a href=\"http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/edgar_conv_html%2f2020%2f02%2f28%2f0001399529-20-000009.html#FIS_BUSINESS\" target=\"_blank\">More</a> ...&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n", "KeyExecutives": [{"name": "Bob D.
