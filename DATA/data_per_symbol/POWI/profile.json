Our products are used in power converters that convert electricity\r\nfrom a high-voltage source to the type of power required for a specified\r\ndownstream use. In most cases, this conversion entails, among other functions,\r\nconverting alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC) or vice versa,\r\nreducing or increasing the voltage, and regulating the output voltage and/or\r\ncurrent according to the customer's specifications.\r\nA large percentage of our products are ICs used in AC-DC power supplies, which\r\nconvert the high-voltage AC from a wall outlet to the low-voltage DC required by\r\nmost electronic devices.&nbsp;&nbsp;... <a href=\"http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/edgar_conv_html%2f2020%2f02%2f07%2f0000833640-20-000044.html#FIS_BUSINESS\" target=\"_blank\">More</a> ...&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n", "KeyExecutives": [{"name": "Balu Balakrishnan", "title": "President, Chief Executive Officer & Director"}, {"name": "Radu Barsan", "title": "Vice President-Technology"}, {"name": "Raja G.
