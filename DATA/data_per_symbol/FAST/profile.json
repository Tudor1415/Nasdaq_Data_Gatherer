We opened our first branch in 1967 in Winona, Minnesota, a city with a\r\npopulation today of approximately 27,000. We began with a marketing strategy of\r\nsupplying threaded fasteners to customers in small, medium-sized, and, in\r\nsubsequent years, large cities. Over time, that mandate has expanded to a\r\nbroader range of industrial and construction supplies spanning more than nine\r\nmajor product lines (described later in this document). The large majority of\r\nour transactions are business-to-business, though we also have some walk-in\r\nretail business.&nbsp;&nbsp;... <a href=\"http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/edgar_conv_html%2f2020%2f02%2f06%2f0000815556-20-000011.html#FIS_BUSINESS\" target=\"_blank\">More</a> ...&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n", "KeyExecutives": [{"name": "Daniel Lars Florness", "title": "President, Chief Executive Officer & Director"}, {"name": "Holden Lewis", "title": "Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President"}, {"name": "John L.
