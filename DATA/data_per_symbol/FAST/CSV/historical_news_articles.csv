"In trading on Monday, shares of Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST) touched a new 52-week high of $39.65/share.  That's a 48.45% rise, or $12.94 per share from the 52-week low of $26.71 set back on 03/23/2020.  That means at today's intraday high, any investor who purchased FAST stock any time over the past 52 weeks has an unrealized gain, including company insiders.


Over the past six months, insiders have been scooping up shares, and those bets are now paying off handsomely.  As summarized by the table below, FAST has seen 3 different instances of insiders buying over the trailing six month period.



		
The chart below shows where FAST has traded over the past year, with the 50-day and 200-day moving averages included.

There are 6 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Fastenal Co., but the average is just that — a mathematical average.  There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $26.00.  And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $45.00.  The standard deviation is $6.345.


But the whole reason to look at the average FAST price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes.  And so with FAST crossing above that average target price of $35.33/share, investors in FAST have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $35.33 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

The stock started to move steadily ahead of the broader market following its earnings release on April 14, but the relatively good news in that report shouldn't have been a surprise. Fastenal provided monthly sales updates throughout the first quarter. Each month saw a top-line increase in the low-to-mid single digits. However, the big change came in March, when the company broke out its safety equipment sales. Fasteners, the industrial firm's namesake product line, saw a 10% drop in daily sales in March while safety came in with a 31% increase (""other"" was down 2.5%).

Given the spreading impact of , those are pretty strong results. Investors should be impressed. April sales results, released on May 6, showed a continuation of the trend, with overall sales up a solid 6.7% year over year driven by the safety business' 120% sales gain.However, the decline in the fasteners business steepened, with a year-over-year drop of 22.5% in April, and the ""other"" business also fell more, dipping 10%. This is a decidedly mixed picture. The safety business only represented 18% of the company's sales in 2019. These are uncertain times and it's far from clear how long this one business can sustain Fastenal's overall results. The U.S. is highly likely to fall into a recession, if it isn't already in one, so investors are only just starting to see the impact here -- and it could get worse before it gets better.  So far, Fasental has done a good job of weathering the hit from the economic shutdowns related to COVID-19. Still,  shouldn't expect that trend to continue, as the company's safety business probably isn't large enough to keep offsetting the declines being experienced in other parts of the company. All in, it seems prudent to expect choppy waters ahead as the world, and Fastenal, continues to adjust to the impact of the coronavirus.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"As a supplier to industrial and construction businesses, the performance of   can be a good way to look at the overall health of the manufacturing sector. If its business is strong, it is likely that portends positive results from its customers, as they continue to consume critical items to run their operations. Fastenal's biggest single product line is fasteners, which made up 34.2% of 2019 sales. But it also supplies general and specialty tools, safety items, and electrical, welding, and even janitorial supplies. So its recent earnings report should be a good way to see how the effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may be beginning to influence manufacturing businesses. But digging into the details shows that a strong report from the supplier could be a deceptive signal.Image source: Getty Images.On the surface, the company had a solid earnings report, with 4.4% net sales growth versus last year. The company said growth continues to come from its investment initiatives in industrial vending and Onsite locations, as has been the case in recent years. It noted, however, that the results were also driven by ""increases in certain products later in the quarter related to the coronavirus pandemic."" Its biggest product line, fasteners, actually declined on a daily sales basis versus a year ago. Sales of its safety product line really drove the business, increasing 18.4%. This shift in the business is likely telling as to what we will see from industrial companies this earnings season. Safety supply sales have been expanding for Fastenal, but not quite at the rate seen this quarter. Since 2017, this product line grew by 15.5% annually. So while the recent jump in sales is good for Fastenal, it doesn't bode well for its customers. These are likely not consumables that directly contribute to manufacturers' earnings, but rather ones that are becoming an added necessity -- and added cost -- in today's environment. Fastenal described business activity as ""sluggish"" through the beginning of March. But it said that ""the second half of March saw activity levels weaken significantly in response to societal actions meant to address the coronavirus pandemic."" In illustrating the shift in its customers' businesses, the company reported that in March alone, fastener daily sales actually dropped 10.1%, while safety supply sales increased 31%, mainly from personal protective equipment (PPE).Additionally, sales to the government sector increased 31.1%, with sales to healthcare organizations more than doubling. At the same time, sales to manufacturers and residential construction dropped. Fastenal has been seeing success in recent years from its : vending devices and Onsite locations. Vending provides point-of-use dispensing, storage, and delivery for customers to manage inventory more efficiently and save costs. Onsite locations are another initiative designed to improve the ease of doing business and build more loyalty in customer relationships. Both have shown positive results, with installed vending devices growing 10.4% year over year for the first quarter, to a total of over 92,000 units. Onsite locations grew by 24.8%. However, the company did withdraw its growth guidance for both items for the remainder of the year amid the uncertainty brought by the pandemic.While portions of its business are hurt by the , Fastenal's quarterly results show that the safety supply segment will help carry it forward. Unfortunately, the slowdown in fastener, cutting tool, and other non-safety equipment sales is likely to mean that upcoming quarterly results from its customer base of industrial and construction companies will show material weakness in the manufacturing sector. When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"  is a steady business that pays a 2.9% dividend yield, which isn't bad -- but income-seeking investors can do better. While there are many stocks generating high single-digit or even double-digit dividend yields, investors need to be cautious about investing in these because many of them are declining businesses, have excessive levels of debt, or face other risks that cast doubt on the sustainability of their dividends.The dividend-yielding companies investors should want to own are high-quality, growing businesses that will almost certainly continue their track record of raising dividends every year.

Some of its most well-known properties include Whistler Blackcomb, Breckenridge Ski Resort, Vail Mountain Resort, Park City Resort, Keystone Resort, Beaver Creek Resort, Heavenly Mountain Resort, and Stowe Mountain Resort. The big thing Vail Resorts has going for it is the supply of ski mountains is essentially fixed. New competitors can't make new ski mountains, so there is virtually no risk of new skiing competition. This is also a business where most of the operating costs are fixed, which means the next visitor or skier is very profitable.Image source: Getty Images.Vail has done an incredible job over the years with its . With Epic Pass, avid skiers can ski at any one of Vail's mountains worldwide. That creates a scale advantage other individual mountains can't compete with. The company has raised the price of the Epic Pass at an average rate of 4.5% per year since it launched in 2008. Clearly, the company has shown impressive pricing power, which has helped the stock appreciate by more than five times in the 11 years since then. That's a 15.7% average annual rate, and that doesn't even include the dividends the company has paid over the years.With the stock at $185.03 per share, the company's $1.76 per share quarterly dividend is a 3.8% annual dividend yield.

Lamar owns 157,800 billboards in the U.S. and Canada, as well as 3,500 digital billboards. The attractive thing about this business is outdoor advertising is one of the new ""old school"" advertising methods that isn't being disrupted by digital advertising from 's Google, , , and others. As long as people continue to drive on highways, which seems highly likely to persist indefinitely, people will see Lamar's advertising. That means advertisers will pay Lamar for the ad space. It's even possible that we end up driving more in the long-term if we're driven around by autonomous cars.Lamar is also converting some of its static billboards to digital billboards. These digital billboards rotate the advertisement every so often and do so without the need for someone to visit the board and change the copy. That reduces operating costs. Digital boards also generate more revenue because there is more demand for digital spots that can be changed on the fly and don't require long-term advertising commitments. In addition, a broader variety of advertising partners finds that sort of medium useful. For example, a restaurant that's advertising a dinner special for that night only or a retailer off the next exit that's advertising a one-day sale.Lamar has grown its revenue and operating profit at 5.3% and 6.2% average annual rates over the last five years. The annual dividend has been raised every year since 2014 when Lamar converted to a real estate investment trust (REIT) for federal income tax purposes.

"The two big questions stock investors have right now is how deep will the economic contraction be in the second quarter, and what will the shape of the recovery be like in future quarters? While those answers won't be definitively decided by any data being released in May, investors can still get very useful information on trends and also see which sectors might come back stronger than others.In this context, multi-industry industrial  , heavy equipment machinery company  , and industrial supply company   are the ones to watch. Here's why and what to look for with these three industrial stocks.The  3M has withdrawn its full-year guidance on the back of the uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, on the company's recent , CEO Mike Roman said, ""Starting in May, we will provide monthly updates on how our business is performing and we will continue to provide this until we are better able to forecast future performance."" In addition, CFO Nick Gangestad went on to outline that management would provide insights on trends by ""business and geography."" The economy is headed for a period of significant volatility. Image source: Getty Images3M offers a wide array of products that straddle end markets as diverse as automotive (aftermarket and original equipment), personal safety, industrial adhesives, electronics, medical consumables, dental care, and home improvement. As such, its management has a pretty good handle on trends in the economy. Moreover, the breakout by industry and geography will be very useful to see which sectors/stocks might bounce back quickest.In particular, it will be interesting to see if China -- the country in which the COVID-19 pandemic originated and one of the earliest to start to normalize economic activity after the worst of the disease had run its course -- will have a sustained recovery, particularly in its automotive sector. Segment Q1 2020 RevenueQ1 2019 Revenue3M Business Groups With Sales Above $250 Million in Q1 2020 (Above $500 Million in Bold)Safety and industrial$2.94 billion$2.96 billionAbrasives, automotive aftermarket, closure and masking systems, electrical materials,, Transportation and electronics$2.24 billion$2.36 billionAdvanced materials, automotive and aerospace solutions, commercial solutions, Health care$2.10 billion $1.74 billionHealth information systems, Consumer$1.26 billion$1.20 billionHome care, Data source: 3M presentations.The heavy equipment manufacture is releasing its three-month rolling retail sales data every month, as management believes it's the best way to monitor trends in its business. The chart below demonstrates that a picture really can be worth a thousand words. Caterpillar's sales were in a downtrend even before the coronavirus pandemic came, and hopes of a second-half recovery have obviously been dashed by fears of a recession.Data source: Caterpillar presentations.The overall data is obviously going to get worse in the coming months, but the extent and length of the drop is unknown. In addition, some of the granular-level detail will be fascinating. For example, given that China is normalizing its economy first, it's reasonable to expect relatively stronger numbers coming out of the Asia/Pacific region for Caterpillar. Of course, there's no guarantee that Europe and North America will follow the trend, but it's still worth following closely as a leading indicator.The chart below shows how Caterpillar's retail sales in Asia/Pacific fell off a cliff in early 2020 when the outbreak first occurred in China. However, some stabilization will likely occur in Asia/Pacific at least in the coming months, even as the numbers from Europe and North America start to worsen when April is included. Data source: Caterpillar presentations.Industrial supply companies always give great color on the economy, because their sales are the first to get hit in a slowdown and the first to recover when growth returns. As such, the monthly sales data from Fastenal -- set to be released on May 14 -- will be indicative of just how bad manufacturing conditions will be in the second quarter.The numbers in March were bad, but they are likely to get even worse in April. As incredible as this may sound, the March numbers might actually contain some pull-forward in demand as manufacturers may have stocked up in fear of not being able to source supplies later on -- at least that's what fellow industrial supply company   . In common with Fastenal, MSC's sales are heavily tied to the operational activity of its manufacturing customers.  Data source: Fastenal presentations.

"The  formula at  ranks a coverage universe of thousands of dividend stocks, according to a proprietary formula designed to identify those stocks that combine two important characteristics — strong fundamentals and a valuation that looks inexpensive.  Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST) presently has an above average rank, in the top 50% of the coverage universe, which suggests it is among the top most ""interesting"" ideas that merit further research by investors.


But making Fastenal Co. an even more interesting and timely stock to look at, is the fact that in trading on Friday, shares of FAST entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $33.491 per share.  We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100.  A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.  

In the case of Fastenal Co., the RSI reading has hit 29.8 — by comparison, the universe of dividend stocks covered by  currently has an average RSI of 24.1.  A falling stock price — all else being equal — creates a better opportunity for dividend investors to capture a higher yield.  Indeed, FAST's recent annualized dividend of 1/share (currently paid in quarterly installments) works out to an annual yield of 2.86% based upon the recent $35.02 share price.


A bullish investor could look at FAST's 29.8 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.  Among the fundamental datapoints dividend investors should investigate to decide if they are bullish on FAST is its dividend history.  

In general, dividends are not always predictable; but, looking at the history chart below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue.

"
There are 7 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Fastenal Co., but the average is just that — a mathematical average.  There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $30.00.  And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $39.00.  The standard deviation is $3.728.


But the whole reason to look at the average FAST price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes.  And so with FAST crossing above that average target price of $35.28/share, investors in FAST have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $35.28 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

 A year ago, I wrote an article about  that had announced a dividend increase in the first 64 days of 2019.ÃÂ To make the exercise even more useful, I tried to diversify my picks by selecting one stock from seven different sectors. HereÃ¢ÂÂs how theyÃ¢ÂÂve performed since then.ÃÂ 1-Year Total Return Ã¢ÂÂ 7 Dividend Stocks to BuyWhile the performance of the seven dividend stocks managed to beat the Morningstar US Market Total Return Index by 480 basis points over the past year, I think I can do better. That said, I wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt have a problem if you went with the seven stocks listed above. TheyÃ¢ÂÂre all outstanding long-term holds.ÃÂ However, if the name of the game is outperforming the benchmark by more than 480 basis points over the next year, here are 10 stocks that I believe have what it takes to deliver superior performance.ÃÂ Changing things up a little, IÃ¢ÂÂm going with stocks that have at least a 2% dividend yield, are up at least 10% year to date, and have market caps greater than $2 billion. Like last time, I tried to include picks from as many different sectors as possible.ÃÂ 	Dividend Yield: 3.86%First up, weÃ¢ÂÂve got Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile (NYSE:), a basic materials stock thatÃ¢ÂÂs based in South America. SQM has a market cap of $3.8 billion, is yielding 3.86%, and has a year to date  through Feb. 18.What does it do?ÃÂ SQM is a producer of chemicals, including lithium, potassium fertilizer, iodine,ÃÂ  specialty plant nutrition, and industrial chemicals. Lithium accounts for , followed by specialty plant nutrition at 24%, iodine at 22%, potassium at 8%, and industrial chemicals at 3%.Lithium is used in the production of electric vehicle batteries. Quimica is the worldÃ¢ÂÂs second-largest producer with 17%  share. In November, SQM reported  due to lower lithium prices combined with global oversupply issues.ÃÂ As Quimica works to capture greater market share in China, investors should continue to expect significant volatility in its stock price. Long-term, I believe itÃ¢ÂÂs a winner.ÃÂ 	Dividend Yield: 2.27%Unless youÃ¢ÂÂve been living in a cave, youÃ¢ÂÂve probably heard of Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:), the consumer goods company behind Colgate toothpaste, Palmolive dish soap, and HillÃ¢ÂÂs pet food. Colgate-Palmolive has a market cap of $64.9 billion, itÃ¢ÂÂs yielding 2.27%, and has a year to date  through Feb. 18.If youÃ¢ÂÂve owned CL stock in the past five years, youÃ¢ÂÂve likely been disappointed as it generated an annualized total return of 3.6%, 576 basis points worse than its peers in household and personal products. It has done even worse relative to the Morningstar US Market Total Return Index, which generated an 11.8% annualized total return over the same period.ÃÂ The move up so far in 2020 is an indication that CL stock is ready to revert to the mean.ÃÂ On Jan. 23, Colgate announced that it had  one of the fastest-growing premium oral care brands in the U.S. Just days later, Hello introduced a  that includes a variety of kinds of toothpaste and lip balms.If Colgate is going to get out of its funk, innovative brands like Hello Products are a step in the right direction. At  I wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt categorize CL as cheap, but I would say itÃ¢ÂÂs not expensive either.ÃÂ Long-term, this looks like the beginning of a long leg up to $100.ÃÂ ÃÂ ÃÂ ÃÂ ÃÂ 	Dividend Yield: 3.17%Unless you work on Wall Street, thereÃ¢ÂÂs a good chance you might confuse Blackstone Group (NYSE:), an alternative asset manager with more than  with BlackRock, the investment manager I mentioned earlier in this article.Blackstone has a market cap of $72.8 billion, itÃ¢ÂÂs yielding 3.1%, and has a year to date  through Feb. 18. Over the past five years, itÃ¢ÂÂs got an annualized total return of 14.5%, 268 basis points better than the markets as a whole.ÃÂ  of Brookfield Asset Management (NYSE:), another alternative asset manager  for several years. I donÃ¢ÂÂt know as much about Blackstone as I do BAM, but CEO and co-founder Stephen Schwarzman is ÃÂ ItÃ¢ÂÂs appropriate that Brookfield CEO Bruce Flatt is equally bright. It makes for a wonderful competition. You canÃ¢ÂÂt go wrong owning either of these stocks.ÃÂ ÃÂ ÃÂ 	Dividend Yield: 1.9%Selecting Danish health care company Novo Nordisk (NYSE:) was made easier by the fact NVO stock was the only health care company on my screen that was up more than 10% year to date.ÃÂ Novo Nordisk has a market cap of $119.8 billion, itÃ¢ÂÂs yielding 1.9%, and has a year to date  through Feb. 18. Over the past three years, itÃ¢ÂÂs got an annualized total return of 24.1%, almost 12 percentage points greater than its biotechnology peers.ÃÂ The company reported its fiscal 2019 results on Feb. 5. They were extremely positive, with  on the year with revenues increasing by 6% year over year to 122 billion Danish kroner, which is equivalent to $13.4 billion in U.S. dollars.ÃÂ Novo NordiskÃ¢ÂÂs revenues remained stagnant in the three years between 2016 and 2018. However, in 2019, its business took off, with sales growing 9% overall. A significant contributor to that growth was its international operations outside the U.S. Specifically, its AAMEO region (Africa, Asia, Middle East and Oceania), saw sales increase by 16% in 2019, an important number considering it accounts for 23% of sales outside the U.S.In 2019, three drugs in its Diabetes and Obesity care segment: NovoRapid, Victoza, and Ozempic, accounted for 50% of the segmentÃ¢ÂÂs overall revenue and 42% of the companyÃ¢ÂÂs total sales.ÃÂ Somehow, given the diet of most Americans, I donÃ¢ÂÂt see the demand for these drugs going away anytime soon.ÃÂ 	Dividend Yield: 2.25%Lockheed Martin (NYSE:) is one of only three companies that made the cut from the industrial goods sector. I went with LMT for a couple of reasons, which I will get to in a moment.ÃÂ LMT is the largest defense contractor in the world. ItÃ¢ÂÂs probably best known for the F-35 fighter jet. It has a market cap of $120 billion, itÃ¢ÂÂs yielding 2.25%, and has a year to date  through Feb. 18.The first reason I like Lockheed Martin is that a woman runs it. Marilyn Hewson, its CEO, was named  in 2018 by Chief Executive magazine. Go through a list of past winners and youÃ¢ÂÂll see that the long-time employee is in good company.ÃÂ When  I just had to recommend its stock. ItÃ¢ÂÂs up almost 50% since then. Defense contractors donÃ¢ÂÂt have it as easy as some might think. Hewson makes the job look easy.ÃÂ The second reason I like LMT stock is that itÃ¢ÂÂs a  for Bombardier (OTCMKTS:) now that the Quebec aerospace company has sold off everything but its business jet program that includes the Learjet, Challenger, and Global brands.ÃÂ Bombardier is better off within a larger company; Lockheed could use a civil aviation business. Like the merger many years ago between Lockheed and Martin Marietta, this one would be a winner. ÃÂ ÃÂ ÃÂ ÃÂ  	Dividend Yield: 2.9%For most investors, Darden Restaurants (NYSE:) is probably best known as the owner of Olive Garden. When I think of DRI, I think of Yardhouse, the companyÃ¢ÂÂs food and craft beer concept, that has  across the U.S. However, thereÃ¢ÂÂs no question that Olive Garden is the biggest brand in the Darden stable with 867 locations as of Q2 2020.ÃÂ ÃÂ ÃÂ Darden has a market cap of $14.6 billion, itÃ¢ÂÂs yielding 2.9%, and has a year to date  through Feb. 18.It has been a while since IÃ¢ÂÂve considered DRI stock. The last time I wrote about the company in 2013, it still owned Red Lobster, which has since been sold off. At the time, CEO Clarence Otis was  It needed a new direction.Current CEO Gene Lee has been the chief executive since October 2014, when the former COO was put in charge after  On an interim basis at first, Lee became the  in February 2015.ÃÂ  Since Lee has taken the reins, DRI stock is up 116% over the past five years. He remains a firm hand in a very competitive industry.ÃÂ ÃÂ ÃÂ 	Dividend Yield: 2.4%It has been three months since  NortonLifeLock (NASDAQ:), after Broadcom (NASDAQ:) acquired SymantecÃ¢ÂÂs enterprise business for $10.7 billion.NortonLifeLock has a market cap of $12.5 billion, itÃ¢ÂÂs yielding 2.4%, and has a year to date  through Feb. 18.ÃÂ WhatÃ¢ÂÂs left after the sale is the Norton and LifeLock consumer cyber safety brands. On its first day of trading, UBS analyst Fatima Boolani gave NLOK stock a Ã¢ÂÂbuyÃ¢ÂÂ rating and a  Boolani believes that NLOK has an excellent chance to be a reliable providing investors with a healthy dividend.ItÃ¢ÂÂs important to note that most of the gains in 2020 are due to the  paid on Jan. 31 as part of the companyÃ¢ÂÂs pledge to return more than 100% of the after-tax proceeds from the sale of its enterprise business.ÃÂ In fiscal 2020, NortonLifeLock is likely to finish the year with free cash flow approaching $1 billion. Based on its current market cap, itÃ¢ÂÂs got an FCF yield of 8%, which many consider being value territory.ÃÂ Add in the healthy dividend and NLOK could be the best of the bunch value-wise.ÃÂ 	Dividend Yield: 3%ItÃ¢ÂÂs not often that you see a utility company make a list of stocks to buy for capital appreciation, but I did say I would include as many sectors as possible. Being from Canada, I take special pride in Algonquin Power & Utilities (NYSE:).The company has a market cap of $8.7 billion, itÃ¢ÂÂs yielding 3%, and has a year to date  through Feb. 18. Over the past five years, itÃ¢ÂÂs got an annualized total return of 18%.ÃÂ Vivian Lewis, the editor of the Global Investing newsletter, recently called AQN her  It was her top pick for conservative investors in 2019.ÃÂ As Lewis points out, Algonquin plans to be generating 75% of its electricity from renewable power no later than 2023. Selling to more than 750,000 customers in the U.S. and Canada, it is an excellent play on climate change.ÃÂ ThereÃ¢ÂÂs no question AQN is a winner. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs why in November 2018, I called it one of the  Since then, itÃ¢ÂÂs up 58%, an annualized rate of return of 48%.ÃÂ If all utilities were like that, there wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt be anything else in my portfolio.ÃÂ ÃÂ 	Dividend Yield: 2.6%Now that IÃ¢ÂÂve gotten through all the sectors with at least one pick each, IÃ¢ÂÂve gone back to one of two stocks from last yearÃ¢ÂÂs recommendations mentioned earlier.ÃÂ BlackRock has a market cap of $86.8 billion, itÃ¢ÂÂs yielding 2.6%, and has a year to date  through Feb. 18.ÃÂ As I highlighted earlier, BLK stock has a great return over the past year, up 27.8%. It even has a pretty good three-year annualized total return of 15.6%, 99 basis points higher than the markets as a whole. ItÃ¢ÂÂs not nearly as good for the five- and 10-year periods.ÃÂ Back in January 2019, I recommended BLK stock, suggesting that its  (iShares accounted for just 38% of sales; in 2019, that was down to ) make it an excellent investment in good times and bad.ÃÂ CEO Larry Fink remains  However, I say that with reverence. Very few CEOs of large companies have the stomach for honest conversations. To shareholdersÃ¢ÂÂ benefit, Fink does. As long as Fink is CEO, BLK remains a fantastic dividend stock to own for the long haul.ÃÂ 	Dividend Yield: 3.86%Last but not least, I ave gone back to one of Brookfield Asset ManagementÃ¢ÂÂs spinoffs. It owns  and went public in ÃÂ Brookfield Infrastructure has a market cap of $22.7 billion, itÃ¢ÂÂs yielding almost 3.9%, and has a year to date  through Feb. 18. Over the past five years, itÃ¢ÂÂs got an annualized total return of 16.5%, 604 basis points higher than its peers in the utility sector.On Dec. 23, the company announced that it had acquired Cincinnati Bell (NYSE:) for , including the assumption of debt. BrookfieldÃ¢ÂÂs management wanted Cincinnati Bell because its footprint of more 1.3 million customers in Ohio, Kentucky, and Hawaii makes an excellent addition to its data infrastructure portfolio.ÃÂ While some might consider Cincinnati Bell long past its prime, the company is halfway to upgrading its entire network. With BrookfieldÃ¢ÂÂs help, it will get the other 50% completed sooner rather than later.ÃÂ Brookfield remains an excellent judge of value. In 3-5 years, shareholders will be happy it paid a 36% premium to acquire CBBÃ¢ÂÂs stock.ÃÂ Will Ashworth has written about investments full-time since 2008.

"In trading on Thursday, shares of Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST) touched a new 52-week high of $38.24/share.  That's a 34.74% rise, or $9.86 per share from the 52-week low of $28.38 set back on 08/07/2019.  That means at today's intraday high, any investor who purchased FAST stock any time over the past 52 weeks has an unrealized gain, including company insiders.


Over the past six months, insiders have been scooping up shares, and those bets are now paying off handsomely.  As summarized by the table below, FAST has seen 2 different instances of insiders buying over the trailing six month period.



		
The chart below shows where FAST has traded over the past year, with the 50-day and 200-day moving averages included.


   
In afternoon trading on Thursday, FAST shares are changing hands at $37.67/share, slightly below the new 52-week high.

"The most recent short interest data was recently released for the 04/15/2019 settlement date, and Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST) is the #35 most shorted of the S&P 500 components, based on 9.44 ""days to cover.""  There are a number of ways to look at short data, but one metric that we find particularly useful is the ""days to cover"" because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares typically traded.  The number of shares short is then divided by the average daily volume, to express the total number of trading days it would take to close out all of the open short positions if every share traded represented a short position being closed.  



In the case of Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST), the total short interest at the 04/15/2019 settlement date was 22,224,359 shares, which compares to the average daily trading volume of just 2,354,139 shares, for a ""days to cover"" ratio of 9.44.  


When short sellers eventually cover their positions, by definition there must be buying activity because a share that is currently sold short must be purchased to be covered.  At the present levels of short interest, if from this point forward every single FAST share traded represented a short position being closed, then at the average daily volume of 2,354,139 shares it would only be during the 10th trading day that every short position would be closed.  


So it would stand to reason that should some unexpectedly good news come out, and short sellers did not have 10 days of patience but instead wanted to cover their short positions very suddenly, that situation could result in sending the stock higher until the higher price produces enough sellers to generate the necessary volume to close out those positions quickly.


Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST) has something relatively rare for a stock with this much short interest, that being insiders taking the other side of the trade.  Looking back over the trailing six month period, FAST has seen 2 different instances of insider buying, as summarized by the table below:


		Below is a chart showing the ""days to cover"" for FAST over time:


   
And looking at the chart below, FAST's low point in its 52 week range is $28.38 per share, with $37.94 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $35.93.

"As the saying goes, there are many possible reasons for an insider to sell a stock, but only one reason to buy -- they expect to make money.  So let's look at two noteworthy recent insider buys.

At Fastenal (FAST), a filing with the SEC revealed that on Thursday, Director Darren R. Jackson purchased 18,000 shares of FAST, at a cost of $35.57 each, for a total investment of $640,231.  Bargain hunters can pick up FAST even cheaper than Jackson did, with shares changing hands as low as $34.63 in trading on Monday -- that's 2.6% below Jackson's purchase price.  Fastenal is trading off about 1.6% on the day Monday.  This buy marks the first one filed by Jackson in the past year.

And also on Thursday, Chief Business Officer Mark C. Wiggins bought $20,102 worth of TRACON Pharmaceuticals (TCON), buying 5,000 shares at a cost of $4.02 each.  TRACON Pharmaceuticals is trading off about 3.3% on the day Monday.

"Looking at the universe of stocks we cover at , on 1/30/20, Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST), Signet Jewelers Ltd (Symbol: SIG), and Alliant Energy Corp (Symbol: LNT) will all trade ex-dividend for their respective upcoming dividends.  Fastenal Co. will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.25 on 2/28/20, Signet Jewelers Ltd will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.37 on 2/28/20, and Alliant Energy Corp will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.38 on 2/18/20.  

As a percentage of FAST's recent stock price of $35.35, this dividend works out to approximately 0.71%, so look for shares of Fastenal Co. to trade 0.71% lower — all else being equal — when FAST shares open for trading on 1/30/20.  Similarly, investors should look for SIG to open 1.42% lower in price and for LNT to open 0.64% lower, all else being equal.





Below are dividend history charts for FAST, SIG, and LNT, showing historical dividends prior to the most recent ones declared.

Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST):
   Signet Jewelers Ltd (Symbol: SIG):Alliant Energy Corp (Symbol: LNT):
In general, dividends are not always predictable, following the ups and downs of company profits over time.  Therefore, a good first due diligence step in forming an expectation of annual yield going forward, is looking at the history above, for a sense of stability over time.  This can help in judging whether the most recent dividends from these companies are likely to continue.  If they do continue, the current estimated yields on annualized basis would be 2.83% for Fastenal Co., 5.69% for Signet Jewelers Ltd, and 2.57% for Alliant Energy Corp.

"There are two really big questions that investors in the industrial sector are asking themselves right now, and they both relate to the second half of 2020. The first is whether there's any validity in the thesis that there will be a recovery in the industrial economy in the second half. That idea has been tossed out there by several management teams so far this year. On a related note, the second question is when exactly the   737 MAX will return to service (RTS). Let's take a look at what these questions mean and what stocks you should follow to try and find the answers.Image source: Getty Images.If you want an early read on the industrial economy, then it makes sense to keep an eye on industrial supply companies like   and the outlook statements made by highly cyclical companies like motion and control company  . Fortunately, both have given some relatively good news recently.Before getting into the details, it would be remiss not to mention that the  received a boost recently, with the latest data from the purchasing manager index (PMI) data from the Institute for Supply Management -- the most widely followed data set in the industry. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the industrial economy. As you can see below, the January reading was the first above 50 since July 2019, and the new orders component came in positive too. data by Turning back to Fastenal, it appears that its January sales came in better than its CEO had expected they would be just a few weeks ago. On the first-quarter  in the middle of January, CEO Daniel Florness broke his habit of not giving commentary on trading within the month by saying: ""I expect at this point, January will feel a lot like December. I don't know, if that means it will be 1%, but I think, it's going to feel like December did.""Presumably, he's talking about the 1% improvement in average daily sales growth reported in December -- a figure that would turn out to be bettered by a 3.6% rise in year over year average daily sales growth in January. Moreover, there was a nice uptick in both its manufacturing and construction end-market sales.Data source: Fastenal presentations. Year-over-year growth.Finally, its average daily sales growth rate (October to January period) was only slightly worse than its benchmark historical five-year average in spite of two relatively weak months in October and December.Data source: Fastenal. **For January, Fastenal reports October to January data. All other months are sequential.In November some commentators  by Parker-Hannifin's guidance and the fact that it implied a bottoming of its sales trend ""somewhere between Q2 and Q3 in this guidance"" according to CEO Thomas Williams.Unfortunately, the grounding of the 737 MAX and the production slowdown by Boeing has caused Parker-Hannifin to cut its guidance for the second half of 2020, but on the second-quarter  Williams maintained that ""-- in our guidance, we're reflecting really Q3 is kind of our bottom from what we see at this point."" Since Parker-Hannifin's guidance doesn't include any additional sales from the 737 MAX, there's arguably some upside potential from a timely 737 MAX RTS.All told, the coming third quarter is likely to be another difficult one for Parker-Hannifin, but the outlook should be for a relative improvement in its fourth quarter -- a quarter which will coincide with most other companies' third quarter of 2020.The airplane is intended to be, alongside the Airbus A320 NEO, the workhorse of the commercial aviation industry. It's such an integral part of the U.S. industrial economy that companies as diverse as paintings and coatings company , industrial supplier  and the usual suspects such as  like  and  have all had to adjust their near-term outlooks because of its ongoing grounding.Moreover, there's also the risk that a protracted delay in the RTS could cause some supply chain gremlins to creep in and significantly affect the industrial sector. For example, jobs are also being lost in an industry where skills aren't easy to come by.Boeing expects the plane will be ungrounded in midyear 2020, and industrial companies are keying off that outlook, but the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is believed to be open to a RTS sooner than Boeing's estimate. Such an event would provide a much-needed boost to the U.S. economy. It's definitely a watch item.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, , has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Boeing wasn't one of them!

"Mid-cap stocks could be the Goldilocks segment of the market for many investors: bigger than the sometimes risky, often volatile small-cap end of the pool, but smaller and more agile than the more lethargic large-cap end.While mid-cap stocks between $2 billion and $10 billion can certainly be both risky and slow-growing, they have often established themselves enough to generate sufficient sales and profits that put them on a firmer foundation. Fortunately, there are still opportunities to grab from growth ahead of them. The three mid-caps below give investors a chance to strike the right balance between risk and reward.Image source: Getty Images.The first year of legal marijuana in Canada has been a  for   and other pot producers, but the advent of Cannabis 2.0 up north, or the legalization of cannabis derivatives products, has many expecting year two to be less of a buzzkill.Canopy Growth is arguably positioned to capitalize on this next phase of legalization because it has one of the broadest suites of products ready for the market. Included in its portfolio are several lines of CBD- and THC-infused beverages, cannabis-infused chocolate, and even vape pens and cartridges.The market saw fit to take down the entire segment this year as the rollout of  was met with bureaucratic snafus because of an overwhelming crush of applications. The delays have hurt sales for producers, and some companies saw their stocks lose three quarters of their value or more.Canopy didn't escape the carnage, and shares are down 62% from their 52-week high. However, many view Canopy as the strongest of the players, and with financial backing from , it has a better chance than many of bouncing back sharply in 2020.Shares of industrial maintenance and supply organization   have traded in a fairly narrow range for the better part of the year as the market remains concerned about slowing growth in a cyclical business. Whereas it benefits from  already under its belt, industrial activity is decelerating, according to the Institute for Supply Management, whose national factory activity index dipped again in November to 48.1. A reading below 50 indicates contraction in the manufacturing sector.However, sales at HD Supply are still growing despite the market volatility, and business sentiment will improve now that the first stage of a trade agreement with China is being negotiated. The big news, of course, is that HD Supply plans to split itself into two separate publicly traded companies, one focusing on facilities maintenance and the other, construction and industrial. The former will be renamed HD Supply Facilities Maintenance, with approximately $3 billion in net sales; the latter will be called Construction & Industrial White Cap and expects similar revenue. The deal is expected to be completed by the middle of fiscal 2020.Investors would be getting a leading player in two spaces trading at a discount to rivals  and , with an economy that might not be ready to creak to a halt just yet.Unlike Canopy Growth and HD Supply, shares of leading lawn care products specialist   have not been beaten down in 2019. In fact, they've gained almost 75% this year, which might have some thinking it's approaching the end of a bullish period. That may be premature. Although lawn care provides the bulk of Scotts' revenue and profit, its hydroponic business is the faster-growing segment, and as it caters to the expanding legal marijuana market in the U.S., it has the potential to assume a much larger proportion of importance for the company.Sales at Hawthorne, Scotts' cannabis subsidiary, grew 38% in the fiscal fourth quarter, with growth exceeding 50% in some west coast markets such as California. Although the segment experienced some hiccups following Scotts' acquisition of the business, it has since , and Chairman and CEO Jim Hagedorn said Hawthorne's performance gives Scotts ""a high degree of confidence as we look ahead into fiscal 2020.""It should give investors a degree of surety, too, that during the pot stock meltdown this year, Scotts Miracle-Gro was unaffected. Supplying the picks and shovels to whoever the miners are is still a smart way to play the market. And Hagedorn has promised to boost Hawthorne's profitability.Don't discount the lawn-care business from sprouting further growth: It was only expected to see 1% to 2% gains this year, but Scotts bumped it up to 6% to 7% during the summer. It ended up reporting 8% growth for the full year.Scotts Miracle-Gro isn't a cheap stock, but it still has the potential to grow like a weed. When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

" may not be on your radar yet. But this small-cap industrial products distributor to small and medium-size businesses has used 2019 to reposition itself and focus on a new path to growth. A new CEO and the final divestiture of its overseas business could lead to strong sales gains. Image source: Getty Images.While peer   and  may be more recognizable names in the business, Systemax distributes private-label and brand-name equipment and supplies under the somewhat more familiar name Global Industrial. But with market capitalizations of over $20 billion and over $4 billion for Fastenal and MSC, respectively, both are much bigger players in the business of industrial product supply. Systemax began in 1949 as a materials handling business. The ensuing decades consisted of much acquisitive growth. By 2008, sales exceeded $3 billion, and the acquisitions continued, including the e-commerce assets of bankrupt electronics retailer Circuit City. Systemax's sprawling technology products group also included the familiar CompUSA retail stores, and it added information technology businesses in the Netherlands, France, Germany, and the U.K. The most recent few years have seen a divestiture of the technology products group, with the final sale of its French business closing in September 2018. What remains is a more focused, profitable North American industrial products group, with a market capitalization of approximately $900 million.With proceeds from the sale of the French business and 2018 cash flow, the company paid shareholders a December 2018 special dividend of $6.50 per share, marking the third special dividend in a 12-month span. The company also announced that board member Barry Litwin would become the new CEO effective January 2019, to leverage his background in e-commerce businesses and digital strategy. Litwin planned to concentrate on improving customer experience through digital channels within the industrial products group.So after almost 70 years, Systemax is now back close to where it started: as an industrial products supplier in the MRO (maintenance, repair, and operations) segment. But today's version is highly digital, with its new global industrial website having been launched this past November. This profitable segment should keep the company in a good position for both growth and capital returns to shareholders. As of the end of the quarter that included September 2019, the balance sheet was strong, with $98 million in cash and virtually no debt, along with $72 million available under its credit facility. Free cash flow from operations was $11 million in the third quarter. This should allow the company to continue to grow its business organically, take advantage of any appropriate potential acquisitions, and reward shareholders with its ongoing dividends. Current efforts have been aimed at opening a new Dallas distribution center. As Litwin stated, ""The expansion of our distribution network is a key component of our strategy and was critical to providing customers with shorter lead times and more-competitive shipping rates while supporting growth and long-term operating leverage.""Investors should keep in mind the cyclicality of the business. So a good way to look at valuation in this sector is to compare metrics with its peers. The following chart shows that Systemax is priced lower than both MSC Industrial and Fastenal versus last year's sales (its first full year with all the international businesses off the books).Data by Its forward P/E ratio also shows that while it's trading slightly higher than MSC Industrial, if Systemax's new streamlined business focus shows results, it could have the cheapest valuation among its larger peers on both metrics.As a  industrial sector company, Systemax should be positioned to grow from here and continue returning capital to shareholders -- and may be worth a look for that sector of an investor's portfolio. When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Shares in industrial supply company   soared 41.3% in 2019 according to data provided by . It was a truly remarkable occurrence, not least because most of it comes down to internal execution.Image source: Getty Images.In a year when U.S. industrial production came in lower than most of the expectations going into it, Fastenal managed to generate high-single-digit sales and operating income growth largely based on its strategy of expanding onsite locations, e-commerce sales growth, and placing industrial vending machines.There's a useful snapshot of the company's progress on its strategic initiatives in the third-quarter earnings figures:The end result was a 7.8% year-over-year increase in sales in the third quarter and a 7.4% increase in operating income. Fastenal is still a . Fastenal's results in 2019 are very good, especially when you consider the headwinds it's faced from a slowing industrial economy, cost increases emanating from tariff actions, and . As you can see below, the company's year-over-year growth rate has slowed as a consequence of weakness in the industrial economy, but Fastenal still remain firmly in positive territory. For reference, industrial supply companies have what economists call short-cycle sales. This means there's a short lead time between initial contact and the generation of a sale, so when industrial production starts to slow, industrial supply companies will be hit first.Data source: Fastenal presentations.With Fastenal having demonstrated it can grow even in a slowing environment -- indeed, a slowdown could lead to a scenario where it grabs market share from smaller distributors -- the key question is what kind of assistance the company can receive from the economy in 2020?The question is subject to debate.  that the slowdown is largely a consequence of issues that can be rectified in due course, such as the trade conflict and a natural slowing in transportation markets (automobile and truck sales). In addition, the underlying economy remains in good shape with falling unemployment, low interest rates, and solid housing markets.Meanwhile, bears will point out that the current trend in the industrial economy is negative, Europe remains in an anemic growth mode, and there's no shortage of geopolitical issues to worry about right now.If the bulls are right, there should be an improvement in the industrial economy at some point in the middle of 2020 -- something that could lead to a much brighter outlook for Fastenal's earnings in 2021.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"Industrial supplies wholesale distributor   outpaced the broader market by a wide margin in 2019, as shares raced higher by 41% against the  index's gain of nearly 29%. The company reports on its final quarter of 2019 on Jan. 17 before markets open for trading. Investors will pay special attention to this report, as it will set the tone for Fastenal's share price performance in 2020, but also because the company's operations give us some insight into the current health of the manufacturing and construction industries. Below, let's review what the report might tell us about Fastenal's results -- and the broader economy in general.Fastenal's share price ascent last year was fueled in part by vibrant sales growth. Through the first three quarters of 2019, Fastenal booked $4.1 billion in revenue, translating into year-over-year top-line growth of 8.7%. Revenue advanced by nearly 8% in the third quarter over the comparable period, to $1.4 billion.Will this sales momentum continue? We already know that the company experienced a curbing of its growth rate in two of the last three months of the year, as Fastenal has released its October 2019 and November 2019 monthly sales reports (December's report will be released simultaneously with earnings on the 17th).In October, total sales increased by 4.3% over the prior year, while Fastenal's key metric of daily sales (total sales divided by the number of days in the month) also advanced by 4.3%. In November, sales rose by 0.7%, but this was mostly attributable to the period's 20 business days versus 21 days in November 2018. Daily sales in November improved by 5.7%.Both reported sales and daily sales are tracking below the sales growth of the first nine months of 2019, so the suspense is building on how much December might improve or further dilute the two-month trend. Image source: Getty Images.Investors will also scrutinize two other important metrics in the earnings release: the number of industrial vending machines Fastenal signed for placement in customers' worksites during the third quarter, and the number of Onsite inventory fulfillment locations it signed with customers.In the trailing 12 months ending in September 2019, Fastenal increased its total installed vending machine count by 12.2%, to approximately 88,000 units. However, during the latter part of 2019, management noted that ""slower economic activity"" was lengthening the sales cycle for its vending machines.Thus, management reduced Fastenal's full-year 2019 vending sales goal from a range of 23,000-25,000 units, to 22,000 units. As I discussed in , this is still a healthy target. The organization had clinched signed agreements for roughly 16,700 vending machines through the first nine months of 2019.As for Onsite locations, Fastenal signed 283 new locations in the first three quarters of 2019, with a goal of hitting 375 to 400 signings by year-end -- an ambitious goal. The company counted a total of 1,076 of these on-premise inventory centers at the end of Q3 2019.Industrial vending machines and Onsite locations are Fastenal's two biggest growth drivers, and a rush of signings at year-end will likely bolster shareholder enthusiasm, even if the total pace of revenue growth indeed slows in the fourth quarter. Conversely, lackluster revenue numbers coupled with weak customer signings could spur profit-taking in this industrial sector . Given the company's huge share price run-up last year, investors shouldn't be surprised it Fastenal gives back a few percentage points of its stock gains if releases only moderately improved earnings.Fastenal's fourth-quarter 2019 earnings report will be utilized by some market watchers as an early data point on the health of the U.S. economy. With its huge installed base of tens of thousands of vending machines, and continuous order flow deriving from two vital industries (manufacturing and construction), the company can be seen as a proxy for waxing or waning business demand. A pickup in sales coupled with healthy vending and Onsite signings will give investors useful information to supplement upcoming readings of the economy.On the other hand, a weak quarter from Fastenal, one that builds on the company's cautious note of slower economic activity in the latter half of 2019, may signal to some investors that it's not too early to begin worrying about a possible recession later this year. The takeaway from such a report should be a resolve to monitor the earnings of similar economic bellwethers as they begin to release year-end 2019 earnings over the next few weeks and to pay close attention to early 2020 macroeconomic reports. Key domestic figures to track in this scenario include U.S. manufacturing output, labor expansion, and, of course, the all-important metric of gross domestic product (GDP) growth.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Shares of motion control motor and power transmission company   rose 10.2% in December, according to data from . It's not so much that the company itself delivered, or was the recipient of, any positive stock-specific news. However, there is a growing sense of optimism -- supported by some data points and company results and guidance -- that the industrial sector could be set to trough sometime in the middle of 2020 and trend upward from then.Bears and bulls are likely to have a big fight over Altra Industrial Motion stock in 2020. Image source: Getty Images.Altra is interesting because . The stock currently trades at just 13.4 times analyst earnings projections for 2020. Merely meeting earnings expectations could lead to a stock price appreciation. On the other hand, the near-term trends in its end markets are negative. For example, management started its fiscal 2019 expecting diluted EPS in the range of $3.02-$3.18, only to reduce guidance to $2.81-$2.97 on the second-quarter earnings release in July, and then $2.77-$2.83 on the third-quarter  in October. In a nutshell, the company has suffered, alongside many other industrials, from the slowdown in short cycle spending in the industrial sector --- seen here in the survey data from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) Purchasing Managers Index. A reading below 50 implies a contraction in the industrial economy. data by That said, some of the most cyclical industrial companies, such as Germany's  and motion control company  , have  and   that suggest a bottoming out could occur in 2020, and this could be a good year to be  as a consequence. Meanwhile, the sales figures from a highly economically sensitive company like industrial supplier   also suggest a bottoming-out process could be in progress.Data source: Fastenal presentations.Throw in the possibility of an easing of trade tensions with China, and there's reason for cautious optimism regarding the industrial sector in 2020.For now, the idea that the second half of 2020 will signal an upturn is merely conjecture, and it's worth noting that the ISM data remains weak and Europe remains in an anemic growth mode. So don't be surprised if there's more negative news to come in the near term, especially from a company like Altra Industrial, which sells into some highly cyclical end markets such transportation (heavy trucks), factory automation, materials handling, and mining. It's likely to be a volatile year for investors in Altra Industrial Motion, and also one with a keenly fought-over bear and bull battleground. The bears will point to near-term pressure from declining industrial markets. Meanwhile, the bulls will argue that the company's valuation has a large enough margin of safety built in for some disappointment, provided the industrial economy is likely to improve in the second half.

Not for your average American, nor for your average investor. In fact, chances are, if youaEURtmve heard of them, itaEURtms because one of their analysts have sounded off on a stock du jour such as Netflix (NFLX) or McDonaldaEURtms (MCD).But EVR does hold a lofty spot among these aEURoefive-staraEUR payouts.

ThataEURtms not the concern. What should worry investors is that a significant market downturn would likely hit Evercore and its core business much harder than others. LetaEURtms keep looking.Mastercard (MA)Dividend Yield: 0.5%DIVCON Level: 5No one will ever accuse Mastercard (MA) of being a value play. At 32-times 2020 profits and a dividend yield youaEURtmd need a microscope to see, this payment-services stock looks like a hyper-growth tech play with a baby-fresh dividend.However, reality is a little different.Mastercard is indeed an impressive growth play.

WhataEURtms more, Wall StreetaEURtms pros are expecting better-than-usual growth next year: an improvement of roughly 14% and 18% on the top and bottom lines, respectively.But the dividend is established, and it has a rock-solid foundation.

An astonishingly high percentage of the globe remains cash-based, meaning MA should find avenues for growth, or at least ways to counter potential weakness in the U.S., for years to come.Fastenal (FAST)Dividend Yield: 2.4%DIVCON Level: 5Fastenal (FAST) does indeed specialize in fasteners such as bolts, screws, nuts and pins. But itaEURtms so much more.Fastenal services the nation via 3,200 branches and customer-specific on-sites, doling out not just a wide array of industrial supplies spanning electronics and HVAC to packaging gear and janitorial products, but even logistics solutions and supply consulting.ItaEURtms quite literally the backbone of AmericaaEURtms economic growthaEUR""no wonder, then, that the company boasts a 377% return in the past decade.

DominoaEURtms earned those gains by writing one of the best turnaround stories in corporate history. In 2009, the company flat-out admitted to America that its pizza was garbage and began to reinvent its pie. The lesser-told part of the story is that CEO J. Patrick Doyle, hired in 2010 and known for his presence in commercials propping up its wildly improved pies, also pushed a swath of improvements in in-store, delivery and online technology.Doyle stepped down in 2018, and the stock has been a roller-coaster ride ever since.DominoaEURtms (DPZ) Delivery Route Has Developed Some PotholesA ThereaEURtms nothing wrong with the dividend. It has blossomed by 160% in just five years and is covered with an excellent 27% payout ratio. Free cash flow is more than thrice what it needs to cover the dividend, too.But the leadership change, though more than a year old, remains a considerable concern that bears watching. Meanwhile, the market expects solid high-single-digit growth out of DPZ for next year, but thataEURtms been more than baked in, given a high forward P/E of 27. ThataEURtms a little too much risk.Cummins (CMI)Dividend Yield: 2.9%DIVCON Level: 5Cummins is a global engines and power systems manufacturer that also boasts a distribution arm. Of late, the company has pushed itself into the 21st century by adding an aEURoeElectrified Power SegmentaEUR that offers hybrid and fully electric powertrain solutions.Cummins doesnaEURtmt log breakneck growth, but it has been outpacing its peers over the past eight years with 7.6% compound average annual revenue growth.

t's no secret that global growth has slowed in 2019, and the industrial economy in particular has taken a downturn. The near-term outlook is negative, but long-term investors don't buy stocks with a quarter-by-quarter view. The big question is when the cycle will turn positive again. With this in mind, three companies giving earnings reports in November --  ,  , and   -- will help to provide answers for investors in stocks ranging across a wide swath of industries.Image source: Getty Images.The company is one of the , and as such, its revenue is other companies' capital spending, making it a key bellwether of overall industrial conditions. The company gives its fourth-quarter results in the middle of November, and aside from the general market commentary, there are three things to keep an eye out for.First, management believes that organic sales will decline by 3% to 3.5% in the fourth quarter, but aside from the headline number, investors should focus on the architecture and software systems segment results and revenue growth outlook -- it tends to be more exposed to short-cycle spending patterns and so will lead the direction of Rockwell's overall sales.Data source: Company presentations.The second thing to look for is its guidance on its automotive end market.  expecting flat sales growth from the automotive end market, only to reduce expectations to a mid-single-digit decline on the  in January and then cut it to a 10% decline in April. Will Rockwell meet this guidance? And what will Moret say about 2020?Third, semiconductor spending has been weak in 2019, but companies that supply the market such as , , and  have all been pointing to improving conditions lately, and it wouldn't be a surprise if Rockwell indicated potential improvement too -- something to look out for.Speaking of the semiconductor sector, Analog devices will give earnings toward the end of the month, and investors will be looking to see if the sector has really passed a trough, as Siemens CEO Joe Kaeser believes it has.The company's year-over-year sales growth has been in negative territory for the last four quarters, and it's hard to expect much improvement from its automotive end markets, while communications growth has been driven by 5G spending. However, considering the brighter outlook given by some of its peers, it's possible that Analog could report some relatively positive numbers on its consumer end markets and some stabilization in its industrial end market.Analysts have the company eking out 1% sales growth in 2020, and it will be interesting to see whether the company guidance matches or even meets that estimate as it reports its fourth-quarter 2019 results.Meanwhile, for broader market watchers, it's worth noting that semiconductor capital spending is often seen as being a very early-cycle activity, and if it comes back, investors can feel more positive about the general economic outlook in 2020.Data source: Company presentations.Agricultural and construction machinery company Deere will also give its fourth-quarter results at the end of the month. The key things to look out for are its outlook for U.S. and Canadian agricultural machinery equipment sales in 2020 and its overall construction equipment sales forecast.It's been a complicated year for the company, with a combination of the fallout of the trade war (agriculture has been a key battleground, leading to a slump in U.S. soybean exports to China) and African swine fever causing dramatic declines in China's pig herd and consequently its demand for soybean meal.As such, management now expects its full-year U.S. and Canadian agricultural equipment sales to be flat compared to a forecast for flat to up 5% . The key question is what Deere will guide toward for 2020. The answer will tell investors a lot about how the trade war is impacting the U.S. agricultural sector.Data source: Company presentations.Deere also has a construction equipment business, and as you can see in the table above, the construction segment has also lowered full-year guidance through the year. That said, there's been some evidence of an improvement in the construction end market recently -- for example, industrial supply company  and  turned positive in October after a few months in negative territory.Given the recent strength in the S&P 500 and the 24% gain so far this year, the market appears to believe the industrial economy will avoid a recession. However,  will feel a lot more confident if companies like Rockwell, Analog Devices, and Deere give decent outlooks, and what their managements say will guide investors as to which sectors are best placed to invest in during 2020.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Analog Devices wasn't one of them!

"ith the  hovering near all-time highs and economic growth around the globe showing signs of slowing, market participants are on edge. Bad news from a company can result in harsh punishment, while good news can lead to a wave of investor enthusiasm, which is what   saw when it reported third-quarter 2019 earnings that beat expectations. . It kept rising, too, and is up nearly 20% at this point. But was the news really that good?  The big headline from the third quarter was that Fastenal beat Wall Street's earnings expectations. That's clearly good, but step back and look at the actual numbers. Analysts had been calling for earnings of $0.35 a share in the quarter and Fastenal came up with $0.37 a share -- a $0.02 beat. Yes, shareholders get excited about things like this, but  see a few pennies here or there as all that important.Image source: Getty Images.That said, earnings were up roughly 8% year over year in the quarter, which is a positive when you look at the global growth picture. In fact, Fastenal is managing what appears to be a slowing worldwide economy in relative stride. To put that into perspective, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) just lowered its global growth forecast to 3%, stating that the world is in a ""synchronized slowdown."" If 3% sounds pretty good, remember that this is for the whole world, including fast-growing emerging markets and slower-growing developed markets -- which is largely where Fastenal operates. Developed markets are only expected to come in with 1.7% growth this year, which was also lowered from previous expectations. (More on this topic in a second.)  But it wasn't just earnings that came in on the positive side of things. There was also good news on some of the company's key growth initiatives. For example, it , including vending machines. Branches are expensive to operate and become less valuable as Fastenal gets entrenched in a customer's business by setting up shop within the customer's facilities. Shifting to on-site locations helps to create very ""sticky"" relationships with customers, who can't easily replace the services that Fastenal provides once they partner up on site. And, thus, closing branches at the same time helps keep costs in check while the company is expanding its reach in other, more productive ways. Solid execution on this front further solidifies Fastenal's long-term story.  But not all of the news was good. Notably, the industrial company's sales are slowing. A key metric Fastenal provides investors is its daily sales rate, which is basically net sales divided by the number of business days. In the third quarter, the daily sales rate was up 6.1% year over year. At first blush that sounds great, but step back and look at the longer-term trend.  Daily sales were on an upward trajectory throughout 2017, peaking at 14.8% in the final stanza of that year. In 2018 that fell a bit, but generally trended sideways at about 13% or so. Daily sales have declined each quarter so far in 2019, going from that 13% figure to the recent 6.1%. That's more than a 50% haircut in daily sales rate growth in just three quarters.   Meanwhile, the weakness is hitting every part of the company's business. Daily sales of non-fasteners, about two-thirds of the top line, were lower each quarter. Daily sales of fasteners, the company's namesake product and roughly 33% of revenue, rose in the first quarter, but have fallen dramatically since. They've now fallen from daily sales of roughly 12% to around 3%. And the trouble spans the heavy equipment, construction, and manufacturing breakouts offered by management as well. Fastenal is doing well based given the conditions it is facing, but it is clearly dealing with a broad slowdown in demand.    data by .And it isn't the only industrial supplier that's seeing weakening trends, with . If a slowdown is all that happens, as the IMF is suggesting, then Fastenal should be fine. However, if the slowdown takes a nasty turn and becomes a recession, then Fastenal (and most other industrials) will likely see a steep drop-off in demand. These are , so that's just par for the course. But with so many companies -- including Fastenal -- showing signs of slowing growth, it's probably better to err on the side of caution than to jump in with both feet.After the big run-up, Fastenal's stock is trading near all-time highs. Its price-to-sales, price-to-earnings, price-to-book-value, and price-to-cash-flow ratios are all above their five-year averages. It would be hard to argue that Fastenal isn't executing well today, like it always has (which is why it is a favorite of ). But at a time when the company's underlying sales are weakening and the global outlook for growth is tenuous, the good report that sent Fastenal's shares up 20% isn't really good enough to justify buying today.

"nyone who just blindly blames the economy for all industrial stocks' woes might want to take a look at the difference in performance between   and   over the last year. The former is up 37%, while its multi-industry peer is down 8.6% in the same period. Let's look at what Illinois Tool Works is doing right and whether it can continue.It's no secret that the industrial sector has seen broad-based slowing in 2019; indeed,  like 3M  and  during the current earnings season. Similarly, ITW's recent third-quarter earnings showed the signs of strain.Image source: Getty Images.As you can see below, the revenue growth outlook has been lowered through the year, and management reduced its full-year margin outlook. EPS guidance was maintained, but CEO Scott Santi acknowledged that ""the combination of near-term macro uncertainties and the lingering strike at "" means the final figure is more likely to come in at the lower end of guidance.Data source: Illinois Tool Works.Moreover, only one of its seven segments (polymers and fluids) reported organic growth in the quarter. Whichever way you look at it, the economy isn't helping the company much, just as it didn't with 3M and others that have broad-based short-cycle exposure.Data source: Illinois Tool Works.That said, why is ITW managing to outperform?First, the recent bump in the price is probably down to the idea that end-market conditions aren't as bad as feared. Just as industrial supply company  indicated at the start of earnings season, conditions are getting worse, but the rate of deterioration didn't increase in the third quarter -- suggesting that . Second, Illinois Tool Works continues to do a great job with expanding margin in the face of falling volumes and some pressure from rising costs -- a long-term comparison with 3M reveals much about the two companies' contrasting fortunes. data by .A large part of the reason comes down its so-called ""enterprise initiatives"" -- the company's ongoing efforts to refocus on its most profitable customers and product lines. The chart below shows how the initiatives helped offset pressure from rising costs in 2017 and 2018, and then declining volume in 2019. Meanwhile, the trend in margin remains upward.Data source: Company presentations. BP= basis points.Third, through its so-called product-line simplification (PLS) program, management continues to take the scalpel to businesses and products that are detrimental to its margin. And there's more to come, according to CFO Michael Larsen, who said on the , "" ... we are looking to divest certain businesses with revenues totaling up to $1 billion and are targeting to complete this effort by year-end 2020 with about half of the divestitures in 2019."" This level of portfolio pruning stands in direct contrast to 3M's lack of significant action -- . There was plenty of good news in the recent results, but as you can see in the first table above, management cut its full-year operating margin guidance, implying a weak fourth-quarter result in terms of margin.In response to a number of analyst questions on the matter, Larsen said it came down to bringing forward restructuring projects and the possible impact of an extended strike at General Motors alongside more overall volume declines -- in short, investors need to watch for the margin outlook on the next .Analysts have Illinois Tool Works growing EPS by 5.2% in 2020 to $8.01. That puts the stock's 2020 P/E at 21.5 times earnings. That's not especially cheap, and the company will have to demonstrate it can continue to expand margin in order to grow into the valuation. It's a great company, but the upside to the stock looks limited for now.Please make sure you've selected a ticker.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Is Illinois Tool Works Still a Buy?@2019-11-04@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-illinois-tool-works-still-a-buy-2019-11-04

Here's what to look out for.Image source: Getty Images.According to most industry forecasts and current trends, the trucking sector is set for a severe contraction in 2020, as it normalizes from a couple of years of torrid growth that followed the slowdown in heavy industries caused by the slump in commodity prices in 2015-2016: data by .However, it looks like this news has largely been .

The reason is that their sales cycles tend to be very short, and when a slowdown (or an acceleration) occurs in the industrial economy, you'll see it first in their sales figures. Fortunately, Fastenal publishes its sales information every month, something investors should look out for.Unfortunately, the data for October showed an ongoing slowdown in manufacturing. But investors will be hoping that construction data builds on signs of stabilization from September and October:Data source: Fastenal investor presentations.Perhaps the best way to look at matters is to focus on sequential growth trends compared to historical benchmarks given by Fastenal in earnings presentations; this gives a better measure of when conditions might stabilize.October certainly wasn't a good month from this perspective, so investors will be hoping the November data is significantly better than the historical benchmark of a 4% decline in sales from October to November -- something to look out for if you want to invest in the manufacturing sector in 2020.Data source: Fastenal investor presentations.It's not been an easy year for investors in FedEx.

iven a choice, most investors would love to get rich by investing in the next hot stock by riding the next global megatrend to extreme wealth. But chances are that you'll strike out long before you hit a  out of the park for a 25,000% lifetime return.For investors, boring can be brilliant, and if you have a longtime horizon, investing in dividend stocks can be the simplest way to get rich over time. Here are two stocks that won't take the investing world by storm but are still wonderful for building long-term wealth.If you're unaware of  , it's known as a distributor of a long list of industrial and construction products and parts, although it also has branched out into logistics, consulting, and technology services. For decades, Fastenal's growth story revolved around its expanding store count, but recently, management has fine-tuned its strategy to increase the value it offers customers. In recent years, Fastenal has focused on driving growth through vending and inventory management services and on-site programs, as there are multiple benefits to having , rather than only in its retail stores.Any management team can make vague claims such as innovative solutions, industry expertise, and unmatched commitment, but for a business to be successful, it has to offer customers obvious value. Fastenal's vending machines and on-site programs do just that.Fastenal's vending machines can stock and track items ranging from eye, hearing, and hand protection to batteries, tape, drill bits, and paints -- or even big-ticket items such as laptops and power tools. When using these vending machines and especially the data tracking behind them, customers are cutting consumption by 30% or more, reducing their inventories, and minimizing the time it takes to find these products or travel to a store for them. Essentially, Fastenal offers its customers a way to work more efficiently and quickly.For investors, these vending machines help drive incremental revenue because they're the closest point of purchase and also secure a direct link and partnership between Fastenal and its customers. This helps support retention rates and pricing power. Vending machines started as an idea in 2008, and as of June 2019, Fastenal has over 100,000 active devices driving consumption savings for customers and incremental revenue for Fastenal. data by Vending machines are just one example of how Fastenal is evolving as a business to strengthen its business partnerships, grow revenue and market share, and utilize its nationwide supply chain advantages to provide these services better than their competitors. As you can see in the graphic above, Fastenal's business might seem boring but it's consistently returned value to shareholders through improving results and higher dividends. Fastenal began paying dividends in 1991, and its current 2.4% yield and roughly 26% payout ratio means it's valuable already and has plenty of room to move higher.  is a . After years of trudging through quarterly reports of slow growth and flat or worse comparable sales, its management decided to slash roughly 100 brands to better focus on higher-growth opportunities. The company whittled down to 65 brands and fine-tuned its marketing and investment strategy, and a glance at the company's five-year stock price chart shows that Wall Street and investors have jumped back onboard. data by Not only did P&G's business improve throughout 2019, accompanied by a rising stock price, but the company took that momentum into its first quarter of fiscal 2020. Organic sales grew 7%, with all 10 global categories increasing. And thanks to the strong first quarter, management bumped up its outlook for the full year on both the top and bottom lines.P&G's results over the past year or so demonstrate that slashing more than half its brand count and less-lucrative categories was the right long-term move. But don't think that P&G is a lesser company without those brands: Of the 65 brands it still has, 21 generate at least $1 billion in annual sales and another 11 generate at least $500 million.P&G will always have a long list of massive, valuable and powerful brands. But now that the company is leaner and meaner and generating more tantalizing growth, investors should feel optimistic about holding shares long term for its 2.45% dividend yield.P&G already has a long history of returning value to shareholders, and that won't change anytime soon. The company has paid dividends for 129 consecutive years, increased its dividend for 63 years, and returned over $135 billion in value to shareholders over the past decade.Image source: Procter & Gamble.P&G has just about everything an investor could want. It offers a valuable and consistently increasing dividend, a slew of billion-dollar brands that own the retail shelf, a secure business as a valued supplier across the nation of retail stores, and improving sales and pricing. These are a great mix for business.To keep up the momentum, management will have to continue innovating new products, packaging, and marketing campaigns. If its recent turnaround suggests anything, however, it's that management understands how to ignite growth. Fastenal and P&G won't make the list of sexy growth stocks that coworkers discuss over a drink at the bar. However, savvy investors shouldn't ignore the two stocks because, in investing, boring can often be brilliant.Fastenal's move to entrench its vending machines with its customers was a great move to generate incremental revenue, but it also helps its customers save money and see value in its partnership on the front lines. P&G, a maker of everything from razors to fabric softener, is also boring if you're looking to hear the newest business buzzwords or exciting presentations, but the company has everything investors could want, including powerful brand images and products that solve consumers' problems daily.Yes, , and Fastenal and P&G are phenomenal dividend stocks for investors who understand that notion.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"he third-quarter earnings of industrial supply company   led to a double-digit increase in the share price on the day of their release (Friday 11th Oct) and raised the hopes of investors in the industrial sector. But was the jubilation justified? The numbers suggests there is reason for some cautious optimism, but it might not be from the area that many expected it.Companies like Fastenal and   tend to set the tone for the industrial sector because they have extremely short sales cycles. In other words, as soon as manufacturing companies see a slowdown, the first thing they will do is cut back on buying supplies from Fastenal.Image source: Getty Images.Indeed, the weak  in the previous quarter set the tone for a disappointing quarter of earnings from the industrial sector. That said, Fastenal's most recent results were broadly better than the market was expecting, so does that mean that end-market conditions have improved and investors won't have to ? The reason for the optimism can be shown in the chart below, specifically the uptick in the last bar of the chart. The chart is a bit complicated, so bear with me while I take you through it.Sequential monthly sales growth simply means the growth rate from one month to the next -- for example, from January to February in the same year. In this case, the benchmark (which the sequential sales growth rate is compared with in the chart) is simply the historical average sequential growth rate for the same periods in question. Therefore, when Fastenal's monthly average daily sales rate is higher than the benchmark (a positive number in the chart), you could argue that Fastenal is in a growth phase; when it's negative, Fastenal is in a slowdown.In addition, it's important to note that overall performance -- and benchmarked performance -- can naturally bounce around from month to month because some sales can be delayed or pulled forward over the month. Nevertheless, as you can see below, there was a definite slowing in the April-to-August period, but it picked up in September. Let's look at why.Data source: Fastenal presentations.Unfortunately, the outlook isn't as bright as suggested by the September data above. First, breaking out the daily sales growth rate by end market shows that the headline sales growth rate was helped by a bounce in Fastenal's construction sales growth. In fact, the year-over-year growth rate for Fastenal's manufacturing sales fell in September.Data source: Fastenal presentations.Second, Fastenal raised prices in the quarter, and as CEO Daniel Florness pointed out on the : ""we did do a little bit better with pricing in the quarter, obviously. And I think that that kind of moved through as the quarter went on as well.""In other words, revenue was boosted a bit in September by pricing impacts, which could prove difficult to repeat.Third, regarding sales performance in the third quarter, CFO Holden Lewis noted that ""This largely reflects moderation in the variables that impacted the second quarter."" Putting it another way, the deterioration in the third quarter wasn't as bad as it was in the second quarter, and as you can see in the first chart above, sales growth does tend to bounce around.Turning to a more positive perspective, there are three key points to note about Fastenal's earnings:One swallow doesn't make a summer, and the construction sales growth in September isn't enough to encourage wide-scale optimism. Meanwhile, Fastenal's manufacturing sales data and management commentary indicate that the industrial sector continues to weaken. In short, Fastenal's earnings don't provide much succor for those hoping that manufacturing will avoid a recession. On the other hand, a lot of negativity appears to be baked into many industrial stocks, and any relatively positive news could immediately reward long-term investors who have taken advantage of recent weakness to buy stock.That's a good way to think about the upcoming earnings season. There are likely to be some guidance cuts, but merely maintaining guidance might be enough for many companies to see positive reactions. When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have an investing tip, it can pay to listen.

"ndustrial and construction supplies wholesaler   saw its stock surge by 17% on Friday, after the release of its fiscal third-quarter 2019 results. The company's earnings exceeded investor expectations, and its year-over-year growth rate hit the high single digits. Importantly, the results also alleviated worries over the potential for trade tariffs to cut into the organization's profit margins.As we review the quarter, note that all comparative numbers are presented against those of the prior-year quarter.Data source: Fastenal. Image source: Getty Images.Fastenal's strategy of on-premise growth through supplies vending machines and the more comprehensive Onsite inventory solution has made it  over the past several quarters. Expansion continued in the third quarter: Fastenal signed 5,671 industrial vending machines, bringing its total signings to 16,713 machines in the first nine months of the fiscal year. Total installed machines grew 12% year over year to 88,327.Nonetheless, management observed that ""slower economic activity has lengthened the sales cycle for vending."" Executives currently expect to complete 22,000 vending machine signings this year, versus a previously stated goal of 23,000 to 25,000 units. That still represents a fairly brisk growth target.During the organization's , CEO Daniel Florness attributed some of the reduction in the pace of vending machine signings to customers' hesitation because of the uncertainty in the global economy. The CEO lauded the company's ability to push through appreciable signings under these conditions and also highlighted the fact that Fastenal's average revenue per installed vending machine increased during the past three months on a year-over-year basis.The company added 84 new Onsite locations during the past three months and has tacked on a total of 283 new locations in the first three quarters of 2019. Management still believes its full-year goal of 375 to 400 new installations is within reach. Fastenal counted 1,076 active Onsite locations at quarter's end.As Fastenal heads into the final quarter of the year and looks ahead to fiscal 2020, it appears to be gaining momentum despite a vulnerable growth environment in the supplies distribution business. Fastenal has skated past the earnings obstacle of tariffs through timely price increases, and it's overcome broader economic inertia by ramping up on-premise installations to gain market share.

Gross profit as a percentage of sales declined 90 basis points to 47.2% in the quarter. Fastenal said the most significant driver of that decline was that vending and onsite locations tend to have lower gross margins due to customer and product mix.Fastenal reiterated its expectations that it would record $195 million to $225 million in capital expenditures for the full year, up from $166.8 million in 2018, as it continues spending on developing its hub capacity and vending devices. That spending should pay off over time, but in the near term the cost will weigh on earnings.The near-term outlook is likely to be clouded by worries about trade wars, tariff increases, and the health of the U.S. economy, but Fastenal appears to be making the right moves to secure its place as an essential partner to its customers.

The former fell while the latter was off by after  (NASDAQ:) unveiled its competing streaming service. , even offering less content than its rivals, the iPhone maker has tacitly declared something of a price war.To that end, AAPL shares gained more than 1% in response to its announcement.That gain was chump-change compared to the 2.5% advance  (NYSE:) shares logged today. BofA leads a group of bank stocks higher, in step with recovering interest rates.Headed into hump-day, however, it’s the stock charts of  (NYSE:), (NASDAQ:) and  (NASDAQ:) that have earned a closer look. Here’s why, and what may lie ahead for each.Just a few months ago, Micron Technology was presumed to be in serious peril. Yet another memory chip glut had lowered prices, punishing manufacturers who dared to ramp up production to meet what was perceived to be sustainable demand.This year has been dramatically different though. Not only is MU stock up, it has moved higher in a way that has set the stage for an explosive move higher from here. It will need some help to do so, and the effort may not be long-lived. The potential is tremendous though.Micron Technology isn’t the only name on the verge of benefiting from what appears to be an upside-down head and shoulders pattern, however. JPMorgan Chase is as well. Although it’s not as well-formed as Micron’s and has moved a little more erratically as it has unfurled, the prospective upside is still noteworthy.In fact, JPM stock is arguably better positioned to make a nice run given a hint offered up on the long-term weekly chart.Finally, the last time we looked at Fastenal Company shares , the stock was fighting a losing battle. Its 50-day moving average line capped a rally attempt, and sent shares lower to test a major support line around $30.

"he current economic expansion is one of the longest on record. That's helped to keep the stock market up near all-time highs. But the market isn't always bullish, and investors need to keep an eye out for the downturns that always follow upturns.Right now, there are some troubling  starting to emerge at economically sensitive industrial giants like  ,  , and  . Here's a quick look at what's happening. Diversified industrial giant 3M is facing a number of worrisome headwinds today. One of the big ones making the news is the company's legal troubles, as it deals with liability surrounding supposedly faulty products and . However, there's a lot more going on today that has investors spooked, sending the shares down by more than a third from their early 2018 highs.  Image source: Getty Images.A notable issue in 2019 has been a change of direction in 3M's ""short-cycle"" businesses. These are economically sensitive operations that tend to turn down before a recession hits. A prime example is the company's auto-related business, which has been hit by slowing vehicle markets abroad and domestically. The company was so concerned about the outlook for these businesses that  and started a cost-cutting program.  Management has been seeing some success in its cost-cutting effort, but in its  noted that there is still ""uncertainty"" in the global economy and highlighted that growth trends appear to be ""slowing."" Although 3M maintained its guidance for the rest of the year, it didn't really do much to reduce the economic concerns that have investors worried about its near-term future.   It's not just 3M that's seeing weakness in short-cycle businesses. Industrial automation specialist Rockwell has also seen a trend shift. Management noted that organic sales were up 0.5% year over year in its fiscal third-quarter earnings presentation, highlighting strength in its oil and gas, pulp and paper, mining, and life sciences businesses. But the very next bullet point was: ""Shorter-cycle weakness: automotive, semiconductor, food and beverage.""  The company went on to note that, ""Uncertainty with respect to global trade is impacting some customers' investment decisions, particularly those related to the timing of capital investments."" The company reduced its organic sales growth projection for fiscal 2019 from 3.7%-5.3% to just 1.5%. That's a pretty sizable downward revision that occurred between just April and July. It's also worth noting that there's only one more quarter left in the company's fiscal year, so investors would be right to wonder if something material is taking shape. While Rockwell is still expecting growth, it is clearly less sanguine about the future than it was just a few short months ago.  Adding to the picture is power specialist Eaton, which has now lowered its expectations twice so far in 2019. The company entered the year expecting organic growth of 4% to 5%. After just one quarter, however, it trimmed that to 4%. The big drivers were reduced expectations in its hydraulic operation, which sells to original equipment manufacturers in industries like construction, and its vehicle division, which has material exposure to trucking. Both of these businesses are highly sensitive to economic conditions.  Unfortunately, the first reduction wasn't enough. When it released second-quarter earnings, Eaton dropped its organic growth expectations to 3%. The big drivers were, once again, hydraulics and vehicles. So whatever weakness started to show up in the first quarter continued to gain steam in the second. Eaton's expectations for its vehicle division are particularly troubling. At the start of the year, management expected an organic sales drop of 1% to 2%, weak but not terrible, but has since shifted to projecting a decline of between 7% and 8% -- a much more troubling pullback.  Industrials are generally pretty , with their top and bottom lines going up and down along with the economy. Looking at the recent results of some of the largest players in the industry, there's nothing at this point that suggests we are in a recession. But there are some warning signs starting to show up that the economy is beginning to weaken. The news out of 3M, Rockwell, and Eaton provides just a few examples. There are more, if you look closely enough. The key is to look at the trends and not the absolute numbers, which are still showing overall growth. Although it may be too soon to say we are in a recession, the financial performance of industrial companies like these shows clear signs that the risk of a recession is rising.   When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and 3M wasn't one of them!

Here comes the trade war, and that isn’t good news for  (NASDAQ:) which dropped nearly 4% on news that U.S. President Donald Trump will impose a 10% tariff on $300 billion worth of Chinese goods at the start of September. Don’t count Fastenal stock out just yet, though.   The logic here is simple enough. Fastenal is the world’s largest fastener distributor in North America. As the largest fastener distributor in North America, Fastenal sells heavily to North American industrial and manufacturing companies. They also source a ton of product from Asia, particularly China. Consequently, the company has been hit hard by a double headwind of slowing demand and rising costs amid escalating trade tensions.Revenue growth has slowed. Margins have compressed. Profits have fallen flat. FAST stock has dropped, falling close to bear market territory (almost 20% off recent highs), while the  is just 3% off its all-time highs.This new round of tariffs is more bad news for FAST stock. It’s basically confirmation that things won’t get much better anytime soon, and that Fastenal stock will likely remain depressed for the foreseeable future.But, this trade war isn’t a permanent thing. Eventually, it will stop. Nobody really knows when. But, it will, because the global economy is so connected that neither side can fight with the other forever. Once the trade war does get resolved, Fastenal’s headwinds will disappear. Revenue growth will pace higher. Margins will rise. Profits will rebound.So will FAST stock.As such, patience will be rewarded here. FAST sock won’t turn things around right away. But, in a multi-year window, this stock does have tremendous upside in the likely scenario that a trade resolution is struck within the next few years.The first important thing to note about Fastenal stock is that it’s depressed for a reason (the trade war) and that reason isn’t going away anytime soon.There are two things here: supply and demand. On the supply side, Fastenal sources a ton of product from Asia, particularly China, so as Trump has continued to impose more and more tariffs on Chinese imports, it has resulted in rising costs for a healthy portion of Fastenal’s products.Fastenal has tried to hike prices to offset these rising costs. But, such efforts have fallen short thus far. Consequently, gross margins are getting squeezed. Last quarter, Fastenal reported nearly 200 basis points of year-over-year gross margin compression.On the demand side, Fastenal sells a ton of product to North American manufacturing and industrial companies. Those companies are being hit hard by the trade war. Because prices are going up, business operations are being disrupted, and everyone in the industry is uncertain about what’s going to happen next.The result is, capex and investment levels are dropping. Indeed, by many metrics, U.S. manufacturing activity has plunged in 2019 to a .As U.S. manufacturing activity has slowed, so has demand for Fastenal’s products. Daily sales growth, the important revenue metric for this business, was 8%. It was the first sub-10% reading since the first quarter of 2017.Overall, then, the trade war is creating a huge drag on Fastenal’s business. That drag isn’t going away anytime soon. So long as it remains, FAST stock will remain depressed.The second important thing to note about Fastenal stock is that near term weakness isn’t here to stay forever, and it’s ultimately creating a compelling long term buying opportunity.Zooming out, the big picture fundamentals here are very good. Since 2010, U.S. manufacturing sales have grown at a  compounded annual growth rate. Fastenal, due to its expansion and growth drivers, has significantly outpaced the industry, growing revenues at a 10%-plus compounded annual growth rate since 2010.This outperformance persists today, even in a time of turbulence. U.S. manufacturing sales have fallen flat in 2019. Fastenal reported first-quarter sales growth of 12% and second-quarter sales growth of 8%. That’s impressive.Thus, Fastenal is a winning company in a long-term stable industry that’s going through a rough patch right now. But, this rough patch won’t last forever. Because their two economies are so connected and dependent upon one another, the U.S. and China are unlikely to fight on trade forever.Instead, Trump will keep upping the ante, China will be forced into a position to make a more meaningful deal, and a resolution will likely be reached within the next few quarters or years.Once that resolution is reached, FAST stock should jump.The math here is easy to follow. Even accounting for the trade war, Fastenal still projects as a mid-single-digit revenue grower over the next several years. Gross margins should rebound as Fastenal more consistently and optimally leverages price hikes to offset rising costs. The opex rate should keep falling since management sounded a big cost savings tone on the last call.Putting all that together, profit growth should run around 10% over the next several years. That puts 2025 EPS at around $2.50. Based on a historically average 20-times forward multiple, that implies a 2024 price target of $50. Discounted back by 7% per year (3 points below 10% to account for the yield), which equates to a 2019 price target of ~$35.According to the long term fundamentals, FAST stock is materially undervalued at the current moment.

"he upcoming third quarter isn't likely to be a vintage one for  . The company's headwinds have been growing, and a combination of industry dynamics and macroeconomic difficulties threatens its near-term outlook. Let's take a look ahead at why it's set to be a tricky period for the company.Image source: Getty Images.It's clear that the construction segment of the business is the largest profit generator, but the change in profit -- the key swing factor in determining the stock's prospects -- was pretty much split among the three equipment segments in 2018.Data source: Caterpillar presentations.Unfortunately, all three faced difficult conditions in the third quarter.Readers have already seen how a host of information from engine and component manufacturer  , , not least the concern that China's construction industry is on the slide. As we shall see in a moment Cummins's management had some cautionary commentary on the outlook for oil & gas and mining spending in 2019 -- key end markets for Caterpillar.  In addition to the macro-economic challenges, CFO Andrew Bonfield talked of ""pricing pressures from local competitors"" during the second-quarter .Furthermore, a look at industrial supply company   monthly sales data for its construction (nonresidential) end market shows a clear slowdown, and this could feed through into weak orders for Caterpillar.Data source: Fastenal presentations.Indeed, Caterpillar's global rolling three-month construction industries retail sales turned negative in July and remained so in August, with North America growth slowing to just 1% and Asia/Pacific down 15%.Of course, this is the last thing that Caterpillar needs, because on the last , Bonfield said that he expected dealer inventories to rise by $900 million in 2019 compared to a previous estimate for inventories to be flat last year. On the second-quarter call, Bonfield said about dealer inventory, ""We are comfortable that this level is supported by positive end-user demand.""However, if end-market sales growth is slowing (and inventories have already been rising more than previously expected), dealer inventories are likely to go up more, meaning that they are less likely to order more equipment from Caterpillar.Going into 2019, investors had high hopes that mining companies were on the verge of beginning a long cycle of capital spending following a few years of weakness. Indeed, as you can see below, they have remained strong in 2019 so far.Data source: Caterpillar presentations.Moreover,  of the capital spending plans of major miners like , , and  shows that they remain in place. However, if global growth is slowing, it's likely to take demand for commodities like iron ore, copper, and coal with it.Cummins CEO Tom Linebarger has talked of mining not looking ""like it's at peak, but it's definitely leveled off."" The question is whether that leveling off will also be seen in Caterpillar's resource industries sales and whether it's compatible with management's expectations for the segment in 2019.There are two areas of concern here.First, Caterpillar is expecting reciprocating engine sales to bounce in the fourth quarter as takeaway capacity comes online in the Permian Basin. However, other companies such as Cummins have been reducing their expectations for spending from the region, and  CEO  in spending from the Permian Basin this year. Indeed, the management of Emerson's process automation rival, , has also spoken of large projects being pushed out.Second, adoption of  (PSR)  by nearly all the major railroads in the U.S. is likely to improve the efficiency of rail networks, and history suggests that this will mean a drop in locomotive and railcar equipment demand.Caterpillar's rival in locomotives,  , had its CEO Rafael Santana stating on his company's second-quarter earnings call that ""precision scheduled railroading is certainly having some effect on new local orders."" All told, the longer-term impact of PSR on holding back locomotive order growth is a concern.The company certainly faces headwinds, but to be fair, a lot of this is probably already priced into the stock. For example, even if Caterpillar only hits the bottom end of its guidance range of $12.06 to $13.06, it will trade on just 10 times earnings. That makes the stock look like a good value, but just be aware that the headline news might not be great in the next six months or so, and the headwinds outlined here might cause a lowering of its earnings outlook in the near term.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"y Lee SamahaThere's no way around it: The industrial economy is slowing, and the recent results from industrial supply companies   and  suggest there could be some unwelcome surprises in earnings season. Given their short-cycle sales and exposure to manufacturing, construction, and heavy industries, the industrial suppliers are always seen as key bellwethers. Let's look at the what their recent earnings might mean for other industrial stocks.There are three key conclusions from the recent quarterly earnings reports -- two of them apply across the board, while the third relates specifically to the industrial supply sector:Around 41% of Fastenal's sales are to manufacturing customers, with another 26% to heavy equipment manufacturers, and 13% going to the construction market. It's a similar story with MSC, except that it has a larger exposure to heavy industry -- 47% of its sales are to such companies, with light manufacturing contributing 22%.Image source: Getty Images.Unfortunately, the latest data from both companies suggests a slowing in end demand, particularly for MSC -- implying that heavy industries have decelerated noticeably. In addition, as you can see below, Fastenal's manufacturing and construction sales have experienced the same thing -- indicating a broad-based slowdown.Data source: Company presentations. The data was backed up by management's commentary, with MSC Industrial's CEO Erik Gershwind talking of ""a step down in industrial demand since our fiscal April,"" which is ""evidenced in discussions with customers and suppliers, along with data points coming from many sources.""Meanwhile, Fastenal CFO Holden Lewis talked of activity having clearly slowed, and he pointed out that sales of fasteners (its most cyclical product) only grew 5.5% in the quarter, compared with a 9.5% rise in sales outside the fastener segment. Regarding industry end markets, Lewis said:Manufacturing was up 9.1%. Oil and gas remain soft, and our heavy equipment categories also slowed. Construction was up 7.2% in the second quarter. Fastenal's sales growth remains good on an absolute level largely thanks to. However, management at both companies described their results as ""disappointing"" and not in line with expectations.The slowdown in heavy industries implies that companies might not be so willing to sign off on capital spending in the near future --  for a company like  . Rockwell's management is hoping that growth from oil and gas as well as heavy industries will help to offset weakness in automotive spending in 2019.It's a similar story at iconic companies   and  . Both expect a better second half in 2019. But with their significant construction exposure, it's hard to not see some pressure, given what the industrial supply companies said. Moreover, Stanley's exposure to manufacturing and Caterpillar's oil and gas production and mining equipment also suggest some cause for concern.It's no secret that  has pressured industrial supply companies' margins, and it looks likely to continue over the longer term.But the near-term margin consideration is the difficulty of offsetting supply-chain cost increases from trade tariffs against China. Simply put, the pricing environment doesn't seem strong enough to enable Fastenal and MSC to offset cost hikes right now. As you can see below, both companies reported gross margin contraction in the quarter, and both cited rising costs due to tariffs as an issue.Data source: Company presentations. *Gross margin excludes acquisitions. Fastenal's earnings are for the second quarter, while MSC Industrial's are its fiscal third quarter.If the difficult price/cost dynamic is  and  (particularly since both companies' guidance implied relative improvement in pricing/cost in the second half), it will be evident when the two -- and others -- report earnings.Clearly, some companies will be forced to reduce full-year earnings guidance due to a combination of slowing end demand and rising costs from tariffs. That said, the market has known for some time that the economy is set to slow in 2019, and while some companies' earnings expectations may need to be reduced, it doesn't mean that a recession is around the corner -- earnings remain in growth mode.All of which suggests a bumpy earnings season, but there will be buying opportunities created by some of the disappointments. So investors need to follow the upcoming earnings reports very closely.

arnings season is just beginning as companies release their results for Q2 2019, and that will come as a relief for many market watchers. After a few months of trying to read the minds of the Fed and following the Presidential Twitter feed, it will be nice to get back to more mundane, measurable things like corporate profitability.Or at least, that is the theory, but if early indications are anything to go by, this earnings season will be more about opinion and speculation than the traditional metrics of EPS and revenue.Fastenal () was one of the first companies to release second quarter earnings when they did so Thursday morning. The Minnesota-based company is the largest U.S. manufacturer and distributor of fasteners and is traditionally one of the first companies to report. Despite that, though, they are not widely seen as an indicator of what is to come, probably because a large part of their business is tied to construction, an industry that has its own cycles within larger economic trends.This morning, however, was different.Fastenal missed on both the top and bottom lines, and growth fell below ten percent for the first time in over two years, causing the stock to lose close to five percent in early trading.All that is interesting information for stockholders and those that follow FAST, but for most people the real interest here came not in the results themselves, but in the reason given for the disappointing numbers.Fastenal’s management were very clear in the accompanying comments that the tariffs and trade war were almost entirely to blame for the disappointing numbers.I have no reason to doubt the board when they say that, although cynics might say that tariffs were the obvious excuse for not hitting targets, so the explanation should be taken with a pinch of salt. The details of the release suggest that isn’t the case. The most noticeable change was a 1.8% decrease in margins year on year, something that is logically attributable to a company absorbing some of the cost of tariffs.Even if it is the case, though, what we heard this morning is still likely to set the tone for the next few weeks of earnings.Excuses will be pretty commonplace. They are, after all, out there and available. If it isn’t the direct effect of the trade war and tariffs, then it will be the hardship placed on exporters by dollar strength. Those that are currently criticizing the Fed will latch onto the latter as proof of their point, while critics of the Trump administration will highlight the former. There will be a lot of shouting, but investors need to minimize the effects of the noise and concentrate on the underlying trends.Whether you blame Trump or Powell, the fact is that both sides are readying their excuses in preparation for a disappointing quarter. There will probably still be the usual two thirds of S&P 500 companies beating expectations, but that is because those expectations have been adjusted downward recently in a big way.According to , over eighty percent of S&P 500 companies have cut their profit outlook in advance of this earnings season, with analysts downgrading at a pace not seen for a couple of years.That wouldn’t matter that much if the market was priced accordingly, but it is not. As most are probably aware, the S&P 500 broke 3000 for the first time yesterday, and we are going into earnings season with multiples that would be appropriate to booming corporate profits, not profit warnings from a massive majority of companies.Of course, that doesn’t mean that you should sell everything. Traders have latched onto the chances of a Fed policy reversal and that is what is driving stocks higher. We have seen on many occasions, most notably in 2000 and 2007, that asset prices that are inflating, whether by accident or design, can continue to do so long past the logical endpoint.Eventually though, the reality of corporate profits always intrudes and, given the possibility of major earnings disappointments over the next few weeks, that means that adjusting your portfolio to a more defensive posture may be a smart move.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Fastenal's (FAST) Earnings Hint at What is To Come@2019-07-11@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/fastenals-fast-earnings-hint-at-what-is-to-come-2019-07-11
"  unveiled relatively healthy second-quarter 2019 earnings on Thursday before the markets opened for trading. However, while the wholesale industrial and construction supplies distributor continued the fast top-line growth it recorded in the first quarter, it was circumspect about the effect of macroeconomic activity on results going forward, and also warned of margin pressure in the coming quarters. Note that all comparative numbers in the discussion that follows are presented against the prior-year quarter.Data source: Fastenal. YOY = year over year.Image source: Getty Images.As I discussed , Fastenal is focused on expanding its on-premise solutions for both supplies and inventory. The company installed 5,439 industrial vending machines during the second quarter, bringing its year-to-date total to 11,042 units. Fastenal reaffirmed its goal of installing 23,000-25,000 of these units in 2019. The company's total vending machine base jumped by 13% year over year to approximately 86,000 units.Fastenal also maintained a steady pace of Onsite installations, in which it provides physical inventory and a team to manage both sales and service either within or in close proximity to a customer's location. The organization signed 94 new Onsite installations in the second quarter, marking 199 deals in the first half of the year, and is on track to ink between 375 and 400 Onsite deals in 2019. At quarter-end, Fastenal's installed base of 1,026 active Onsite locations represented a 35% increase over the comparable 2018 quarter.Looking forward, Fastenal's year-to-date sales growth of 9.1% and steady progress in on-premise installations are somewhat overshadowed by sales and margin uncertainty. As noted above, management is wary of the pace of economic activity in the back half of the year. Underscoring the caution, in Fastenal's June 2019 activity report released alongside earnings, daily sales increased 7% over June 2018, a pace that's 2 percentage points off the daily sales growth of 9% recorded overall in the first half of the year. On the margin front, the company observed that its recent price increases helped to mitigate tariff-related cost escalation, but was inadequate in overcoming general inflationary pressures in the second quarter. According to the earnings press release, Fastenal has ""taken additional actions in the third quarter of 2019 to counter the broader pressures [we] are experiencing on our costs as well as the additional tariffs that were levied on China-sourced products in May 2019."" Thus, the company will attempt to stave off further gross margin pressure in the back half of the year, but for now, it hasn't promised a complete offset.While Fastenal has enjoyed decent expansion so far in 2019, its slightly cloudy outlook for the final two quarters may have provided some investors with an excuse to book profits after a share price increase of nearly 20% year to date.

ith signs of an industrial slowdown appearing all around us, it's time to take a step back and examine the big picture.We know that a slew of companies served notice of slowing demand in short-cycle industries in the last quarter. But is that the start of a lengthy downtrend, or is it just a sentiment-led pause? Let's take a look at some important data points that investors can use to gauge what's going on.Image source: Getty Images.Everyone knows that company quarterly earnings reports contain a wealth of useful data and commentary, but some companies also report monthly sales data.   will release its retail sales figures in the middle of the month. Investors will be particularly focused on the number from its resource industries segment: Caterpillar is relying on capital spending in the mining industry, to help to offset potential weakness in construction spending growth and a delay in spending in the Permian basin in its energy and transportation segment.This is a particular concern because    on the length and strength of the recovery in the mining capital spending cycle.Data source: Caterpillar presentations. Chart by author.Industrial supply companies usually , and this quarter was no different.  and   spooked the market with their disappointing earnings in the second quarter -- when industrial activity slows, the first thing to get hit is revenue at industrial supply companies. Neither company will report earnings in September, but Fastenal will soon report sales data for July, and the market will be keeping a close eye on it.Data source: Fastenal presentations. Chart by author. has not had a great year so far, and has notably    in 2019.  FedEx CEO Fred Smith has been vocal in  on his company's performance. In this context the market will be looking for Smith's commentary on global trade trends and their impact on FedEx's international volumes. It will say a lot about the outlook for trade in the third quarter.From a stock-specific perspective, investors will be focusing on monitoring progress in the ongoing integration of TNT Express -- in the previous quarter, the European business faced margin challenges due to an unfavorable sales mix -- and judging how well the company is dealing with margin pressure from burgeoning e-commerce deliveries.With a market cap of around $1.5 billion,   is far from being a household name. However, as an aviation parts supplier and an MRO (maintenance, repair, and operations) services company, it has its finger on the pulse of the aviation aftermarket.This is an extremely important sector for industrial markets because it's been the area of strength for the largest of the industrial conglomerates. For example,  has disappointed with its non-aerospace segments (Otis and Carrier) so far in 2019. But good progress at Pratt & Whitney and Collins Aerospace led to management  on the last .  also saw a bit of weakness in its . But here again, strength in the commercial aviation aftermarket helped management to raise full-year earnings guidance. Meanwhile,   is also relying on aviation spares to help support GE Aviation, particularly as  if the  737 MAX doesn't get back into service.There's no two ways about it: The last thing the giants of the industrial sector need to see is a slowing in the commercial aviation aftermarket. This is why AAR's earnings report close to the end of September (the first of its fiscal 2020) will be very interesting for investors. On one hand, there's actually some upside potential -- the grounding of the 737 MAX may lead to more parts and MRO needed for legacy aircraft as they are flown more.On the other hand, if a slowing in the industrial economy bleeds through into a slowdown in cargo and passenger traffic, it could challenge the profit outlook for many industrial companies; AAR's earnings will give an early look.This article has focused on potential negative trends, but that's because the warning signs were established in previous quarters. However, it's important to note that a change in sentiment on global trade can happen pretty quickly. Moreover, if it really is all about companies pausing spending, rather than a fundamental slowdown, then conditions could reverse soon enough. Time will tell, and these companies' data points will help provide an early look at the future.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

 (NASDAQ:) reported its quarterly earnings results on Thursday, bringing in a profit and sales that were below what analysts called for, which sent the company’s stock declining more than 2% today.The Winona, Minn.-based industrial supply business said that for its , it amassed earnings of 36 cents per share, which was below its profit of 37 cents per share from the same period a year ago. This figure also missed the Wall Street consensus estimate of 36 cents per share.Fastenal Company’s revenue for the period tallied up to $1.37 billion, which missed the Wall Street consensus estimate of $1.38 billion. It is also worth noting that the organization’s sales growth was underwhelming, as it came in at 7.9% when compared to the year-ago quarter–this is the first three-month period in which sales have failed to gain at least 10% year-over-year in nine such periods.This increase was caused in large part due to higher unit sales, which are linked to growth drivers. There were notable contributions from its industrial vending business, onsite locations and construction, among others. Fastenal’s daily sales growth was also 7.9%, which missed the 12.2% and 13.1% gains from the first quarter of its 2019 and its year-ago quarter respectively.Daily sales gained 7% on a monthly basis in June, 9.5% in May and 12.5% in April, all below the same amounts in the company’s year-ago months.FAST stock is down about 2.9% today.The post  appeared first on .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Fastenal Company Earnings: FAST Stock Falls on Q2 Miss@2019-07-11@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/fastenal-company-earnings%3A-fast-stock-falls-on-q2-miss-2019-07-11
"hen industrial and construction supplier   reported second quarter earnings last month, some investors were disappointed as they pointed to the results as a harbinger of declining market conditions for the manufacturing segment.In fact, management acknowledged as much, saying, ""While general economic activity remained positive, we did see slowing in the second quarter of 2019 relative to activity levels experienced in the first quarter of 2019.""Source: Fastenal CompanyBut looking from a broader lens, while short-term results may be negatively impacted by a lull in market demand and higher costs that the company claims are tariff-related, the longer-term growth drivers of onsite locations and vending machines continue to perform well.In early June, the company announced that it surpassed 100,000 active vending devices and celebrated having over 1,000 onsite locations in July. Before we look closer at these growth opportunities, let's look a little more at the recent quarterly results.As mentioned, higher costs and a slowdown in end markets were headwinds for Fastenal. In line with 2018, for the first six months of 2019, 86% of sales occurred in the United States, so domestic macroeconomic conditions play a significant role in how the company performs. The following table compares daily net sales growth through last year (net sales divided by the number of days in the reporting period) as well as gross profit. Fastener products and non-fastener products account for approximately one-third and two-thirds of sales, respectively:Data source: Fastenal financial filings. Though overall sales rose a respectable 7.9% for the quarter, it's apparent that the biggest highlights are trends of slowing growth and increasing costs. Management pointed to increased inflation on net product margins as a growing cost-related factor over the first quarter:While we successfully raised prices as one element of our strategy to offset tariffs placed to date on products sourced from China, those increases were not sufficient to also counter general inflation in the marketplace. We have taken additional actions in the third quarter of 2019 to counter the broader pressures we are experiencing on our costs as well as the additional tariffs that were levied on China-sourced products in May 2019.While it's clear there are some near-term challenges, the longer-term strategy remains on track. The milestones achieved with active vending devices and onsite locations were a reminder of the progress Fastenal has made on projects the company can control.Both the vending machines and onsite program are meant to bring the company closer to the customer, both literally and figuratively. By setting up in a customer's facility, Fastenal creates a stickiness that helps establish a long, productive relationship for both parties. The milestone onsite facility is with an existing customer, Nutrien, the world's largest provider of crop inputs, services, and solutions. A manager at Nutrien described the benefits of the program:Some of our locations are in remote areas, so an immediate benefit of a Fastenal Onsite program is that it shortens supply chain from a distribution standpoint [...] Integration is also very important to us. Having a fully dedicated Fastenal resource allows us to step away from tactical activities to become more efficient and focused on our core business.The most recent quarter saw continued success with these growth drivers. The following table shows what the company reported related to these initiatives, including the rate of daily sales achieved through the two areas:*This does not include more than 15,000 devices that are part of a lease locker program. Data source: Fastenal.The quarterly results certainly highlighted some headwinds from areas out of management's control, but long-term shareholders should be satisfied that the company's focus on growth through vending devices and onsite locations is paying off.Fastenal also announced a dividend increase in July, following a pattern that has given shareholders an annual dividend increase rate of over 15% over the past decade. With the dividend payout ratio hovering around 60%, there's every reason to think this trend will continue, giving shareholders an income stream as any macroeconomic headwinds and cycles play out. The success of management's key strategies along the way should make for an even stronger company in the future.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"Shares in industrial supply companies   and   and mining company  all declined by double digits in May, according to data provided by . MSC's 15.5% fall was almost matched by Fastenal's decline of 13.3%, but both were overshadowed by Freeport-McMoran's 21.1% decline. The reason can be largely put down to some evidence of a cyclical slowdown in the economy, accompanied by fears over the impact of a protracted U.S.-China trade conflict.Image source: Getty Images.Industrial supply companies are seen as good bellwethers of the economy -- they have very short-cycle sales, and when economic activity starts to slow down, their revenue takes a hit. Meanwhile, the key swing factor in Freeport-McMoran's earnings prospects is usually its copper mining activities. Copper is one of the most cyclically aligned commodities out there -- the metal is extensively used in construction, electrical equipment and electronics, machinery, and transportation. The first place investors usually look for any signs of a slowdown in the industrial economy is the Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM). The PMI is a long-established survey of private manufacturing businesses. For reference, a reading above 50 indicates expansion.As you can see below, the PMI and the related New Orders index have come down notably in recent months. Both numbers are still above 50, and the price of copper has only come down a bit lately, but the trend is downward, and the market seems to be joining the dots and projecting a decline in manufacturing activity, which is putting pressure on copper prices. data by .Turning to the company-specific data, the evidence from Fastenal's daily sales data for manufacturing and construction shows the downtrend in the company's daily sales growth in 2019 -- in case you are wondering, the May data was released in June, the stock price decline in May.Data source: Fastenal presentations. Chart by author.MSC Industrial reported its second-quarter earnings in the middle of April, with CEO Erik Gershwind noting, ""At the halfway point of the fiscal year, gross margins and operating expenses are as anticipated, but revenue growth has slightly underperformed our expectations.""A slowdown in sales is the last thing industrial supply companies need as  that 's entry into the industry has held back the kind of margin growth that usually accompanies an ongoing economic expansion.As you can see above, Fastenal's underlying sales growth did bounce back in May, and despite the negative sentiment around the trade dispute and its possible impact on copper demand from China, the impact on copper prices has been pretty mundane so far in 2019.There's little doubt that certain sectors of the industrial economy are facing significant headwinds in 2019 -- notably the automotive sector and parts of consumer electronics -- but there are also areas of strength, such as aerospace, while heavy industrial capital spending is improving. In other words, it's wrong to conclude that cyclical industrial stocks are headed for a sharp contraction in overall demand in 2019.For Freeport-McMoran, the key is the impact of the trade dispute and/or China's growth prospects. Meanwhile, for Fastenal and MSC Industrial, the key will be U.S. industrial economy and whether it matches current expectations. Growth is definitely slowing -- 's forecast is for U.S. industrial production growth to be 2.4% in 2019 and 2% in 2020, after a strong 4% in 2018 -- but it's still an environment in which these companies can grow revenue and earnings.

Warren Buffett has a problem. One-hundred and twelve billion of them to be exact. That’s the amount of cash that  (NYSE:,NYSE:) has on its balance sheet at the end of 2018. And odds are, Buffett’s cash hoard has only grown over the last three months as his vast empire continues to pay some hefty dividends.
The problem for Warren Buffett and Berkshire is that amount of cash starts to be a real drag on its profitability and returns. So, for the last year or so, Buffett has been searching for a firm to buy. And given BRK’s size, it needs to be a big one to move the needle. Unfortunately, the Oracle of Omaha hasn’t found just the right one yet.But there could be plenty of choices.Analysts have started to look at what Buffett could buy to add to the Berkshire Hathaway arsenal. In total, about 141 different firms could meet the Warren Buffett standard for cash flows, profitability and value. Here are the best possible Warren Buffett stocks that regular retail investors may want to snag up as well.

	It’s no secret that Warren Buffett loves insurance stocks and BRK is chockfull of them. That’s because Buffett loves their float. An insurance company’s float is basically all the premiums it’s collected, but hasn’t paid out just yet. This money can be invested in a wide range of things — with some caveats on amounts. Most insurance companies use bonds and other fixed-income instruments, but not all. Berkshire’s subsidiaries use their float to bet on stocks.And so does insurer  (NASDAQ:).CINF is property and causality insurer that has been very successful in using its float to boost its returns over the years. Additionally, the company has some very conservative underwriting standards which have helped limit losses. Combining this plus its local agent-specific businesses model — which partners with existing insurance agencies to promote its businesses — and Cincinnati Financial has been a long-term winner.In fact, with its last dividend hike, CINF has managed to raise its dividend for That sort of steadfastness could be exactly what Buffett is looking for. Moreover, CINF could be an easy fit into Berkshire’s other insurance assets. With a market cap of around $15 billion, the stock would be an easy one for Buffett to swallow as well.

	If there is one thing Buffett likes, its simple to explain businesses that churn out hefty cash flows year in and year out. That’s basically what  (NASADQ:) has been doing for the last 50 years.FAST produces and sells a variety of hardware and supplies that other industrial firms or businesses need to keep running. This includes everything from boring nuts and bolts to more exotic fare like tools and pumps. It’s basically an industrial supplier to the industrials. That’s a good place to be.Over the years, Fastenal has cemented itself as one of the top players in this niche. The key for the firm comes down to its relationships with other industrials and manufacturers. FAST’s system makes it easy for procurement managers to order. The firm operates more than 2,220 branches and a hefty online website. But the real win is that FAST has been able to get inside manufacturers themselves. This comes from Fastenal’s storage bin replenishment and vending machine programs. Here, FAST is able to directly integrate into a manufacturer’s ordering/supply chain and allows for ease of repeat customers. Simply, FAST is able to integrate itself into a customers’ workflow. Last year, the firm processed more than 41 million orders and pulled in more than . More importantly, it has allowed FAST to grow at a very hefty clip in terms of margins and profits.With a wide moat, great growth and $20 billion market-cap, Buffett could and should swallow up Fastenal.

	Buffett is clearly a fan of homeownership as several of Berkshire Hathaway’s subsidiaries focus on products for construction and decorating. This includes carpet-producer Shaw Flooring. Under this banner, paint-producer  (NYSE:) could get the nod from Buffett.With its 2017 purchase of Valspar, SHW became the global leader in paints and coatings. This includes a hefty amount of paints and stains for personal/home use. But the real reason why Buffett could give SHW a nod is its industrial businesses. Sherwin-Williams produces a ton of different coatings and paints for a variety of industries — including lucrative aerospace and automotive/transportation finishes. These sort of performance coatings have been a bright spot in its business —  in the last quarter. Profits here jumped by over 60% as Valspar was able to significantly contribute. That’s the sort of growth that Buffett would love to see inside Berkshire.And Buffett could find plenty to love in its dividend as well.Thanks to big growth in several of these performance coatings segments, Sherwin-Williams recently was able to raise its dividend by  Meanwhile, the stocks payout ratio is measly 23%. That leaves plenty of room for future payout increases.In the end, SHW is the kind of specialty industrial business that throws off serious cash flows. Exactly what characterizes most Warren Buffett stocks.

	The long joke among investors is that investing in an airline was the surest way to lose to money. For the longest time, no Warren Buffett stocks were airlines. But that was then and this is now. And now Berkshire counts holdings in the four major airlines, but (NYSE:) could ultimately be the one that gets bought out.Things have changed a lot for the industry. Thanks to deregulation and the wave of mergers, the number of airlines has shrunk in the U.S. That has provided the remaining ones with larger operating footprints and better profit profiles. Additionally, dropping oil prices have reduced one of the biggest costs for the sector. That’s what initially drew Buffett into the sector in the first place.Why Southwest will get the love is that it the airline checks a lot of boxes for Buffett.For one thing, the corporate culture at LUV is top notch and is still run by early insiders and founders. Secondly, it’s moat as a carrier is deeply entrenched and many low-cost competitors have difficulty competing. Finally, the top-notch carrier may be cheap.LUV cut its guidance twice in the last two months thanks to woes over canceled flights. Southwest flies almost  — though not exclusively 737 Max planes. With that, shares have dropped and now trade for just 10 times free cash flows. That’s a very juicy figure and could get Buffett to just buy out the stock.Businesses that produce plenty of cash flows because they have no overhead are something Buffett likes as well. So, when you combine with this with an irreplaceable moat, you know Buffett is 100% onboard. This could help explain his attraction to  (NYSE:).Moody’s — along with rival  (NYSE:) — provides credit ratings, research, and risk analysis services. And as one of the three main ratings agencies, investors, banks and other customers rely on MCO to make their investment decisions. This includes BRK. In fact, a company can’t issue a bond without a ratings agency giving it it’s blessing.The best part is that Moody’s only real overhead is salary. That leads to plenty of cash generation and mega-sized margins for its products. This year,  that it will generate more than $1.6 billion in free cash flows. Meanwhile, the firm has been more than happy to share those cash flows with investors. Over the last five years, MCO has managed to grow its dividend by an average of 12%. Currently, the stock yields 1.03%.These factors are some of the reasons why Buffett and Berkshire own a hefty slog of Moody’s shares.Add in its growth potential from side analytic business and the need for robust credit research and there’s a good chance that Buffett could finally take the firm private.Disclosure: At the time of writing, Aaron Levitt did not hold a position in any of the stocks mentioned.The post  appeared first on .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@5 Elephant-Sized Companies Warren Buffett Could Buy@2019-05-01@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/5-elephant-sized-companies-warren-buffett-could-buy-2019-05-01
"nvestors in Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST) saw new options begin trading this week, for the July 19th expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the FAST options chain for the new July 19th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $62.50 strike price has a current bid of $1.60.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $62.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $60.90 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of FAST, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $65.09/share today.

Because the $62.50 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 67%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.56% return on the cash commitment, or 16.11% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.


Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Fastenal Co., and highlighting in green where the $62.50 strike is located relative to that history:


   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $67.50 strike price has a current bid of $1.65.  If an investor was to purchase shares of FAST stock at the current price level of $65.09/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $67.50.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 6.24% if the stock gets called away at the July 19th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if FAST shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Fastenal Co., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing FAST's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $67.50 strike highlighted in red:



   
Considering the fact that the $67.50 strike represents an approximate 4% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 62%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.53% boost of extra return to the investor, or 15.95% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.


The implied volatility in the put contract example is 30%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 27%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $65.09) to be 26%.

n the surface, industrial parts supplier   is a boring, easy-to-understand business. As the economy waxes and wanes, so, too, will the  company's top and bottom lines. Although that big-picture view is true, it misses a huge opportunity that Fastenal is working on today. One that has been and will continue to support its long-term growth. Here's the secret sauce that management is using today to spice up its business.. It is not a sexy business, but it is one that's pretty important to its customers. Without the often tiny parts that Fastenal makes, its customers' operations would grind to a halt. So being a reliable partner that makes quality parts is an important attribute, but not one that's going to get investors excited. It's more along the lines of table stakes in a highly fragmented and competitive business.   Image source: Getty Images.At the end of the first quarter Fastenal had just under 2,200 of the branches through which it sells its products. This has long been the core of the business, supporting its relationships with customers. That number, however, was down 6% year over year. Despite the decline in its branch count, first-quarter sales were up 10% and earnings per share advanced around 11%. If you simply looked at these numbers you might walk away thinking that Fastenal is doing more with less -- but that's not the big story.  In fact, the company has been closing branches for a number of years now. At the end of 2013, Fastenal had roughly 2,680 branch locations. So over that roughly five-year span the company's store count has fallen around 18%. That's a huge decline. And yet sales have continued higher just the same, with trailing 12-month revenues and earnings per share higher by around 45% and 75%, respectively, over the past five years. data by Fastenal is good at what it does, but not good enough that it can shut 18% of its stores and still continue to expand like that. So what's going on? Fastenal has figured out a way to get even closer to its companies.The main focus of a company like Fastenal is to become an indispensable supplier. Or, at the very least, really hard to get rid of. Historically it's done that by being reliable and providing high-quality parts. Now, however, Fastenal's growth is being driven by actually getting inside the companies with which it works.With an on-site location, Fastenal basically operates a customer's parts inventory for it. At the end of the first quarter it had 945 on-site locations, up nearly 40% year over year. It has two primary methods here, managing an open inventory system at a customer location and some 83,400 vending machines that it maintains inside customer facilities. For reference, the vending machines contain parts, not candy and soda.   Put the 40% year-over-year increase in on-site locations against the 6% decline in branches and it's pretty clear what's driving Fastenal's growth today. But don't stop there; the bigger picture here is more important. While Fastenal has, indeed, found a great way to continue expanding its business, it is doing so in a way that makes it even more vital to its customers' operations.It's fairly easy to switch to a new supplier if the parts a customer gets come in a big box that the customer then deals with internally. The only thing that has to change is the box holding the parts. It's much more difficult to shift to a new supplier if your existing supplier is handling your internal parts processes. That includes keeping track of what parts are in need of replacement and ensuring that the parts go to the places where they are needed. Once a company outsources those two tasks it would need to either rebuild the processes and controls to exit a relationship with Fastenal or find some other company with the same capabilities as Fastenal. Neither would be an easy task.On-site locations, then, are the real underlying story behind Fastenal's still-solid growth outlook. Yes, the company's sales and earnings will wax and wane with economic activity, but its business is getting even more sticky (for lack of a better term) as it further integrates itself into its customers' businesses. When you read about earnings, this is the story to keep an eye on. data by Fastenal is a very well-run company, a fact proven out by two decades of annual dividend increases (the annualized dividend increase over the past decade was roughly 20%, an impressive figure). And it has been getting even better by getting inside its customers' operations. But Fastenal stock is rarely cheap.Today its price-to-earnings and price-to-cash-flow ratios are a little below their five-year averages, while price to sales and price to book value are a little above. The dividend yield at 2.4% doesn't really stand out (3% appears to be a more attractive entry point, historically speaking). For investors looking to add a good company at a reasonable price, Fastenal is worth a deep dive. But for most, this is one to put on your wish list for the next economic downturn. If you can hold out until Wall Street is frightened by a temporary economic malaise, you'll likely be able to buy Fastenal at a discount, knowing that its customers will have a hard time switching to a new supplier.   When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"ndustrial and construction supplier,  , has a simple approach to business. Its motto -- ""Growth Through Customer Service"" -- focuses on recruiting quality employees (now numbering over 21,000) to find new customers and then grow alongside them. It's a formula that's been working, as sales have grown at a compound annual rate of 10% since 2009. Notably, this dividend payer has also shared its success with shareholders by growing its annual payout over 14% annually in that same period. Read on to find out how this company is on track to enjoy continued success and why it should have a place in your portfolio.Image source: FastenalFastenal started over 50 years ago, supplying threaded fasteners to small businesses, and it has grown into an industrial supplier with nine major product lines that include safety, welding, and janitorial supplies.Historically, Fastenal has used public stores to get -- and stay -- close to its customers. These are located strategically within distribution networks and service more than one customer. District and branch employees are empowered to customize stock to suit a particular area need, which reflects the conviction that employees are one of the company's main strengths.More recently, Fastenal's main source of growth has shifted to onsite locations and industrial vending devices. Both opportunities bring Fastenal directly under its customers' roofs. For example, the company's vending devices are placed directly in work areas around a customer's facility, similar to food and drink machines, and they're stocked with items that would normally be kept at a facility's central warehouse. These can include safety gear, tools, cleaning items, rigging, and of course, fasteners. The convenience for busy workers is obvious, but companies can also save money by allowing users to get what they need to finish the job instead of stashing extra inventory in toolboxes or around work areas with the hope of avoiding extra trips to the warehouse. Fastenal, of course, supplies all the inventory and can increase sales by supplying items previously provided by other vendors. Warehouse inventory decreases, which offers its own savings for clients.The value proposition is expanded with the company's digital solutions segment. Here, it overlaps the physical inventory monitoring and document exchange such as purchase orders, shipping notices, and invoices with a customer's Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. Management believes the total revenue from onsite locations will grow ""materially over time."" As of March 2019, the company had 83,410 vending devices installed, and it believes the market can support up to 1.7 million. The expansion of these newer segments can be seen below with the spike in the number of onsite locations as well as the total number of company vending devices installed: Overall net sales growth has accelerated accordingly in the last three years from 2.4% in 2016 to 10.8% in 2017 and 13.1% in 2018. That growth has continued into the current year -- management recently noted:We also experienced growth in sales to 81 of our top 100 customers in the first quarter of 2019, which compares to growth in sales to 78 of our top 100 customers in the first quarter of 2018. These metrics describe healthy general industrial activity in our markets.Certainly a good domestic economy helps a company that supplies industrial manufacturing, especially when almost 86% of 2018 sales were in the U.S. With a customer base consisting mainly of manufacturing and non-residential construction markets, business can be cyclical. However, management states, ""We believe our model has certain protections that moderate the volatility of our results around cyclical changes."" These protections include a large number of customers that operate within a wide range of segments and industries.In the most recently reported quarter, revenue was up 10.4% year over year. Meanwhile, management also paid out $123 million in dividends. Shareholders should feel confident that the recent dividend growth will continue. Dividends paid as a percentage of net earnings have declined from almost 70% in 2016 to less than 60% last year. The company has paid quarterly dividends since 2011 and has made clear its intention to sustain that course.  Shares of Fastenal have gained 24% year to date as of this writing and currently trade at 23 times forward earnings. It should also be noted that the company has announced a 2:1 stock split that will be effective after the market close on May 22, 2019.Despite a cyclical business and client base, investors shouldn't be scared to start a position in this company, even after the gains put up this year. Fastenal has significant market opportunities like vending machine forging new paths to growth, and the company is simultaneously strengthening its relationship with customers, creating a pinwheel effect that will deliver sustainable results. Investors should feel good about partnering with a proven management team focused on its employees, clients, and shareholders.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"here's no end of discussion regarding the potential of   to eat the lunch of almost every industry it touches. Not all of it is accurate.However, the U.S. industrial-supply wholesaler market has definitely been feeling the heat of online competition, with companies like  ,  ,   and   experiencing margin pressure in recent years. But just how significant is it, and should it change the investment thesis around the stock?In a nutshell, the answers to the questions above are ""very"" and ""yes."" Here's why.Let's start by looking at the chart below. As you can see, over the long term, the operating margins of industrial-supply companies have tended to follow the trend of U.S. industrial production. data by .As the industrial economy improves, the supply companies grow sales, and then operating margin leverage kicks in; the opposite occurs when a downturn is in place. You can see this pattern in the upswing from 2002 to 2008, the downswing from 2008 to mid-2009, and another upswing from mid-2009 to 2015.However, if you look closely at the chart, you can see the recovery in industrial production that started in 2016 hasn't been accompanied by an increase in margin. In fact, the margin trend of companies in the industry has been downward, with companies like WESCO repeatedly . Part of that is due to rising material costs, but there's no doubt that Amazon's  expansion in the industrial-supply sector has forced traditional companies to adjust their strategies.As industrial-supply companies are highly cyclical, it makes sense to look at their revenue and operating margins over a cycle, rather than just look at one or two years' worth of isolated data. So here's a look at the average margin over two cycles. For reference, the data is taken from peak margin to peak margin -- which naturally correlates with the direction of growth in industrial production.The chart shows a clear deterioration in 2015-2019 compared to 2008-2015 for MSC Industrial and Grainger; the comparison gets worse if you consider that the 2008-2015 period includes the deep recession of 2009. Fastenal has done much better, but this is largely because it .Fastenal has been able to deal with margin pressure by shifting its sales mix to higher-margin revenue streams. The deeper question is: What would Fastenal's margin be without pressure from Amazon?Data source: Company presentations. Chart by author.Operating margin at MSC Industrial and Grainger across the last cycle is around 13% lower than it was in the previous cycle. Of course, if the long-term margin in an industry is lower by 13%, then assuming valuations (market cap to earnings) are consistent, revenue would have to rise by nearly 15% across comparable cycles, just to keep the market cap (share price) constant.The pressure on share prices is obvious, and it's why the only company that's come close to the return of the  since 2015 is Fastenal. It's a good stock performance, but consider that Fastenal has had to execute very well on an operational basis just for its stock to keep pace with the S&P 500 index: data by .For a rough estimate of how much Amazon may have reduced value in the industry, consider that the highly fragmented industrial-supply industry is seen as having a current combined revenue of $74 billion.  A rough approximation of a 12% operating margin across the cycle produces an earnings figure of around $9 billion. Assigning a market multiple of 15 times earnings would give companies in the industry a current market cap of around $133 billion.Of course, if margin and earnings weren't 13% lower than in the previous cycle, then the estimation of industry market cap could be around $153 billion, or $20 billion higher than it is now. All told, you could argue that this is how much value Amazon's entry into the industry has cost its traditional players in terms of market valuation.Image source: Getty Images.If the thesis holds that online competition from Amazon (and others) is causing margin decline across the industry, then investors should focus on companies consciously making efforts to deal with these pressures rather than pretend they don't exist. For example, Grainger has made efforts to .Alternatively, investors could buy shares in companies benefiting from the shift toward e-fulfillment, such as .Whichever way you look at it, Amazon's entry in the marketplace is a game-changer, and investors should think differently about how to invest in the sector.Motley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.

"A 2018 survey of CEO pay in 22 countries around the world including the U.S. found that the average CEO was paid  annually.Here in Canada, where I live, the average CEO was paid a little more than $7 million. In the UK, it was almost a million higher than Canada.How about the U.S.?Well, it was the number one country for CEO pay at $14.25 million — or more than four times the global average. Are U.S. CEOs worth that much — or that much more than CEOs in other countries? Not by a long shot. But that doesn’t stop some professorial types from singing their praises.“The efforts of America’s highest-earning 1% have been one of the more dynamic elements of the global economy. It’s not popular to say, but one reason their pay has gone up so much is that CEOs really have upped their game relative to many other workers in the U.S. economy,”  George Mason University Economics professor Tyler Cowen in his recent book Big Business: A Love Letter to an American Anti-Hero. CEOs might have a more complicated job than they had 20 years ago, but that doesn’t justify pay that is  times the average U.S. rank-and-file worker. U.S. Congressman Keith Ellison released a report in 2018 that suggested a median employee at Mattel (NYSE: would have to work at the company for  to earn as much as a CEO’s annual pay.  Ridiculous. Investors need only to consider one fact. “Since 2008, the 100 companies with the lowest CEO compensation within the S&P 500 index have outperformed the 100 with the highest compensation every year except 2013,” Bloomberg  in March of this year. “The annualized return from 2008 to 2018 was 17.2 percent compared with 8.4 percent.”It is clear that investing in companies who are doing a good job cutting the gap between the CEO’s pay and the average employee is key to your portfolio’s future success.Here are seven stocks to buy in that vein.Source: 
	CEO Pay: $5.1 millionPay Ratio: 32:1The median worker’s pay at Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:) is $157,491, the 22nd highest amount of compensation in the . It kind of makes sense. Do you really want a bunch of low-paid workers manufacturing the company’s da Vinci surgical robotic systems? One wrong move and your hernia repair becomes a one-way ticket to the morgue. I’m facetious, but I think you get my meaning. By having well-paid employees, not only are they likely to be happier; they’re probably more productive especially when they realize that the CEO makes just 32 times their pay, about one-tenth the U.S. average. Intuitive Surgical has come a long way from  when it launched the first da Vinci system. At the end of 2018, it had almost 5,000 systems installed; 64% of them in the U.S. with Europe and Asia its next biggest markets, but with plenty of room to grow. The global surgical robotics market is expected to grow by almost  annually over the next seven years to $17 billion. ISRG currently has a 17% market share. If it grows that market share to 25% by 2025, it translates into an additional $1.4 billion in revenue. As people age, minimally invasive surgery will become even more critical than it already is. As secular trends go, ISRG is one of the best bets you can make. Source: Shutterstock
	CEO Pay: $4.4 millionPay Ratio: 53:1American Water Works (NYSE:) CEO Susan Story is the only woman on this list so if ESG issues are of interest to you; AWK is an excellent stock to consider. As for its business, that’s also good. AWK was recently  one of Barron’s 100 Most Sustainable U.S. Companies. Also, Bloomberg included AWK on its list of 230 companies for the 2019 Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index (GEI), a group selected for their dedication advancing the cause of women. That’s a big deal when you consider that providing equal pay for U.S. women would add  to the economy on an annual basis.  Here’s another reason to like the water utility. AWK stock hasn’t had a single year with a negative total return delivering a 10-year annualized total return of 20.6%, which goes entirely against the theory that utilities are dull and poor performers over the long haul.   Providing water services to more than 14 million people in 46 states, AWK is a stock whose business will never go the way of the Dodo bird.Source: Shutterstock
	CEO Pay: $2.0 million Pay Ratio: 58:1If you’ve owned Fastenal (NASDAQ:) for the past five years, your patience is finally being rewarded after spending four years rangebound between $40-$50. Up 32% year to date through April 15, FAST stock looks like its gallop to $100 is underway. Consider that the supplier of industrial and construction supplies grew revenues and operating profits over the past five years by 49% and 40% to  and $1.0 billion respectively. And for that, its stock went sideways. In the company’s Q1 2019 earnings, Fastenal grew the top and bottom lines by double digits. Revenues were up  on a like-for-like basis, and net earnings rose 11.9% to $0.68 a share. Helping move the needle is its industrial vending machine program. In the first quarter, it signed 5,603, bringing the total number to 83,410, an increase of 13.4% over Q1 2018. Sales at those machines grew in the high teens in the first quarter. And you thought vending machines were a thing of the past. Fastenal is all about customer service. It’s got the growth to prove it.Source: Shutterstock
	CEO Pay: $1.7 millionPay Ratio: 59:1Say what you will about Amazon (NASDAQ:) CEO and founder Jeff Bezos, but you can’t deny his company’s success. A $10,000 investment ten years ago is worth almost $247,000 today. Bezos might be  in your opinion but his ability to deliver what the world’s craving is astonishing. Everything Amazon does is to please the customer. In Bezos’ annual letter to shareholders, he mentions the word customer on 49 occasions.  “Much of what we build at AWS is based on listening to customers. It’s critical to ask customers what they want, listen carefully to their answers, and figure out a plan to provide it thoughtfully and quickly (speed matters in business!). No business could thrive without that kind of customer obsession. But it’s also not enough. The biggest needle movers will be things that customers don’t know to ask for,” the CEO .How many CEOs do you know that think like this? I can count the number on two hands. He might be an a**hole in the minds of many, but he’s a brilliant one, cut from the same cloth as Elon Musk.Source: 
	CEO Pay: $2.4 millionPay Ratio: 76:1The cream always rises to the top. Garmin (NASDAQ:) is one of those companies that seems to fly under the radar despite being a reasonably large company. If you own Fitbit (NASDAQ:) stock, however, you’re likely more than a little aware of Garmin. In the most recent quarter, Garmin delivered boffo earnings. Since announcing  results February 20, GRMN stock is up 24%. A key highlight from earnings was its guidance for 2019. Analysts were expecting earnings of $3.52 a share on $3.43 billion in revenue. Garmin CEO Cliff Pemble’s outlook is for $3.70 a share on the bottom line and $3.50 billion on the top line. “2018 was another remarkable year of revenue and operating income growth driven by strong performance in our aviation, marine, outdoor and fitness segments,” Pemble  in its news release. “Entering 2019, we see many opportunities ahead and believe that we are well positioned to seize these opportunities with a strong lineup of products across all of our segments.”Hopefully, you’re beginning to see a trend. Companies that keep the pay ratio low tend to deliver strong long-term results. Since Pemble became CEO in , GRMN stock has generated a 19.7% annualized total return for shareholders, 440 basis points greater than the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:).  Source: 
	CEO Pay: $4.8 million  Pay Ratio: 88:1A lot of investors might have a problem owning shopping malls. I certainly wouldn’t. But they’ve got to be good. They can’t be Class C malls with no-name retailers filling the place. That’s a recipe for disaster. Zacks recently wondered if Simon Property’s (NYSE:) efforts were enough to battle the retail blues. Are we seriously still having that discussion in 2019. Well, it turns out there are a lot of crappy retailers still operating including Sears. “The deepening of the relationship with existing tenants, and the launch of its online retail platform, weaved with an omni-channel strategy, will likely be accretive to Simon Property’s long-term growth,”  Zack’s equity research team April 8.“In fact, the company is investing billions and actively restructuring its portfolio, aiming at premium acquisitions and transformative redevelopments. The transformational plans include the addition of hotels, restaurants, residences and luxury stores.”The fact is, very few retail mall owners have the vision of the Simon family. They’ve been doing this a long time. They’re more than capable of rolling with the punches.Good brick-and-mortar retail isn’t disappearing. Just the crappy kind is. Know the difference.Source: 
	CEO Pay: Pay Ratio: 141:1O’Reilly Automotive (NASDAQ:) makes it on to the list despite hitting a  of $398.41 in early April and carrying on past $400 in the days that followed. Up 19% year to date through April 15, ORLY’s only had one year of negative returns since 2009. As a result, you’re looking at a 10-year annualized total return of 27.3%, almost double the S&P 500. In 2018, the retailer of aftermarket auto parts had same-store sales growth of , at the top of its estimate for the year, the company’s 26th year with an increase. In 2019, it expects same-store sales growth of 3%-5%. This past year it opened 200 net new stores in 36 states. It plans to open as many as 210 in 2019. It now has 5,219 stores across the U.S.  On the bottom line, O’Reilly increased its EPS by 27% over 2017 to $16.10, the 10th consecutive year with a 15% increase in earnings. In 2019, it expects EPS of at least $17.37. Given its track record, you should expect more than that.

Let's sign 375 to 400. There's 52 weeks in the year. You've got to take out a couple of those weeks because it's the holidays and a lot happens in those weeks...On vending, our goal is to do 23,000 units to 25,000 units. So, there's 254 business days in the year. We need to sign roughly 100 every day to get to the high end of that number. If we sign 90 every day, we're at the low end of that number. We were just shy of 90 in the first quarter. But in the month of March, we rounded up to 100. We were at 99.6 [vending machines signed up] per day. So, we were off [to] a nice start. The reasoning behind these lofty sales targets is fairly straightforward. In chasing brisk on-premise expansion, Fastenal gains immediate market share, but more crucially, each vending machine or Onsite installation also creates a conduit for long-term supplies and services revenue. Through the first quarter, Fastenal signed 105 new Onsite locations, and active Onsite locations grew 39.4% year over year, to 945 in total.

Net sales in the holiday quarter fell 11% to $3.31 billion, missing analysts' expectations for $3.33 billion, and earnings per share excluding a non-cash impairment charge came in at $1.20, above the analyst consensus of $1.11. Comparable sales fell 1.4%.The company raised its earnings guidance for fiscal 2019 from flat growth to a range of $2.11 to $2.20 per share, excluding one-time charges, or an increase of 3% to 7.3%. For 2020 and beyond, management said it expected gross margin improvement of 2 percentage points, operating margin expansion of 3 points, and double-digit growth rates in earnings per share.That rosy outlook was immediately challenged by analysts on the , who couldn't understand how Bed Bath & Beyond could expect gross margin to improve so much when it has been falling in recent quarters. CEO Steve Temares would not provide any details, nor would he comment on the  him and the entire board, news of which had previously sent the stock soaring 22%. That silence did nothing to lend credibility to the company's turnaround plans.Motley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''.  These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand.  Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).  Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

And thank you for joining us for our first quarter .I'm going to -- before I step into Holden's flipbook, just going to touch on a few comments that I had with our leadership in our normal call at 7 o'clock this morning to talk about the quarter, to give them a little insight about some things that we'll be focusing on the call, as well as just some of the comments I made to them.My first comment to them this morning was a sincere thank you for a job well done. I think this is a really nice start to the year. I'm pleased with the performance we're seeing across our business units throughout the planet and a very positive start to the year.I also mentioned them about the challenge that comes when you get into the -- a multi-year improvement in business. So, when I think back to stepping into this role back in 2000 -- late in 2015, we've had a tough year. The economy had not been our friend that year. And when you're exposed to the industrial marketplace and it flips on you, it can cause some pain in the short-term. But we kept focusing on what we focus on. That's our customer.We kept focusing on things to make our business better, and we really started the transition to a much more focused approach on some of our growth drivers, particularly breathing some new life into vending and challenging ourselves to look at Onsites as a meet -- as not a solution, when there's not an alternative, but as a means to grow faster and a new growth drive within our business.It's a wonderful way to extend what is the traditional Fastenal relationship, but lower your cost structure at the same time. And I hope these numbers are all correct. I haven't proofed them through our screening process. And this is just me jotting down some numbers. But what I shared with them was, if I stack together multiple years, five months of the last seven months, if I look at it, taking the three years added together and again, I hope I calculated it correctly, I believe five months or less seven months, we've been 30% plus, when you look at the cumulative impact of the last three years.And November and January were the only two months that didn't break that 30% and they were at 29%. So, a good number. And I believe for the last 14 months, if you looked at on a two-year basis and combined year one and year two growth, you're at a number that starts with the 2. So, north of 20%. But since August, I believe that number is north of 25%. So, not only are we -- do we have great local plans to engage with our customer and grow our business, but we're able to stack it on top of some comps that are frankly challenging. I'm really pleased with what the group is doing, and I'm really proud of the group and proud to be associated with them.I also shared with them one of their -- one of the blessings and curses of the Internet age, is it's easy to -- for people to make comments. Sometimes you read through a newspaper and some of the comments you see, you're kind of like, boy, that person just seems angry about something that's not this article, but they're just angry or you can tell that person's maybe political view is driving their commentary they're putting into an article. But at 10 o'clock last night, I was reading a comment that came in from a customer. And every comment that comes into Fastenal, I'm on an email distribution list and I read through them.Sometimes I do it late at night before I go to bed. Sometimes I do it early in the morning. And I'm reading one last night. It was a fellow. He said, I'm an older gentlemen, I'm 61 years old. That pain me a little bit because I'm 55. And I hear somebody at 61 refer to themselves that old was a little troubling, but that's a different issue.But this individual was talking about, where our branch, it was a San Antonio Texas branch, but where our branch went above and beyond the call and really helped them solve the problem. And I floated out to our regional leadership last night and I said, you know what, folks, this is what we're about. We're about solving peoples' problems. Because in today's world, sometimes it's hard to find people to help you solve a problem.And it was fun one to share because sometimes you get in a few here and there that aren't as positive and you assess them to understand what we can do to be better.But now, I'll flip the Holden's book here. We grew -- we had 68% -- $0.68 of earnings and I start there, almost 12% earnings-per-share growth. Bottom line is we grew our earnings faster than our sales. And that's not an easy act in a quarter, where weather was impact -- very impactful and with one less selling day. We were in the situation of -- with $20 million a day in revenue, there's a chunk of revenue, a chunk of gross profit dollars that are out there but the expenses typically are. So to pull off what we did, when we were down a day is a pretty positive thing.Despite the challenging weather, our demand continued to be healthy. Our daily sales growth was 12.2% in the quarter. And I think Holden said it well, 2019 has started where 2018 left off. Operating margin expanded 20 basis points and our incremental margin was 21.7. As we've talked about in prior calls, our growth drivers are changing the mix of our business.If we're successful with it, it's going to pull gross margins down. If we're successful with it, we should be able to leverage our operating expenses. And it should result in a great win for our customer, for our employee, for our supplier and for you, our shareholders. And I think you saw that in the first quarter here. But sequentially, we did hold gross margin flat, which was really a sign of some of the price increases we put in late last year in the wake of tariffs and inflations, allowed us a little breathing room in the short-term.But Holden will touch on that a little bit more in his comments.We talked about this in the past. Our business, as it continues to grow with larger customers and with international customers, sometimes we get caught in a situation where you have a customer who is doing some window dressing at the end of the year, end of the quarter. And they frankly stop paying with two, three, four weeks left in the quarter and it makes for a challenging situation. Our solution here is to constantly be engaged in discussion with our customer about -- our value proposition to you is a better supply chain.We take inventory up to your balance sheet. Don't do this to us at the end of the quarter because what it ultimately does, it puts us in a position where we can't fund inventory. But there's a trade-off. If we know we're going to have an extra $5 million in receivables, we have to squeeze that somewhere else and that doesn't serve our customer. And we need to be engaged in that dialogue and challenge. If you want to do window dressing, do it with somebody else's payable, not with ours. And -- but we did produced stronger cash flow in the quarter and allowed us to pay a higher dividend and reduced debt a little bit.Onsites, I remember, when years ago we did CSP and we really went through a change in our branch network. But at some point in time, we stopped talking about CSP because CSP became part of us. Now, we're going to keep talking about Onsites from the standpoint, sharing with you our location count and our penetration of the market and where we're finding success.But we're going to break a thousand Onsites sometime here in the second quarter. I guess, that's a forward-looking statement, but it's one I'm pretty safe in saying. But it's truly part of Fastenal now. We have Onsites throughout our region, throughout our districts. And so it's not something we're experimenting with, or pushing people to change or even pushing customers to consider and change.We're doing all that, but we're doing that from a base of knowledge similar to a -- not too many years ago, when we were talking to the industry about vending machines. But on Onsites, our goals are pretty simple this year. Let's sign 375 to 400. There's 52 weeks in the year. You've got to take out a couple of those weeks because it's the holidays and a lot happens in those weeks.But if we can do eight signings per week and do it 50 weeks of the year, that's 400. And so in the first quarter, we got off to a really nice start. We hit that number, and we signed 105. So, very pleased. Our sales growth, removing the transferred sales, so if I have an existing customer and we go Onsite, we'll probably pull some revenue out of a branch and move it over there. But ignoring that, that business is growing north 20%. Really pleased with what the team is doing.On vending, our goal is to do 23,000 units to 25,000 units. So, there's 254 business days in the year. We need to sign roughly a 100 every day to get it to the high end of that number. If we sign 90 every day, we're at the low end of that number. We were just shy of 90 in the first quarter. But in the month of March, we rounded up to a 100. We were at 99.6 per day. So, we were off to, I think, a nice start. And again, it's just part of our extension into our customers' facilities.Speaking of vending, I had a new experience yesterday. So, one of the things that we've struggled with is, we've had, I remember a few years ago at Investor Day, talked about the idea of having outdoor lockers or having lockers where we can do deliveries into.Frankly, we struggled to make the technology easy to use. And so we didn't get really much traction with it. And we have very few branches that have outdoor lockers. We have now built the interface between our point-of-sales system and our vending platform, which is a third-party software. And yesterday morning, I ordered something. We had turned on our Winona branch on Monday. So yesterday morning, I ordered something. I immediately had a confirmation of that order and a couple hours later I got an email, your order is ready to pick up and I went over and I punched in my six digit code and I pulled an item out of the locker. It was a really easy and seamless transaction.That doesn't mean we're going to be getting into the retail business anytime soon. But if I think of our Onsites, if I think of our customers that need something and they want to get in and out quickly or they are coming in after hours, it provides a great extension of our -- of the hours of our day and our ability to serve our customers. And I'm really excited about what that means, but really also proud of our technology team for developing that and it worked really easily. And I've gotten in the habit in recent months of buying a lot of stuff online.One of the companies I'm really impressed with and I buy from them once a week to understand what they're changing and I keep bringing comments to our folks as a result. I don't know if any of you have ever bought on Walmart online. They do a really nice job. Now, again, we're not a retailer, but making it easy and making it efficient for your customer is an important part of the equation. And we finally have that working. National Accounts grew 17% in the first quarter. The team continues do a great job of making promises to customers. And our branch and Onsite network, along with everybody else that supports them, does a great job of honoring those promises. So, good -- good quarter.Outside the US, exchange rate is a full right now. International is about 14% of our revenue and we grew in the mid-teens. I believe the number was about 17%, and so continued to be really impressed with our teams there, and our ability to extend the U.S and Canadian relationships broadly around the planet. So, excellent job to the team.With that, I'm going to turn over to Holden. But before I do that, when I read through his notes, one thing jumped out at me and that was the PMI at 55.4 and I almost -- when I read stuff or even read his notes, it almost felt like that was kind of an eee number (ph). And I've been here over 23 years, and I've never thought of 55.4 as an E-numberand I've seen that in some of the external reporting.So, we're seeing a good tone in the marketplace. Holden is going to touch on some oil and gas concerns. And being a farm kid, I know the agricultural side has had some tough time in the last year with commodity prices and I'm sure there'll be some weakness there. But we're pretty bullish on what we're seeing.Holden? -- Great. Thank you very much. Good morning. So, let's just jump on to slide five. Total sales, as Dan indicated, were up 10.4%. There was one fewer sales day in the first quarter versus last year. So, on a same-day basis, sales were up 12.2%. We estimate that severe weather in the Northern US and Central Canada reduced sales by between 60 basis points and 90 basis points. So, remember last year, there was a weather issue as well, so net of last year's weather impact. The total effect was probably 20 basis points to 30 basis points.In March, our daily sales growth was 12.7%. Pricing in response to tariffs and general inflation contributed 90 basis points to 120 basis points in the period. This is below the level of the fourth quarter of 2018, but incremental progress is being masked in the current period by having to grow over the price increases that began to benefit last year's 1Q.We do look at it and believe that sequentially, our price realization was slightly higher. From a macro standpoint, as Dan said, the PMI averaged 55.4 in the first quarter of 2019. This is the lowest level in nine quarters, which is getting a lot of the print. But it does still constitute a healthy level, as reflected in continued low to mid single-digit growth in industrial production.Relatedly, our manufacturing and markets were up 13.4%, with recent trends remaining in force. Most sub verticals that we track are healthy, the main exception being oil and gas which remains soft. Construction was up 13.1% in the first quarter of 2019. The January comparison was easy, but February and March also continued to grow double-digits, as a result of healthy markets and strong internal selling energy.From a product standpoint, on a daily sales basis, fasteners were up 11.8% and non-fasteners were up 12.7%. In March, fasteners outgrew non-fasteners. Fastener growth has been sustained at high levels, while safety growth moderated to a mid-teens rate following what were two years of 20% plus growth in that product vertical.This has served to narrow the growth gap between fasteners and other products. But overall, we remain pleased with the growth of our main product categories. From a customer standpoint, National Accounts were up 16.9% in the quarter, with 81 of our top 100 accounts growing. Growth to non-national accounts was mid single-digits. Nearly, 65% of our branches grew in the first quarter.In terms of market tone, regional leadership remains constructive on demand, with the caution that was evident last November largely gone. The exception, as I mentioned, was oil and gas. We haven't seen the weakness in that market deepened, but we have seen it broadened across more of our regions. Still on the whole, 2019 seems to be starting much as 2018 finished.Now to slide six. Our gross margin was 47.7% in the first quarter of 2019, down a 100 basis points from first quarter of 2018, but flat on a sequential basis. Something we haven't seen since the first quarter of 2015. On a year-over-year basis, the familiar variables played out.Customer and product mix pulled the margin down, which is expected, given that the National Accounts and Onsite continue to drive our growth. Freight remained a drag, though not to the same degree we experienced through 2018. Our net rebates were a slight negative as well as a result of efforts to limit inventory growth.Our price cost deficit in the first quarter of 2019 was 20 basis points, which was half of the deficit that we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2018, as a result of incremental progress with pricing in the period to address inflation and tariffs. We expect to make further progress toward eliminating this deficit in the second quarter of 2019 and over the course of the full year.Our operating margin was 20% in the first quarter of 2019, up 20 basis points year-over-year. Continued healthy growth drove a 110 basis points of cost leverage and generated an incremental margin of 21.7%. Looking at the pieces, we achieved 60 basis points of leverage over employee-related costs, which were up 7.1%. This leverage was generated because FTE headcount growth lag sales at up 6.2% and due to our incentive compensation growing at a healthy but moderated level versus last year.Occupancy-related costs were up 2.3%, generating 35 basis points of leverage. A decline in branch expense as we continue to rationalize sites and only modest increases to non-branch occupancy costs, mitigated what was double-digit growth in vending costs as we continue to expand the installed base. We generated 20 basis points of leverage over other operating administrative expenses.The benefits of higher sales on this line was partly offset by a relatively active quarter for legal settlements and a large net debt write-off. This generated probably $2 million to $2.5 million more in costs in this period than we would have otherwise expected.As described in the past successfully, our growth drivers is likely to reduce gross margin over time, but also provides the platform and volume that generates good operating expense leverage. That played out in the first quarter of 2019, and we expect it to continue to play out over time. So putting it all together, we reported first quarter '19 EPS of $0.68 versus $0.61 in the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 11.9%.Turning to slide seven. Before jumping into the numbers, I just wanted to call to your attention, a change in our balance sheet. This quarter, we adopted FASB's new standards for accounting for leases, which requires us to move operating leases onto the balance sheet. You will see these values on separate lines identified as right-of-use assets and current long-term liabilities. The impact of adopting this standard on our income statement and cash flow was immaterial.Now, looking at the cash flow statement. We generated $205 million in operating cash in the first quarter of 2019 or 106% of net income. This remains below the historical rates of conversion that we have experienced in first quarters, but is meaningfully above last year's 92% figure. The challenge remains working capital, which I will cover in a moment.Net capital spending in the first quarter was $53 million, up from $29 million in the first quarter 2018, but consistent with expectations. This reflects investments in hub property and equipment that are necessary to support our high-service levels, as well as investments in vending equipment to support growth in our installed base.Our 2018 range for total net capital spending is unchanged between $195 million and $225 million to invest in hub property and equipment and vehicles to support our growth and vending devices to support our rising success in this initiative. We increased funds paydown dividend by 16% (ph) to $123 million and reduced debt. We finished the quarter with debt at 16.9% of total capital above last year's 15.7%, but down sequentially and at a level that we believe provides ample liquidity to invest in our business and pay our dividend.The working capital picture remains challenging but improved. Inventories were up 14% in the first quarter of 2019, with days on hand flat year-over-year. We continue to experience inflationary pressure on our inventories. However, during the period, we worked off the foreign sourced inventory that was accelerated into the US in the fourth quarter of 2018 and advanced several initiatives aimed at making us more efficient with inventory.AR grew 15.2% in the first quarter of 2019, with customers continuing to aggressively push payments out past quarter end. As has been the case in past quarters, we are not seeing any meaningful change in hard-to-collect balances. Reducing these annual growth rates will be an area on which to improve over the balance of the year.That is all for our formal presentation.So with that operator, we'll take questions.Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Robert Barry of Buckingham. Your line is open. -- Hey, guys. Good morning. -- Good morning. -- Good morning. -- Congrats. Solid start to the year. -- Thanks. -- So, you mentioned in the slide deck that reminded us that Good Friday is in April this year versus in March last year. How much did that impact the March number? And adjusting for that, do you read that things may be decelerated a little bit in March? -- Yeah. So, I think it's difficult to really burrow into what that number meant. I mean last year, Good Friday fell on the last day of the month and it fell on a Friday and so we have a lot of sort of month-end payments coming through. So, what was there -- was there a modest impact as a result of the timing of the holidays in the month? There probably was.But, look, I guess, the perspective that I would give to you -- to you, Rob, is this. If we're going to try to parse out the impact of a holiday, the impact of days in the month, et cetera, we also should probably be talking about variables such as foreign exchange and weather, and all these other things that impact our month.And if I look at -- if I try to adjust for all of these things, the fact is the growth that we experienced in the first quarter, if I adjust for acquisitions over the past 22 months, if I adjust for foreign exchange, if I adjust for weather events that we call out, we grew north of 13%, adjusting for all of those things. If I look at the six months growth rate, it was a little over 13%. If I look at the 12 months growth rate, it was a little over 13%.So the question that you're trying to get at the end of the day is, if you take out one piece, does that suggest that we're growing more slowly? And the answer I would give you is, that's not what we're experiencing in the market through March. I would say that, if you try to adjust for all the pieces, our growth rate has been remarkably stable at a fairly high level.And I think that with the exception of oil and gas, it's reflective of a business environment that remains fairly healthy through March. So, that's probably how I'd characterize. So -- no, I think you're right. But let's not lose sight of the fact that foreign exchange was as big of a drag on this quarter as we've seen, since we began to grow. There's a lot of moving pieces that go into it. But generally speaking, the environment feels healthy to us. -- Rob, I'm going to throw in a little adder. Holden's dead on right. And he comes out -- I can always tell he worked in your world for many years. He thinks about stuff. I enjoy our conversations, so he thinks about things fundamentally different.My answer probably would have been a little brief, Rob. I'd probably said, you know what, I honestly don't know. If I ask 10 people, I'd get 14 answers. Historically, internally, I've always said to our team, you know what, when we pick up a day or lose a day or Good Friday comes into play, I usually throw in the joke that Easter is on a Sunday this year and Good Friday is on Friday.But I always had in my head, it's probably half a point. And when Holden asked me earlier about this question, I said, yeah, I said it helped us. Weather hurt us. This morning, my kids were at home, driving my dogs crazy because we have a snowstorm in Winona and it was thundering and lightning all night long. Weather impacted us. Good Friday impacted us. Good Friday will hurt us here in April. And if I were to put a number on it, probably 0.5%.But your underlying question is, did the tone change? And I honestly don't think it did. -- All right. Great. Great. I guess, my other question was just on, seeing the FTEs grow just over six and kind of looking at data from the BLF, looks like wage inflation and manufacturing is running 2%, 3%. So, to see your employee-related expense up only seven, seems like a pretty noteworthy performance. And I was just wondering, if you can comment on kind of what's driving that and kind of how sustainable you think the ability to kind of leverage that line at this level is, as we kind of look out over the next several quarters? -- I'll chime in on that and then Holden can add some nuance of some things that I might not be sharing or appreciating. And if you think of what was going on in the last couple years, we were seeing massive inflation in our numbers, not because of the marketplace but because of our performance. We pay a lot of incentive comp.And so, this morning, as an example, I was talking -- when we were talking to the RVPs, our Regional Vice Presidents, one of the things I said to him, is I said, hey folks, congratulations on a nice first quarter. But I gave a little bit of a cautious tone going into the second quarter. I said, second quarter of this year is our most challenging year from a comp stand -- from a comparison standpoint and earnings, the incremental margin standpoint.Because, last year, in the first quarter, we grew our earnings. I believe it was $21 million. And then from Q1 to Q2, that number -- that earnings growth number went to $30 million. And so our incentive comp expanded dramatically. I mean, if you looked in our proxy, you could see, from a leadership standpoint and that proportion works out throughout the organization.We pay-off earnings growth. And so, I gave him a caution for Q2. But in an answer to your question, are we seeing underlying inflation in labor rates, if I think of people that are working in our distribution centers, that are throughout the organization? Yeah, we're seeing inflation rates of the economy.One of the things that's masking a bit right now is the fact that our incentive comp isn't expanding at the pace it was the last couple of years. And that's why our incremental margin is shining through things, we talked about in the past. But it gives a buffer. And one of your peers described it really well years ago, when he talked about the shock absorbers in our system.When we're getting great earnings growth, we share a chunk-up with our employees and it takes a little leverage out. In a weaker environment, everybody steps up to the plate and loses a little bit of pay because the incentive comp contracts. And so that's part of the dynamic we have going on there is, yeah, is there an underlying inflation in wage rates? Yeah. We're employing the same base of people everybody else is from the standpoint where we draw from. But our incentive comp is at a high watermark a year ago and it's at that high watermark now. But incrementally, it's not growing in the same way. -- That's right. And -- but, yeah, Rob, there definitely was a little bit of inflation as it relates to just sort of our base pay to our full timers and our part timers. But when you marry that up with the increase that we had in FTEs and headcount, we were still able to leverage that piece of our business.And then, when you throw on top of that, that the incentive pay piece, we actually didn't leverage that because the good news is when we're growing like we're growing, incentive pay is a big piece that shock absorber, if you will, when we're growing, we didn't leverage the incentive pay because the folks who are driving our business are being fairly successful. But that dynamic has been in place.I would expect a very similar dynamic going forward. We'll continue to expand our headcount. We'll probably continue to see some wage inflation in the market that's out there today. But this isn't the first quarter that dynamic has been in place. It existed for much or all of last year as well. And I think that the first quarter labor dynamics are very similar to what we experienced all last year too. And I would anticipate experiencing much of the rest of this year as well. If we grow double-digits, we should be able to leverage that. -- Got it. All right. I'll pass it on. Thanks, guys. -- You bet. -- Thanks.Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Evelyn Chow of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. -- Hi. Good morning, Dan, Holden. Maybe just starting on price realization this quarter. Fantastic job and encouraging to see that price-cost gap narrow. I noticed on pricing specifically, I think your comps on a stand-alone basis continue to get even harder throughout the year. So, would it be your expectation that though the price-cost gap turns positive, the actual stand-alone pricing level maybe is at its highest point in 1Q? -- Well, you're right that in 1Q what began to happen relative to 4Q was that we had to grow over price increases that we put in, essentially at the beginning of last year. And we'll have that dynamic in Q2, Q3, Q4 as well, where we have to grow with those same price increases. And in Q2, they probably got a little bit better.So from a sequential standpoint, what I expect from the fact that we grew pricing at 1%, little better than 1% in the quarter? Do I expect that necessarily to meaningfully increase? Perhaps not, given the comps. But all that said, we do believe that there is incremental sequential pricing to be had in the business over the next, certainly over the next quarter or two, as we continue to adjust to what the marketplace realities.And regardless of what sort of the year-over-year comp number looks like, as I said, I still believe there's opportunity for us to be constructive on pricing, sequentially into next quarter or two. And that should allow us to continue to mitigate and eliminate the deficit.So, I think what you're describing is kind of a comp issue and I get it. But I think, if you get the substance of the matter, I don't see our ability to pursue price as being worse today than it was in first quarter. And I don't see our ability to narrow that deficit on price-cost as being any more difficult today than it was in the first quarter or fourth quarter. So, I guess, hopefully that answers the question, Evelyn. -- That's very helpful, Holden. And then maybe just on Onsites. Obviously, nice to see the pace of signings and the continued commitment there. I noticed you called out, you had 66 activations and 15 closures this quarter. So, is that about the level of attrition you would expect going forward? -- Attrition regarding the closures, you're talking about? -- Yes, exactly. -- So, that was a little bit higher this quarter than what we typically see. We will typically see some attrition, right? Looking into the reason behind those 15 closures, there was nothing unusual there. I would say that about half of them were simply because a plant closed or moved.I think that there was probably an equal number, where frankly we went Onsite, we didn't get the kind of revenue that we anticipated getting. So, we decided to leave or their business was off, right, or their business was off. But one way or the other, what made sense at the time didn't make sense today. And so we closed up that Onsite and we'll service them from the branches we always have.And there's -- I think there might be one or two in there, where -- where maybe we didn't deliver the performance we told them we would or another competitors sort of made some inroads and we left. And -- but those things do happen every quarter. It was a little bit higher this quarter than normal. But I don't see that as a trend necessarily. And we didn't see any unusual reasons for the number. Seem to be the usual stuff. -- The -- I would throw a little -- some tidbit in there and I'll use vending as my example. When we started vending and it really was ramping up five yeas, six years, seven years ago, we didn't know what type of attrition there would be because it was a new industry. And what we found when we got into 2014 and 2015, that a lot of those machines that we had signed in '11 and '12 and '13 were extremely successful. But there was a handful that we signed that were just either -- oops, maybe we shouldn't have put this one in there.And we were pulling out on -- going into a given year, I looked at what we had for installed base and we were pulling out about and I don't have the stats in front of me, but my recollection, it is about 15% a year. But when we really looked at the underlying data, we saw that five of the -- probably a third of those were ones, where, you know what, we need to continue to get better at how we make it easy for our branches to serve these machines, because we felt we could lower that number to 10.What we've done in the last three years is we've lowered that number to about 11. And we think we still believe we can get it to 10. So if we have 80,000 machines out there, it would tell me we're probably going to pull out. In a good year, 8,000 and a less than good year, 9,000 or 10,000. And bottom line is we think that's a reasonable proposition because it helps us grow faster.In Onsites, if I looked at historically, we pull out about 10 a year, but we had 200 though. And so we didn't really know what it would be. And we still don't frankly know because there's still a newer animal. But sending those Onsites, we want to be mindful. We're really cautious about where we do it, where we don't do it. Because it's more expensive to pull out an Onsite than it is to pull out a vending machine.But I love the fact that we're engaging with our customers and we're growing faster, but it's going to take some time to figure out what that number is. When we have 1,000 Onsites, how many do we pull out a year? Because either the customer closed its facility or I mean, the customer gets acquired and the acquiring company doesn't use Fastenal. There are few of those out there and we're trying to reduce that number every day. -- And with regards to the new active, new active is just a little bit lower in the quarter. We would expect to have a greater rate of active growth as you go through the rest of the year. -- All right. Well, thanks, again, for the time today, guys. -- Thanks, Evelyn.Thank you. Our next question is from the line of David Manthey of Baird. Your line is open. -- Hey, guys. Good morning. First off, could you talk about the cost structure of the business today? And I'm wondering if you think that the model is more or less variable than it was 10 years ago in terms of costs? And what I'm getting at here is if growth does moderate slightly, are you still going to be able to sustain 20% contribution margins in that environment? -- The -- first, in your underlying, when I think back to a decade ago when we started what we called the pathway to profit, one of the things that we were truly doing is we were slowly making the model more variable in that by not opening branches as fast. That added to the fixed cost infrastructure of the business and we were making it more variable.One of the things that hurt our ability to leverage, as the economy was picking up is, A, I personally felt we needed to make some additional investments in some people resources to support Onsite to our vending, but also we made significant advancements in our infrastructure to do great things from a technology standpoint. And we talked about those dollars that we were willing to spend and consume some of the leverage. But also the variable nature consumed some of the leverage and incentive comp is a good example.To the extent, we're talking about incentive comp and the people energy, the model is more variable today than it was in the past. The question about incremental margin really becomes challenging in the short-term because it really falls back to how much do you want to dial back on certain growth drivers. Because the deleverage comes from -- if we have a branch out there doing 200,000 and that market softens and they go to 180, that's a painful downhill because that's a highly profitable branch, that's levered like crazy and there it's going to delever. And it's not very -- and it's more fixed than variable.The incentive comp-up piece, obviously, comes into play. So, it's probably a long -- not very -- a long, long answer to your question, Dave, but it depends on the timeframe. In the short-term, we could -- incentive comp pulls back automatically and you're the one that use the historical reference of the shock absorbers, which I think is a great descriptor.And in the shorter term, it's not as difficult. In the longer term, it really comes down to, do you want to start cutting away on some of the flesh? When the economy we sell into is huge, the opportunity is huge. But our installed base has contracted because we have all of this customer spend but their spend is down 20%. And so it makes it really challenging to do that because I'm a firm believer, I'm more interested in the going after the 100 billion plus market than I am about raining everything in the short-term. -- Yeah. Okay. Sounds different but still manageable. So that's fair. Second question. In previous quarters, you've talked about the customer conversations you're having around tariff-related price increases. And Holden, you answered this question to some extent.But I guess to refine it, have those sort of negotiated price changes been reflected already in the first quarter results. And also on the inventory side, are you now seeing the tariff cost increases flow through FIFO? Or do those two things continue to evolve with a glide path from first quarter into second quarter? -- Well, yes, on all of it, first off. Yes. So the conversations were aggressive through Q4 and frankly, fairly constructive. When we said, we were encouraged, I see no reason to sort of step away from the fact that we thought the conversations with our customers went fairly well. And I think there's a lot of reasons why that has been the case. One was simply the plan that was put together to address the issue of tariffs. We feel that was fairly open and fair, and I think our customers responded in -- as we would have hoped, they would have given that.We also put a lot of energy into having those conversations face-to-face with our customers. And so, yeah, they went fairly well. Now, our expectation at the time and I think it's played out this way is that we would begin to see those costs flow through the business in Q1, and so we had to be timed to start getting some of the pricing flowing through the business in Q1. And I believe that, that happened.And when we talk about seeing some sequential increase in pricing, I think that some of that is increases coming as a result of tariffs in that February, March period. And when we talk about being able to see some sequential increases in pricing, I think there is going to be some additional relationships and that come online, as we go through the early part of the second quarter and third quarter.So -- but at this point, I wouldn't say that we've been able to narrow the deficit with those things happening. The timing has worked out like we had planned for it to work out, and the dialogue with the customers has been positive around it. So, I guess that's where I would leave that. -- Dave, the only thing I'd throw in as an adder is sudden jolts are disruptive as heck. And what it really requires is all of us, our suppliers, Fastenal, our customers having a really informed, frank discussion about what's happening because it's been incredibly disruptive in the last four months.In fact, it probably took away some growth because you're having -- a lot of our sales teams are having discussions about pricing when I'd rather have discussions about growing the business. And -- but it's going to be disruptive. If anybody on the call has a crystal ball and can tell me what's going to happen with the tariff in six months and twelve months from now and do they get bigger? Do they get smaller? Do they unwind? Is it messy? It's going to be disruptive. Just disruptive on the unwind is -- was it unwind. And only time will tell how that works.Fortunately, on an unwind, whenever it occurs, while it might be disruptive to pricing, it's probably going to be helpful to the underlying economy. So, there'll be a lot of noise to our numbers. But in destructive times and times of radical change, the best cure is just good, open honest dialogue with your customer and we managed to do it. -- Okay. Thanks very much. -- Thanks, Dave. -- Thanks, Dave.Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ryan Merkel of William Blair. Your line is open. -- Thanks. Hey, everyone. Nice quarter. -- Thanks. Good morning Ryan. -- Yeah. So, first question I had was on oil and gas. I recall going back to maybe February, that the RVPs were saying this was just a pullback in spending. It was just a pause. Is this still the case and what are you hearing today? -- Yeah. Well -- so the RVPs obviously respond to what their customers are telling them. And the -- what we're hearing is that -- what we're hearing is that it's a challenging marketplace. We're not seeing wholesale sort of layoffs and cutting of capital spending and things like that.And frankly, the weakness that we're seeing seems to be fairly measured and tempered, which doesn't always sound like what oil and gas has been like historically, right. And so if I think about the RVP tone on oil and gas, some of them were more encouraged about what the second half looks like than what the first half looks like. But all of them say, what oil price is going to do, right?And so, I think -- if I think about the tone around oil and gas, I guess, it began to weaken, I think, we began talking about this probably November, December last year. And the degree of weakness hasn't necessarily gotten more severe over that period of time. It has persisted but it's also broadened.So, what something which began in Houston and Dallas has spread to other regions, right, in terms of commentary. And like I said, some of them feel like this is going to clear itself out by the second half, some of them feel like they don't know and all of them understand that it's about what happens to the price of oil and how their customers feel. And we just don't have a great answer to it. But that's where we have oil and gas today. -- Okay. That's helpful. And then second question on Onsite margin inflection. I recall 2020 could be the year where more mature Onsites at higher margins start to offset the newer Onsites. Is this still the case based on what we know today? And then, how much do you think it could lift overall company margin? -- Yeah. So, we haven't seen any real change in kind of the pacing of how we expect that to play out. And so, what I've said before is, today, where we've got so many new Onsites, you don't have sort of an equal ratio between how they're aging versus how we're adding them.But over time, that's going to change. And I think the proxy for that will be when does the average size per Onsite stop declining, right? And my feeling is that is probably late '19 but probably more in 2020, which means by the time you get to 2021, 2022, instead of just continuing to work against our overall level of gross profitability, that -- it will begin to diminish in terms of the impact on the mix. We still feel like that is the case. Now, what we've said before is -- and I think Dan laid this out last time, right? I mean, when we double our revenues, we want to be a 22% operating margin company, thereabouts. And in order for that to happen from 20% today, we need to see some of those Onsites begin to mature and become more profitable. And we think that, that will happen.And so, what is the impact? I would tell you, today, the overall impact is a drag, more so on the gross margin, the operating margin but it's in both. But over the next, let's call it 18 months, I think you're going to begin to see that drag really flatten out and then it begins to contribute more toward our goal of being a 22% operating margin company. -- And one thing to keep in mind, it's a two-pronged drag in the short -- over the last few years. The one drag is the mix of Onsites and the average revenue per Onsite going down. The other drag is, we went from not really signing Onsites to 80s and 180s and 280 and now close to 400. And every time we sign an Onsite, I sense (ph) that, most of the times that when we sign an Onsite, we're taking our customer relationship out of a branch, a highly profitable branch and we're delevering it.So, you kind of have a two for going on. Not only are you pulling down the average of your Onsites, you're actually hurting the profitability of your branch network a little bit in the short term. And when you get to a steady state of how many are coming in and going out, that's when life becomes a little easier. No different than, think about how the math changed decade ago, when we slowed down opening branches through the pathway to profit. All of a sudden, your mix of branch has changed. So, that's kind of the trajectory. And frankly, what's been great is that, that really has been playing out largely as we would have modeled it out a year ago, two years ago. -- Perfect. That's good to hear. It was kind of what I was getting at. Thanks, guys. I will pass it on. -- Thanks, Ryan. -- Thank you.Thank you. And your next question is from the line of Hamzah Mazari of Macquarie. Your line is open. -- Hi, guys. This is actually Mario Cortellacci filling in for Hamzah. I know there has been questions about pricing already. But I mean, do you think it's harder for distributors in general to get pricing during the cycle versus prior cycles? Or maybe asked in a different way, I mean, given where the demand environment is and where commodity inflation is, should pricing be higher than where it is? -- Yeah. Since I've been here longer, I'll take a shot at that and Holden, I can say can chime in and correct me on some things he disagrees with. But pricing is always hard. People talk about transparency in today's world. And it is greater. But frankly, our customers knew what they were spending for product and what product costs were around town 10 and 20 and 30 years ago. So, it's always been hard. It's about, are you bringing the great value to your customer and their willingness to pay for that value if you think it that way? I think probably the toughest one right now on a pricing front is, pricing is always hard. But I think the one that's got a little bit harder is the freight one. Now for us, it's two-fold. One, the freight dynamic is a little bit different because Onsites are a different dynamic for freight than the branch network.And so we almost have to understand the two pieces individually. But in today's world, there's a lot of examples of where freights included or freights this or freights flat and it's fundamentally different models. And it's always just having a good discussion about your freight -- the freight side of your picture. And that's probably the more challenging element in today's world, setting mix aside. -- Yeah. And I would say, I don't know what it should be, compared to history, I would say this. I mean, every quarter, going back to beginning of 2018, we've made sequential progress in raising price. We've done that because there has also been sequential increase in costs. And so we don't love obviously that we have a deficit on the price-cost dynamic. But part of that is perhaps, we needed to be more aggressive than we were.But that shouldn't be read to mean that we weren't doing what we had to do to protect the margins because as I said, pricing has gone up every quarter. But we also have to acknowledge that we've had some pretty significant increases in costs. And if I look at how much our costs has increased in the first quarter, it's more than twice what that same increase was in the first quarter of last year.And so we're kind of chasing -- we're chasing that piece of it as well. But I don't want to give the impression that because we have a price-cost deficit, that doesn't mean that we haven't been able to pass price through because we passed more price through every quarter in response to the marketplace. But if you give us a flattening in the cost environment, we'll catch up. But the -- I don't want to leave the impression that we haven't been able to pass price through because we have. -- Great. And just one more and I'll turn it over and you actually mentioned the freight. Just wanted to see if the benefit, essentially running your own captive fleet, it hasn't been fully optimized. Or do you think there's more room to go there? And I guess, if there is more room for improvement, I guess how much do you think that could be? -- Well, first off, the advantage of having a captive fleet, it's indescribable from the standpoint of -- set the costs aside for a second, our ability to provide service is night and day different from all our competitors. Earlier I used the example of that outdoor locker. A year from now, I fully expect us to be able to take an order from a customer that comes in late in the day, maybe in the evening and let's say, one time in 100 that customer is in a jam and they need it like two hours ago. Our competitors are going to be providing that. They're probably going to have to freight that in using small parcel. And it's not getting there to 10 o'clock tomorrow morning and that's a really expensive trip.Our driver gets to that branch at 4:00 in the morning or 2:00 in the morning or 6:00 in the morning. You pick the time because it's different for each branch. But let's say, this branch is 4:00 in the morning, our driver could throw that item in an outdoor locker and that customer would get a text at 4:00 in the morning, say the item you ordered at 5 o'clock last night is here and nobody else in that market can do that.So to me, the value of a captive trucking is you could provide a level of service that just separates you in the marketplace. From a cost standpoint, we have a great cost structure compared to our peers and we're able to use that cost structure. Part of our gross margin differential in our industry is because of that freight advantage. Our cost structure is lower. But it puts you in a position to challenge it every day. It also puts you in a position to have conversations with your customer and maybe move some product for them on the back hauls.So, one of the reasons that we've always been successful is we do a nice job with back hauls from our suppliers and more recently from some customers. That's where I think we have some more legs to it, especially on the Onsite piece of saying to customers to get some pallets, you need move -- we'll move it. And maybe you get freight that way. To quantify the potential, I'm not ready to go there right now because I don't know that we know it. -- Yeah. The only thing I would add is, I mean, I think, one direction you're going is, it is more cost effective to move product on our trucks than on third-parties. And from the fourth quarter of 2017, we really begin to see the field utilizing our truck network at a greater rate because of what was going on outside of our truck network. That kind of hit a level in Q3 of 2018 that we sustained a very high level. So if the question is what can you ship more and more onto your trucks, yeah, there's always good reasons to use a third-party, whether it's a customer requirement or what have you.So, we're probably at a good level for that. But I can't emphasize enough that in a period like this of inflation, third-party inflation is going up at a far greater rate than the costs that we're experiencing on our own captive fleet. And what that means is we have a huge advantage in the marketplace that is only getting wider by having that fleet.So, what we can never tell you is how much of an advantage are we getting in winning business because we have our captive fleet, even in an environment where there's inflation, especially in an environment where there's inflation. I can't answer that question for you. But it goes into our calculations and it's a reason why we win. So, I guess the tenor of the question is when are they going to stop impacting gross margin. I wanted to take the answer a little bit more broadly because we've done things to sort of minimize the impact. But you can't underestimate the value of that trucking fleet and our ability to manage costs and our ability to win business. -- Got it. Thanks for the time, guys. -- Thank you. -- So, I show on my watch 9:57, and very mindful that we're in an earning season and everybody on this call has a busy schedule. And so, I don't want to go along. I just want to close out with a few thoughts. I mentioned earlier in the question and I thought I'd just touched on it again to make sure I didn't freak anybody out with my kind of -- off-the-cuff comment.The message I have to our team is, as we go forward, just like it's more challenging to grow when you start stacking years together, it's more challenging for incremental margin. And that means we need to work harder every day to achieve it. Doesn't mean -- if this -- that isn't a cautionary tale. That's just a statement of fact. And I feel great about the team we have and their ability to manage this business and to grow this business.The second item, we talk about the weather impact and you see the discussion centers on impact to sales and the impact to our customers. One thing I'm really proud of is the -- because the biggest impact quite frankly, is to the folks that drive our semis down the road. We were talking about freight. Picture you are driving through the middle of the night and they're in the middle of a snowstorm. That's a tough thing.I think I mentioned on last call, I mentioned it to our team internally about a semi driver who was stranded outside of Chicago because their fuel line gelled up because it was so cold. And a branch manager on the last day of the month went and rescued that person, and got him into a warm environment because it was 30 below zero.And one thing, I'm really proud of is the way our branches and our district -- and our distribution managers treat our driver from the standpoint of, hey, make sure your back dock is -- snows are removed and it's a safe environment for your driver because that driver is the lifeblood of your business. And really pleased to say we came through it with a very safe circumstance for our semi drivers.Last thing, great people pursuing a common goal can do great things. Learned that from Bob 23 years ago and it is true today as it was then. Thanks, everybody. Have a good day. -- Thank you.Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.

"A 2018 survey of CEO pay in 22 countries around the world including the U.S. found that the average CEO was paid  annually.Here in Canada, where I live, the average CEO was paid a little more than $7 million. In the UK, it was almost a million higher than Canada.How about the U.S.?Well, it was the number one country for CEO pay at $14.25 million - or more than four times the global average.Are U.S. CEOs worth that much - or that much more than CEOs in other countries?

Do you really want a bunch of low-paid workers manufacturing the company's da Vinci surgical robotic systems? One wrong move and your hernia repair becomes a one-way ticket to the morgue.I'm facetious, but I think you get my meaning. By having well-paid employees, not only are they likely to be happier; they're probably more productive especially when they realize that the CEO makes just 32 times their pay, about one-tenth the U.S. average.Intuitive Surgical has come a long way from  when it launched the first da Vinci system. At the end of 2018, it had almost 5,000 systems installed; 64% of them in the U.S. with Europe and Asia its next biggest markets, but with plenty of room to grow.The global surgical robotics market is expected to grow by almost  annually over the next seven years to $17 billion.

If it grows that market share to 25% by 2025, it translates into an additional $1.4 billion in revenue.As people age, minimally invasive surgery will become even more critical than it already is.

Up 32% year to date through April 15, FAST stock looks like its gallop to $100 is underway.Consider that the supplier of industrial and construction supplies grew revenues and operating profits over the past five years by 49% and 40% to  and $1.0 billion respectively. And for that, its stock went sideways.In the company's Q1 2019 earnings, Fastenal grew the top and bottom lines by double digits. Revenues were up  on a like-for-like basis, and net earnings rose 11.9% to $0.68 a share.Helping move the needle is its industrial vending machine program. In the first quarter, it signed 5,603, bringing the total number to 83,410, an increase of 13.4% over Q1 2018. Sales at those machines grew in the high teens in the first quarter.And you thought vending machines were a thing of the past.Fastenal is all about customer service. It's got the growth to prove it.CEO Pay: $1.7 millionPay Ratio: 59:1Say what you will about  (NASDAQ:  ) CEO and founder Jeff Bezos, but you can't deny his company's success. A $10,000 investment ten years ago is worth almost $247,000 today.Bezos might be  in your opinion but his ability to deliver what the world's craving is astonishing. Everything Amazon does is to please the customer.In Bezos' annual letter to shareholders, he mentions the word customer on 49 occasions.""Much of what we build at AWS is based on listening to customers. It's critical to ask customers what they want, listen carefully to their answers, and figure out a plan to provide it thoughtfully and quickly (speed matters in business!). No business could thrive without that kind of customer obsession. But it's also not enough. The biggest needle movers will be things that customers don't know to ask for,"" the CEO  .How many CEOs do you know that think like this? I can count the number on two hands. He might be an a**hole in the minds of many, but he's a brilliant one, cut from the same cloth as Elon Musk.CEO Pay: $2.4 millionPay Ratio: 76:1The cream always rises to the top. (NASDAQ:  ) is one of those companies that seems to fly under the radar despite being a reasonably large company. If you own  (NASDAQ:  ) stock, however, you're likely more than a little aware of Garmin.In the most recent quarter, Garmin delivered boffo earnings. Since announcing  results February 20, GRMN stock is up 24%.A key highlight from earnings was its guidance for 2019.Analysts were expecting earnings of $3.52 a share on $3.43 billion in revenue. Garmin CEO Cliff Pemble's outlook is for $3.70 a share on the bottom line and $3.50 billion on the top line.""2018 was another remarkable year of revenue and operating income growth driven by strong performance in our aviation, marine, outdoor and fitness segments,"" Pemble  in its news release. ""Entering 2019, we see many opportunities ahead and believe that we are well positioned to seize these opportunities with a strong lineup of products across all of our segments.""Hopefully, you're beginning to see a trend. Companies that keep the pay ratio low tend to deliver strong long-term results.Since Pemble became CEO in  , GRMN stock has generated a 19.7% annualized total return for shareholders, 440 basis points greater than the  (NYSEARCA:  ).CEO Pay: $4.8 millionPay Ratio: 88:1A lot of investors might have a problem owning shopping malls. I certainly wouldn't. But they've got to be good. They can't be Class C malls with no-name retailers filling the place. That's a recipe for disaster.Zacks recently wondered if  (NYSE:  ) efforts were enough to battle the retail blues. Are we seriously still having that discussion in 2019. Well, it turns out there are a lot of crappy retailers still operating including Sears.""The deepening of the relationship with existing tenants, and the launch of its online retail platform, weaved with an omni-channel strategy, will likely be accretive to Simon Property's long-term growth,""  Zack's equity research team April 8.""In fact, the company is investing billions and actively restructuring its portfolio, aiming at premium acquisitions and transformative redevelopments. The transformational plans include the addition of hotels, restaurants, residences and luxury stores.""The fact is, very few retail mall owners have the vision of the Simon family. They've been doing this a long time. They're more than capable of rolling with the punches.Good brick-and-mortar retail isn't disappearing. Just the crappy kind is. Know the difference.CEO Pay: Pay Ratio: 141:1 (NASDAQ:  ) makes it on to the list despite hitting a  of $398.41 in early April and carrying on past $400 in the days that followed.Up 19% year to date through April 15, ORLY's only had one year of negative returns since 2009. As a result, you're looking at a 10-year annualized total return of 27.3%, almost double the S&P 500.In 2018, the retailer of aftermarket auto parts had same-store sales growth of  , at the top of its estimate for the year, the company's 26th year with an increase. In 2019, it expects same-store sales growth of 3%-5%. This past year it opened 200 net new stores in 36 states. It plans to open as many as 210 in 2019.

his week, as we head into what could be a pivotal earnings season, many investors will be looking at early returns for clues as to what to expect over the next few weeks. Delta Airlines () is always quick off the mark and will be the first to report for the quarter that ended at the end of March when they do so on Wednesday, followed by building supply company Fastenal () on Thursday and then PNC Financial Services (), Wells Fargo () and JP Morgan Chase () on Friday.All of those earnings will be closely-watched and parsed for clues as to what is to come, but the best indications may come not from facts, but from opinions.It is always dangerous to read too much into small sample sizes, and that is especially true here. The three financial sector companies’ earnings on Friday will probably receive the most attention, but, as investors have seen all too clearly in the past, profits in banking don’t necessarily translate to broad economic health and, in the case of WFC at least, that bank’s individual issues will muddy the waters.FAST and DAL will be more indicative of overall conditions, but there too there will be industry- and company-specific factors that could result in a misleading indicator.The week before earnings season gets fully underway, however, is when analysts tend to adjust their forecasts, and changes there may well give investors a better idea of what to expect.It is easy to dismiss these price targets and ratings as just one person’s opinion in each case. There have certainly been some high-profile misses and bad calls in the past, and no doubt there will be again, but the degree of specialization in analysts’ work means that their opinions are worth more than most.Over the years, I have had many friends in the analysts’ profession and know first-hand the degree of hard work, dedication and research that goes into their calls. That is why when someone like Stephen Tusa at JPM  a stock like GE () and cuts his price target, it directly affects the stock price.Tusa was not alone in issuing an adjustment this morning either; there were  made to start the week. As I said, this is often a time for such announcements, but fifteen is a large enough number in one day to make it worth looking at the average and attempting to divine a trend.Of those fifteen calls this morning, ten were negative and only five were upgrades. That makes it seem that there is some trepidation going into earnings season.In context though, that is hardly surprising. There were many reasons for the big drop in stocks at the end of last year, but one of those reasons was that many companies used third quarter earnings releases as an opportunity to temper expectations for the start of this year.As we have bounced back to recover almost all of those losses, those warnings have been largely forgotten by traders ... but not by analysts. The negativity we are seeing now is likely more about pricing in that context than about any real fear of recession, but it still suggests that this earnings season may not be as supportive of stock prices as we have come to expect.If nothing else, if this morning’s calls are a guide, this week could be a bit bumpy. The actual results will decide the market’s direction after that though, and the fact that an average of over two-thirds of S&P 500 companies beat expectations every quarter is why earnings are usually a positive boost to the market.That happens because analysts, and the CEOs’ guidance that form an integral part of their calculations, are inherently cautious. However, even with that tendency to underestimate, a rash of downgrades should be seen as a warning.So, if the early reports this week bring some positive news, or if they disappoint, don’t get carried away in either case. Whatever your view of the economy and the broader market, listen to what the analysts are saying. They set the tone for traders and investors and will give easily readable clues as to what to expect over the next few weeks.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Week Ahead: Looking for Earnings Season Clues@2019-04-08@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/week-ahead-looking-earnings-season-clues-2019-04-08
" company's own top management tend to have the best inside view into the business, so when company officers make major buys, investors are wise to take notice.  Presumably the only reason an insider would take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock of their company in the open market, is that they expect to make money — maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both.  So in this series we look at the largest insider buys by the ''top brass'' over the trailing six month period, one of which was a total of $103.9K by Daniel L. Florness, CEO and President at Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST).
	


Florness's average cost works out to $51.95/share.  Shares of Fastenal Co. were changing hands at $64.96 at last check, trading off about 0.1% on Wednesday.  The chart below shows the one year performance of FAST shares, versus its 200 day moving average:


   

Looking at the chart above, FAST's low point in its 52 week range is $47.37 per share, with $67.09 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $64.96.


The current annualized dividend paid by Fastenal Co. is $1.72/share, currently paid in quarterly installments, and its most recent dividend ex-date was on 01/30/2019.  Below is a long-term dividend history chart for FAST, which can be of good help in judging whether the most recent dividend with approx. 2.6% annualized yield is likely to continue.

And thank you for joining us for our first quarter  .I'm going to -- before I step into Holden's flipbook, just going to touch on a few comments that I had with our leadership in our normal call at 7 o'clock this morning to talk about the quarter, to give them a little insight about some things that we'll be focusing on the call, as well as just some of the comments I made to them.My first comment to them this morning was a sincere thank you for a job well done. I think this is a really nice start to the year. I'm pleased with the performance we're seeing across our business units throughout the planet and a very positive start to the year.I also mentioned them about the challenge that comes when you get into the -- a multi-year improvement in business. So, when I think back to stepping into this role back in 2000 -- late in 2015, we've had a tough year. The economy had not been our friend that year. And when you're exposed to the industrial marketplace and it flips on you, it can cause some pain in the short-term. But we kept focusing on what we focus on. That's our customer.We kept focusing on things to make our business better, and we really started the transition to a much more focused approach on some of our growth drivers, particularly breathing some new life into vending and challenging ourselves to look at Onsites as a meet -- as not a solution, when there's not an alternative, but as a means to grow faster and a new growth drive within our business.It's a wonderful way to extend what is the traditional Fastenal relationship, but lower your cost structure at the same time. And I hope these numbers are all correct. I haven't proofed them through our screening process. And this is just me jotting down some numbers. But what I shared with them was, if I stack together multiple years, five months of the last seven months, if I look at it, taking the three years added together and again, I hope I calculated it correctly, I believe five months or less seven months, we've been 30% plus, when you look at the cumulative impact of the last three years.And November and January were the only two months that didn't break that 30% and they were at 29%. So, a good number. And I believe for the last 14 months, if you looked at on a two-year basis and combined year one and year two growth, you're at a number that starts with the 2. So, north of 20%. But since August, I believe that number is north of 25%. So, not only are we -- do we have great local plans to engage with our customer and grow our business, but we're able to stack it on top of some comps that are frankly challenging. I'm really pleased with what the group is doing, and I'm really proud of the group and proud to be associated with them.I also shared with them one of their -- one of the blessings and curses of the Internet age, is it's easy to -- for people to make comments. Sometimes you read through a newspaper and some of the comments you see, you're kind of like, boy, that person just seems angry about something that's not this article, but they're just angry or you can tell that person's maybe political view is driving their commentary they're putting into an article. But at 10 o'clock last night, I was reading a comment that came in from a customer. And every comment that comes into Fastenal, I'm on an email distribution list and I read through them.Sometimes I do it late at night before I go to bed. Sometimes I do it early in the morning. And I'm reading one last night. It was a fellow. He said, I'm an older gentlemen, I'm 61 years old. That pain me a little bit because I'm 55. And I hear somebody at 61 refer to themselves that old was a little troubling, but that's a different issue.But this individual was talking about, where our branch, it was a San Antonio Texas branch, but where our branch went above and beyond the call and really helped them solve the problem. And I floated out to our regional leadership last night and I said, you know what, folks, this is what we're about. We're about solving peoples' problems. Because in today's world, sometimes it's hard to find people to help you solve a problem.And it was fun one to share because sometimes you get in a few here and there that aren't as positive and you assess them to understand what we can do to be better.But now, I'll flip the Holden's book here. We grew -- we had 68% -- $0.68 o  and I start there, almost 12% earnings-per-share growth. Bottom line is we grew our earnings faster than our sales. And that's not an easy act in a quarter, where weather was impact -- very impactful and with one less selling day. We were in the situation of -- with $20 million a day in revenue, there's a chunk of revenue, a chunk of gross profit dollars that are out there but the expenses typically are. So to pull off what we did, when we were down a day is a pretty positive thing.Despite the challenging weather, our demand continued to be healthy. Our daily sales growth was 12.2% in the quarter. And I think Holden said it well, 2019 has started where 2018 left off. Operating margin expanded 20 basis points and our incremental margin was 21.7. As we've talked about in prior calls, our growth drivers are changing the mix of our business.If we're successful with it, it's going to pull gross margins down. If we're successful with it, we should be able to leverage our operating expenses. And it should result in a great win for our customer, for our employee, for our supplier and for you, our shareholders. And I think you saw that in the first quarter here. But sequentially, we did hold gross margin flat, which was really a sign of some of the price increases we put in late last year in the wake of tariffs and inflations, allowed us a little breathing room in the short-term.But Holden will touch on that a little bit more in his comments.We talked about this in the past. Our business, as it continues to grow with larger customers and with international customers, sometimes we get caught in a situation where you have a customer who is doing some window dressing at the end of the year, end of the quarter. And they frankly stop paying with two, three, four weeks left in the quarter and it makes for a challenging situation. Our solution here is to constantly be engaged in discussion with our customer about -- our value proposition to you is a better supply chain.We take inventory up to your balance sheet. Don't do this to us at the end of the quarter because what it ultimately does, it puts us in a position where we can't fund inventory. But there's a trade-off. If we know we're going to have an extra $5 million in receivables, we have to squeeze that somewhere else and that doesn't serve our customer. And we need to be engaged in that dialogue and challenge. If you want to do window dressing, do it with somebody else's payable, not with ours. And -- but we did produced stronger cash flow in the quarter and allowed us to pay a higher dividend and reduced debt a little bit.Onsites, I remember, when years ago we did CSP and we really went through a change in our branch network. But at some point in time, we stopped talking about CSP because CSP became part of us. Now, we're going to keep talking about Onsites from the standpoint, sharing with you our location count and our penetration of the market and where we're finding success.But we're going to break a thousand Onsites sometime here in the second quarter. I guess, that's a forward-looking statement, but it's one I'm pretty safe in saying. But it's truly part of Fastenal now. We have Onsites throughout our region, throughout our districts. And so it's not something we're experimenting with, or pushing people to change or even pushing customers to consider and change.We're doing all that, but we're doing that from a base of knowledge similar to a -- not too many years ago, when we were talking to the industry about vending machines. But on Onsites, our goals are pretty simple this year. Let's sign 375 to 400. There's 52 weeks in the year. You've got to take out a couple of those weeks because it's the holidays and a lot happens in those weeks.But if we can do eight signings per week and do it 50 weeks of the year, that's 400. And so in the first quarter, we got off to a really nice start. We hit that number, and we signed 105. So, very pleased. Our sales growth, removing the transferred sales, so if I have an existing customer and we go Onsite, we'll probably pull some revenue out of a branch and move it over there. But ignoring that, that business is growing north 20%. Really pleased with what the team is doing.On vending, our goal is to do 23,000 units to 25,000 units. So, there's 254 business days in the year. We need to sign roughly a 100 every day to get it to the high end of that number. If we sign 90 every day, we're at the low end of that number. We were just shy of 90 in the first quarter. But in the month of March, we rounded up to a 100. We were at 99.6 per day. So, we were off to, I think, a nice start. And again, it's just part of our extension into our customers' facilities.Speaking of vending, I had a new experience yesterday. So, one of the things that we've struggled with is, we've had, I remember a few years ago at Investor Day, talked about the idea of having outdoor lockers or having lockers where we can do deliveries into.Frankly, we struggled to make the technology easy to use. And so we didn't get really much traction with it. And we have very few branches that have outdoor lockers. We have now built the interface between our point-of-sales system and our vending platform, which is a third-party software. And yesterday morning, I ordered something. We had turned on our Winona branch on Monday. So yesterday morning, I ordered something. I immediately had a confirmation of that order and a couple hours later I got an email, your order is ready to pick up and I went over and I punched in my six digit code and I pulled an item out of the locker. It was a really easy and seamless transaction.That doesn't mean we're going to be getting into the retail business anytime soon. But if I think of our Onsites, if I think of our customers that need something and they want to get in and out quickly or they are coming in after hours, it provides a great extension of our -- of the hours of our day and our ability to serve our customers. And I'm really excited about what that means, but really also proud of our technology team for developing that and it worked really easily. And I've gotten in the habit in recent months of buying a lot of stuff online.One of the companies I'm really impressed with and I buy from them once a week to understand what they're changing and I keep bringing comments to our folks as a result. I don't know if any of you have ever bought on Walmart online. They do a really nice job. Now, again, we're not a retailer, but making it easy and making it efficient for your customer is an important part of the equation. And we finally have that working. National Accounts grew 17% in the first quarter. The team continues do a great job of making promises to customers. And our branch and Onsite network, along with everybody else that supports them, does a great job of honoring those promises. So, good -- good quarter.Outside the US, exchange rate is a full right now. International is about 14% of our revenue and we grew in the mid-teens. I believe the number was about 17%, and so continued to be really impressed with our teams there, and our ability to extend the U.S and Canadian relationships broadly around the planet. So, excellent job to the team.With that, I'm going to turn over to Holden. But before I do that, when I read through his notes, one thing jumped out at me and that was the PMI at 55.4 and I almost -- when I read stuff or even read his notes, it almost felt like that was kind of an eee number (ph). And I've been here over 23 years, and I've never thought of 55.4 as an E-numberand I've seen that in some of the external reporting.So, we're seeing a good tone in the marketplace. Holden is going to touch on some oil and gas concerns. And being a farm kid, I know the agricultural side has had some tough time in the last year with commodity prices and I'm sure there'll be some weakness there. But we're pretty bullish on what we're seeing.Holden? -- Great. Thank you very much. Good morning. So, let's just jump on to slide five. Total sales, as Dan indicated, were up 10.4%. There was one fewer sales day in the first quarter versus last year. So, on a same-day basis, sales were up 12.2%. We estimate that severe weather in the Northern US and Central Canada reduced sales by between 60 basis points and 90 basis points. So, remember last year, there was a weather issue as well, so net of last year's weather impact. The total effect was probably 20 basis points to 30 basis points.In March, our daily sales growth was 12.7%. Pricing in response to tariffs and general inflation contributed 90 basis points to 120 basis points in the period. This is below the level of the fourth quarter of 2018, but incremental progress is being masked in the current period by having to grow over the price increases that began to benefit last year's 1Q.We do look at it and believe that sequentially, our price realization was slightly higher. From a macro standpoint, as Dan said, the PMI averaged 55.4 in the first quarter of 2019. This is the lowest level in nine quarters, which is getting a lot of the print. But it does still constitute a healthy level, as reflected in continued low to mid single-digit growth in industrial production.Relatedly, our manufacturing and markets were up 13.4%, with recent trends remaining in force. Most sub verticals that we track are healthy, the main exception being oil and gas which remains soft. Construction was up 13.1% in the first quarter of 2019. The January comparison was easy, but February and March also continued to grow double-digits, as a result of healthy markets and strong internal selling energy.From a product standpoint, on a daily sales basis, fasteners were up 11.8% and non-fasteners were up 12.7%. In March, fasteners outgrew non-fasteners. Fastener growth has been sustained at high levels, while safety growth moderated to a mid-teens rate following what were two years of 20% plus growth in that product vertical.This has served to narrow the growth gap between fasteners and other products. But overall, we remain pleased with the growth of our main product categories. From a customer standpoint, National Accounts were up 16.9% in the quarter, with 81 of our top 100 accounts growing. Growth to non-national accounts was mid single-digits. Nearly, 65% of our branches grew in the first quarter.In terms of market tone, regional leadership remains constructive on demand, with the caution that was evident last November largely gone. The exception, as I mentioned, was oil and gas. We haven't seen the weakness in that market deepened, but we have seen it broadened across more of our regions. Still on the whole, 2019 seems to be starting much as 2018 finished.Now to slide six. Our gross margin was 47.7% in the first quarter of 2019, down a 100 basis points from first quarter of 2018, but flat on a sequential basis. Something we haven't seen since the first quarter of 2015. On a year-over-year basis, the familiar variables played out.Customer and product mix pulled the margin down, which is expected, given that the National Accounts and Onsite continue to drive our growth. Freight remained a drag, though not to the same degree we experienced through 2018. Our net rebates were a slight negative as well as a result of efforts to limit inventory growth.Our price cost deficit in the first quarter of 2019 was 20 basis points, which was half of the deficit that we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2018, as a result of incremental progress with pricing in the period to address inflation and tariffs. We expect to make further progress toward eliminating this deficit in the second quarter of 2019 and over the course of the full year.Our operating margin was 20% in the first quarter of 2019, up 20 basis points year-over-year. Continued healthy growth drove a 110 basis points of cost leverage and generated an incremental margin of 21.7%. Looking at the pieces, we achieved 60 basis points of leverage over employee-related costs, which were up 7.1%. This leverage was generated because FTE headcount growth lag sales at up 6.2% and due to our incentive compensation growing at a healthy but moderated level versus last year.Occupancy-related costs were up 2.3%, generating 35 basis points of leverage. A decline in branch expense as we continue to rationalize sites and only modest increases to non-branch occupancy costs, mitigated what was double-digit growth in vending costs as we continue to expand the installed base. We generated 20 basis points of leverage over other operating administrative expenses.The benefits of higher sales on this line was partly offset by a relatively active quarter for legal settlements and a large net debt write-off. This generated probably $2 million to $2.5 million more in costs in this period than we would have otherwise expected.As described in the past successfully, our growth drivers is likely to reduce gross margin over time, but also provides the platform and volume that generates good operating expense leverage. That played out in the first quarter of 2019, and we expect it to continue to play out over time. So putting it all together, we reported first quarter '19 EPS of $0.68 versus $0.61 in the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 11.9%.Turning to slide seven. Before jumping into the numbers, I just wanted to call to your attention, a change in our balance sheet. This quarter, we adopted FASB's new standards for accounting for leases, which requires us to move operating leases onto the balance sheet. You will see these values on separate lines identified as right-of-use assets and current long-term liabilities. The impact of adopting this standard on our income statement and cash flow was immaterial.Now, looking at the cash flow statement. We generated $205 million in operating cash in the first quarter of 2019 or 106% of net income. This remains below the historical rates of conversion that we have experienced in first quarters, but is meaningfully above last year's 92% figure. The challenge remains working capital, which I will cover in a moment.Net capital spending in the first quarter was $53 million, up from $29 million in the first quarter 2018, but consistent with expectations. This reflects investments in hub property and equipment that are necessary to support our high-service levels, as well as investments in vending equipment to support growth in our installed base.Our 2018 range for total net capital spending is unchanged between $195 million and $225 million to invest in hub property and equipment and vehicles to support our growth and vending devices to support our rising success in this initiative. We increased funds paydown dividend by 16% (ph) to $123 million and reduced debt. We finished the quarter with debt at 16.9% of total capital above last year's 15.7%, but down sequentially and at a level that we believe provides ample liquidity to invest in our business and pay our dividend.The working capital picture remains challenging but improved. Inventories were up 14% in the first quarter of 2019, with days on hand flat year-over-year. We continue to experience inflationary pressure on our inventories. However, during the period, we worked off the foreign sourced inventory that was accelerated into the US in the fourth quarter of 2018 and advanced several initiatives aimed at making us more efficient with inventory.AR grew 15.2% in the first quarter of 2019, with customers continuing to aggressively push payments out past quarter end. As has been the case in past quarters, we are not seeing any meaningful change in hard-to-collect balances. Reducing these annual growth rates will be an area on which to improve over the balance of the year.That is all for our formal presentation.So with that operator, we'll take questions.Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Robert Barry of Buckingham. Your line is open. -- Hey, guys. Good morning. -- Good morning. -- Good morning. -- Congrats. Solid start to the year. -- Thanks. -- So, you mentioned in the slide deck that reminded us that Good Friday is in April this year versus in March last year. How much did that impact the March number? And adjusting for that, do you read that things may be decelerated a little bit in March? -- Yeah. So, I think it's difficult to really burrow into what that number meant. I mean last year, Good Friday fell on the last day of the month and it fell on a Friday and so we have a lot of sort of month-end payments coming through. So, what was there -- was there a modest impact as a result of the timing of the holidays in the month? There probably was.But, look, I guess, the perspective that I would give to you -- to you, Rob, is this. If we're going to try to parse out the impact of a holiday, the impact of days in the month, et cetera, we also should probably be talking about variables such as foreign exchange and weather, and all these other things that impact our month.And if I look at -- if I try to adjust for all of these things, the fact is the growth that we experienced in the first quarter, if I adjust for acquisitions over the past 22 months, if I adjust for foreign exchange, if I adjust for weather events that we call out, we grew north of 13%, adjusting for all of those things. If I look at the six months growth rate, it was a little over 13%. If I look at the 12 months growth rate, it was a little over 13%.So the question that you're trying to get at the end of the day is, if you take out one piece, does that suggest that we're growing more slowly? And the answer I would give you is, that's not what we're experiencing in the market through March. I would say that, if you try to adjust for all the pieces, our growth rate has been remarkably stable at a fairly high level.And I think that with the exception of oil and gas, it's reflective of a business environment that remains fairly healthy through March. So, that's probably how I'd characterize. So -- no, I think you're right. But let's not lose sight of the fact that foreign exchange was as big of a drag on this quarter as we've seen, since we began to grow. There's a lot of moving pieces that go into it. But generally speaking, the environment feels healthy to us. -- Rob, I'm going to throw in a little adder. Holden's dead on right. And he comes out -- I can always tell he worked in your world for many years. He thinks about stuff. I enjoy our conversations, so he thinks about things fundamentally different.My answer probably would have been a little brief, Rob. I'd probably said, you know what, I honestly don't know. If I ask 10 people, I'd get 14 answers. Historically, internally, I've always said to our team, you know what, when we pick up a day or lose a day or Good Friday comes into play, I usually throw in the joke that Easter is on a Sunday this year and Good Friday is on Friday.But I always had in my head, it's probably half a point. And when Holden asked me earlier about this question, I said, yeah, I said it helped us. Weather hurt us. This morning, my kids were at home, driving my dogs crazy because we have a snowstorm in Winona and it was thundering and lightning all night long. Weather impacted us. Good Friday impacted us. Good Friday will hurt us here in April. And if I were to put a number on it, probably 0.5%.But your underlying question is, did the tone change? And I honestly don't think it did. -- All right. Great. Great. I guess, my other question was just on, seeing the FTEs grow just over six and kind of looking at data from the BLF, looks like wage inflation and manufacturing is running 2%, 3%. So, to see your employee-related expense up only seven, seems like a pretty noteworthy performance. And I was just wondering, if you can comment on kind of what's driving that and kind of how sustainable you think the ability to kind of leverage that line at this level is, as we kind of look out over the next several quarters? -- I'll chime in on that and then Holden can add some nuance of some things that I might not be sharing or appreciating. And if you think of what was going on in the last couple years, we were seeing massive inflation in our numbers, not because of the marketplace but because of our performance. We pay a lot of incentive comp.And so, this morning, as an example, I was talking -- when we were talking to the RVPs, our Regional Vice Presidents, one of the things I said to him, is I said, hey folks, congratulations on a nice first quarter. But I gave a little bit of a cautious tone going into the second quarter. I said, second quarter of this year is our most challenging year from a comp stand -- from a comparison standpoint and earnings, the incremental margin standpoint.Because, last year, in the first quarter, we grew our earnings. I believe it was $21 million. And then from Q1 to Q2, that number -- that earnings growth number went to $30 million. And so our incentive comp expanded dramatically. I mean, if you looked in our proxy, you could see, from a leadership standpoint and that proportion works out throughout the organization.We pay-off earnings growth. And so, I gave him a caution for Q2. But in an answer to your question, are we seeing underlying inflation in labor rates, if I think of people that are working in our distribution centers, that are throughout the organization? Yeah, we're seeing inflation rates of the economy.One of the things that's masking a bit right now is the fact that our incentive comp isn't expanding at the pace it was the last couple of years. And that's why our incremental margin is shining through things, we talked about in the past. But it gives a buffer. And one of your peers described it really well years ago, when he talked about the shock absorbers in our system.When we're getting great earnings growth, we share a chunk-up with our employees and it takes a little leverage out. In a weaker environment, everybody steps up to the plate and loses a little bit of pay because the incentive comp contracts. And so that's part of the dynamic we have going on there is, yeah, is there an underlying inflation in wage rates? Yeah. We're employing the same base of people everybody else is from the standpoint where we draw from. But our incentive comp is at a high watermark a year ago and it's at that high watermark now. But incrementally, it's not growing in the same way. -- That's right. And -- but, yeah, Rob, there definitely was a little bit of inflation as it relates to just sort of our base pay to our full timers and our part timers. But when you marry that up with the increase that we had in FTEs and headcount, we were still able to leverage that piece of our business.And then, when you throw on top of that, that the incentive pay piece, we actually didn't leverage that because the good news is when we're growing like we're growing, incentive pay is a big piece that shock absorber, if you will, when we're growing, we didn't leverage the incentive pay because the folks who are driving our business are being fairly successful. But that dynamic has been in place.I would expect a very similar dynamic going forward. We'll continue to expand our headcount. We'll probably continue to see some wage inflation in the market that's out there today. But this isn't the first quarter that dynamic has been in place. It existed for much or all of last year as well. And I think that the first quarter labor dynamics are very similar to what we experienced all last year too. And I would anticipate experiencing much of the rest of this year as well. If we grow double-digits, we should be able to leverage that. -- Got it. All right. I'll pass it on. Thanks, guys. -- You bet. -- Thanks.Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Evelyn Chow of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. -- Hi. Good morning, Dan, Holden. Maybe just starting on price realization this quarter. Fantastic job and encouraging to see that price-cost gap narrow. I noticed on pricing specifically, I think your comps on a stand-alone basis continue to get even harder throughout the year. So, would it be your expectation that though the price-cost gap turns positive, the actual stand-alone pricing level maybe is at its highest point in 1Q? -- Well, you're right that in 1Q what began to happen relative to 4Q was that we had to grow over price increases that we put in, essentially at the beginning of last year. And we'll have that dynamic in Q2, Q3, Q4 as well, where we have to grow with those same price increases. And in Q2, they probably got a little bit better.So from a sequential standpoint, what I expect from the fact that we grew pricing at 1%, little better than 1% in the quarter? Do I expect that necessarily to meaningfully increase? Perhaps not, given the comps. But all that said, we do believe that there is incremental sequential pricing to be had in the business over the next, certainly over the next quarter or two, as we continue to adjust to what the marketplace realities.And regardless of what sort of the year-over-year comp number looks like, as I said, I still believe there's opportunity for us to be constructive on pricing, sequentially into next quarter or two. And that should allow us to continue to mitigate and eliminate the deficit.So, I think what you're describing is kind of a comp issue and I get it. But I think, if you get the substance of the matter, I don't see our ability to pursue price as being worse today than it was in first quarter. And I don't see our ability to narrow that deficit on price-cost as being any more difficult today than it was in the first quarter or fourth quarter. So, I guess, hopefully that answers the question, Evelyn. -- That's very helpful, Holden. And then maybe just on Onsites. Obviously, nice to see the pace of signings and the continued commitment there. I noticed you called out, you had 66 activations and 15 closures this quarter. So, is that about the level of attrition you would expect going forward? -- Attrition regarding the closures, you're talking about? -- Yes, exactly. -- So, that was a little bit higher this quarter than what we typically see. We will typically see some attrition, right? Looking into the reason behind those 15 closures, there was nothing unusual there. I would say that about half of them were simply because a plant closed or moved.I think that there was probably an equal number, where frankly we went Onsite, we didn't get the kind of revenue that we anticipated getting. So, we decided to leave or their business was off, right, or their business was off. But one way or the other, what made sense at the time didn't make sense today. And so we closed up that Onsite and we'll service them from the branches we always have.And there's -- I think there might be one or two in there, where -- where maybe we didn't deliver the performance we told them we would or another competitors sort of made some inroads and we left. And -- but those things do happen every quarter. It was a little bit higher this quarter than normal. But I don't see that as a trend necessarily. And we didn't see any unusual reasons for the number. Seem to be the usual stuff. -- The -- I would throw a little -- some tidbit in there and I'll use vending as my example. When we started vending and it really was ramping up five yeas, six years, seven years ago, we didn't know what type of attrition there would be because it was a new industry. And what we found when we got into 2014 and 2015, that a lot of those machines that we had signed in '11 and '12 and '13 were extremely successful. But there was a handful that we signed that were just either -- oops, maybe we shouldn't have put this one in there.And we were pulling out on -- going into a given year, I looked at what we had for installed base and we were pulling out about and I don't have the stats in front of me, but my recollection, it is about 15% a year. But when we really looked at the underlying data, we saw that five of the -- probably a third of those were ones, where, you know what, we need to continue to get better at how we make it easy for our branches to serve these machines, because we felt we could lower that number to 10.What we've done in the last three years is we've lowered that number to about 11. And we think we still believe we can get it to 10. So if we have 80,000 machines out there, it would tell me we're probably going to pull out. In a good year, 8,000 and a less than good year, 9,000 or 10,000. And bottom line is we think that's a reasonable proposition because it helps us grow faster.In Onsites, if I looked at historically, we pull out about 10 a year, but we had 200 though. And so we didn't really know what it would be. And we still don't frankly know because there's still a newer animal. But sending those Onsites, we want to be mindful. We're really cautious about where we do it, where we don't do it. Because it's more expensive to pull out an Onsite than it is to pull out a vending machine.But I love the fact that we're engaging with our customers and we're growing faster, but it's going to take some time to figure out what that number is. When we have 1,000 Onsites, how many do we pull out a year? Because either the customer closed its facility or I mean, the customer gets acquired and the acquiring company doesn't use Fastenal. There are few of those out there and we're trying to reduce that number every day. -- And with regards to the new active, new active is just a little bit lower in the quarter. We would expect to have a greater rate of active growth as you go through the rest of the year. -- All right. Well, thanks, again, for the time today, guys. -- Thanks, Evelyn.Thank you. Our next question is from the line of David Manthey of Baird. Your line is open. -- Hey, guys. Good morning. First off, could you talk about the cost structure of the business today? And I'm wondering if you think that the model is more or less variable than it was 10 years ago in terms of costs? And what I'm getting at here is if growth does moderate slightly, are you still going to be able to sustain 20% contribution margins in that environment? -- The -- first, in your underlying, when I think back to a decade ago when we started what we called the pathway to profit, one of the things that we were truly doing is we were slowly making the model more variable in that by not opening branches as fast. That added to the fixed cost infrastructure of the business and we were making it more variable.One of the things that hurt our ability to leverage, as the economy was picking up is, A, I personally felt we needed to make some additional investments in some people resources to support Onsite to our vending, but also we made significant advancements in our infrastructure to do great things from a technology standpoint. And we talked about those dollars that we were willing to spend and consume some of the leverage. But also the variable nature consumed some of the leverage and incentive comp is a good example.To the extent, we're talking about incentive comp and the people energy, the model is more variable today than it was in the past. The question about incremental margin really becomes challenging in the short-term because it really falls back to how much do you want to dial back on certain growth drivers. Because the deleverage comes from -- if we have a branch out there doing 200,000 and that market softens and they go to 180, that's a painful downhill because that's a highly profitable branch, that's levered like crazy and there it's going to delever. And it's not very -- and it's more fixed than variable.The incentive comp-up piece, obviously, comes into play. So, it's probably a long -- not very -- a long, long answer to your question, Dave, but it depends on the timeframe. In the short-term, we could -- incentive comp pulls back automatically and you're the one that use the historical reference of the shock absorbers, which I think is a great descriptor.And in the shorter term, it's not as difficult. In the longer term, it really comes down to, do you want to start cutting away on some of the flesh? When the economy we sell into is huge, the opportunity is huge. But our installed base has contracted because we have all of this customer spend but their spend is down 20%. And so it makes it really challenging to do that because I'm a firm believer, I'm more interested in the going after the 100 billion plus market than I am about raining everything in the short-term. -- Yeah. Okay. Sounds different but still manageable. So that's fair. Second question. In previous quarters, you've talked about the customer conversations you're having around tariff-related price increases. And Holden, you answered this question to some extent.But I guess to refine it, have those sort of negotiated price changes been reflected already in the first quarter results. And also on the inventory side, are you now seeing the tariff cost increases flow through FIFO? Or do those two things continue to evolve with a glide path from first quarter into second quarter? -- Well, yes, on all of it, first off. Yes. So the conversations were aggressive through Q4 and frankly, fairly constructive. When we said, we were encouraged, I see no reason to sort of step away from the fact that we thought the conversations with our customers went fairly well. And I think there's a lot of reasons why that has been the case. One was simply the plan that was put together to address the issue of tariffs. We feel that was fairly open and fair, and I think our customers responded in -- as we would have hoped, they would have given that.We also put a lot of energy into having those conversations face-to-face with our customers. And so, yeah, they went fairly well. Now, our expectation at the time and I think it's played out this way is that we would begin to see those costs flow through the business in Q1, and so we had to be timed to start getting some of the pricing flowing through the business in Q1. And I believe that, that happened.And when we talk about seeing some sequential increase in pricing, I think that some of that is increases coming as a result of tariffs in that February, March period. And when we talk about being able to see some sequential increases in pricing, I think there is going to be some additional relationships and that come online, as we go through the early part of the second quarter and third quarter.So -- but at this point, I wouldn't say that we've been able to narrow the deficit with those things happening. The timing has worked out like we had planned for it to work out, and the dialogue with the customers has been positive around it. So, I guess that's where I would leave that. -- Dave, the only thing I'd throw in as an adder is sudden jolts are disruptive as heck. And what it really requires is all of us, our suppliers, Fastenal, our customers having a really informed, frank discussion about what's happening because it's been incredibly disruptive in the last four months.In fact, it probably took away some growth because you're having -- a lot of our sales teams are having discussions about pricing when I'd rather have discussions about growing the business. And -- but it's going to be disruptive. If anybody on the call has a crystal ball and can tell me what's going to happen with the tariff in six months and twelve months from now and do they get bigger? Do they get smaller? Do they unwind? Is it messy? It's going to be disruptive. Just disruptive on the unwind is -- was it unwind. And only time will tell how that works.Fortunately, on an unwind, whenever it occurs, while it might be disruptive to pricing, it's probably going to be helpful to the underlying economy. So, there'll be a lot of noise to our numbers. But in destructive times and times of radical change, the best cure is just good, open honest dialogue with your customer and we managed to do it. -- Okay. Thanks very much. -- Thanks, Dave. -- Thanks, Dave.Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ryan Merkel of William Blair. Your line is open. -- Thanks. Hey, everyone. Nice quarter. -- Thanks. Good morning Ryan. -- Yeah. So, first question I had was on oil and gas. I recall going back to maybe February, that the RVPs were saying this was just a pullback in spending. It was just a pause. Is this still the case and what are you hearing today? -- Yeah. Well -- so the RVPs obviously respond to what their customers are telling them. And the -- what we're hearing is that -- what we're hearing is that it's a challenging marketplace. We're not seeing wholesale sort of layoffs and cutting of capital spending and things like that.And frankly, the weakness that we're seeing seems to be fairly measured and tempered, which doesn't always sound like what oil and gas has been like historically, right. And so if I think about the RVP tone on oil and gas, some of them were more encouraged about what the second half looks like than what the first half looks like. But all of them say, what oil price is going to do, right?And so, I think -- if I think about the tone around oil and gas, I guess, it began to weaken, I think, we began talking about this probably November, December last year. And the degree of weakness hasn't necessarily gotten more severe over that period of time. It has persisted but it's also broadened.So, what something which began in Houston and Dallas has spread to other regions, right, in terms of commentary. And like I said, some of them feel like this is going to clear itself out by the second half, some of them feel like they don't know and all of them understand that it's about what happens to the price of oil and how their customers feel. And we just don't have a great answer to it. But that's where we have oil and gas today. -- Okay. That's helpful. And then second question on Onsite margin inflection. I recall 2020 could be the year where more mature Onsites at higher margins start to offset the newer Onsites. Is this still the case based on what we know today? And then, how much do you think it could lift overall company margin? -- Yeah. So, we haven't seen any real change in kind of the pacing of how we expect that to play out. And so, what I've said before is, today, where we've got so many new Onsites, you don't have sort of an equal ratio between how they're aging versus how we're adding them.But over time, that's going to change. And I think the proxy for that will be when does the average size per Onsite stop declining, right? And my feeling is that is probably late '19 but probably more in 2020, which means by the time you get to 2021, 2022, instead of just continuing to work against our overall level of gross profitability, that -- it will begin to diminish in terms of the impact on the mix. We still feel like that is the case. Now, what we've said before is -- and I think Dan laid this out last time, right? I mean, when we double our revenues, we want to be a 22% operating margin company, thereabouts. And in order for that to happen from 20% today, we need to see some of those Onsites begin to mature and become more profitable. And we think that, that will happen.And so, what is the impact? I would tell you, today, the overall impact is a drag, more so on the gross margin, the operating margin but it's in both. But over the next, let's call it 18 months, I think you're going to begin to see that drag really flatten out and then it begins to contribute more toward our goal of being a 22% operating margin company. -- And one thing to keep in mind, it's a two-pronged drag in the short -- over the last few years. The one drag is the mix of Onsites and the average revenue per Onsite going down. The other drag is, we went from not really signing Onsites to 80s and 180s and 280 and now close to 400. And every time we sign an Onsite, I sense (ph) that, most of the times that when we sign an Onsite, we're taking our customer relationship out of a branch, a highly profitable branch and we're delevering it.So, you kind of have a two for going on. Not only are you pulling down the average of your Onsites, you're actually hurting the profitability of your branch network a little bit in the short term. And when you get to a steady state of how many are coming in and going out, that's when life becomes a little easier. No different than, think about how the math changed decade ago, when we slowed down opening branches through the pathway to profit. All of a sudden, your mix of branch has changed. So, that's kind of the trajectory. And frankly, what's been great is that, that really has been playing out largely as we would have modeled it out a year ago, two years ago. -- Perfect. That's good to hear. It was kind of what I was getting at. Thanks, guys. I will pass it on. -- Thanks, Ryan. -- Thank you.Thank you. And your next question is from the line of Hamzah Mazari of Macquarie. Your line is open. -- Hi, guys. This is actually Mario Cortellacci filling in for Hamzah. I know there has been questions about pricing already. But I mean, do you think it's harder for distributors in general to get pricing during the cycle versus prior cycles? Or maybe asked in a different way, I mean, given where the demand environment is and where commodity inflation is, should pricing be higher than where it is? -- Yeah. Since I've been here longer, I'll take a shot at that and Holden, I can say can chime in and correct me on some things he disagrees with. But pricing is always hard. People talk about transparency in today's world. And it is greater. But frankly, our customers knew what they were spending for product and what product costs were around town 10 and 20 and 30 years ago. So, it's always been hard. It's about, are you bringing the great value to your customer and their willingness to pay for that value if you think it that way? I think probably the toughest one right now on a pricing front is, pricing is always hard. But I think the one that's got a little bit harder is the freight one. Now for us, it's two-fold. One, the freight dynamic is a little bit different because Onsites are a different dynamic for freight than the branch network.And so we almost have to understand the two pieces individually. But in today's world, there's a lot of examples of where freights included or freights this or freights flat and it's fundamentally different models. And it's always just having a good discussion about your freight -- the freight side of your picture. And that's probably the more challenging element in today's world, setting mix aside. -- Yeah. And I would say, I don't know what it should be, compared to history, I would say this. I mean, every quarter, going back to beginning of 2018, we've made sequential progress in raising price. We've done that because there has also been sequential increase in costs. And so we don't love obviously that we have a deficit on the price-cost dynamic. But part of that is perhaps, we needed to be more aggressive than we were.But that shouldn't be read to mean that we weren't doing what we had to do to protect the margins because as I said, pricing has gone up every quarter. But we also have to acknowledge that we've had some pretty significant increases in costs. And if I look at how much our costs has increased in the first quarter, it's more than twice what that same increase was in the first quarter of last year.And so we're kind of chasing -- we're chasing that piece of it as well. But I don't want to give the impression that because we have a price-cost deficit, that doesn't mean that we haven't been able to pass price through because we passed more price through every quarter in response to the marketplace. But if you give us a flattening in the cost environment, we'll catch up. But the -- I don't want to leave the impression that we haven't been able to pass price through because we have. -- Great. And just one more and I'll turn it over and you actually mentioned the freight. Just wanted to see if the benefit, essentially running your own captive fleet, it hasn't been fully optimized. Or do you think there's more room to go there? And I guess, if there is more room for improvement, I guess how much do you think that could be? -- Well, first off, the advantage of having a captive fleet, it's indescribable from the standpoint of -- set the costs aside for a second, our ability to provide service is night and day different from all our competitors. Earlier I used the example of that outdoor locker. A year from now, I fully expect us to be able to take an order from a customer that comes in late in the day, maybe in the evening and let's say, one time in 100 that customer is in a jam and they need it like two hours ago. Our competitors are going to be providing that. They're probably going to have to freight that in using small parcel. And it's not getting there to 10 o'clock tomorrow morning and that's a really expensive trip.Our driver gets to that branch at 4:00 in the morning or 2:00 in the morning or 6:00 in the morning. You pick the time because it's different for each branch. But let's say, this branch is 4:00 in the morning, our driver could throw that item in an outdoor locker and that customer would get a text at 4:00 in the morning, say the item you ordered at 5 o'clock last night is here and nobody else in that market can do that.So to me, the value of a captive trucking is you could provide a level of service that just separates you in the marketplace. From a cost standpoint, we have a great cost structure compared to our peers and we're able to use that cost structure. Part of our gross margin differential in our industry is because of that freight advantage. Our cost structure is lower. But it puts you in a position to challenge it every day. It also puts you in a position to have conversations with your customer and maybe move some product for them on the back hauls.So, one of the reasons that we've always been successful is we do a nice job with back hauls from our suppliers and more recently from some customers. That's where I think we have some more legs to it, especially on the Onsite piece of saying to customers to get some pallets, you need move -- we'll move it. And maybe you get freight that way. To quantify the potential, I'm not ready to go there right now because I don't know that we know it. -- Yeah. The only thing I would add is, I mean, I think, one direction you're going is, it is more cost effective to move product on our trucks than on third-parties. And from the fourth quarter of 2017, we really begin to see the field utilizing our truck network at a greater rate because of what was going on outside of our truck network. That kind of hit a level in Q3 of 2018 that we sustained a very high level. So if the question is what can you ship more and more onto your trucks, yeah, there's always good reasons to use a third-party, whether it's a customer requirement or what have you.So, we're probably at a good level for that. But I can't emphasize enough that in a period like this of inflation, third-party inflation is going up at a far greater rate than the costs that we're experiencing on our own captive fleet. And what that means is we have a huge advantage in the marketplace that is only getting wider by having that fleet.So, what we can never tell you is how much of an advantage are we getting in winning business because we have our captive fleet, even in an environment where there's inflation, especially in an environment where there's inflation. I can't answer that question for you. But it goes into our calculations and it's a reason why we win. So, I guess the tenor of the question is when are they going to stop impacting gross margin. I wanted to take the answer a little bit more broadly because we've done things to sort of minimize the impact. But you can't underestimate the value of that trucking fleet and our ability to manage costs and our ability to win business. -- Got it. Thanks for the time, guys. -- Thank you. -- So, I show on my watch 9:57, and very mindful that we're in an earning season and everybody on this call has a busy schedule. And so, I don't want to go along. I just want to close out with a few thoughts. I mentioned earlier in the question and I thought I'd just touched on it again to make sure I didn't freak anybody out with my kind of -- off-the-cuff comment.The message I have to our team is, as we go forward, just like it's more challenging to grow when you start stacking years together, it's more challenging for incremental margin. And that means we need to work harder every day to achieve it. Doesn't mean -- if this -- that isn't a cautionary tale. That's just a statement of fact. And I feel great about the team we have and their ability to manage this business and to grow this business.The second item, we talk about the weather impact and you see the discussion centers on impact to sales and the impact to our customers. One thing I'm really proud of is the -- because the biggest impact quite frankly, is to the folks that drive our semis down the road. We were talking about freight. Picture you are driving through the middle of the night and they're in the middle of a snowstorm. That's a tough thing.I think I mentioned on last call, I mentioned it to our team internally about a semi driver who was stranded outside of Chicago because their fuel line gelled up because it was so cold. And a branch manager on the last day of the month went and rescued that person, and got him into a warm environment because it was 30 below zero.And one thing, I'm really proud of is the way our branches and our district -- and our distribution managers treat our driver from the standpoint of, hey, make sure your back dock is -- snows are removed and it's a safe environment for your driver because that driver is the lifeblood of your business. And really pleased to say we came through it with a very safe circumstance for our semi drivers.Last thing, great people pursuing a common goal can do great things. Learned that from Bob 23 years ago and it is true today as it was then. Thanks, everybody. Have a good day. -- Thank you.Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today's conference.

" has been performing well lately as evident from 14.7% rise in the stock price in the past three months. This growth stemmed from progress on its integrated retail strategy that connects offline and online channels. Further, the company's omni-channel expansion efforts and momentum in the Pro business supported this momentum.However, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has witnessed a snag in the past month, owing to lower-than-expected sales and comparable store sales (comps) reported in fourth-quarter fiscal 2018. Tough comparisons, hurricane-related sales gains in the prior year, currency headwinds and commodity price inflation in the first three quarters of fiscal 2018 deterred comps growth.While these headwinds were factored in the company's guidance, an unexpected impact of wet winter weather in all regions throughout the quarter largely weighed on comps. The wet weather caused project delays, thus reducing demand, which negatively impacted comp sales in the fiscal fourth quarter by nearly 85 bps.Clearly, the stock has declined 4% in the past month against the  's growth of 2.5%.Nonetheless, there are more positive factors that can cushion the performance of Home Depot's stock despite the aforementioned deterrents. Let's get a detailed view of factors that may aid the stock's growth moving ahead.Home Depot's integrated retail strategy is well received by customers as clear from improved customer satisfaction scores and conversion rates through investments in interconnected capabilities that encompass digital properties and physical store assets. Online sales, representing nearly 7.9% of total sales, increased about 22.7% and 24.1%, respectively, in the fourth quarter and fiscal 2018. Further, as a testament to its interconnected retail strategy, physical stores continue to be relevant to shoppers as nearly 50% of the online orders in the United States were picked up in stores.Moreover, the company continues to roll out automated lockers in its stores to make picking-up of online orders easier and convenient. Currently, automated lockers are available in about 1,000 stores. The company expects to roll out more lockers in 2019.Home Depot's Pro segment is key growth driver, with Pro sales outpacing DIY (do-it-yourself) sales for the past several quarters. The Pro segment is benefiting from the company's efforts to enhance service capabilities for Pros. The fiscal fourth quarter was marked by the rollout of a consolidated go-to-market approach for Pro customers under the Home Depot Pro banner. Further, the company is investing to bring more personalized experience for Pro customers through new B2B website. It expects to roll out this new Pro online experience to more than a million Pros in 2019.Driven by strong close to fiscal 2018, the company outlined a solid view for fiscal 2019 and reaffirmed long-term financial targets. For fiscal 2019, it expects sales growth of nearly 3.3%, with comps growth of about 5%. The company anticipates earnings per share of $10.03, up nearly 3.1% year over year.Home Depot is tracking well with the ""one Home Depot"" investment plans that were outlined in December 2017. It is benefiting from efforts to provide an interconnected shopping experience to customers, with localized and innovative products, and improved productivity.As a result, the company continues to anticipate total sales of nearly $115-$120 billion by fiscal 2020, representing compounded annual sales growth of nearly 4.5-6%. Operating margin is expected to be 14.4-15%. Moreover, it expects annual average capital spending to be about 2.5% of sales, with return on invested capital of more than 40%, reflecting the impact of the new tax reform.A detailed review of the company's growth strategies suggests that the stock is definitely poised to regain traction in the future. This view is further supported by our  of A and a long-term earnings growth rate of 11.6%.

 is riding on higher aggregate shipments, strong pricing, cost-saving initiatives and strategic acquisitions.However, rising diesel and liquid asphalt costs, along with seasonal influences on construction activity are likely to weigh on the company's performance.Meanwhile, shares of Vulcan have outperformed its  and the S&P 500 composite in the past three months. Its shares have gained 23.6% compared with the industry's 17.1% growth and the S&P 500's 17.7% rally in the same time frame.Let's delve deeper into the factors substantiating its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Based in New Jersey, Vulcan is one of the nation's largest producers of construction aggregates. The company's Aggregates business (including crushed stone, sand and gravel, and sand and other aggregates), contributing 80.2% to total revenues in 2018, is one of the major growth drivers for the company.Over the past few quarters, the company has been experiencing strong aggregate shipments and pricing, backed by growing public demand and operational discipline. In 2018, its aggregate sales increased 13% from a year ago to $3,513.6 million. Shipments (volumes) were up 10% year over year (6% on a same-store basis) and mix-adjusted price increased 3.5%, led by double-digit growth in Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Illinois, Tennessee and Texas. Notably, total revenues grew 13% on a year-over-year basis to $4,382.9 million in 2018.Vulcan projects aggregate shipments to rise 3-5% year over year in 2019. Also, aggregates freight-adjusted price is expected to increase 5-7% from a year ago.Meanwhile, increased construction spending in the United States in recent times is a pure bliss for Vulcan. Precisely, public sector construction spending (representing 45-55% of total aggregate shipments) is quite stable compared with the private sector, as it is less affected by general economic cycles. The company is witnessing strong public-sector demand, courtesy of Trump's impetus to fix America's infrastructure over the next 10 years.Again, the company focuses on reducing controllable costs and maximizing operating efficiency across the organization in order to generate higher earnings and cash flow. Strong local operating disciplines, production efficiency and a commitment to improve on a regular basis have led to considerable cost savings for Vulcan. Notably, in 2018, its selling, administrative and general expenses, as a percentage of total revenues, improved 75 basis points. Adjusted EBITDA increased 15.3% from a year ago in the same period.Notably, the company anticipates double-digi  growth in 2019, backed by continued strength in public and private construction demand. Per the consensus estimate, adjusted earnings is currently pegged at $4.78 per share for 2019, reflecting 18% year-over-year growth.Vulcan followed a systematic inorganic strategy for expansion and has wrapped up various bolt-on acquisitions that significantly contributed to growth. In 2018, the company closed four acquisitions for a total consideration of $219.9 million.Vulcan is experiencing higher diesel and liquid asphalt costs over the last few quarters. Diesel expenses increased 25% and liquid asphalt costs grew 32% year over year in 2018. Asphalt gross profit declined 38.5% year over year, as higher liquid asphalt costs negatively affected segmental earnings by $54 million. The company uses large amounts of electricity, diesel fuel, liquid asphalt and other petroleum-based resources, subject to potential supply constraints and significant price fluctuation. Variability in the supply and prices of these resources could weigh on its operating costs and profitability going forward.Moreover, the company is prone to bad weather conditions, as most of its products are used outdoors in the public or private construction industry. Also, the company's production and distribution facilities are located outdoors. Inclement weather affects its ability to produce and distribute products, in turn impacting demand.Some better-ranked stocks in the Zacks  sector include Arcosa, Inc.  , Armstrong World Industries, Inc.  and Fastenal Company  , each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see  .Arcosa and Armstrong World's earnings for the next year are expected to increase 28.7% and 12.6%, respectively.Fastenal is expected to record 8% earnings growth in the current year.Research indicates one sector is poised to deliver a crop of the best-performing stocks you'll find anywhere in the market.

" expects its second quarter of fiscal 2019 bottom line to be impacted by unfavorable weather conditions. The company expects to incur loss between 45 cents and 55 cents per share (on an adjusted basis), which is much wider than the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of 26 cents.Historically, the second quarter has been the most difficult quarter. The company experienced extremely harsh weather conditions in this fiscal second quarter, mostly in February and early March. Through mid-March, the weather negatively impacted 40% to 75% of the company's available selling days, depending on geography. Higher-than-normal seasonal pressure impacted margins that contracted more than the company had anticipated. It also resulted in higher variable expenses given weather fluctuations.Beacon Roofing expects its fiscal 2019 earnings to be toward the lower end of its earlier guided range of $2.90 to $3.35.In the las  ed quarter, the company's top and bottom lines surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.6% and 7.1%, respectively on higher revenues and gross margin. Beacon Roofing, one of the largest distributors of residential as well as commercial roofing materials and complementary building products, posted record sales of $1.72 billion in the fiscal first quarter, up 53.4% year over year.However, earnings decreased 11.8% from a year ago, primarily due to 80.1% increase in operating expense during the quarter. Increased interest expenses along with preferred dividend payments associated with the acquisition of Allied added to the woes. Also, its earnings lagged the consensus mark in five of the trailing seven quarters.On a positive note, the company remains confident that it will be able to overcome the current weather-related unfavorable impact in the second half of fiscal 2019 on the back of higher volumes and margin expansion.Over the past three months, the company's shares have gained 10.8%, compared with its industry's rally of 12.1%. Higher contribution from the Allied Building Products acquisition and successful price increases associated with solid demand environment are expected to support Beacon Roofing's growth. Also, its focus on productivity enhancement is likely to aid this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company's performance.

 's  inorganic moves, value-building techniques and cost-saving initiatives are key growth drivers. Meanwhile, shares of Masco have gained 35.1% in the past three months, outperforming its  's rally of 12.5%.However, rising raw material costs and prevailing homebuilding headwinds raise concerns.Let's delve deeper into the factors substantiating its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Masco, being one of the leading cabinet manufacturers in the United States, holds the highest share in faucets. The company's value-building techniques depict strong demand for its market-leading brands. Notably, its Behr brand is the topmost brand for architectural coatings in the DIY market.The company expands its product portfolio through various inorganic moves. In 2018, the company acquired Kichler Lighting in order to complement its product line and expand in the fragmented $6-billion U.S. residential lighting industry. The acquisition significantly contributed to sales growth of the Decorative Architectural Products segment in 2018. Its 2019 performance will continue to be leveraged by enhanced product portfolio, with existing and new customers realizing further operational improvements, and optimizing its brand and go-to-market capabilities.Meanwhile, the company regularly divests the less profitable and underperforming businesses to focus on its core areas, in a bid to accelerate growth and improve shareholder value. The company is enthusiastic about the future prospect of expansion and margin growth.Cost-cutting initiatives are boosting profits through business consolidations, system implementations, plant & branch closures, improvement in the global supply chain, and headcount reductions. Although the company has been experiencing depressed margins, it remains structured to optimize corporate demand for driving strong growth and margin expansion in the near future. Notably, in 2018, selling, general and administrative expenses were 17.7% of net revenues, contracting 90 basis points (bps) year over year.In 2018, Masco's adjusted gross and operating margins declined 200 bps and 60 bps, respectively, due to increased commodity costs, higher depreciation expense, and ERP and logistics costs. Raw material costs and expenses related to new product launches are hurting its margins and profits. Masco purchases several raw materials like resin, copper and zinc to manufacture its products. Fluctuations in the prices and availability of these raw materials might increase the cost of production.Meanwhile, the company's overall performance is directly affected by volatility in the housing market. Over the last few quarters, the housing market has been witnessing a slowdown due to the affordability concerns arising from higher housing prices and rising mortgage rate. The company believes that the above-mentioned headwinds are likely to hamper its performance going forward.For full-year 2019, repair and remodel business (which represents approximately 85% of its business), is expected to grow in mid-single digits, lower than the 2018 level. Also, new construction is anticipated to rise in low-single digits, mainly due to labor constraints and affordability concerns prevailing in the market.Moreover, in international markets, specifically in Europe, sales are likely to grow in low-single digits. Consequently, overall sales growth (excluding currency) is expected in the range of 3-5% (versus 9.4% improvement in the year-ago period).Arcosa and Armstrong World's earnings for the next year are expected to increase 28.7% and 12.6%, respectively.Fastenal is expected to record 8% earnings growth in the current year.In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-holds for the year?Who wouldn't?

Recently, I saw an article about  that have already increased their quarterly payment early in 2019.If you can't beat 'em, join 'em.Eric Volkman,  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NYSE:  ) and  (NYSE:  ). All Dividend Aristocrats, I like the latter two. Pepsi not so much.However, I do appreciate the inspiration.Now, on to the task at hand.I'm looking for seven dividend stocks that I'd want to own that have announced a dividend increase in the first 64 days of the year. While they don't have to be in the  , nor do they have to be a Dividend Aristocrat, they should have a market cap higher than $2 billion.To help with diversification, I'll try to get one stock for seven different sectors. I can't guarantee that will be the case, but I'll give it my best shot.So, without further ado, here are my seven dividend stocks to own now.On Jan. 16, 2019,  (NYSE:  ) announced a  . Payable as of Feb. 15, the monthly dividend is now 37.5 cents or $4.50 on an annual basis. It is the company's ninth consecutive year increasing its dividend.In February 2018, I  that specializes in experiential real estate, to own in good times and bad. At the time, it was yielding 7.7%. As of Mar. 5, 2019, it's yielding 6.1%. That's because it has appreciated significantly over the past year.I've been a fan of EPR stock for a long time. I first  when it was trading in the $50s.In 2019, EPR expects to generate adjusted funds from operation (FFO) of at least $5.30 a share. With all the interesting experiential real estate it owns or is developing, I continue to believe it's a REIT to hold for the next 20 years.On Jan. 16, 2019,  (NASDAQ:  )  in its quarterly dividend. Payable as of Feb. 27, the quarterly dividend is now 43 cents or $1.72 on an annual basis. As of Mar. 5, it yielded 2.8%.The company first paid an annual dividend in 1991. It went to semi-annual dividends in 2003, and finally to quarterly dividends in 2011. It has also paid out special dividends in 2010 and 2012.Fastenal is a wholesale distributor of industrial and construction supplies. Although I haven't  in recent years, its results from fiscal 2018 suggest it's doing just fine.In 2018, Fastenal grew revenues by 13% to $5 billion. On the bottom line, it increased earnings by 30% to $752 million. Both the company's fastener and non-fastener products experienced healthy double-digit growth in 2018.CEO Daniel Florness plans to double company sales to  . That ought to happen sometime in 2024.

As of Mar. 5, it yielded 3.0%.BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has become almost as famous for his annual letter to CEOs as he has for building the owner of iShares ETFs into a global asset management powerhouse. Fink's 2019 letter was another classic.Here's the part that stands out for me:""Companies must embrace a greater responsibility to help workers navigate retirement, lending their expertise and capacity for innovation to solve this immense global challenge. In doing so, companies will create not just a more stable and engaged workforce, but also a more economically secure population in the places where they operate,"" Fink  .He's not shy to say what's on his mind.

Payable as of Mar. 1, the quarterly dividend works out to $1.52 on an annual basis. As of Mar. 5, it yielded 3.4%.A penny increase in the quarterly dividend might not seem like a lot, but it adds up. That's especially true when you've increased the dividend for 31 consecutive quarters. That's not a typo.There aren't many companies that are that consistent about their dividend. Of course, would you expect any less from Roger Penske, the King of motor racing?It hasn't been smooth motoring for PAG stock over the past 26 months with negative total returns of 5.3% and 12.8% in 2017 and 2018, respectively; it's nice to see Penske stock is up almost 9% year-to-date.I  last August as one of seven dividend growth stocks to buy. Although it has gone slightly backward since then, I see its juicy 3.4% dividend yield as an excellent check to earn while you wait for its stock to revert to the mean.On Feb. 6, 2019,  (NYSE:  ) announced a  increase in its quarterly dividend to 50 cents. Payable as of Mar. 29, the quarterly dividend works out to $2.01 on an annual basis. As of Mar. 5, it yielded 5%.Google the word ""infrastructure,"" and you get 718 million results.Without infrastructure investments, economies wither and die. President Trump ran on an impressive platform in 2016 to grow the nation's infrastructure, but very little has been done. That's because America is broke and infrastructure is a costly adventure. It's not for the faint of heart, hence the 5% dividend yield.In fiscal 2018, BIP saw funds from operations (FFO) increase by  . Leading the charge was its energy business, which saw FFO increase by almost 29% in the past year. A significant part of the increase was the result of the company's investment in a Canadian midstream business as well as a North American residential energy infrastructure company.Like its affiliated former parent,  (NYSE:  ), BIP's goal is to acquire assets at a reasonable price, get them operating both efficiently and profitably, and then sell those assets when prices are high. Then take the proceeds and do it again. Rince and repeat.On Feb. 5, 2019,  (NYSE:  ) announced a  to 22.75 cents.

Over the past ten years, CHD's delivered an annualized total return of 19.6%, 250 basis points higher than the S&P 500.That is  for investors to own for the long haul.On Feb. 27, 2019,  (NYSE:  ) announced an  to 50 cents.

As of Mar. 5, it yielded 3%.With the 11% increase, Best Buy has now increased its annual dividend payment for six consecutive years. It has also paid a dividend for 61 straight quarters.Best Buy's past issues including its ongoing fight with  (NASDAQ:  ) appear to be very much in the rear window.In 2018, Best Buy grew  , overall revenues increased 1.7% to $42.9 billion, and earnings-per-share on a non-GAAP basis increased by 20.4% to $5.32 a share. In 2019, it expects to generate at least $5.45 a share in earnings on $42.9 billion in revenue.It might not be massive growth, but considering its shares were trading around $12 in 2012, it has come a long way. When I  , it had online sales that accounted for 6.1% of its overall revenue.

 announced plans to hire 80,000 workers in its stores and distribution centers in a bid to make the most of the spring season, which is the key selling period for home improvement retailers. Notably, the company will carry out the recruitment process via the modern hiring technology developed by its in-house engineers.The hiring will take place for available seasonal, part-time and full-time positions across the company's roughly 2,000 U.S. stores as well as more than 100 distribution centers. The vacancies will include various departments like overnight freight, garden, customer service as well as merchandising in its stores and distribution centers.Earlier this year, Home Depot announced plans to hire about 450 employees in the Charlotte area stores, per sources. The company operates nearly 13 stores in that area. This hiring follows the company's announcement to take aboard 700 people in the Tampa Bay area over the next few months.Technology plays a significant role for Home Depot when it comes to hiring associates. As a result, the company heavily invests in technology for a convenient and faster recruitment process. Evidently, last spring, the company rolled out the Candidate Self Service, a 24/7 homegrown technology, which allows job seekers to self-schedule in-person interviews and select the most suitable interview appointment available after completion of the applications.

he housing market is probably entering a good spell. Winter months were subdued for homebuilding as the weather was too wet in the south and severely chilly in the north. Per some surveyed wood products companies, the homebuilding backlog is rising and a surge of domestic business will be seen  .The housing market has, in fact, entered the key spring selling season, which is considered the peak time for home sellers. Normally, the season starts in March and lasts through May-June thanks to warmer weather after a chilly winter and buyers' inclination to move to a new house before the next  starts. Buyers will be trying to dip their toes into the housing market for as long as the rates remain affordable. A solid job market is doing its bit to drive this segment.Despite persistently low inventories and rising price issues, the latest pool of sales data came in favorable. Sales of previously owned houses in the United States - which make up the majority of the market - surged 11.8% in February, marking the  and the biggest monthly rise since December 2015. Sales of new single-family houses rose 4.9% in February, beating market expectations and logging the highest reading since March 2018.Unlike last year, the Fed has been pretty dovish from the start of this year. The central bank has pledged to take a patient stance toward the future rate outlook amid global growth worries. Federal funds rate projections for 2019 were trimmed to 2.4% from 2.9%, while the same for 2020 and 2021 was cut to 2.6% from 3.1%. The U.S. benchmark yield is hovering around 2.48% as of Apr 2, down from this year's high of 2.79% hit in January.

" came out with February sales report, wherein net sales grew 10.5% year over year to $411.9 million. However, the figure was down from 13.3% net sales growth in January.Meanwhile, daily sales grew 10.5% to $20.6 million, down from 13.3% growth registered in January. Winter storms negatively impacted February sales by an estimated 130-160 basis points (bps). Foreign exchange also impacted the same by 50 bps.That said, the sales pace is in line with the company's expectation of double-digit growth in 2019, owing to a combination of company-specific growth drivers (i.e. Onsite, vending) and price realization.From end-market perspective, manufacturing sales grew 11.6% during the month, comparing unfavorably with the 15.9% growth in the year-ago period. Again, non-residential construction grew 11%, better than the 10.5% growth reported in February 2018.Fastenal derives sales from the fastener product line and the other product line. Fasteners growth slowed to 8.7% from 13.3% in January and 13.1% in February 2018. Non-fasteners continued with its double-digit growth rate of 11.9%. However, it slowed down from 13.6% in January and 16.3% in February 2018.National account growth was an impressive 16% compared with 19% a year ago, given the fact that 78% of the top 100 accounts are expanding. However, non-national accounts grew just 3%, down from 7% in January and 9% a year ago.We believe that the slowdown in non-national account customer growth may reflect slowing industrial demand. Although growth of national accounts is encouraging, it reflects continued gross margin pressure. Also, a dip in fastener sales relative to other sales added to the woes.Negative customer/product mix as a result of enhanced growth of lower-margin national accounts and lower proportion of higher margin fasteners has been serving as dampeners for Fastenal's gross margin since the past three years. Its customer mix shifted toward the large-account end-market, which produces low-margin gross profit but stronger operating income. The product mix shifted from high-margin fastener products to lower margin non-fastener products. Fastenal ended 2018 with a gross margin of 48.3%, down 100 bps from the 2017 level, mainly due to product and customer mix, as well as freight inflation.Nonetheless, Fastenal, a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, remains optimistic about its performance in the forthcoming quarters, given improved pricing expectation. Over the past three months, shares of Fastenal have gained 13.6%, outperforming its  's 9.7% growth.Other top-ranked stocks in the Zacks  sector include Beacon Roofing Supply, Inc.  , AutoZone, Inc.  and Tech Data Corporation  , each carrying a Zacks Rank #2. You can see  .Beacon Roofing has a three-five year expected EPS growth rate of 21%.AutoZone is expected to witness an earnings growth rate of 21.4% this year.Tech Data has a three-five year expected EPS growth rate of 8.7%.See how you can more effectively safeguard your retirement with a new Special Report, ""4 Warning Signs Your Investment Advisor Might Be Sabotaging Your Financial Future.""Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Moreover, comparable sales fell short of analysts' expectations. However, both net sales and earnings per share improved year over year. While the home improvement retailer remains optimistic about the U.S. economy, it anticipates softness in the Canadian housing market to persist in the near-term.The company is streamlining its store portfolio, which along with its strategy of enhancing customer shopping experience with advanced technology and inventory rationalizing, is likely to generate incremental sales. There lies a significant opportunity to enhance pro-sales.Meanwhile, Lowe's is on track with its plans to exit Mexico retail operations, Orchard Supply Hardware business and certain non-core businesses in U.S. home improvements including Alacrity Renovation and Iris Smart Home.

nvestors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above-average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.By their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.However, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the  system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.Our proprietary system currently recommends Fastenal (FAST) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this maker of industrial and construction fasteners is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. For growth investors, double-digi  growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Fastenal is 9%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 7.9% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 2.2%.Cash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.Right now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Fastenal is 31%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 6.5%.While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 11.7% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 11.5%.Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The current-year earnings estimates for Fastenal have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.4% over the past month.While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Fastenal a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.You can see  .This combination positions Fastenal well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"Teetering on the edge of a full-blown pullback as of Thursday, the bulls finally decided to make a stand. Friday's 0.69% advance from the  may not have undeniably averted a disaster, but it certainly let stocks end the week on a high note. (NASDAQ:  ) did most of the heavy lifting, up nearly 2% in response to news that it was  in the near future … an announcement that ultimately shook shares of at least one competitor out of a budding uptrend. Smaller  (NYSE:  ) was actually a bigger winner, however, rallying close to 6% as investors increasingly believe its turnaround effort is taking hold.The market's gain overcame the dead weight  (NASDAQ:  ) brought to the table. Shares of the electric car company fell almost 8% in response to concerns that Tesla  the $35,000 Model 3 it touted on Thursday.None of those names are especially well suited for trading as this week gets going, though. Rather, it's the stock charts of  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NYSE:  ) and  (NYSE:  ) that appear to be entering well-developed trends.Over the course of the past several months, we've watched Kroger shares bounce around inside of, and sometimes outside of, a narrowing trading range. Since December, the stock has spent more time below the floor of that range than above it, although it never really suffered that ""death blow."" On Friday, however, the 4.5% stumble in response to news of Amazon's grocery ambitions broke several key support lines.There's one more chance to salvage it, but the bulls are going to have to work a little magic to keep several months' worth of indecision from becoming unleashed in a hurry.Click to Enlarge  • The shape and placement of Friday's bar is the key. Kroger shares started above them all, but in one fell swoop the stock broke back under all three key moving average lines as well as the lower edge of the rising wedge, framed with yellow lines on both stock charts.• The weekly chart puts things in perspective. Last year's momentum has been slipping for a while now.• The line in the sand is around $26.65, plotted with a red dashed line on both stock charts. That's where Kroger found a bottom in October and again in December. That floor may not survive a third test.Fastenal Company is another name that's made its way onto our radar several times in recent weeks, largely for the same reason as Kroger. That is, like KR, FAST shares have been bouncing around - rather reliably - within a wide trading range since 2016.The recent bump into the upper boundary of that range has, as of Friday, started to become true trouble for the stock.Click to Enlarge  • There are actually two support lines in play here. The near-term minor one is plotted in yellow, and tagged all the key lows since the middle of last year. The ultimate floor, however, is plotted with a white dashed line on the weekly chart. It's paired up with the uppermost ceiling at the top of both stock charts.• That same weekly chart indicates Fastenal shares are stochastically overbought … a condition that tends to coincide with encounters of the upper edge of the trading range, and a condition that's usually quickly ended with some significant selling.• Still, although clearly vulnerable to more downside, this setup would be much stronger if the market helped, and if FAST can log at least one more lower close.Finally, it's still miles away from securing its place in a new uptrend. But, Nielsen Holdings has moved well enough to that condition to justify putting it on your radar now.Just know that odds are good there will still be a time in the very foreseeable future that it doesn't feel like NLSN has snapped out of the bearish funk that's dragged it lower for the past couple of years.Click to Enlarge  • The ""notice"" is this past week's push up and off the purple 50-day moving average line and, briefly anyway, back above the white 200-day moving average line. It's the best attack on the long-term moving average line we've seen in months, underscored by strong volume.• The weekly chart shows previous attempts to move above the 200-day average have petered out. This one is different, though, in the sense that it's starting after what looks like a capitulation in July.• Bear in mind a reversal out of a long-term downtrend like this one is more of a process and less of an event. It's most likely that Nielsen will wiggle its way into an uptrend rather than make a clean ""V.""The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@3 Big Stock Charts for Monday: Nielsen Holdings, Kroger and Fastenal Company@2019-03-04@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-big-stock-charts-for-monday%3A-nielsen-holdings-kroger-and-fastenal-company-2019-03-04
nvestors with an interest in Building Products - Retail stocks have likely encountered both Beacon Roofing Supply (BECN) and Fastenal (FAST). But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Right now, both Beacon Roofing Supply and Fastenal are sporting a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that these stocks have improving earnings outlooks. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.BECN currently has a forward P/E ratio of 11.72, while FAST has a forward P/E of 21.97. We also note that BECN has a PEG ratio of 0.56. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. FAST currently has a PEG ratio of 1.37.Another notable valuation metric for BECN is its P/B ratio of 1.34. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, FAST has a P/B of 7.71.These metrics, and several others, help BECN earn a Value grade of B, while FAST has been given a Value grade of C.Both BECN and FAST are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that BECN is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"he most recent short interest data was recently released for the 01/31/2019 settlement date, and Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST) is the #54 most shorted of the S&P 500 components, based on 6.29 ""days to cover."" There are a number of ways to look at short data, but one metric that we find particularly useful is the ""days to cover"" because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares typically traded. The number of shares short is then divided by the average daily volume, to express the total number of trading days it would take to close out all of the open short positions if every share traded represented a short position being closed.In the case of Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST), the total short interest at the 01/31/2019 settlement date was 26,261,976 shares, which compares to the average daily trading volume of just 4,175,664 shares, for a ""days to cover"" ratio of 6.29.When short sellers eventually cover their positions, by definition there must be buying activity because a share that is currently sold short must be purchased to be covered. At the present levels of short interest, if from this point forward every single FAST share traded represented a short position being closed, then at the average daily volume of 4,175,664 shares it would only be during the 7th trading day that every short position would be closed.So it would stand to reason that should some unexpectedly good news come out, and short sellers did not have 7 days of patience but instead wanted to cover their short positions very suddenly, that situation could result in sending the stock higher until the higher price produces enough sellers to generate the necessary volume to close out those positions quickly.Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST) has something relatively rare for a stock with this much short interest, that being insiders taking the other side of the trade. Looking back over the trailing six month period, FAST has seen 5 different instances of insider buying, as summarized by the table below:
  
Below is a chart showing the ""days to cover"" for FAST over time:And looking at the chart below, FAST's low point in its 52 week range is $47.37 per share, with $63.285 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $62.49.In recent trading, shares of Fastenal Co.

In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 2.8%.While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 11.7% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 11.5%.Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The current-year earnings estimates for Fastenal have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 1.9% over the past month.Fastenal has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.You can see  .This combination indicates that Fastenal is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

 is again gearing up for the spring season, its busiest selling period, with plans to hire about 450 employees in the Charlotte area stores, per sources. The company operates nearly 13 stores in the area. This hiring follows the company's announcement made in the last week to take aboard 700 people in the Tampa Bay area over the next few months.Notably, Home Depot hires regularly to fulfill requirements of seasonal and permanent positions. The company currently has an employee base of nearly 400,000, operating across 2,286 stores in the United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, 10 Canadian provinces and Mexico.Spring season hiring is customary for this home improvement biggie as the onset of warmer weather brings people out of their homes, concentrating on gardening, lawns and other home improvement outdoor projects. Consequently, the demand for garden and lawn equipment, portico furniture and other home décor-related products are usually at its peak during this season.Coming back to the hiring, interested candidates in the Charlotte area may use Home Depot's 15-minute application or even text the company to begin the application process. Home Depot is accepting applications for various positions - including sales employees, cashiers, operations personnel and online order-fulfillment staff to make the most of the spring season. These positions comprise both permanent part-time and seasonal job openings.In 2017, Home Depot rolled out a 15-minute application, Mobile Apply and Text-to-Apply facilities, easing the job application process, which reflected 50% increase in job applications. The company states that nearly 50% of the seasonal jobs generally transition into permanent jobs at Home Depot.Notably, Home Depot's arch-rival  also announced its second National Hiring Day to hire over 50,000 full-time, part-time and seasonal employees in its more than 1,700 U.S. stores to make the spring season more profitable. As part of the event, Lowe's will hire about 1,200 employees in the Charlotte area. The company currently employs more than 240,000 people in its U.S. stores.We note that hiring plans had little impact on Home Depot's stock price, which has improved 1.6% yesterday. However, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has outperformed the  in the past month. The company's shares have gained 6.8% while the industry grew 5.6%.We look forward to the company's fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings release on Feb 26.Fastenal Company  has a long-term earnings growth rate of 16% and it currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see  .Beacon Roofing Supply  , also a Zacks Rank #2 stock, has a long-term earnings growth rate of 21%.Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

t has been about a month since the las  report for Fastenal (FAST). Shares have added about 9.8% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Fastenal due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recen  in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Fastenal Company reported fourth-quarter 2018 results, wherein earnings met the Zacks Consensus Estimate, while sales beat the same. Higher market demand, coupled with growth in industrial vending business and existing Onsite locations are encouraging. However, its gross margin suffered due to inflationary pressures.Fastenal reported adjusted earnings (adjusting for discrete tax items) of 60 cents per share in the quarter, in line with analysts' expectation. That said, earnings surged 34.9% from 45 cents reported a year ago.Net sales of $1.23 billion surpassed the consensus mark of $1.22 billion. Sales also grew 13.2% year over year on the back of higher underlying market demand, along with growth in industrial vending business and existing Onsite locations.The company's daily sales grew 13.2% in the quarter, lower than 14.8% increase recorded in the prior-year quarter. That said, demand remained strong in the quarter, with average daily sales in December up 14.5% year over year, aided by acceleration in fasteners business (13.1% in December from 10.4% in November) along with manufacturing and non-residential construction markets. Notably, Fastenal's organic daily sales grew at a 10%-plus rate for 19 consecutive months.On a monthly basis, daily sales improved 14.5% in December, 12.3% in November and 12.4% in October compared with 13.8%, 15.4% and 14.7%, respectively, in the prior-year months.Daily sales of Fastener products (mainly used for industrial production and accounting for approximately 34.4% of the total sales) rose 11.3% year over year in the quarter.Non-fastener products' daily sales (mainly used for maintenance and representing 65.6% of the quarterly sales) increased 14.6% year over year.As of Dec 31, 2018, Fastenal operated 81,137 vending machines, up 13.6% year over year. During the quarter, the company signed 4,980 machine contracts, up 16.7% year over year.Fastenal signed 67 new Onsite locations during the quarter, up 17.5% from 57 signings in the prior-year quarter. As of Dec 31, 2018, the company had 894 active sites, up 47.8% from a year ago. It has signed 32 new national account contracts in the fourth quarter (representing 52.4% of the total revenues). Daily sales to national account customers increased 18.1% on a year-over-year basis during the quarter.Gross margin of 47.7% in the fourth quarter of 2018 contracted 110 bps year over year due to changes in product and customer mix, inflation, as well as higher product and freight expenses.However, operating margin expanded 30 bps year over year to 19% in the quarter, owing to an improvement in operating and administrative expenses.Earnings came in at $2.62 per share in 2018, reflecting 30.5% growth from the 2017 level. Net sales were $4.96 billion, up 13.1% from 2017. Daily sales also grew 13.1% from a year ago.Cash and cash equivalents were $167.2 million as of Dec 31, 2018, up from $116.9 million on Dec 31, 2017. Long-term debt was $497 million, up from $412 million at the end of 2017.Given the solid demand trends, Fastenal expects to achieve incremental margin range of 20-25% in 2019.Fresh estimates followed an upward path over the past two months.Currently, Fastenal has a strong Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with a C. Following the exact same course, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Fastenal has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). We expect an above average return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

 is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 numbers on Feb 27, before the opening bell. In the las  ed quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 7.2%. However, in the trailing four quarters, this home improvement retailer's bottom line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 2.2%. Let's see what's in store for the company this time around.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at 80 cents, reflecting an 8.1% increase from 74 cents reported in the year-ago quarter. Notably, the consensus mark has remained stable over the past 30 days. For revenues, the consensus mark stands at $15,720 million, mirroring a 1.5% improvement from the year-ago quarter's tally.For fiscal 2018, the consensus estimates for the top and bottom lines are pegged at $71.39 billion and $5.11, respectively. | Lowe's has been focusing on augmenting sales, containing costs and improving cash flow generation from operations. To meet these goals, the company is undertaking a better customer-centric approach and exploring market opportunities via merchandising efforts and omni-channel endeavors. For fiscal 2018, management forecasts total sales growth of approximately 4%, with comparable sales expected to rise about 2.5%. Adjusted earnings are projected to be in the band of $5.08-$5.13 per share.Apart from these, the company is streamlining its store portfolio, which along with its strategy of enhancing customer shopping experience with advanced technology and inventory rationalizing, is likely to generate incremental sales. There lies a significant opportunity to enhance pro-sales.Meanwhile, Lowe's is on track with its plans to exit Mexico retail operations, Orchard Supply Hardware business and certain non-core businesses in U.S. home improvements including Alacrity Renovation and Iris Smart Home. The decision is likely to enable the company to focus more on prospective areas such as home improvements, home furnishing products, repair and maintenance.As part of its exiting certain operations and non-core businesses, management had earlier stated that the company is likely to incur incremental pre-tax costs of $460-$580 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. Lowe's envisions operating margin to decline in the range of 240-255 basis points, including 135-150 basis points from charges related to strategic reassessment.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Lowe's is likely to beat estimates in fourth-quarter fiscal 2018. This is because a stock needs to have both - a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive  - for this to happen.

Chicago, IL -February 13, 2019 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include:  ,  ,  ,  and  .Home improvement spending results from the interplay of myriad factors, the most important of which are existing home sales, mortgage rates and home prices. Then there are other factors like unemployment rates, consumer confidence, demographics, broader economic growth, technology adoption and even the weather.So when interest rates rise as they did through 2018 pulling mortgage rates along with them, the cost of acquiring homes goes up, pushing some buyers out of the market.Conversely, when they stabilize as expected in 2019, people tend to reach for their wallets. Mortgage guarantor Freddie Mac says that already, improving sentiments about interest rates have pushed down the 30-year mortgage rate to its 10-month low of 4.41% (week ending Feb 7). Rest assured that this will help drive existing home sales (90% of all home sales in the U.S.) going forward.One factor that has consistently thrown water on the bear market theory is unemployment rates. Despite the slight uptick in January (partly on account of the government shutdown rather than economic weakness), the unemployment rate of 4% remains at historic lows. What's more, the labor force participation rate, at 63.2% and the employment-population ratio, at 60.7% edged up 0.5 points from last year. A low unemployment rate increases consumer confidence, which again encourages home sales.As far as demographics are concerned both baby boomers and millennials participate in the home improvement market. Older millennials are the ones going for new homes and as may be expected, they want them smart. So they spend not just on the home but also on technology. Younger millennials prefer to rent, which is a negative for home sales, but not so for home improvement. Also, with millennials gradually getting into the home buying market, demand is relatively less elastic, supporting relatively stronger pricing.Baby boomers on the other hand generally prefer home improvements, and that includes technology adoption. Remember these are the folks that have spent fortunes on their homes because of which they are loathe to move. They would much rather renovate or add smart home technology.Contrary to popular perception, a growing percentage of this group is spending on things like Internet-connected TV, streaming video, digital devices for photo viewing and Netflix, as the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) finds. eMarketer finds that 8.2 million baby boomers were using smart speakers in 2018, up 28.1% from 6.4 million in 2017.The uncertainty in weather conditions encourage home improvement spending to deal with untoward weather conditions.The Home Depot and Lowe's Companies dominate the market, and both have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and VGM score A.Other stocks in the Zacks-classified Building products-Retail industry are Zacks #2 (Buy) ranked Beacon Roofing Supply , Lumber Liquidators Holdings, Inc and Fastenal Company. You can see It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But from 2000-2018, while the market gained +4.8% per year, our top stock-picking strategy averaged +54.3% per year.How has that screen done lately? From 2017-2018, it sextupled the market's +15.8% gain with a soaring +98.3% return.Media ContactZacks 800-767-3771 ext. 9339Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

The bulls tried their best, but when push came to shove, they just didn't have enough fight. Spurred by just a few too many lackluster earnings reports, the  ended yesterday's action down to the tune of 0.27%. (NYSE:  ) was one of those names with an alarming quarterly report. KO stock fell more than 8% on the heels of expected Q4 sales and profits, but a  that was considerably less than estimated.  (NYSE:  ) ended the day even deeper in the red, though, sliding 13% after  .There were a handful of winners, like  (NYSE:  ), which advanced 2.2% in step with rising oil prices, and was up another percentage point in after-hours trading. In fact, there was more bullish volume than bearish volume on Thursday. There just wasn't enough buying interest in the right stocks to lift the market over the hump.Headed into the weekend, the stock charts of  (NYSE:  ),  (NYSE:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ) are of the most interest. Here's why, and what to look for.Back in October, Fastenal Company shares were in something of a freefall, After bumping into a long-standing resistance line in August, all signs pointed to a trip back to the lower edge of the trading range that has framed the volatile rally going back to 2016.That never happened … at least not in full. Rather than making a complete pullback, FAST stock hit a low about halfway there, and then made a triple bottom and established a new support line in December.Now we're back at the long-term ceiling, and hinting at another bearish outcome. The question is, which floor is the one that will do the job?Click to Enlarge  • The trading range is framed by white dashed lines on both stock charts. We bumped into the upper one this week.• The newly developed intermediate-term floor is marked with a yellow dashed line, also on both stock charts.• The weekly chart's stochastic indicator is in overbought territory, which has also coincided with pullbacks; that's not a condition that lasts long.With nothing more than a quick glance, the 0.3% gain Davita dished out yesterday is little to cheer. Indeed, DVA has been suspiciously left out of the most of the post-December rally.A closer, second look at Thursday's action, though, sets the stage for renewed bullishness in light of the other clues that have materialized over the course of the past couple of weeks.Click to Enlarge  • While Thursday's gain was ho-hum, the intraday turnaround was telling. The bears had a chance to tip it over with the early move back under key short-term moving average lines, but the bulls weren't going to give up any ground.• And those bulls are certainly strong in number. Even beyond yesterday's volume surge behind the advance, the accumulation (buying) days have seen higher and higher volume.• There may be some brewing resistance around the $58.10 area, which is marked with a dashed blue line on both stock charts.Finally, it's not said often enough, but there's a lot of value in spotting a surge in volatility from a particular stock, or index. When the war between the buyers and sellers heats up, it often signals a turning point.BorgWarner shares have been particularly volatile the past few days, in all the right places. It looked like the bears were going to take control last week, but the bulls made a strong statement yesterday. They also failed to move above the one key ceiling they really needed to clear, however, so the outcome of this skirmish hangs on the balance.Either way, some something big is likely to come from the melee.Click to Enlarge  • The big line in the sand is $41.50, plotted with a yellow dashed line on both stock charts. That's where BorgWarner has peaked several times since October, and it was still trouble as of yesterday.• Also noteworthy, however, is how the purple 50-day moving average line has stepped up as a technical floor.• Even before yesterday's big gain, the bullish volume was brewing, suggesting the undertow is bullish. The stumble from last week, though on above-average volume, didn't take shape with a lot of bears' support.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@3 Big Stock Charts for Friday: Davita, Fastenal Company and BorgWarner@2019-02-15@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-big-stock-charts-for-friday%3A-davita-fastenal-company-and-borgwarner-2019-02-15
The shares of  (NASDAQ: FAST) , an industrial supplier of fasteners, tools, and other supplies, rose an impressive 15% in January, according to data provided by  . That was likely a relief for investors, who saw the stock fall nearly 12% in December and roughly 4% for all of 2018. What was most interesting about January's performance, however, was the material spike higher in the middle of the month -- just when Fastenal reported earnings.As an industrial company, Fastenal is sensitive to the ups and downs of the economy. When its customers experience slowing demand, they don't order as many fasteners because they simply don't need them. That, in turn, puts a crimp in Fastenal's business. Although the U.S. economy has been doing fairly well lately, there have been increasing concerns that the good times can't last forever -- a fact that recently caused the U.S. Federal Reserve to soften its stance on interest rate hikes. This was a key driver of Fastenal's weak showing in December and for the year overall.Image source: Getty Images.When Fastenal reported 2018 financial results, however, there was no question that the company remains in growth mode. Year-over-year fourth-quarter earnings advanced 11% on a 13% top-line gain. The full-year numbers were even better, with earnings up 30% on a 13% revenue increase. Fastenal is clearly doing very well today despite investor concerns about the economy. So it makes sense that when investor sentiment turned more positive in January, Fastenal shares picked up. And when the company reported strong growth in the middle of the month, the shares got another shot of adrenaline.That said, there's an important nuance to monitor here. The company closed 147 locations in 2018. At first, that sounds pretty bad, but it isn't. Fastenal has been  to better integrate with its customers. That has, notably, included vending machines -- the company grew its vending fleet by 14% in 2018, adding more than 22,000 vending devices. The trend toward on-site locations is the one to watch here, and it looks like the results are still strong. That's a trend that bodes well for financial results in 2019.Investor sentiment helped turn December's share price decline around in January, with an extra boost from strong 2018 earnings. The key story on the earnings front, meanwhile, is Fastenal's continued successful shift toward on-site locations. That said, the dour mood on Wall Street that pushed the company's shares lower at the end of 2018 shouldn't be ignored. Fastenal operates in the  , and the U.S. growth streak is, indeed, looking a little long in the tooth.There's nothing imminent to suggest a downturn is in the cards, but if you buy Fastenal, you should go in knowing that when the next downturn hits, the company will feel the hit on the top and bottom lines. And, more to the point, investors are likely to push the shares lower again even if the company's shift toward on-site locations continues to progress as expected.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Fastenal wasn't one of them!

ome improvement spending results from the interplay of myriad factors, the most important of which are existing home sales, mortgage rates and home prices. Then there are other factors like unemployment rates, consumer confidence, demographics, broader economic growth, technology adoption and even the weather.So when interest rates rise as they did through 2018 pulling mortgage rates along with them, the cost of acquiring homes goes up, pushing some buyers out of the market.Conversely, when they stabilize as expected in 2019, people tend to reach for their wallets. Mortgage guarantor Freddie Mac says that already, improving sentiments about interest rates have pushed down the 30-year mortgage rate to its 10-month low of 4.41% (week ending Feb 7). Rest assured that this will help drive existing home sales (90% of all home sales in the U.S.) going forward.One factor that has consistently thrown water on the bear market theory is unemployment rates. Despite the slight uptick in January (partly on account of the government shutdown rather than economic weakness), the unemployment rate of 4% remains at historic lows. What's more, the labor force participation rate, at 63.2% and the employment-population ratio, at 60.7% edged up 0.5 points from last year. A low unemployment rate increases consumer confidence, which again encourages home sales.As far as demographics are concerned both baby boomers and millennials participate in the home improvement market. Older millennials are the ones going for new homes and as may be expected, they want them smart. So they spend not just on the home but also on technology. Younger millennials prefer to rent, which is a negative for home sales, but not so for home improvement. Also, with millennials gradually getting into the home buying market, demand is relatively less elastic, supporting relatively stronger pricing.Baby boomers on the other hand generally prefer home improvements, and that includes technology adoption. Remember these are the folks that have spent fortunes on their homes because of which they are loathe to move. They would much rather renovate or add smart home technology.Contrary to popular perception, a growing percentage of this group is spending on things like Internet-connected TV, streaming video, digital devices for photo viewing and Netflix, as the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) finds. eMarketer finds that 8.2 million baby boomers were using smart speakers in 2018, up 28.1% from 6.4 million in 2017.The uncertainty in weather conditions encourage home improvement spending to deal with untoward weather conditions.The Home Depot  and Lowe's Companies  dominate the market, and both have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and VGM score A.Other stocks in the Zacks-classified Building products-Retail industry are Zacks #2 (Buy) ranked Beacon Roofing Supply  , Lumber Liquidators Holdings, Inc  and Fastenal Company  .

"omentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the  , helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at  , which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Fastenal currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for FAST that show why this maker of industrial and construction fasteners shows promise as a solid momentum pick.A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.For FAST, shares are up 1.71% over the past week while the Zacks Building Products - Retail industry is up 1.71% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 11.38% compares favorably with the industry's 3.15% performance as well.While any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. Over the past quarter, shares of Fastenal have risen 6.44%, and are up 16.36% in the last year. In comparison, the S&P 500 has only moved -3.05% and 6.96%, respectively.Investors should also take note of FAST's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, FAST is averaging 3,205,267 shares for the last 20 days.The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note tha  estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with FAST.Over the past two months, 7 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 1 lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost FAST's consensus estimate, increasing from $2.78 to $2.83 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 3 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.Taking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that FAST is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of B. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Fastenal on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

nvestors with an interest in Building Products - Retail stocks have likely encountered both Beacon Roofing Supply (BECN) and Fastenal (FAST). But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Both Beacon Roofing Supply and Fastenal have a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that these stocks have improving earnings outlooks. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.BECN currently has a forward P/E ratio of 11.84, while FAST has a forward P/E of 21.42. We also note that BECN has a PEG ratio of 0.62. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. FAST currently has a PEG ratio of 1.34.Another notable valuation metric for BECN is its P/B ratio of 1.32. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, FAST has a P/B of 7.55.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to BECN's Value grade of A and FAST's Value grade of C.Both BECN and FAST are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that BECN is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

This is economic data in relative microcosm: commerce from a top ten U.S. city via its federal agency, which can fluctuate notably month to month.

rowth stocks are attractive to many investors, as above-average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.That's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.However, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the  system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.Fastenal (FAST) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this maker of industrial and construction fasteners a great growth pick right now.Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors, double-digi  growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Fastenal is 9%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 7.5% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 1.3%.Cash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.Right now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Fastenal is 31%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 2.8%.While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 11.7% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 11.5%.Beyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.There have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Fastenal. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 1.7% over the past month.While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Fastenal a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.You can see  .This combination indicates that Fastenal is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Before we delve into Holden's flipbook, just want to touch on a few things and -- so if I go back in time to late 2015 or just 2015 in general, we've seen a dramatic slowdown in the economy we sell into. We had a tough year. I was stepping into this role and I member the first comment I made to the team was, Hey folks, we have a ton of great things, we can do for our customer; what we can do for our employees, our suppliers and our shareholders, that's focused on the future, and let's just get going.And in 2016, it was the year of investment. We invested an inventory in our branch network to support our customer. We invested in growth drivers of the business and the infrastructure to support those growth drivers and as all you recall, we had a tough year from the standpoint of nominal growth. But we really grew our expenses and our working capital because we were setting ourselves up to be a better supply chain partner for our customer.In 2017, we armed with the economy that was not kick at us in the face, but was actually giving us a little bit a tailwind, we looked at the team and said, you know, let's grow our sales and earnings this year and when I talked about our earnings, I'm not talking just about Fastenal, I'm talking about our people too, and we did a nice job that year of doing all three. In 2019, we've improved that from the standpoint. I think we found a better balance in growing the aspects of our business. And one thing that was really important to us was an incremental margin that started with a two. And second half of the year, we've been able to deliver that. It was good enough in the second half of the year that it -- we produced it for the year. And that's an important component because it's not just about growth, but it's about profitable growth and creating opportunities for your customer and your employee in the process.In 2019. I think that matters is -- that's find little bit more balance and that's extend to what we're doing already. But that's extended to the cash flow statement and really hit all pieces and reward all constituencies. When speaking of constituencies, we keep it really simple here, there's four. There's customers, there's employees, there's suppliers and there's shareholders. It has to work for all four for our business to be successful, short term and long term and we look at everything with a long term perspective. But we try to have a short term edge to it, have a sense of urgency.From a customer's perspective, the biggest thing that we do every every day is, we thank you for the business. Thank you for trusting and embracing our supply chain partners --partnership. Supply chain is critical to each and every one of our customers and I thought I'd share a few tidbits out of a recent customer letter that came in and it actually -- was an unsolicited letter I received last week. It was a customer where we had taken on, we signed an Onsite earlier in the year. It's been a customer for years from an MRO perspective, but we took on their OEM fasteners. As we've talked on the past, OEM fasteners is a very intimate relationship because we're selling them not just the stuff they need in their facility, we're selling them the components of what they're representing and selling to their customer. We're part of their DNA in the OEM fastener world.And the letter touched on a handful of bullets about the business that first talked about the bidding process. The last sentence in the brief paragraph, Fastenal by far presented the best with the most advantages for present and future growth. Fastenal is a best -- the best option. From a transition of implementation again, that's a scary place for a customer to be because your production line is dependent on hiccups that can occur in transition.And second sentence in this paragraph Fastenal merely brought on for an Onsite a team of professionals with a lead implementation person that manage through each item of inventory with each group function within our company. Stackouts through the process which started in March 2018, we have not seen a single stockout situation within our company. Communication was and is top notch on all matters.Urgency, Fastenal communication and sense of urgency has been exceptional. Engineering support; knowledge support and testing that we get now in all parts, is exceptional. Sourcing; we've been able to keep current manufacturers, as well as looking at other options for cost savings. The value we bring is the high level of service, but it's also an opportunity to challenge status quo and take costs out of supply chain. That's what we do for our customers. It's not just about fulfillment, that's an important component. But it's also about bringing the supply chain knowledge to lower your cost, and improve yours and your customers' value proposition in the marketplace.Service support; Fastenal onsite management has been exceptional and in our letter closes to say, we look at Fastenal as an extension of our company and with the onsite service we have, our folks don't have any doubt on where to go. So, I thought I'd share that letter. It was really fun to receive and I called the individual that sent it, and personally thanked her. But it's really indicative of what our business and our onsite strategy is about, as it relates to engaging with our customer.Secondly employees. So we grew our business 13% in the last 12 months. Our FTE growth is up about 6%. Now it's no secret in the marketplace, there's some inflation going on because it's a tight labor market. There is also when you have advancements in the organization, folks that are stepping into leading a new onsite, maybe you are the second or third person of branch before. Getting added to our implementation team, our National Accounts Sales team or Industrial Services Teams, all the teams within Fastenal are -- our base pay, we saw it increased about 9%. So on a 6% increase in headcount, base pay is up about 9%. Some of that is inflation. Some of that is advancements in positions within the organization because of the opportunity our team and our customers are creating.Incentive compensation; that's commissions at the branch, that's incentive to our leaders, that's incentive to the folks in support areas of our organization. Despite the fact that it grown handsomely in 2017, it grew again in 2018, it's up 20%. Profit sharing; we share the rewards of the business with everybody in the business. From 2017 to 2018, I'm proud to say our profit sharing contribution this year is up about 24%. Despite all that we were able to leverage our employee cost, which meant we were able to leverage our SG&A.Our total employee costs were up about 11%. Another way to think about it, there's a lot of ways to think about productivity and productivity is key to our current and future success, because it's bringing greater value to the customer, but doing it in a more cost efficient manner. Every $1 we spent in payroll in 2017, translated into a $1.02 profit. So we had $881 million of profit last year. We spent $862 million in total payroll, Holden is probably trending (ph) right now that I'm sharing that number because people wanted it again and again and again. Sorry Holden. But I think that's an important component of our business. But despite all the investments we made in people and resources in the last year, the last three years. In 2018, we spent $962 million in total payroll cost. That's everything in there, base pay, incentive, profit sharing, Social Security taxes, Worker's Comp, health insurance, everything added up.We spent $962 million, but it din't then generate a $1.02 -- $1.02 of profit, it generated $4. We generated $999 million, essentially $1 billion in profit in the last 12 months. That's productivity and I'm really excited what that means for our team and I think there's a lot of opportunities to expand that in the future.Our suppliers that are constituent had a really successful years with us. Suppliers have been -- that have been willing to evolve and change to support our vending business in the last 10 years, our onsite business in the last three years, four years; our construction business, our National Account business, our local business, a Fastenal model, have had really successful years. I've met with a lot of more in the last two months and really excited about what 2019 can mean and what they're seeing downstream in their business.Finally shareholders; you know, our shareholders have been rewarded as well. Our stock has been, it's been a little bit in purgatory, feels like for a period, a period of years. We've started to move out of it though and we were seeing that you know some in '17, some in '18. Our sector is no secret to the folks in this call. I've seen a bit of a multiple compression and we've tried to offset some of that by strong dividend and buyback aspects and I'm pleased to say when I look at that press release we just put out or last night on our dividend and our stock buybacks, if I take the dividend we just declared for the first quarter of 2019 and extend it to the year, assuming we pay about the same each quarter, and look at the last 9 years and add the 600 million of buybacks we've done.We've returned almost $4 billion, $3 billion -- $3.85 billion to be exact to our shareholders. In a business that's thrived and grown in that time frame and we've essentially doubled in size in that 10-year time frame from a little over $2 billion to about $5 billion in revenue.In the last five years, we've returned about 65% of that number, about $2.5 billion and on a $15.5 billion market cap, we've returned about 16% of that number over the last five years. We're proud of that number. And we believe we have ability to grow that in the future. We just need to work on a cash flow statement little bit better, to be able to do set even further.Turning to the flipbook and before we started on that, I do want to cite, I mentioned the aspect of employees within Fastenal, a part of our Blue team. There's a few Blue team members I want to cite right now. First is, we have two employees that are going to hit a really big milestone and we believe in service and milestones and every year at our Florida event, we recognize our 25-year employees. We actually have two employees here in 2019 that are going to recognize 40 years of service within Fastenal.The first one is Nick Lundquist. In March -- he joined us in 1979. In March, he will hit 40 years with the company. You know, he must've started when he was about 10 years, or 11 years old. Because he's got the spunky has in him and the dedication he brings to the organization everyday is impressive and he continues to develop people around him, which is a sign of a great leader.The second person is Dana Johnson. In August, Dana will celebrate 40 years with the organization. Dana, might not be is well known to this group. Dana is -- leads our property area and over the years Dana has had a multitude roles within organization and the professionalism and the talent he brings to every role he serves, is impressive. So, I congratulate both of them on the 40-year milestone this year.Speaking of Blue team. Two people that are particularly close to me within Fastenal a lot, recently lost a parent. In December, Reyne Wisecup, lost her father and here several weeks ago, Nick Lundquist lost his mother. Now both of those individuals enjoyed long lives. They are great families. But for Nick and Maria and for Reyne and John, even an important part of our Blue team family and our condolences and prayers are with you.Now let's flip to the book. Fourth Quarter 2018, it came in at $0.59. There's a discrete tax item in there, a little bit of noise in tax items in the last four or five quarters, something about a new tax law signed in the U.S., creates a little bit noise. Absent this, our EPS would have been $0.60 for the quarter. Adjusting for discrete items in both years, EPS grew about 14%. Demand is strong, 13.2% sales growth in the fourth quarter. That's our sixth quarter of at least 13% growth. We continue to execute really well on our growth drivers and I'll touch on that in a few minutes.Operating leverage; remains strong. We have gross margin pressure, some of that self-imposed, because our growth drivers naturally lower our gross margin, but inflation and more recently tariffs are creating some ripples in our business. Despite that, we had incremental margin of 21% in the quarter. Price; prices are trending favorably. When I talk about price and cost in these discussions, price is our sale price to our customer. Cost is the inbound, whether that is the cost of goods cost, freight cost or an OpEx cost, but I'll try to use those terminologies to be more concise and how we describe things.Price tended favorably, but it's still lagging cost inflation a bit here and that is pressurizing our gross margin more than just pure mix and Holden will touch on that in greater detail. As you all know, list three of the tariffs, did impact Fastenal. And -- but most of the impacts on the working capital that are added to inventory late in the year and again Holden will touch on that.One thing that's positive, we have a supply chain relationship with our customers. Tariffs and inflation are not a foreign concept, no pun intended to our customers and those discussions are going well and I'm encouraged about what we saw in the month of December, what we're seeing in January, February, and March, what we expect to see in February and March, as it relates to our ability to pass through those tariffs. We're better yet, find better cost options for our customer, in many cases that involves substitution.Q4 cash generation continues to be impacted by the working capital trends. However, we were still able to return $177 million to our shareholders via repurchase and dividends, while retaining, what I would consider, pretty flexible capital structure.Now let's go to the growth drivers; Page 4, Onsites. The team really is making progress there. When I think about, back in 2014, we had a couple hundred Onsites. We were adding 10-a year, which meant 3% to 5% of our district managers were really engaged in this game. The rest of folks were really engaged in the more traditional side of our business, plus the Vending that we've introduced in the last 10 years. We started to change that in 2015. We went into high gear in '16, '17 and '18.In 2015, that's about 25% of our district managers signed it Onsite. Next year that went to 50%. Last year it was in the low 70s% and we always talked about, that's drive that to 80%. If we drive that to 80%, we are an Onsite company, because we're engaged in that throughout the business, not in a subset of our business.In 2018, 79% of our district managers signed an Onsite. We will pierce that number of 80% in 2019 and I'm really excited about what that means for our ability to keep growing and manage the business. However, when you go from 200 Onsites to 900 Onsites in a few short years, you do deleverage that business quite dramatically and -- so our average Onsite back in 2014 did $150,000 a month. Today our average Onsite does $120,000 a month. And it isn't because we are lowering at the bar on opportunity. It's because we have a whole bunch of really young Onsites and that's deleveraging the business. But on the flip side of that coin, our branch network has been leveraging like crazy. And that's what allowed us to maintain an incremental margin in the last two years of a little 20%. But on Onsites, we signed 336 for the year. Not quite our goal, our goal is pretty aggressive, but well above the 270 of last year. We have 48% more active sites today than we did just a year ago. And our goal for next year is 375 to 400.Vending. We have really breathed new life in the Vending. The team has done a wonderful job in the last few years. We met our goal for the year. We signed 22,073. We signed over 90-a day in the third quarter. Incredible milestone in my mind. And our installed base ended the year at just over 81,000 about a 14% increase from last year. Product sales, through those devices, is up more than 20%. For next year, our goal is 23,000 to 25,000.I told a team there's 254 days next year. If we hit 100-a day, that's 25,400. It's a really nice number. But our goal -- our stated goal is 23,000 to 25,000. One thing that isn't mentioned in this list of bullets, is construction. You know, when we are making these investments back in '16, '17 and '18, a big one was inventory in our branch network. We had languished in the construction market for a better part of a decade with growth between 3% and 4%, very on Fastenal like. We were focused on other things and we lost our sight on construction.Between -- put the inventory on our branch, opening the door to our customer and that we had a great local plan and in the process beginning the development of a good national and international plan. Our construction business is now not growing 3% or 4%, it's growing 15% as we exit the year. The construction market itself has grown about 5%, the end market. We're tripling that. That's market share gains and it's about a great team going after that market being prepared.We ended the year with just over 3,100 locations versus 2,988 a year ago, despite the fact we closed 157 branches. So that leveraging we're getting in our system, is coming from people leveraged and occupancy leveraged. And we're converting those closed locations into ever more customer serving locations by moving Onsite, by moving in and lowering our cost structure and improving our value proposition to our customer.National Accounts; they had an outstanding year, 18% growth in the fourth quarter, large customer growth was also 18% for the entire year. Our non-U.S. daily sales, it's about 14%, sales grew at mid-to-high teens rate and slightly below in the latter part of the year, Europe and Asia have slowed a little bit and currency has given us some headwind.With that I'll turn it over to Holden. -- Great. Thank you, Dan. Good morning. I'm going to begin with a quick recap of our 2018 results before moving on to the quarter. In 2018, Fastenal generated a record $4.97 billion in sales, which is up 13.1% from 2017. We generated at least 13% growth in each quarter of the year, reflecting what had been stable and sustained macro tailwinds, as well as effective execution of our growth drivers. To touch on those growth drivers, for Onsites, we signed 336 new agreements in 2018, that was shy of our 360 to 385 goal. But it's well above last year's 270 signings.If I exclude the branch transfer revenues, sales through Onsites grew more than 20% for the full year. We're targeting 375 to 400 signings in 2019. For Vending, we finished 2018 with more than 81,000 installed product dispensing machines, which is up 13.6% over 2017. Our 2018 signings of 22,073 machines, were up 14% and around the midpoint of our 21,000 to 23,000 signing goal for the year. Sales through our machines rose more than 20% in 2018 and we're targeting 23,000 and 25,000 signings in 2019.Lastly National Accounts pace the overall business with sales growth through our largest customers in 2018 accelerating to up 18.1%. We were active with new signings, but this acceleration also reflects success in expanding our sales to existing customers. Though today, they represent a relatively small part of our business, we also continue to see healthy growth in our non-North American revenues as well as sales through our e-commerce channel.Our operating margin was flat year-to-year at 20.1% in 2018. This stability does mask improved leverage as the years progressed, with our operating margin expanding by about 30 basis points in the second half of 2018. Our gross margin finished 2018 at 48.3%, down 100 basis points largely from product and customer mix, freight costs, negative price costs and growth allowances. Our ability to narrow our gross margin declines going forward will rest heavily on our ability to close the gap between rising prices and rising costs.We generated an offsetting 100 basis points of SG&A leverage, 30 to 40 basis of this was from employee related expenses, as we cleared our incentive reset in the second quarter of 2018 and grew headcount more slowly than sales. 30 to 40 basis points with some leveraging occupancy as the closure of 157 branches in 2018 mitigated growth in our base of vending machines. Finally, we leveraged our remaining operating costs by 30 to 40 basis points.Given continued growth in our business, there remains further room to leverage our operating expenses given continued healthy growth, our overall goal for operating margins entering 2019 is unchanged. That's even incremental margin between 20% and 25% and deliver some margin expansion. Below the operating line, interest expense is up 39% on higher average debt balances largely from share repurchase activity. Our tax rate fell to 23.8% in 2018 from 33.7% in 2017, excluding discrete items from both periods, our tax rate fell to 24.5% in 2018 from 36.5% in 2017, reflecting the Tax Act which had the effect of lowering our tax rate beginning in the first quarter.It all blended to a full year 2018 EPS figure of $2.62 versus $2.01 in 2017. If I exclude the discrete tax items however, our EPS would have been $2.59, a 35% increase from a $1.92 in 2017. If I further adjust for the differing tax rates that apply between 2017 and '18 as a result of U.S. tax reform, our EPS grew 13.4%.Moving to Slide 5, in our review of the fourth quarter, as Dan covered sales were up 13.2% in the fourth quarter of 2018, which included daily sales growth of 14.5% in December. We have now grown our organic daily sales at a 10% plus rate for 19 consecutive months. We continue to see good contribution from our growth drivers. We also saw continued favorable macro trends, as illustrated by fourth quarter '18 Purchasing Managers Index and industrial production readings.Still sentiment was a bit choppier in the period with rising cautiousness in November, seeming to dissipate a bit in December. Our business does not provide much visibility to future trends and so we cannot speculate as to whether this choppy at all will persist. However, it did not affect performance in the fourth quarter, as you can see by the growth of our end markets, our products and our channels provided in Slide 5.As it relates to pricing, during the quarter, we put in place focused resources to evaluate and execute our pricing strategies. This is appropriate in light of the prevalence of inflation and tariffs as well as the growth of our National Accounts business, all of which makes the pricing environment more complex than we have seen it in many years.In addition to this group strategic objectives, it has also taken a fresh look at how we measure pricing costs with two observations resulting first. As we reported before, we have achieved improved price realization throughout 2018 with a notable step up in the third quarter as is necessary because our costs have also risen throughout 2018.Second the impact of price on our results is slightly below what we had previously modeled. As a result, we've realized between 110 and 140 basis points of price in the fourth quarter 2018, which is improved on the 85 to 150 basis points of price that we realized in the third quarter '18. As it relates to tariffs, there was minimal impact on the P&L in the fourth quarter of '18, but that will grow in the first quarter and full year of 2019. The impact on the balance sheet is also modest at this point with one exception, while we did not buy any excess inventory in anticipation of higher tariffs, we did accelerate the shipping of plan spend to arrive before the potential 25% tariffs kicked in, which was originally expected on January 1st. This pulled roughly $12 million in inventory that would have otherwise gone into the first quarter of 2019, into the fourth quarter of 2018.Now to Slide 6. Our gross margin was 47.7% in the fourth quarter of 2018, down 110 basis points versus the fourth quarter of 2017. This decline was slightly more than we expected. Relative to prior periods, we did see the negative effects of freight and net rebates moderate in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of easier comparisons. However, product margin was below where we thought it would be. The negative impacts of price cost widened as product cost increases outpaced our price increases. The negative impact of customer product mix similarly widened as an increasing proportion of our gross derived from our growth drivers.Our operating margin was 19% in the fourth quarter of 2018, up 30 basis points year-over-year. Continued healthy growth drove us 130 basis points of cost leverage and generated an incremental margin of 21%.Looking at the pieces, we achieved 60 basis points of leverage over employee related costs, which were up 10%. Growth in headcount was below growth in sales and growth in incentive compensation though healthy moderated versus last year.Occupancy related costs were up 7.2% generating 25 basis points of leverage. Total occupancy cost grew very slightly with higher expenses at non-branch facilities more than offsetting a decline in branch facilities. As a result, most of the growth in costs related to higher vending expenses to support the growth in our installed base.We realized an additional 55 basis points of leverage of other and operating administrative expenses. Putting it all together, reported fourth quarter EPS were $0.59 versus $0.53 in fourth quarter 2017. However, the current year does include $3.2 million discrete tax charge while the prior year period includes a $24.4 million discrete tax benefit. Both related to the effects of the Tax Act. Excluding these discrete items, fourth quarter '18 EPS would have been $0.60 or up 34.2% from the fourth quarter of 2017, boosted by a lower tax rate as a result of the Tax Act. Absent tax reform, EPS growth would have been 13.9%.Turning to Slide 7. We generated $178 million of operating cash in the fourth quarter of 2018 or 106% of net income. This is slightly below the conversion we typically see in fourth quarters, again relating to working capital. I'll cover that in a moment.Net capital spending in the fourth quarter 2018 were $78 million, bringing our year-to-date outlays to $167 million, an increase of 48.3% over 2017. We expected an uptick in spending in the fourth quarter just based on project timing related to hub investments. But we also had an opportunity to purchase property in North Carolina for future hub expansion that was unanticipated and added nearly $20 million to this total. Our current growth and growth drivers require additional investments in 2019 and we expect net capital spending to be in a range of $195 million to $225 million, largely for investments in the hub, property and equipment, vending devices to support our rising success in this initiative and vehicles. We paid $114 million in dividends in the quarter and $442 million for the year. We also repurchased $63 million stock in the quarter and $103 million for the year, the second most active year in our history.We finished the quarter with debt at 17.8% of total capital, a little above last year's 16.5%, but still at levels that provide ample liquidity to take advantage of opportunities to invest in our business.The working capital picture remains challenging. Inventories were up 17% in the fourth quarter and days on hand ticked up slightly for the first time in 2018. Some of the growth related to supporting demand in our growth drivers and some was related to the accelerated shipments mentioned above. However, the third major element was simply the growing impact of inflation. Receivables grew 17.5% in the fourth quarter and is up more than three days. Sustained strong growth in National Accounts and international businesses matter. But the biggest factor remains customers pushing payments past quarter end, which intensified further in the fourth quarter of 2018. Receivables quality remains good with no deterioration in past due balances.That's all for our formal presentation. So with that, operator, we'll take questions.Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Chris Dankert of Longbow Research. Your line is now open. -- Morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess first off and I don't know, if it was limited, but we're going into the New Year here, obviously price cost was a headwind, last year we're kind of comping on that. Given that you're going to be pushing some more pricing in a more focused way, given that volumes are going to be up, is it fair to assume that gross margin in the first quarter should be up a little bit sequentially or are we still kind of fighting sideways here? -- Well I think if you look sort of sequentially at how things usually play out with gross margin. Historically, we've seen an uptick in Q1 over Q4, but over the last three years, really that the Q4 to Q1 cadence has been more flattish. And I think a lot of that has to do with, is sort of the inherent volatility in gross margin in Q4. So it can be difficult to predict. We're moving into a quarter where we're going to see how the tariff price cost dynamic plays out. We still have inflation price cost dynamic playing out. I think if what you're asking about is what we should think about in terms of sequential gross margin, I would think about Q1 looking somewhat similar to where Q4 comes in. -- Got it, guys. Thanks. That's helpful. And just the quick follow up, thinking about the full year price cost, with the team in place, should we -- is it fair to expect that by 2Q we're starting to claw back some of that price cost versus more of a like back half type of dynamic? -- Well, the -- what all I emphasize is, we have improved our price realization each quarter this year and setting aside the question of tariffs, just looking at generalized inflation, I would expect that, that's going to continue as we enter 2019. So given that the question really comes down to what do we expect out of costs as we go into 2019.I'll tell you that as much as we've realized the incremental pricing, we've also realized incremental cost each quarter of this year as well. So we still see pressure there quite frankly. But that said, we are making a lot of progress in terms of our ability to realize price. We talked a little bit about the pricing tools that went in midyear 2018. We talked a little bit here about how we've sort of rejiggered the group a little bit to give us a bit more focus information et cetera. And I think that's going to continue to provide us some additional incremental benefits.So our expectation in 2019, is that we're going to continue to narrow and frankly get rid of the gap that exists today between price and cost. -- Got it. Got it. That's so helpful. Congrats on '18 and look at moving on to New Year. -- Thanks Chris. Just one item, I'll add to Holden's commentary. When I think of the dynamic that's going on right now, whether it's inflation or tariff in general. I think this is a huge opportunity for the Fastenal's supply chain capabilities where we can flex our skill set. And I mean that from the standpoint, we're not a fulfillment company. We don't just supply you what you ordered. We also challenge in the process of saying, you know, the item you are ordering, we don't know that, we don't -- based on what we know about your business, we would question if that's optimal for your business.Sometimes it's substituting the product from the standpoint of the durability of that product, does it fit, either is it adequate or too adequate, to the demand of the use. But also, we have great partner brands, we've great exclusive brands. And sometimes it's coming to your customer and saying you've used this same brand for years. We have this brand that we actively support and we have a better price points on, better cost point which translates into a better price point. And we can offset inflation and/or tariffs by actively substituting and that comes from an active engagement with knowing how the customer is using it, and where their pain points are, where they're willing to be flexible and where they can't be flexible. And I think that's an important component of Fastenal's supply chain. -- Thank you, Dan.Thank you, and our next question comes from David Manthey of Baird. Your line is now open. -- Good morning guys. Happy New Year. First of all I'm hoping I could get a little bit of color on these large customer pricing conversations. Are you through all of them? When do the changes start taking effect? And I assume you've outlined agreements for the 10% and 25% tariff environments, but have you also reached contractual agreements as it relates to when the tariffs are eventually rolled back? -- You know, the agreements we have, allow for windows for discussions. We've talked about this in the past of when pricing can change. There is legally you can do things, you know, beyond that, you know, from the standpoint of there's always force majeure elements of contracts. We're not a fan of that on up or down because we don't think that's part of a supply chain partnership. So we're having active discussions with the customers, the discussions are going quite well, are some more successful than others. Yeah, a lot of times it depends on where we find success in the things I just mentioned, the ability to substitute, the alternative sources of supply, the level of service trade-offs, have we grown our business with et cetera. And -- but we've been largely successful. We were seeing some price increases that are going into place as we speak and we'll be going in place over the upcoming months.In regard to the specifics of what happens when it goes from 10 to 25 or what happens when it unwinds, you can talk through scenarios, but there's no agreement that that contemplates the -- I don't know if I want to use the word craziness or the noise or all the stuff that's going on in the marketplace. And so, it's going to be a fluid environment on all regards, though the one thing we did put through some price increases that took effect in the middle of -- mid-December and in those, we just -- we're really having the discussion with our customer of saying, you know what, the tariffs started on September 24th. Here's the latency we're putting in. These tariffs unwind.Here's how we'll unwind the tariffs in those discussions and really having the same kind of latency and the idea was trying to match-up best you can, where it's impacting your P&L, where it's impacting your business and having a fair trade off on the in and out, because there are going to be distinct lines in the span, but it's not a foregone conclusion that the 10 or 25, what's going to happen when or if some or all of it remains there essentially and perpetually. -- What I'll add to that, David, is yes, I do believe that the vast majority of conversations have been had in fact when I asked why our signings of Onsites were perhaps a little bit lower in Q4 than we've seen the rest of the year. One of the answers I got was because of all the time and attention that we diverted to having those conversations.So those groups both locally and National Accounts have worked really hard to have those conversations in a compressed period of time and they came into those conversations with a great plan and every bit is important with great data, which allowed us to define the issue fairly precisely and it's a known issue. And I think those are the elements that have given -- that make us be very encouraged about how those conversations have gone down.We do believe that those conversations have been generally successful. The costs related to the 10% tariff will begin to roll into the P&L in the first quarter. But frankly, I think that most of the agreements that we've reached with many of our customers will also begin to roll into January and February window as well.So what that means in terms of the incremental price cost in sort of the January/February time-frame, time will tell, but that's just a timing issue. AS I said, we're encouraged by how those conversations went and we're sort of expecting that we're going to largely be able to neutralize the tariff impact. -- That's great color. Thanks guys.Thank you. And our next question comes from Ryan Merkel of William Blair. Your line is now open. -- Hey, couple of questions from me. So first, I'm getting a lot of questions about tariffs and FIFO accounting. So how should we think about gross margins sort of first half '19 to second half '19, as it relates to FIFO? -- Well that's why we began to build some cost in the inventory in the fourth quarter based on when the containers begin to sort of hit the shores at the end of September. And we expect that we will begin to see that inventory that is currently sitting there, roll into cost of goods as we get into the first quarter.So that was all expected, Ryan. We knew that there would be some impact on the inventory side of the ledger. But that -- it'll take some time for that to roll through. But the nature of the tariffs as opposed to our usual purchasing was going to compress that window. That's why we spent so much time talking to investors in a very tight window because we knew how that was going to roll out in Q1.So I think the effects you're alluding to are certainly playing out, but our original goal was to have pricing conversations ready to roll out as we began to see the costs shift off the balance sheet and into the income statement. And we think that we have largely achieved that goal. And so going forward, we're going to continue to see that -- the containers move through the inventory and into the COGS at, that's sort of a comparable rate and then we should begin to see the pricing in Q1 and then Q2 related to that specifically and that's how we tend to view it. So, I'm not sure that I see a huge difference between the first half and the second half, as it relates to the tariffs. -- The only thing, I'll add to Holden's commentary and this is putting my old hat on for a second, is when I think of our business just holistically and I think about it over the years we've had roughly 160 days of inventory plus or minus a handful and I'm not going to get into exacts, but just holistically. About 100 of those days, we're physically at the branch. And about 60 of those days were physically at the distribution center.Now in the case of a lot of our products, and I'm setting vending aside and I'm setting OEM fasteners aside, in the case of a lot of our products that kind of mirrors where the replenishment cycles coming in and really what put us in the position of having these discussions and having a little bit of a window to react to.But that product that was in the branches is, now we're three months away from a little over three months away from the start of tariffs, where -- that product that's going into the branches is starting to get replaced with stuff that was coming in and so you'll see bits and pieces of it coming in January, and February and March that will be billing as opposed to the quarter. The full team will really hit in Q2. -- And then I think maybe another way to think about it is, traditionally when we buy a product from overseas, it might take you know, six months or two quarters or whatever to move into our -- to sort of move into our system that's -- but the tariffs were not applied at the point that you purchased the product. The tariffs were applied at the point that it hit the shores. So when the tariffs went into place on September 24, I think it was any container that hit on September 25th, we might have bought the product three months earlier, but that tariff hit right then. And so that's why when you talk about the timing, the timing as it relates to tariffs and how we saw our system is compressed compared to our normal purchasing sort of our normal purchasing period, that make sense? -- Yes. Okay. That's helpful guys. And then secondly Holden, I think you mentioned the goal for incremental margins in 2019, was that 20%, 25% range. So. Just two questions on that. First, what level of sales growth you need to achieve that. And then secondly, it sounds like you're assuming that you can neutralize tariffs and product cost inflation with price? -- Well, the -- currently we're assuming that we continue to grow double digits now. However the cycle plays out, we'll have a lot to say about that. But we believe that the momentum that we have, in our growth drivers, is going to continue. We think that will continue in the current environment to improve the price profile. And so the real question is what does the cycle do. But at least through Q4, demand is still fairly healthy, so we're assuming we're going to grow double digits in order to achieve that. -- The one thing I'll add to that Ryan is, if you look at it in the last couple of years, so Terry Owen had -- we had our Board meeting yesterday and Terry Owen came in and talked to the Board about Terry overseas a big chunk of our behind the scenes business, so all of our National Accounts team, our solutions people which is Onsite, which is vending, government, our marketing folks, our finance that support National Accounts. All those things rolled into one. Those are the bedrock of our growth drivers.We've added 30% more people into his team or teams over the last three years. And so when you look at that non-branch, the sales headcount that's non-branch, that's the part I'm talking about. And we plan to keep adding aggressively into that area because that customer letter I talked about, that's reflective of what that group does, as well as our local team and the District Manager of bringing that type of execution to our customer. And so in double digit environment, we're going to keep growing that group aggressively to support what we're doing. Obviously if we weren't in a double digit environment, I'd have to go to Terry, let's go to a bunch of folks in the organization and say, hey folks, tighten the belt, because we don't have the luxury to add that.But before I stepped into this role, one thing one thing I learned from this -- from this population quite acutely is, great incremental margin if you're not growing doesn't matter. Now it's changed a little bit. Great growth where you don't have great incremental margin, doesn't matter either. And I agree with both statements and -- but we want to be very mindful of growing the infrastructure to be great at Onsite, because this is just like vending, it's incredibly disruptive to the space and we are designed to be the best at this. And so let's go after it with a vengeance. -- Just to finish off the last part of that. So yes, with regards to tariffs, we do expect that the success of how do we allow us to neutralize that, that's a different conversation from price cost. Price cost, I think was about a 30 basis point drag to our business for the year. Our intention is to eliminate that drag and what we'll see how that plays out over the course of the year. But our expectation is to eliminate that drag. -- We think we have a good plan to do it. -- Yep. -- Helpful, thank you. -- Now that would be part of achieving that incremental margins.Thank you, and our next question comes from Scott Graham of BMO Capital Markets. Your lines is now open. -- Hey, good morning, Dan, Holden, Ellen. -- Good morning. -- So, I want to go back to what your -- just now comment was holding on price cost and kind of looping your earlier comment that the key to gross margin in 2019 will be to sort of get to this. You know, call it price cost neutrality. Price cost broadly defined as being your entire P&L as opposed to just materials, I assume.I guess as we look at your -- the trends of your sales, recognizing that on a longer term basis the Onsite stuff does start to even out a little bit, but the mix is still kind of running negative. So you have in the past said, you have to look to backfill something like 20 to 30 basis points to just keep your gross margin flat due to mix. I guess is that number still applicable and maybe connect the dots here for me that, why is that not as important as managing price cost to get to your gross margin to improve this (inaudible) gross margin? -- Yes sure. So I don't want to give the impression that mix is not important as something that we need to mitigate right. Because we do need to find ways to improve our profitability and to the extent that whatever the mix number is, we should be able to reduce it just to other activities, but let's not lose sight of the fact that the mix is going down or the mix is a drag on gross margin because we're getting tremendous growth in our growth drivers.And so, I don't think I've ever asserted to you that our gross margin was unlikely to decline provided we are successful with our growth drivers. But it is still incumbent upon us as an organization do, everything we can to maximize our gross margin and mitigate the impacts of that. But you shouldn't have any expectation that our gross margins are going to be flat to going up as long as we are successful with these growth drivers.Look, Onsites have a gross margin in the neighborhood of 35% give or take. It's just math, right? I mean if we're going to grow that business 40% take out the transferred sales, it's 20%. The math is going to tell you, it's going to be difficult for us to expand our gross margin environment, but it's a real big reason why we're outgrowing everybody else in the space. So, we're not as hung up with the idea of offsetting mix fully as perhaps your question suggests that we should. So -- but that said, price cost, that is something where that is not -- that should be in our control. We know what our costs are rising. We know what we need to offset, the markets that allow it and we should be able to go to our customers and say look we're not trying to take advantage here, but this is what the marketplace is doing, this is what we need to be doing. That's something that's about our discipline as an organization. That's a very different conversation than one about mix. -- Understood. Thank you. I was under the impression that if you were able to backfill the 20 to 30 that the gross margin would be flat for the year, but it sounded me like you are not saying... -- Yeah I know. So, -- yeah I mean if we -- whatever the number is, if we could backfill, it obviously would be -- it would be flat and we always try to backfill, but you know the fact is, it's difficult to find those in any given period. So no, I think we've been fairly open that if we're going to be this successful with our Vending and our non fasteners and our Onsites, in all likelihood over a period of time, our gross margin will go down. That doesn't mean by the way that our operating margin needs to go down. We get tremendous leverage from the growth that we're seeing and we saw that this year as well. I think the dynamic you saw this year is very comparable to the dynamic we expect to continue to see.Now I'll tell you, mix expanded beyond that 20, 30 in 2018 and it did so because if you think about it, National Accounts in 2017 grew 14.5%. It grew 18% in '18. Onsites grew 35% including transferred revenues. In 2017, they grew 42% in '18. Non-fastener accelerated, with those accelerations, we did see an expansion in the impact from customer -- from customer mix, but again we can't lose sight of the fact that you know growth in National Accounts growing at 14.5 to 18 -- 14.5% to 18%, also drives more dollars to the revenue line that we then have leveraged at the operating -- at the operating expense line. That's how our model works at this point. -- Yes understood. Thank you. my -- just a quick follow up would be, you know in the past you've talked about sort of in-product line and in-channel mix, so products fasteners versus non fasteners, markets manufacturing versus non-residential. Could you -- did you see anything in the mix in any of these four groups that went with you or went against you? -- You mean within the group itself as opposed to the changing mix of the individual groups. -- That's correct. -- Yeah, I mean where products are concerned, our non fasteners grew faster than our fasteners this year. -- I think he's talking about within the individual components, the dynamic of March. -- Yes. -- Oh, so OK, I got it. Yeah I mean the element of the -- the element of price cost was a drag in a lot of these areas. Right, I mean I think I indicated price cost is about a 30 basis point drag to margin for the full year. And you know, I think that affected the margin in most of the channels and products that we were in. Now it affected fasteners more than non fasteners without a doubt. It was probably more significant in the local business than it was on the Onsites and the National Accounts et cetera. So, there were some differential, but price cost was a challenge across the business. -- It's fine, thank you. -- Thank you.Thank you. And our next question comes from Adam Uhlman of Cleveland Research, line is now open. -- Hey good morning everybody. Happy New Year. I was wondering Holden (multiple speakers), if you go back to the cash flow outlook for this year. How should I be thinking about working capital kind of in your plan right now for 2019 -- as we'll get rid of some of the one time pull forward impacts that you outlined on inventory, but just directionally, which we see there in cash days improve and then could you just talk about like your downturn scenario planning if you've done any, what if the business kind of ground to a halt, that's a lot different than several years ago, the last downturn. How would you expect working capital to perform with the change in the mix of the business? -- Sure. So frankly, my rule of thumb model for our balance sheet would be a slight increase in days on the AR simply because of the growth in National Accounts and growth in international businesses. But a meaningful multi-day decrease in days of inventory.That's how we would like to build it out. Now the reality is right now, there are some challenges that by the back half of 2018, it was very difficult for us to achieve those. We have to take steps in 2019 to get back on the track that I just laid out. We're not there right now, but we have plans to begin to try to address that.Normally, what I would tell you is for the full year, we should convert more than 100% of our net income into operating cash flow. And this year, the biggest reason why we did not, was because of working capital and the expectation is that as we go into 2019, we should be able to deliver that. The challenges obviously are related to the inflation and tariffs and things like that, what impact that might have on inventory.So, that's sort of the rule of thumb that I look at when I think about the balance sheet. We have to show that we can deliver that again in 2019 because 2018 was a struggle and the variables that caused it to be a struggle in 2018 have not gone away. As it relates to a downturn scenario, traditionally if it's a short, relatively normal downturn, we need less working capital in that environment and our cash flow is usually pretty stable and steady. -- I'll just throw in a couple of thoughts just after being in for 20 plus years, I am the old guy, so I can give a little perspective. The interesting thing about a distribution business, it's a working capital business. We have a little more fixed capital business now because of things like vending and automation and warehouse and the fact we have our own trucking network. But it's really a working capital business and when we put up good growth, the number Holden just cited that 100%. That becomes more challenging and historically I would expect our number if we're putting up good growth to pull down into the mid 90s as a percentage o  , because your AR and your inventory have grown faster because you're supporting an ever growing business and that's considered a good problem.The dynamics have changed a little bit on that math because our tax rates are lower now. So we produced a higher, the hundred, -- the hundreds of earnings isn't a hundred of earnings anymore. It's a little bit higher and so you can, it raises that relationship. If I look at when growth really stalls, I mean the best year we've had for operating cash to earnings as a percentage, the best year and that I've ever seen was 2009. I hope that never repeats itself. We drew up more cash than you can imagine because the business slowed down and our -- if you don't have more sales, you don't have more receivables. If you don't have sales growing in the future, you don't need to be beefing up your inventory.The only dynamic that can mark that up is if it slows down quickly because we can't shut off the inbound inventory fast. But the receivables will drop off, as the sales drop off. With that I see we're on -- at 959. I just want to close the call with a few final thoughts.First off thank you for participating on our call today. Thanks for your interest in Fastenal and for being a shareholder in Fastenal. One thing for us to think about is we're moving from a $5 billion to a $10 billion company and you start thinking about gross profit operating expenses and operating margin, the message internally is quite clear for our employees.As our business evolves, if I looked out to that $10 billion company and I was just putting a guess of where I think the numbers are. I think gross margin, if the mix ends up where I think it's going to be, I think the gross margin is around 46. And I think there's some things we have to do to get better at, be at 46, is there upside to that? Sure. But in planning for that 46, I would also tell our team we need a plan on operating expenses being in the lower half of 20s, 24 is the number I always think of. And that allows us to be in a position where we could throw off operating margins at 22. I think that is very realistic. If I look at regions where we have a lot of Onsites in a mature business, the Midwestern U.S. as an example, we're above those numbers. This is a conservative view of the future.But I look at it and say if I look at Page 9 of Holden's flip book, the question a shareholder needs to ask himself is, Fastenal is investing to grow rapidly. We've added 30% to our key account teams in the last three years. Technology, we decided three years ago to spend 50 basis points more every year to become a leader in technology industry, not a follower of technology in our industry.We saw the great partnerships over the years, our vending partnership over the last 10. Our mobility partnership, we put in place next year, we think we're a different organization now. Fastenal Express, as I touched on in the last call, is not a train, it's a rocket. It's growing nicely in our business. It's not about the revenue growth it can produce, which I think it can. It's about the efficiency it can bring to our team.But looking at all those things and are you still being a shareholder in Fastenal, looking at the return on invested capital that we throw off, that whole in details out on Page 9. I think we're a great proposition to own. And I would challenge our shareholders to step up and buy some more, just like I challenge our employees to be willing to learn and change and we challenge our customers to be open minded about their supply chain. That's how we all get better. Thanks and have a good week everybody.Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference.

It is streamed live, four times per week, and features breaking news and analysis from Zacks strategists. Free Lunch is available on YouTube, Twitter, and other major streaming platforms.Wall Street had a handful of bellwether earnings reports to digest on Thursday morning, with companies that serve as indicators for the financial, industrial, and tech sectors all filing quarterly results recently.Morgan Stanley  disappointed investors, missing EPS and revenue expectations on the back of poor performances in key segments, including wealth management. Nevertheless, Morgan Stanley chief James Gorman pledged that these quarterly results would not be the ""new normal"" for the company.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing  also failed to satisfy investors, despite beating estimates on the top and bottom lines. It was the chip giant's poor outlook that had people worried, as TSM guided for current-quarter sales of just $7.4 billion, more than $1 billion below Street estimates. This underscored existing sector-wide fears about weak demand for smartphones.Things were a bit better for industrial and manufacturing bellwethers Fastenal  and PPG  . Fastenal, a maker of fasteners and other parts for all sorts of equipment, matched EPS estimates and tallied profit growth of 11%. PPG also cruised pas  per share projections, inspiring a healthy rally in morning trading today.Now, the attention will turn to Netflix  , which is scheduled to release its lates  results after the bell today. The video streaming company has a solid history of beating EPS figures, but most who follow the stock prefer to hear about subscriber additions and profit margins.The uncertainty of these types of results tend to create volatility ahead of and after Netflix's report, and the stock has indeed seen some wild swings in recent quarters. Moreover, this report feels especially important after the company's recent announcement that it plans to raise prices for its subscription plans.What should investors expect from Netflix this afternoon?

"We're again somewhat light on economic data this morning, with new Housing Starts and Building Permits for December going unreported due to the partial U.S. government shutdown, which tomorrow will reach four full weeks, and already an all-time record. Thankfully, Q4 earnings season and normal Thursday Initial Jobless Claims will help inform the markets, which are starting out  in the red. fell last week by 3000 claims to 213K, from an unrevised 216K the previous week. This is also 20K claims lower than we saw in this read two weeks ago, when claims leaped out of the long-term 200-225K range. The U.S. labor market remains historically robust, with no headwinds showing up in the data - and when they do, they tend to correct back to the mean. went to 1.737 million last week, up from the originally reported 1.722 million from a week ago. These figures have buoyed up slightly from levels down under 1.7 million for a while there, but are nevertheless consistent with a very healthy domestic work force.January  numbers also surprised to the positive this morning, posting a 17.0 headline - more than double the 8.0 reported last month, and well above the 9.5 expected by analysts. This is economic data in relative microcosm: commerce from a top ten U.S. city via its federal agency, which can fluctuate notably month to month. As such, this is a pleasing figure that will hopefully continue as 2019 rolls along.The most noteworthy firm to have reported earnings results this morning is investment giant  , which underperformed fairly badly in its Q4 report compared to expectations. Earnings of 73 cents per share was not only far beneath the 90 cents in the Zacks consensus, but also pales in comparison -13% year over year. Revenues of $8.54 billion was well under the estimated $9.44 billion, down 10% from a year ago.CEO James Gorman offered some words of encouragement, however, when he said, ""Q4 is not the 'new normal."" Gorman pointed out that calendar 2018 was a ""great year that finished on a disappointing note."" The takeaway here is that the massive sell-off we saw in the end of last year had hit Morgan Stanley worse than expected. Shares are down nearly 4% in pre-market activity, and -9% over the past three months. Fellow Wall Street banker  beat bottom line estimates by a penny to $1.05 cents per share. Revenues, however, missed slightly - $2.94 billion versus $2.95 billion in the Zacks consensus.  also topped expectations by a penny to 96 cents per share, and up strongly from the 70 cents reported in the year-ago quarter. Revenues of $345.3 million outperformed the Zacks consensus by 2.9%. Manufacturing sector indicator  - a company that makes fasteners for scores of different hard goods - was in-line with its Q4 estimates: 60 cents per share exactly met expectations, while its $1.23 billion in quarterly sales beat the Zacks consensus by 1%. Chemicals and high-performance paint manufacturer  topped earnings estimates - $1.15 per share versus $1.09 expected - on $3.65 billion, which represented a slight miss on the top line. These figures are also down a tad from a year ago. Mark VickerySenior EditorIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

 is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2018 results on Jan 17, before the opening bell.The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.9% in the las  ed quarter. In fact, it reported positive earnings surprise in all the trailing four quarters, with average of 3.8%.Let's take a look at the estimate revision trend in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company prior to the earnings release. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter to be reported is currently pegged at 60 cents, remaining unchanged over the past 60 days. Nonetheless, this reflects an increase of 33.3% from the year-ago earnings of 45 cents per share. Revenues are expected to be $1.22 billion, up 12% year over year. | Let's take a look at the factors that might affect the company's results in the fourth quarter.Fastenal is expected to benefit from its core product offerings like Onsite Locations/vending machines/managed inventory. However, higher product and freight expenses, along with changes in product and customer mix raise concerns. Over the past few quarters, Fastenal's sales have been driven by an increased installation of industrial vending machines. Sales through vending devices continued to grow at a double-digit pace, both in the first nine months and the third quarter of 2018, primarily due to higher installed base. Fastenal's signings of industrial vending devices grew 23.2% year over year in the quarter and were up more than 13% in the first nine months of 2018. Installed device count (as of Sep 30, 2018) increased 14% from the year-ago quarter. The trend is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well. A consistent increase in the number of on-site locations is likely to strengthen Fastenal's market share and boost quarterly numbers. As of Sep 30, 2018, it had 828 active sites, up 49.2% from a year ago. The increased number of onsite locations is likely to expand Fastenal's market share. The trend is expected to continue in the fourth quarter of 2018 as well. Fastenal aims to achieve 360-385 onsite signings in 2018, reflecting an increase from 270 signings in 2017. Robust construction market, especially the non-residential one, has been acting as a major tailwind for Fastenal's performance over the past few quarters. Non-residential construction grew 16.2% and manufacturing increased 13% in the third quarter, consistent with the second quarter's growth. The trend is likely to have continued in the fourth quarter of 2018 as well.The company is expected to report impressive top- and bottom-line growth in the fourth quarter, courtesy of sustained strength in most of its end markets, as well as strong momentum in vending machine installations and onsite locations. Fastenal's changes in product and customer mix have been hurting the gross margin for quite some time now. In the first nine months of 2018, gross margins contracted 90 basis points year over year. Moreover, freight and product cost inflation added to the woes. That said, Fastenal remains optimistic about its performance in the second half of the year, given improved pricing expectation as well as reasonable gross margin comparisons through the rest of 2018.Fastenal does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients - a positive  and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher - to increase the odds of an earnings beat.

"Shares of  (NYSE: MSM) fell 13.2% in December, according to data provided by  . The move sounds dramatic, but to be fair, it looks like more of a sector issue than a stock-specific one. A comparison with its peers like  (NASDAQ: FAST) and  (NYSE: GWW) shows that the decline was pretty standard across the industry. data by  .However, the decline December comes after  . For example, MSC Industrial stock rose 9.3% in November, with Fastenal up 15.3% and Grainger up 10.6%. Has the market gone mad and randomly decided to buy and sell the sector off by double digits in alternate months?The nonfacetious answer to the question lies with the trade dispute with China. The move upward in November was probably due to a sense of optimism leading into the meeting between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the end of the month. As the meeting failed to produce a satisfactory settlement, and economic data from China continued to worsen, it's not surprising to see the sector sell off again in December.Image source: Getty ImagesChina is important to MSC Industrial in two ways. First, industrial supply companies source many products directly from China or from manufacturers that source components from that country. For example,  that 20% of the company's U.S. segment cost of sales comes from products emanating from China and a 25% tariff would increase the segment's cost by 2%.Turning to MSC Industrial, CEO Erik Gershwind attempted to allay investor fears regarding the matter by arguing that the company's ""direct and indirect exposure comprised slightly more than 10% of our cost of goods sold."" He added, ""Less than half are on the current tariff list, making our exposure to cost increases at under 5% of our total cost of goods.""He went on to discuss the ""likely outcome"" of tariffs stimulating ""inflation across the broader economy and this would be a positive for us as long as demand trends hold and we achieve historic levels of price realization.""That's all well and good, but the simple fact is that operating margins across the industry haven't recovered in line with U.S. industrial production growth in the way they did in previous cycles. data by  .In other words, it's hard to argue the case that MSC Industrial has significant pricing power right now, so any price increases from China could come at the expense of its profits.The second reason is more prosaic: A slowdown in China and/or heavy industries that depend on end demand from China could slow global industrial production growth -- not good news for MSC Industrial.

all Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Fastenal (FAST) reports results for the quarter ended December 2018. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 17. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the  , it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.This maker of industrial and construction fasteners is expected to pos  of $0.60 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +33.3%.Revenues are expected to be $1.22 billion, up 12% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.23% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks  (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce  , and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).For Fastenal, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.19%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Fastenal will beat the consensus EPS estimate.While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the las  ed quarter, it was expected that Fastenal would pos  of $0.67 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.69, delivering a surprise of +2.99%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our  to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Fastenal doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

" is slated to release third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jan 9.The company delivered a negative earnings surprise in the preceding quarter. However, it posted an average earnings beat of 1% in the trailing four quarters. For the to-be-reported quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 17 cents, which remained stable over the past 30 days. This reflects a sharp decline from 44 cents earned in the prior-year quarter. | Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Bed Bath & Beyond has been witnessing strained gross and operating margins for the last nine quarters now. Higher net direct-to-customer shipping expenses along with increased coupon expenses and lower merchandise margin have been denting margins. Also, higher SG&A expenses have been hurting operating margin.For fiscal 2018, management continues to project gross margin deleverage mainly owing to the investments in the customer value proposition and constant shift to the digital channels. Moreover, SG&A expenses are estimated to increase due to higher investments toward transformational efforts. These expenses might be detrimental to margins in the to-be-reported quarter.Moreover, the company is grappling with soft comparable sales (comps) due to decline in number of store transactions. Strained margins and soft comps remain a threat to the company's top and bottom line in the fiscal third quarter.In the past three months, shares of the company have lost 18.2%, wider than the  's 12% decline.Nevertheless, Bed Bath & Beyond's store expansion and transformation initiatives bode well. In fiscal 2018, it targets opening 20 stores, mainly comprising Buybuy BABY and Cost Plus World Markets stores, to boost profitability. Meanwhile, the company's top line is being driven by its robust customer-facing digital networks.Moreover, Bed Bath & Beyond expects to allocate more than half of its capital spending toward technology-related projects to improve the omni-channel capabilities. These endeavors are likely to boost sales and profitability in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues stands at $3,041 million, up 2.9% from the year-ago quarter number.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Bed Bath & Beyond is likely to beat earnings estimates in the fiscal third quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both - a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) - for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  .Bed Bath & Beyond has a Zacks Rank #3 but an Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.Here are some companies that you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Ralph Lauren Corporation  has an Earnings ESP of +1.72% and a Zacks Rank #2.

" is scheduled to release third-quarter fiscal 2019 results on Jan 9. Notably, this leading wine company reported positive earnings surprise of 11.2% in the last reported quarter. Furthermore, it delivered average positive earnings surprise of 4.6% in the trailing four quarters, wherein it recorded beat in three quarters.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $2.04 per share for the fiscal third quarter declined by a penny in the last 30 days. However, it reflects year-over-year growth of 2% from the prior-year quarter. | Constellation Brands has been displaying strength, which is visible in its consistent earnings record and strong beer business. Further, the company's robust business growth plans, including its $5-billion investment in Canopy Growth (CGC), provide lucrative opportunities for the long term.Strength in Constellation Brands' beer business has been a key growth driver for the past many years. Despite the softness in the U.S. beer market, the company's beer business sales improved 10.5% in second-quarter fiscal 2019. Notably, its beer business was the top share gainer in the U.S. beer market in the fiscal second quarter, courtesy of gains from Corona and Modelo Especial brands.Additionally, Constellation Brands' consistent focus on brand building and initiatives to include new products are the key revenue drivers for the stock. Owing to its strategic endeavors, the company is witnessing increasing market share, especially in the U.S. beer category. Moreover, it is bringing innovations and improving its operational activities. It is focused on enhancing points of distribution at retail and effectively executing its merchandising initiatives to boost sales. Moreover, investments in digital enablement for e-commerce initiatives and the new ERP platform as part of the 'Fit for Growth' initiative bode well.Constellation Brands' bullish outlook for the fiscal year indicates that the company is likely to report strong results in the fiscal third quarter. For fiscal 2019, it envisions adjusted earnings per share of $9.60-$9.75. For the beer segment, management continues to expect high-single-digit volume growth as well as 9-11% net sales and operating income growth in fiscal 2019. Moreover, sales and operating income for the wine and spirits segment is likely to improve 2-4%.Notably, Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues pegs $1.91 billion for the to-be-reported quarter, up 6.2% year over year.However, Constellation Brands' soft operating margins, driven by higher transportation costs coupled with increased marketing expenses at both beer and wine segments, remain a threat to overall profitability. Stiff competition, higher debt position and taxes remain added concerns.

"n this series, we look through the most recent  report, and then we cherry pick only those companies that have experienced insider buying within the past six months. The officers and directors of a company tend to have a unique insider's view of the business, and presumably the only reason an insider would choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money - maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both. So when stocks turn up that see insider buying, and are also top ranked, investors are wise to take notice. One such company is Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST), which saw buying by Executive Vice-President William Joseph Drazkowski.Back on October 23, Drazkowski invested $41,948.20 into 830 shares of FAST, for a cost per share of $50.54. In trading on Thursday, shares were changing hands as low as $54.88 per share, which is 8.6% above Drazkowski's purchase price. Fastenal Co. shares are currently trading +5.06% on the day. The chart below shows the one year performance of FAST shares, versus its 200 day moving average:Looking at the chart above, FAST's low point in its 52 week range is $47.37 per share, with $61.14 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $56.98. By comparison, below is a table showing the prices at which insider buying was recorded over the last six months:

he  industry covers a broad range of groups including home improvement retailers, manufactures of industrial and construction materials and distributors of wallboard and ceilings systems. Also, the industry comprises players offering products and services for home decoration, repair and remodeling.Players belonging to this industry group offer everything from cement or concrete foundation materials to roofing boards and shingles. These sell lumber, insulation materials, drywall, plumbing fixtures, flooring, lawn and garden and decor products. Some players also deal in threaded fastener products as well as manufactured and natural stone tiles. These companies mainly sell products to professional homebuilders, sub-contractors, remodelers and consumers.The Building Products - Retail industry is housed within the broader Zacks  sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #162, which places it at the bottom 37% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group's  , which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bleak near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group's earnings growth potential. However, the industry's earnings estimate for the current year inched up about 1% over the course of a year.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let's take a look at the industry's recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.The Zacks Building Products - Retail Industry has underperformed the broader Retail-Wholesale Sector as well as the S&P 500 index over the past year.While the stocks in this industry have collectively lost 12%, the Zacks S&P 500 Composite and Zacks Retail-Wholesale Sector have declined 8.2% and 7.8%, respectively.On the basis of forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, a commonly used multiple for valuing Retail-Wholesale stocks, the industry is currently trading at 15.08X compared with the S&P 500's 14.54X. However, the industry's valuation compares favorably with the sector's forward-12-month P/E of 19.45X.Over the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 26.85X, as low as 17.85X and at the median of 23.21X as the chart below shows.Improving economic backdrop along with higher home prices might change the scenario for the Building Products - Retail industry in the long term. However, decline in U.S. home sales coupled with an unimpressive Zacks Rank raises concerns for the near term. Also, apprehensions related to a fourth rate hike by Fed might make things difficult, resulting in slowdown of housing activities.While none of the stocks in the Zacks Building Products - Retail space currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), here we present two stocks with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Additionally, we suggest another two stocks with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) from the same industry, which investors may hold on to.

nvestors interested in stocks from the Building Products - Retail sector have probably already heard of Tecnoglass (TGLS) and Fastenal (FAST). But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors?

" has been witnessing robust growth, backed by its integrated retail strategy that connects offline and online channels. The company witnessed improved customer satisfaction scores and conversion rates through investments in interconnected capabilities, which encompass both digital properties and physical store assets.Consequently, digital sales in third-quarter fiscal 2018 increased about 28%, backed by robust growth in online traffic. Notably, sales for both ""buy online ship to store"" and ""buy online pickup in store"" capabilities grew faster than the overall online sales growth rate for the fiscal third quarter.Apart from enhanced digital portals, the scope of the integrated retail strategy extends to the supply-chain system, and investments for enhancing the delivery and fulfillment options for customers. Home Depot is currently in the early stages of its five-year investment journey under its ""One Home Depot Supply Chain"" initiative, which targets facilitating the fastest and most efficient delivery network in home improvement.Through this initiative, the company expects to reach 90% of the U.S. population with same-day or next-day delivery capability, even for big and bulky orders. This will reflect a marked improvement from its current capability of reaching 95% of the U.S. population in two days or less with parcel shipping. As part of this initiative, the company has been piloting fulfillment centers, which are delivering desired results.Additionally, the company plans to open more of these pilot facilities through the rest of 2018 and in early 2019. Moreover, the company is keen on meeting its customers' immediate delivery needs, which is clear from the recent rollout of car and van express delivery, which enables same-day delivery of store goods. The rollout of this service to about 40% of the U.S. population resulted in a marked increase in utilization from both Pro and DIY customers.Driven by these efforts, Home Depot is on track to reach its long-term financial targets for fiscal 2020, which were announced in December 2017. Through fiscal 2020, the company anticipates total sales of $115-$120 billion, with compounded annual sales growth of nearly 4.5-6%. Operating margin is expected to be 14.4-15%. Moreover, the company expects annual average capital spending to be about 2.5% of sales, with return on invested capital of more than 40%, reflecting the impact of the new tax reform. Alongside achieving these targets, it plans to accelerate investments in the next three years to enhance customer experience and shareholder value.Furthermore, the stock has outperformed the industry in the past three months. Though shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company dipped 19.5%, it fared better than the  's decline of 20.9%. Additionally, the stock's long-term earnings growth rate of 12.9% and a  of B reflect its inherent strength.Analysts believe that an improving job scenario, gradual recovery in the housing market and merchandising initiatives bode well for the company. Home Depot, which competes with Lowe's Companies Inc.  , has been reporting strong financial figures since fiscal 2008, with steady improvement in revenues and earnings per share. Incidentally, both top and bottom lines beat estimates in third-quarter fiscal 2018. Notably, the company retained its five-year-long trend of beating earnings estimates. Moreover, it delivered positive sales surprise in eight out of the last nine quarters.Notably, Home Depot is witnessing strength across store operations while delivering solid digital growth, which reflects persistently strong customer demand in the home improvement markets. Backed by solid year-to-date performance, the company raised its earnings and sales forecast for fiscal 2018.Home Depot now expects sales growth of nearly 7.2% for fiscal 2018, including the 53rd week. The company earlier anticipated sales growth of 7%. Comps growth is now estimated to be 5.5% (for the comparable 52-week period) versus 5.3% increase stated earlier. Further, the company anticipates earnings per share of $9.75 for fiscal 2018, up nearly 33.8%. Earlier, it projected earnings per share growth of 29.2%.Fastenal Company  has a long-term earnings growth rate of 14% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see  .Technoglass Inc.  delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 26.8% in the trailing four quarters.

" is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2019 financial results (ended Nov 30, 2018) before the opening bell on Dec 20. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 100%.Let's find out how things are shaping up prior to the announcement.BlackBerry has a leading position in the fast-growing Enterprise of Things market. The company's strategy to capitalize on the market's profitable opportunities with BlackBerry Spark - its platform to communicate and collaborate between smart endpoints - bodes well.During the to-be-reported quarter, BlackBerry expanded its partnerships with Android and PLDT Enterprise through Smart Communications, to provide MiCab with a secure enterprise cloud solution that maintains data privacy and boosts service delivery. MiCab is an online taxi-hailing platform. Notably, the solution integrates the security of BlackBerry Unified End-Point Management with the customizable Android Enterprise, and network connectivity and devices from Smart.BlackBerry also partnered with Virginia Tech to train mechanical engineers on BlackBerry QNX technology - a reliable software for connected and autonomous cars. BlackBerry QNX provides OEMs and Tier 1 vendors around the world with advanced technology to protect hardware, applications and systems from cyberattacks. The company aims to help advance the Department of Mechanical Engineering's vehicle research as well as provide hands-on training with QNX software.Moreover, the company added a quantum-resistant code signing server to its range of cryptography tools. Notably, the solution allows software to be digitally signed with a scheme that is hard to break with a quantum computer. BlackBerry's code signing server uses cryptographic libraries from ISARA Corporation - a leader in agile quantum-safe security solutions.The companies aim to protect software of long-lived assets against an increasingly risky computing ecosystem with growing security threats. Such strategic collaborations and state-of-the-art products will likely help the company to improve its top line in the quarter.For the quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues stands at $213 million, down from $226 million reported in the year-earlier quarter. This is primarily due to changes in the accounting and sales model (implementation of ASC 606), which is likely to continue negatively impacting the company's enterprise software revenues for the remainder of fiscal 2019. Adjusted earnings per share are projected to be 2 cents, down from 3 cents reported a year ago.Our proven model does not conclusively show a beat for BlackBerry this quarter as it does not have the two key components. A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below: BlackBerry's Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is 0.00% as both are pegged at 2 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . |  BlackBerry currently has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company's 0.00% Earnings ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:SYNNEX Corp.  has an Earnings ESP of +5.52% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see  .Fastenal Co.  has an Earnings ESP of +1.67% and a Zacks Rank #2.UnitedHealth Group Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +1.33% and a Zacks Rank #2.Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

etail sales increased in November, indicating that holiday season buying was off to a stellar start. Further, the increase in retail sales for October was revised significantly higher. The jump in sales also dispelled lingering concerns about the state of the economy. They also indicate that fourth-quarter expansion could exceed the initial set of modest projections.A slide in spending at service stations was largely a result of a decline in gasoline prices. However, this was a positive development for consumers since it raised their purchasing power substantially. With only the first part of the holiday season out of the way, retail sales are set to remain robust over the next few months. This is why it makes good sense to invest in retail stocks at this time.According to the Department of Commerce, retail sales increased 0.2% in the month of November, in line with the consensus estimate. More significantly, October's initial increase of 0.8% was revised upward to reflect an increase of 1.1%. Taken together, these increases suggest that the economy has started the fourth quarter on a far stronger note than initially estimated.Further, core retail sales, which exclude the impact of gasoline, automobiles, building materials and food services, increased 0.9%. This is significantly higher than the 0.7% increase for October, which in itself has been upwardly revised. This metric closely corresponds to the consumer spending component of GDP.The report will do much to dispel fears created by a yield curve inversion and heavy losses on Wall Street. Another factor negating economic concerns is the labor market's ruddy health. Last week's data on jobless claims shows that the number of Americans claiming unemployment benefits has once again fallen to a 49-year low.Per the National Retail Federation's (NRF) estimates, holiday retail sales for November and December are projected to increase between 4.3% and 4.8% year over year to between 717.45 billion and $720.89 billion. Incidentally, seasonally adjusted retail sales for October increased 0.7% on a monthly basis and were up 5% on a yearly basis.This means that retail numbers for the first half of the holiday shopping season are on course to match the NRF's forecast. These figures exclude the impact of auto, gas station and restaurant sales.Coming back to the Commerce Department numbers for November, unadjusted retail sales increased 4.2% year over year. Service station sales plummeted 2.3%, the largest drop since 2017. According to the Energy Information Administration, gas prices have declined to 40 cents per gallon since October, leading to the slump in gas station receipts.Headline sales numbers were powered by a 2.3% surge in online sales. Sales at furniture and home furnishing stores increased 1.2%. Electronics and appliance stores reported a 1.4% rise in sales. Auto sales, which account for around 20% of all retail sales, inched up 0.2%. Sales at department stores and miscellaneous store retailers each increased 0.4%.November's increase in retail sales indicates that consumer spending has retained sufficient steam during the fourth quarter. This in turn is being supported by a robust labor market with jobless claims falling to a 49-year low last week.These trends are also likely to continue supporting the economy in the near term. This is why it makes sense to invest in retail stocks, especially the categories that have gained substantially last month. However, picking winning stocks may be difficult.This is where our  comes in. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners.

nvestors with an interest in Building Products - Retail stocks have likely encountered both Tecnoglass (TGLS) and Fastenal (FAST). But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Tecnoglass and Fastenal are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. This means that TGLS's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.TGLS currently has a forward P/E ratio of 11.73, while FAST has a forward P/E of 21.16. We also note that TGLS has a PEG ratio of 0.59. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. FAST currently has a PEG ratio of 1.51.Another notable valuation metric for TGLS is its P/B ratio of 2.24. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, FAST has a P/B of 6.79.These metrics, and several others, help TGLS earn a Value grade of B, while FAST has been given a Value grade of D.TGLS stands above FAST thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that TGLS is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"n recent trading, shares of Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $58.11, changing hands for $59.07/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 9 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Fastenal Co., but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $50.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $65.00. The standard deviation is $5.441.But the whole reason to look at the  FAST price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with FAST crossing above that average target price of $58.11/share, investors in FAST have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $58.11 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Fastenal Co.:

ooking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report? Fastenal (FAST), which belongs to the Zacks Building Products - Retail industry, could be a great candidate to consider.This maker of industrial and construction fasteners has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 7.55%.For the last reported quarter, Fastenal came out with earnings of $0.69 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.67 per share, representing a surprise of 2.99%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $0.66 per share and it actually produced earnings of $0.74 per share, delivering a surprise of 12.12%.Thanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Fastenal lately. In fact, the Zacks (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Thanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Fastenal lately. In fact, the Zacks  (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce  . In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Fastenal has an Earnings ESP of +1.67% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on January 16, 2019.Investors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

"ome Depot  reported better-than-expected top and bottom line results Tuesday morning. Maybe more importantly, the home improvement power raised its full-year earnings guidance once again. So, is now time to buy Home Depot with HD stock still down roughly 16% from its 52-week high?Home Depot helped kick off a busy week for traditional brick-and-mortar retailers with reports from Macy's  , Walmart  , and other giants due out later in the week. The firm posted adjusted quarterly earnings of $2.51 per share. This marked a 36.4% jump from the year-ago period and easily topped our $2.27 Zacks Consensus Estimate.Home Depot's Q3 revenues also beat our $26.235 billion estimate and climbed 5.1% to reach $26.302 billion. The company's operating income hit $3.87 billion, which marked a 5.2% jump from the year-ago period. For the first nine months of 2018, revenues jumped 6.1% from $77.02 billion to $81.71 billion.Comparable sales-which are always a vital retail metric-popped 4.8%. Meanwhile, U.S. comps jumped 5.4%. We should note that overall comps jumped 4.8% in Q2 and 5.3% in the first quarter of 2018. The company also noted on its  that big-ticket sales, transactions over $1,000 that represent roughly 20% of U.S. sales, surged 9.1%. ""Once again, we saw strong performance in many Pro-heavy categories as Pro sales grew faster than the company's average comp,"" Home Depot EVP of merchandising Ted Decker said on HD's Q3 conference call.Looking ahead, Home Depot now expects its full-year revenues to climb by approximately 7.2% in a 53-week year. The company had previously called for a 7% jump, but this falls in line with our current 7.25% growth estimate that would see HD post fiscal year revenues of $108.21 billion.The retailer also called for fiscal 2018 comp sales to jump 5.5% above the comparable 52-week period. More impressively, Home Depot upped its adjusted full-year earnings guidance from $9.42 per share to $9.75. This would mark a roughly 33.8% climb from fiscal 2017.Investors should, however, note that Home Depot's updated earnings guidance includes the positive impact of roughly $8 billion in share buybacks, up from the previously-guided $6 billion.Now that we have covered Home Depot's third-quarter results, it's time to take a quick look at its recent stock performance to help us understand if HD might be worth buying right now.Shares of HD are up roughly 7% over the past 12 months, but have slipped 5% since the start of 2018. More recently, Home Depot stock is down nearly 6% during the past month.Home Depot stock rested at $180.30 per share through mid-afternoon trading Tuesday following its quarterly earnings release. This marks a nearly 16% downturn from its 52-week and all-time high of $215.43 per share, and sets up what could prove to be a solid buying opportunity for investors high on Home Depot right now.We can also see that Home Depot stock has outpaced its industry over the last decade, which includes the likes of Lowe's  , Fastenal  , Lumber Liquidators  , and others. HD's climb also crushes the S&P 500's 215% expansion.Moving on, Home Depot is currently trading at 17.8X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates, which marks a discount compared to its industry's 24.3X average. HD is trading above the S&P's 16.3X, but it has traded as high as 23.7X over the last year, with a one-year median of 20X.Home Depot is also trading not too far above its 52-week low of 17.1X. And we can see that Home Depot is trading near its five-year median of 18.5X. Therefore, HD's valuation picture is hardly stretched at this time.Home Depot shares have performed very well over the last decade and its growth outlook appears strong after it posted solid top and bottom line Q3 beats. We also can't forget that Home Depot is a strong income stock, which helps it look more attractive amid our recent market pullback.More specifically, Home Depot has lifted its quarterly dividend consistently over the last few years. HD has paid a quarterly cash dividend of $1.03 per share in 2018, which marked a nearly 50% jump from 2016's $0.69 and a 16% climb from 2017's $0.89.Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

t has been about a month since the last earnings report for Fastenal (FAST). Shares have added about 7.6% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Fastenal due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Fastenal Company announced third-quarter 2018 results, wherein earnings and sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Higher market demand, coupled with growth in industrial vending business and existing Onsite locations are encouraging. Sales through vending devices grew at a strong double-digit pace in the quarter, courtesy of an increase in the installed base and higher revenues per device. However, gross margin suffered owing to inflationary pressures.Fastenal's adjusted earnings of 69 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 67 cents.

" is riding high on robust market demand, coupled with growth in industrial vending business and existing Onsite locations. Moreover, the company's focus on FAST Solutions bodes well for its future earnings prospects.Shares of Fastenal have gained 15.8% in the past year, comparing favorably with its  's growth of 15%. Also, earnings estimates for 2018 have moved 0.8% north over the past 30 days, signaling analysts' optimism surrounding the stock's earnings prospect.Fastenal benefits from robust end-market demand and its core product offerings, namely industrial vending process and Onsite location. The compnay has adopted FAST Solutions, an industrial vending process that has the potential to revolutionize the industrial distribution system and increase profitability. The company installs vending machines at the customer's location and keeps it filled with products they need.Robust construction market, especially the non-residential one, is one of the major tailwinds for Fastenal's performance over the past few quarters. During the third quarter, the company posted higher earnings and revenues on a year-over-year basis. Its top and bottom lines grew 13% and 38%, respectively, courtesy of sustained strength in most of its end markets, as well as strong momentum in vending machine installations and onsite locations.Although the company's daily sales growth was slightly lower than the prior-year quarter, the figure improved 13.5% during the month of September. Also, the reported figure increased 13.7% and 12% on a year-over-year basis and in the month of August and July, respectively.Daily sales of Fastener products (mainly used for industrial production and accounting for approximately 34.7% of third-quarter sales) rose 10.8% in the quarter. Non-fastener product daily sales (mainly used for maintenance and representing 65.3% of the quarterly sales) increased 14.9% year over year.Fastenal's sales have been driven by an increased installation of industrial vending machines over the past few quarters. Sales through vending devices continued to grow at a double-digit pace, both in the first nine months and third quarter of 2018. Also, the company's signings of industrial vending devices grew more than 13% in the first nine months of 2018. In fact, its installed device count increased 14% in the same period.Moreover, a consistent increase in on-site locations strengthens Fastenal's market share and boosts quarterly numbers. As of Sep 30, 2018, the company had 828 active sites, reflecting 49.2% growth from a year ago.However, negative customer/product mix as a result of faster growth of lower-margin national accounts and lower proportion of higher margin fasteners have been the dampeners of Fastenal's gross margin since the past two years. In the first nine months of 2018, gross margins declined 90 basis points year over year due to tough comparison, along with product and freight inflation.Currently, Fastenal carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Other top-ranked stocks in the  include Armstrong Flooring, Inc.  , EMCOR Group, Inc.  and Jacobs Engineering Group Inc.  . While Armstrong Flooring sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), EMCOR and Jacobs both carry a Zacks Rank #2. You can see  .Armstrong Flooring, EMCOR and Jacobs' earnings for the current year are expected to increase 114.3%, 20%, and 35.2%, respectively.Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

As a distributor of residential roofing supplies, it is sensitive to asphalt prices, which are highly volatile and often linked to  . This is because oil is a significant input in asphalt production. Shingle prices have been volatile in the recent years, partly due to volatility in asphalt prices.Also, its commercial roofing market has been experiencing highly competitive pricing pressures. The maintenance, repair & operations (""MRO"") supply market is highly fragmented, with many smaller local players competing directly on pricing issues.The impact of these headwinds was seen in the operating results of the first nine months of fiscal 2018. During the period, the company recorded operating margins of 2.2%, down 200 basis points (bps) from a year ago. Also, its existing markets gross margin declined 40 bps due to raw material cost increase of approximately 3% in the same time frame.Considering the above-mentioned headwinds, Beacon Roofing has lowered its adjusted EBITDA view from $555-$585 million to $510-$520 million for fiscal 2018. Adjusted EPS is now expected in the $3.00-$3.10 range compared with $3.35-$3.55 projected earlier.

Earnings estimates for the to-be-reported quarter have also declined 0.7% over the past 60 days.However, the company is poised to benefit from its ongoing integration with Allied Building Products.

Additionally, on May 1, 2018, the company acquired Tri-State Builder's Supply, a wholesaler of roofing, siding, windows, doors and related building products.Consequently, it has raised its overall synergy expectation to $120 million from $110 million targeted earlier. Also, for full-year fiscal 2018, the company raised its synergy guidance from around $35 million to $40 million.

" series of dismal economic reports about America's housing industry have been released recently. This has led to speculation that the economy is headed for yet another housing bubble. Having said that, the U.S. housing market is gaining strength, courtesy of steady demand and a business-friendly environment. Economists largely believe that this downturn is going to be momentary unlike what happened in 2008.Further, robust labor market conditions, a hiring boom in the construction industry and increase in millennials will lead to improving conditions for the housing market. Under conditions, where the space is about to stage a rebound, investing in housing stocks seems prudent.Most of the housing data released this month has been disappointing. Housing Starts plummeted to 1,201000 in September from 1,268,000 in the previous month. Building permits declined to 1,241,000 from 1,249,000 in August. Further, construction spending, new home sales and existing home sales declined to 0.1%, 553,000 and 5.15 million units, respectively last month.During the last economic crisis about 10 years ago, markets were overheated amid a glut of new houses. Further, subprime mortgage financing weighed heavily on the markets, resulting in a bump in speculative inventory. Taking a closer look at the current scenario, the housing industry is actually reeling under the pressure of extreme paucity of skilled labor amid rising prices of materials.Meanwhile, the economy already expanded at a seasonally adjusted rate of 4.2% in the April-June quarter, per the Commerce Department. Meanwhile, the Labor Department stated that employers in the construction industry added 23,000 new construction jobs in September, while it has added 315,000 jobs over the past 12 months. It is, therefore, evident that the housing space is recovering and lackluster economic data will not mar the industry's fortunes in the long run.Rising wages and a higher number of job openings have resulted in increased demand for land ownership in the metropolitan areas of the country. These areas have witnessed a surge in housing demand, north of 3% on average annual basis.Further, growth in population has also resulted in increased migration toward the metros. This trend is prevalent among millennials and baby boomers who are earning well and moving to bigger cities in pursuit of better lives. Such a trend has kept housing demand steady in these areas.Also, pending home sales surged 0.5% in the last month after falling 1.9% in August. Per the National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo (""NAHB""), the monthly confidence index went up one point to 68% in October. The index's three sub-gauges, current sales condition ticked up one point to 74, and expectations for sales over the next six months rose one point to 75. The gauge of buyer traffic witnessed the largest gain, up four points to 53.Strong economic fundamentals and increase in millennial population has boosted the housing market in the recent past. The current bubble is largely momentary as it stems from labor shortage. Moreover, the hiring boom in construction sheds light on the fact that such impediments would not last long.In this context, we have selected four stocks that are expected to gain from these factors. These stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see  . is a leading manufacturer and supplier of residential impact-resistant windows and doors.The company is based out of North Venice, FL.

 is expected to release its third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Nov 8.The company has an impressive earnings surprise history, having outpaced estimates in five of the trailing six quarters. Also, it delivered an average four-quarter beat of 63.1%. | The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings is pegged at 53 cents, mirroring an improvement of 29.3% from the year-ago quarter. Notably, the consensus mark was revised downward in the last seven days.Let's see how things are shaping up prior to the upcoming earnings release.Dillard's consistent efforts to capitalize on growth opportunities in its brick-and-mortar stores and e-commerce business are encouraging. Additionally, its focus on increasing productivity, enhancing domestic operations and developing omni-channel platform is expected to strengthen the customer base.Further, the company is anticipated to benefit from enhancement of brand relations, focus on in-trend categories and store remodeling efforts. With regard to e-commerce, it has been undertaking strategies like enhancing merchandise assortments and effective inventory management to boost growth. All these initiatives are likely to aid the company's top- and bottom-line performance.Meanwhile, Dillard's comparable store sales (comps) growth as well as strength across its men's apparel and accessories, and juniors' and children's apparel categories is providing a boost to the top line. Also, this leading departmental store chain continues benefiting from its niche market position, offering a broad array of merchandise in its stores featuring products from both national and exclusive brands.However, Dillard's soft cash flows have resulted in lesser share buybacks. This, in turn, affected the company's profitability in the last reported quarter. Apparently, the company incurred loss of 10 cents per share. Dillard's used net cash of $15.4 million in operations and reported soft free cash flows in the fiscal second quarter. It bought back only 39,400 shares for $3.1 million, under the $500-million repurchase program. Moreover, persistence of the challenging trends in the retail apparel space due to changing customer preferences remains a threat to the company's profitability.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues stands at $1,459 million, implying a decrease 0.4% from the prior-year quarter's actual figure.Year to date, shares of Dillard's have gained 21.9%, underperforming the  's 37.4% rally.Our proven model indicates that chances of Dillard's beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate are high as it has the right combination of the two key ingredients - a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) - for this to happen.

After all, headwinds ranging from the recent rise in benchmark bond yield, US-China trade tensions to uncertainty surrounding midterm elections have resulted in neck-snapping volatility this month.With markets experiencing a pullback, investing in stocks that provide brilliant risk-adjusted returns seems well thought-out.October is living up to its notorious reputation of being a volatile month for the equity market. Last week's rebound is surely a dead cat bounce - a period of temporary recovery from a prolonged decline. The S&P 500 has declined around 5% so far this month, with the broader index trading below its 200-day moving average as stocks continue to struggle. Needless to say market analysts consider moving averages as a dividing line of bullish and bearish momentum of an asset.Chief market technician at MKM Partners, JC O'Hara added that ""while the S&P 500 index is just minus 5.5% off the Sept. 20 high, the average S&P 500 stocks is off minus 17% from its 52-week high, and this shows just how much selling has already occurred."" At the same time, market volatility continues to remain elevated, with the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) near the 20 mark. Market pundits view VIX below 12 as low and near 20 as high.Minutes from the Federal Reserve's September meeting confirmed that the central bank is most likely to continue hiking benchmark lending rates at a gradual pace this year and beyond, which sent bond yields rising. This, in turn, rattled the equity market. After all, rapidly rising bond yields will result in steeper borrowing costs, which in turn will squeeze the profit margins of U.S. corporates.Fed officials confirmed that a promising economic outlook backed their decision to raise rates. The labor market is in excellent shape, with unemployment rate at a 49-year low, while the economy is widely expected to grow around 3% in the final two quarters of the year.Strained relationship between the United States and China has also spooked investors. U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese products applied last month at a rate of 10% are expected to increase to 25% by the end of this year. Tariffs are widely expected to have an adverse effect on corporate profits, with about 30 companies already mentioning its negative impact during  so far, per Bank of America's Savita Subramanian.At the same time, killing of a Saudi journalist, Italian budget fears and Trump's unpredictable actions ahead of midterm elections are not going down well with investors. Talking about elections, investors should brace for more volatility. In the last 11 midterm election years since 1974, the S&P 500 traded flat only to rally once political uncertainty waned, per The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.  . In fact, in those years, stock market volatility averaged 15% compared with the median of 12% in all years.Given the near-term bearishness, investors should build a strategy on low-risk assets and a combination of parameters that leads to better returns. The best way to go about doing this is by creating a portfolio of low-beta stocks, which are inherently less volatile than the markets they trade in. In this case, a low beta ranges from 0 to 1.These stocks are also dividend payers. Dividend paying stocks boast immense financial strength and are immune to market vagaries. Such stocks reflect solid financial structure, healthy underlying fundamentals and better quality business.We have, thus, selected five such stocks that flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). operates as a general merchandise retailer in the United States.

"n this series, we look through the most recent  report, and then we cherry pick only those companies that have experienced insider buying within the past six months. The officers and directors of a company tend to have a unique insider's view of the business, and presumably the only reason an insider would choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money - maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both. So when stocks turn up that see insider buying, and are also top ranked, investors are wise to take notice. One such company is Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST), which saw buying by CEO and President Daniel L. Florness.Back on October 12, Florness invested $103,900.00 into 2,000 shares of FAST, for a cost per share of $51.95. In trading on Thursday, shares were changing hands as low as $52.32 per share, which is 0.7% above Florness's purchase price. Fastenal Co. shares are currently trading +0.03% on the day. The chart below shows the one year performance of FAST shares, versus its 200 day moving average:Looking at the chart above, FAST's low point in its 52 week range is $45.96 per share, with $61.14 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $52.68. By comparison, below is a table showing the prices at which insider buying was recorded over the last six months:
  
The DividendRank report noted that among the coverage universe, FAST shares displayed both attractive valuation metrics and strong profitability metrics. The report also cited the strong quarterly dividend history at Fastenal Co., and favorable long-term multi-year growth rates in key fundamental data points.The report stated, ''  ''The annualized dividend paid by Fastenal Co. is $1.6/share, currently paid in quarterly installments, and its most recent dividend ex-date was on 10/23/2018. Below is a long-term dividend history chart for FAST, which the report stressed as being of key importance. Indeed, studying a company's past  can be of good help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Fastenal Named Top Dividend Stock With Insider Buying and 3.04% Yield (FAST)@2018-10-18@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/fastenal-named-top-dividend-stock-insider-buying-and-304-yield-fast-2018-10-18

ooking at the universe of stocks we cover at  , on 10/23/18, Adient plc (Symbol: ADNT), Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST), and Lowe's Companies Inc (Symbol: LOW) will all trade ex-dividend for their respective upcoming dividends. Adient plc will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.275 on 11/15/18, Fastenal Co. will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.40 on 11/21/18, and Lowe's Companies Inc will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.48 on 11/7/18. As a percentage of ADNT's recent stock price of $29.45, this dividend works out to approximately 0.93%, so look for shares of Adient plc to trade 0.93% lower - all else being equal - when ADNT shares open for trading on 10/23/18. Similarly, investors should look for FAST to open 0.76% lower in price and for LOW to open 0.48% lower, all else being equal.Below are dividend history charts for ADNT, FAST, and LOW, showing historical dividends prior to the most recent ones declared. : : :In general, dividends are not always predictable, following the ups and downs of company profits over time. Therefore, a good first due diligence step in forming an expectation of annual yield going forward, is looking at the history above, for a sense of stability over time. This can help in judging whether the most recent dividends from these companies are likely to continue. If they do continue, the current estimated yields on annualized basis would be 3.74% for Adient plc, 3.05% for Fastenal Co., and 1.92% for Lowe's Companies Inc.In Friday trading, Adient plc shares are currently off about 0.9%, Fastenal Co. shares are down about 0.1%, and Lowe's Companies Inc shares are up about 0.2% on the day.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Ex-Dividend Reminder: Adient, Fastenal and Lowe's Companies@2018-10-19@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ex-dividend-reminder-adient-fastenal-and-lowes-companies-2018-10-19
"omebuilder sentiment ticked up recently as buyers' demand overshadowed headwinds. A growing economy and record low unemployment rate boosted housing demand. At the same time, the cost of lumber is falling, which is enhancing builders' confidence.The broader construction industry, by the by, is also hiring on a large scale, reflecting the housing market's underlying strength.Builder confidence unexpectedly rose in October after gain was recorded for the first time in five months. Per the National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo (""NAHB""), the  went up one point to 68 in October. Any reading above 50 shows improvement.The index's three sub-gauges, current sales condition ticked up one point to 74, and expectations for sales over the next six months rose one point to 75. The gauge of buyer traffic witnessed the largest gain, up four points to 53.Builders are motivated by solid housing demand, fueled by a growing economy and one of the strongest job markets in decades. Currently the components of the Conference Board's Leading Economic Index indicate a 3% or more growth rate in GDP in the final two quarters of the year. Notably, the economy, has already expanded at a seasonally adjusted rate of 4.2% in the April-June quarter, per the Commerce Department. This marked the strongest rise since the 4.3% annual gain recorded in the third quarter of 2014. U.S. unemployment rate, in the meantime, fell to a 49-year low of 3.7% in September, the lowest since December 1969, per the Labor Department (read more:  ).Housing demand, in fact, is expected to improve further in the near term. After all, summertime underperformance due to concerns of a housing slowdown may now lead to a ""hope trade"", where investors will buy housing-related stocks in winter and early spring in anticipation of a bounce back in demand. Raymond James analyst Buck Horne added that on an average this phenomenon helped homebuilders to outdo the broader S&P 500 by 14% in the last 33 years.Builders are also relieved to see that  recently have tanked nearly 50% since reaching a record in May. Robert Dietz, NAHB's chief economist added that lumber prices continue to decline because supplies are rising, which has already increased 5% in the first four months of this year. Thus, these tailwinds are a blessing in disguise for homebuilders among rising home prices and borrowing costs.Another sign that the market for newly-built homes may be regaining steam is that a lot of hiring is taking place in the broader construction industry. This is a telltale sign that the housing market is in an expansion mode and definitely in a good shape.Per the Labor Department, employers have added 23,000 new construction jobs in September, while the industry has added 315,000 jobs over the past 12 months.Even pay and perks are also quite encouraging. Last month, average hourly earnings for construction workers were $30.18, more than $27.24 earned by all workers. Ken Simonson, the chief economist for the Associated General Contractors of America, a trade group reiterated that ""the construction industry added workers and increased pay in the past year at rates higher than the overall economy.""Given the aforesaid positives, investing in housing-related stocks that can make the most of the improved homebuilder sentiment seems judicious.

ncluding all of this morning's releases, we now have Q3 results from 69 S&P 500 members that combined account for 19% of the index's total market capitalization. Total earnings for these 69 companies are up +20% from the same period last year on +7.8% higher revenues, with 84.1% beating EPS estimates and 62.3% beating revenue estimates. The proportion of these 69 companies beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 55.1%.The comparison charts below put these results in a historical contextThe earnings and revenue growth pace thus far represents deceleration from what we had seen in the first half of the year, but the proportion of positive revenue surprises is tracking notably below other recent periods. In fact, the proportion of positive revenue surprises at this stage in the Q3 earnings season is the lowest since the first quarter of 2017.Another area of uncertainty is the impact of trade tensions on profitability and outlook, as we saw with the W.W.

Damon LamLook around, and you'll see that the stocks of companies whose businesses fluctuate with the economy are getting hit-hard. Housing stocks have gotten pummeled; automotive stocks have crashed; and the less said about basic industries, the better.Still, the S&P 500 is down just 6% from its all-time highs. Which makes us wonder: What exactly is working well enough these days to prevent a selloff from turning into a slaughter?Consider the case of Genuine Parts (). The distributor of aftermarket car parts as well as industrial power transmission products reported third-quarter-earnings Thursday morning, and easily beat analyst estimates. Genuine Parts also reported sequentially higher same-store sales growth in both of its divisions. Surely this should provide some relief? Nope. Genuine Parts rose 6%, but automotive stocks dropped 1.5% and industrial stocks tumbled 1.7%.Shrugging off even good news has been the market's response to earnings from all kinds of industrial companies. And investors have also been dumping materials and mining, which were also down Thursday. And don't forget materials are already down about 11% year to date, mining is down about 10%, and industrials are down 4%.So what's wrong? Trade fears continue to weigh on sentiment and are manifesting themselves in two ways. The first is by rising costs of both components-as cited by Dover () when it released earnings Thursday-and raw materials, as called out by Sonoco Products () when it released its own. Rising prices have been a common refrain for industrial companies on third-quarter earnings calls.Higher costs generally translate into lower margins, and it cannot be understated how important margin expansion has been to the performance of cyclical stocks, which have seen theirs grow from 9% to 13% over the course of this nine-year economic expansion. Now margins are starting to contract, and that's been responsible for big drops in the stocks of companies like Fastenal (), though Dover and Sonoco both rose after demonstrating rising costs wouldn't stand in the way of earnings growth by raising their guidance.But there's a second, perhaps greater issue: Those higher costs are causing demand to suffer. Management at sea and airfreight provider Kuehne + Nagel International (KNIN.Switzerland) said they have seen a slowdown in trans-Pacific Asian exports. That could be a blip, but given today's environment, it contributes to a narrative of slowing global growth.Whether the industrial slowdown is trade-related or just a function of the economic cycle is still up for debate. Regardless of the cause, we know that global manufacturing activity peaked in January, and that industrial purchasing managers' indexes are decelerating. More troubling: China's manufacturing PMI is back at 50, a level that implies no growth.The Chinese PMI number leads us to the final reason for sluggish cyclical stock performance-China itself. Cyclical stocks just can't be right if China isn't right. Remember China is the largest car market in the world, accounts for about a fifth of Caterpillar's () sales, and consumes about half of the world's copper annually, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. To make matters worse, the Shanghai Composite is down 25% year to date, and those numbers are seeping into industrial-stock sentiment.Which brings us back to our original question: Why isn't the market down even more? Thank the consumer. While manufacturing PMIs have fallen, the global-services PMI is near its highs and the Institute for Supply Management's U.S. nonmanufacturing PMI hit a new high in September. Consumer confidence in the U.S. remains near an 18-year high.Service stocks haven't started reporting results in earnest yet. About two-thirds of the reports out of the S&P 500 have been from cyclical and financial companies. That will change next week, however, when companies like Alphabet (GOOGL), Wynn Resorts (WYNN), McDonald's (MCD), and Visa (V) report, and the reports will continue into November as Tiffany (TIF), Starbucks (SBUX), and Marriott International (MAR) release their results.Hopefully, service results will buoy the market, but we see a bumpy ride for cyclical sectors the rest of this year, or at least until some of these fears get resolved.

"The market appears to have moved past last week's interest rate worries, with positive Q3 earnings releases generally getting credited with helping reassuring market participants that fundamentals still remain rock solid. There is plenty of truth in this narrative, with earnings and revenue growth still very strong even though they have started decelerating. The chart below shows the one-day stock-price reaction to the earnings release, aggregated to the sector level.This is still relatively early in the reporting cycle (the sample size is comprised of the 51 index members that have reported already), as no companies from the top 6 sectors in the above chart have reported Q3 results yet. But the variance in market reaction to the results from different sectors is telling with Transportation on the positive side and Industrial Products on the negative. The Transportation positivity reflects strong results from the air carriers and railroads while the Industrial Products weakness is largely due to W.W. Grainger (GWW) and Fastenal (FAST) whose results show the difficulties of operating in the emerging international trade environment.The market has been modestly happy with the 41.3% of the Finance sector's market capitalization that have reported results, with total earnings for the sector up +20% from the same period last year on +5.3% higher revenues, with 86.7% beating EPS estimates and 60% beating revenue estimates.Relative to other recent periods, these Finance sector results compare favorably to what we have been seeing from the sector in other recent periods, other than revenue beats that appear to be on the weak side across the board.Combining the actual results from the 51 S&P 500 members that have reported with estimates for the still-to-come 449 companies, total Q3 earnings are expected to be up +19% from the same period last year on +7.2% higher revenues.The chart below shows the expected Q3 earnings growth pace for the index in the context where growth has been in recent quarters and what is expected to come in the following few quarters.As you can see, the growth picture remains very strong, even though it is expected to decelerate in the current and coming quarters. But this isn't news for the market, as consensus expectations have been reflecting this deceleration for quite some time.More significant than the growth deceleration will be developments on the revisions front, which had turned modestly negative ahead of the start of the Q3 earnings season. With the global economic growth pace expected to be a bit softer relative to what was expected earlier and the trade issue still largely unsettled, it is perhaps reasonable to expect estimates for 2019 to come down.Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

Higher market demand, coupled with growth in industrial vending business and existing Onsite locations are encouraging.

"The bulls did their best to bring the market back from the brink, but the follow-through on Monday's modest strength ultimately failed. The S&P 500 ended the day down 0.14%, resting right on a pivotal support line.The market might have fared better - even logged a winner - had it not been for  (NYSE:  ) and  (NYSE:  ). Ford fell 3.4% on Tuesday, though for no particular reason. Snapchat's parent Snap saw its stock slide 6.4% in response to  that the company is quickly running out of money."" Not even the 12.4% gain from  (NASDAQ:  ) was enough to carry the broad market higher for the day.None of those names merit any trading scrutiny as today's action gets going though. Instead, stock charts of  (NYSE:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NYSE:  ) are your best bets. Here's why, and what to look for.Kinder Morgan should ring a bell. It was one of the names  , when KMI was toying with a breakout move above a major technical resistance level.That didn't happen right away, but with Tuesday's advance, the ceiling has been broken. That should make it much easier to resume the uptrend that's been materializing since April.Click to Enlarge  • The $18.37 level is the big line in the sand. It had kept a lid on buying efforts through last week, but couldn't keep the stock capped any longer.• This breakout thrust is also well-founded. A week ago it was pointed out that Kinder Morgan was pushing up and off the 100-day moving average line, plotted in gray. Just within the past few days though, the purple 50-day moving average line has acted as a springboard.• Notice that Tuesday's surge also took shape on strong volume. There should be plenty of buyers waiting in the wings to pour in now that a key resistance level has been smashed.Fastenal Company is another name that should ring a bell. We took a closer look at it  , fearful that a red-hot rally would end without warning as the stock bumped into a well-established resistance line.That's exactly how it happened. But, before FAST can continue sliding lower, it has to break below a couple of different potential support lines.Click to Enlarge • The ceiling in question was right around $61 … a line formed by connecting all the major peaks going back to early 2016. It's plotted as a white, dashed line on both stock charts.• The next-best support lines (and last bastions of hope) are the gray 100-day and white 200-day moving average lines, at $55.55 and $54.67, respectively. Neither has been particularly great support for Fastenal shares of late, but both have to be respected.• If those last two potential floors fail, a trip back to the lower edge of the long-term trading range marked on the weekly chart is a distinct possibility.Finally, back in mid-September we took a detailed look at shares of PG&E Corporation, noting they were getting close to breaking above a major technical ceiling.It didn't happen … at least not right away. And, even with the recent advance it's still not over the hump. It's once again close to clearing that hurdle, however, and this time it's starting the effort with an even better head of steam.Click to Enlarge • The technical ceiling in question was and still is $48.81, plotted with a yellow dashed line on both stock charts. PCG has tested that level several times, but has yet to clear it.• The proper underpinnings are in place, however. All the key moving average lines made bullish crossovers in August and September, suggesting this bullishness was building in multiple timeframes.• This budding strength may have more to do with a growing preference for safer havens like utility stocks than it has to do with PG&E itself. If that dynamic changes, that may be enough to quell the rally.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@3 Big Stock Charts for Wednesday: Kinder Morgan, PG&E and Fastenal Company@2018-10-10@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-big-stock-charts-for-wednesday%3A-kinder-morgan-pge-and-fastenal-company-2018-10-10
"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the Invesco S&P 500 BuyWrite ETF (Symbol: PBP), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $24.52 per unit.With PBP trading at a recent price near $21.64 per unit, that means that analysts see 13.29% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of PBP's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST), Cintas Corporation (Symbol: CTAS), and Everest Re Group Ltd (Symbol: RE). Although FAST has traded at a recent price of $51.67/share, the average analyst target is 15.40% higher at $59.62/share. Similarly, CTAS has 15.21% upside from the recent share price of $187.13 if the average analyst target price of $215.60/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting RE to reach a target price of $249.86/share, which is 14.76% above the recent price of $217.73. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of FAST, CTAS, and RE:Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
  
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@PBP's Underlying Holdings Could Mean 13% Gain Potential@2018-10-11@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/pbps-underlying-holdings-could-mean-13-gain-potential-2018-10-11

egendary investor Warren Buffett advises to be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful. One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100.

Good morning everybody, and thank you for joining the third quarter  for Fastenal Company.I'll start the discussion with (inaudible), just recap a few things going on in our business and to add some transparency to some things that are going on in the business. Had a call early this morning with our regional leadership and our -- around the planet. Holden ran through a bunch of the financial aspects and discussed the release in general, talked about some of the points that we will be focusing on in the  today, to have that group be really well-informed of what's happening in the business. And that's something we do every quarter.I started my comments with a simple message to the group. September was a big month. Coming into the month, we had an aggressive goal. And January caused us to just miss our internal sales goal, earlier in the year. Since then we've been in excess of goal every month, very similar to what we experienced in 2017 from the standpoint of good solid top line growth, hitting our internal goals, which gives us the confidence to invest in the business. Year-to-date, we're at 100.7% of goal. When I looked at the numbers on last Saturday, a week ago Saturday, we were at 99.9%, not all the numbers are in yet. So I thought, OK, we have a good shot of hitting goal. We came in at 100% of goal in September. Proud of what we accomplished as an organization from the standpoint of establishing a goal and going out and getting it.In the last two days, we had our typical Board meetings, and the evening before our Board meeting is typically a session where we introduce a topic that we delve deeper into. In past quarters, we've talked about some of the acquisitions we've done, we've talked about some business development opportunities, we'll talk specifically about our Onsite business, our vending business, our e-commerce business, our construction business, just to share additional insight for our Board of Directors, for their own knowledge and engagement as a Director of Organization, but also to solicit input from a very talented group.Our meeting on Monday evening, I typically don't cover that session, I covered that session and talked a bit about the Company, and I just want to share some of the things we talked about. As we did at last year's annual meeting, we talk about Fastenal, what we looked like when we were a $2 billion Company, which was roughly 11 years ago, in 2007.We talked a bit at that time about what we'll look like as a $4 billion Company. And this year, as we prepare for our internal discussions in December and our annual meeting next year, we will get to talk about Fastenal as a $5 billion Company, and we'll talk about how we've morphed, how we've evolved over the last 10, 11 years.We also had a pretty lengthy discussion about what we'll look like when we are a $10 billion Company. And we focused on four aspects of the business. One was the products we sell. If you look at it, fasteners, and now, safety products, combined make up roughly half of our business. Fasteners made up half our business a decade ago, but as the other businesses have grown, especially safety has grown, it's morphed a little bit.We talked about our selling channels, our branch, our Onsite integrated supply, a relatively small business that's kind of tucked away into the Onsite business. And our channel extender in everything that we do, a little thing called vending and bin stocks. We talked about the definition of our customer, who it was 10 years ago, who it is today, who do we believe it's going to be 10 years -- when we're a $10 billion Company. And there we talked about the manufacturing customer, little bit of some of the subsets; the construction customer, a government customer and all the others.We talked at length about the request mode, and what I mean by that is how that's changed over time, in how our customers are ordering. A big swathe -- our request mode is vending, where the customer doesn't request it. Our supply chain delivers it to them at point of use, at time of use and it's a -- we measure our fulfillment in the context of minutes, not hours, not days, but minutes. In our branch network, we measure in the context of minutes and hours. In our distribution network, we measure it in the context of eight hours away, but impressive supply chain in how -- customers ordering patterns and how that's morphing can play really into the strengths of Fastenal.Four things I highlighted just for additional discussion. Some that were tangential to this discussion was our branch economics. We started talking about what we call pathway to profit, 10, 12 years ago. Pathway to profit is still alive and well within Fastenal when I think of our branch network, and understanding how that branch network funds our ability to migrate the business into a more Onsite world.The continuing traction we're seeing in the e-commerce -- Web, I mentioned to the Board that night. I said, last quarter was kind of fun to casually mention on the call that we now have a $100 million Web business within Fastenal. That's ignoring EDI, that's ignoring the electronic orders that are coming in from vending. That's just looking at where people hop on the Web and we've rebranded that mostly to what we call Fastenal Express, but it's a $100 million business within Fastenal, growing handsomely. To that extent, three months later, I can look at that and say that $100 million business is now $110 million business, you can do the math on what that means as far as growth, but it's seeing substantial growth.And interestingly enough, we're seeing the growth, not just in our branch network, we're actually seeing faster growth in our Onsite network, it's a more efficient way of ordering. So not only does it help us grow faster, it helps us be more efficient. And a critical part of our success as we morph from a $5 billion to a $10 billion Company, is managing the operating expense within the organization. And you've seen some of that shine through as we go quarter-to-quarter.We did a bit of a recap on how we communicate and learn internally. How we define the message and our focus and how our emphasis is always on what is special about Fastenal, and how does that something special benefit our customer. And let's make investments to grow there and differentiate ourselves in the market, be something special for the customer. We also touched on people development and some leader development aspects we have in place for 2018 and how that's changing us going into 2019.That transitioned from Monday night into Tuesday, and we had a pretty lengthy discussion on tariffs and inflation in general. We started that discussion to make sure everybody's on the same page, is awareness to what we're talking about, because there's lot of terms that get thrown around in the media, there's is lot of terms that get thrown around in the press in general, lot of terms that get thrown around in our organization. Since they emanate from a government source terminology, you know darn well, they're never going to be intuitive.So we walked through and tried to make some intuitiveness to it. We talked at length about the 232 steel tariffs. It took place early in the year, a 25% tariff that frankly had limited impact -- direct impact on Fastenal, but does create a step-up in the introduction of inflation in the marketplace. We talked about the 232 auto tariffs, a minimal impact, first off, they've been implemented; but secondly, even when they are, the focus for us is really understanding what that means to demand aspects of the North American marketplace.We also operate a pretty sizable fleet, we have about 6,500 Dodge Ram pickups parked in front of our branches, delivering product and making sales calls every day. We have a distribution infrastructure, about 500 vehicles between semis and straight trucks, supporting our customers every day, and anything that impacts that category of our cost pool, we would be mindful of.We talked at length about Section 301, because here's where it starts to change. Back in July, for lack of a better definition, our folks described it as List 1, I'm not sure if that's an official name, it's just our name, but List 1 came out in July and it involved about $34 billion in North American spend going into China; 25% tariff on that. As we've talked about in previous discussions, that's pretty limited for us. There were some impacts. Again, it's about the element of inflation it's introducing into the economy.On August 23, a second list, list number two, came out that impacted about $16 billion worth of imports, again there was a 25% tariff. While there were some impacts to Fastenal, it was relatively limited in how it played out in our business. List 3 was announced on September 17, became effective September 24, so starting a number of weeks ago. It's directly impacting the North American supply chain for our customers.We are an important component of that North American supply chain for our customers in the marketplace in general. Therefore, it has an impact on our business. If I -- an added piece to that is that meaningful impact that kicked in place a number of weeks ago, is scheduled to go from 10% to 25% on January 1. Only time will tell what actually happens. It wasn't too long ago, it looked like NAFTA could easily fall apart into sort of a trilateral relationship, couple of bilateral relationships, till eleventh hour calmer heads prevailed.And while everything isn't a done deal yet, it appears that the differences that existed between the respective governments, respective countries have been largely resolved, and time will tell if the two sides of the Pacific Ocean will have a similar coming of the minds and anybody's guess on this call is good as, if not better, than mine on how that will play out.Our commitment is to our customer and our employee. Every day we balance this commitment with four overriding aspects of our covenant with our customer. One is a reliable supply to support their business, whether that is OEM fasteners, MRO fasteners, MRO non-fasteners, product going through our branch, our Onsite, our vending, it doesn't matter. A reliable supply that consists of quantity and quality. One of the challenges with redirecting your supply chain or making changes to your supply chain, you can interrupt both of those and it impedes the ability to move quickly.The second is value. We're all about total cost of ownership for our customer. That means time that means price. We are managing through this. The third is ideas, solutions and alternatives. One aspect of our approach with our customer is suggesting alternatives to their supply chain, to minimize the impact. Again, that's our covenant with our customer.Finally, the health of our supply chain; that dictates everyday where we push and how hard we push on our supplier base, because ultimately supplier that is not able to invest in their business is not a great long-term supplier in our supply chain.Our steps started three to four months ago, an active resourcing effort. The reality of it is, and this isn't unique to Fastenal's business, this is true of the North American supply chain. A lot of categories are directly impacted by the Section 301 and they're meaningful spend, if I look at the business in North America. Some categories of ours that really jump out, that have big impacts; power transmission, electronics and battery, plumbing, machinery, welding, paint -- paint supplies, material handling. These are items that actually have a really big impact. For us they are a relatively small part of our business. So that's more of an issue for a supply chain that's going through other sources, generally speaking, than Fastenal, because they're all as a percentage of our business single digits.Number 11 on my list here of categories that are impacted, that thing that's near and dear to our hearts, called fasteners. It's a meaningful impact for that group and that group is a big percentage of our spend. And as we've talked in the past, a large part of the North American supply chain and Fastenal supply chain comes through sources outside the United States, and -- or our sources outside North America, excuse me. And a big -- a high percentage of that source, and this data is publicly available, where we import from, a good piece of that is coming from China and that's true in our business as well.If I go a little deeper down the list, I see safety products, another one that's a meaningful component of our business, because of our vending platform. One of the things that we have to help manage through it better than in the past is we have a great national account team and a great Onsite team, a great implementation team, a great engineering team and a great supply chain support infrastructure for that piece of our business. Those discussions have been going on in earnest. They continue to go on in earnest and we are shedding light to the supply chain of those customers and having discussions about prices and options.Another piece is, and we talked about this, not in great detail, in the July call, but we talked about it with meaningful detail in the April call, about on our local pricing. Our tools for managing that weren't as sophisticated, and frankly, a lot of the tools we had for managing that disappeared in -- over the last three, four, five years as we were plugging up back doors to our point-of-sale system with changing prices, in an effort to improve our security.In July, we rolled out a new means to manage local contract pricing or local pricing. Holden mentioned in our release that we got some improvement in our price cost inflation during the third quarter and we kept pace with the third quarter. That is a true and accurate statement for the third quarter. One point I'd make is, we started this in July and really got traction in August. While in the third quarter we kept pace with the current inflation and we didn't get back any of the inflation we lost in the first two quarters of the year, in the month of September, if I look at our local pricing, we did achieve a very good claw-back into that first and second quarter. And so we exit the quarter at a much better position than we entered the quarter or in what the quarter experienced and that's a positive from our business, from our standpoint, to be an efficient supply chain to manage that inflation dynamics in the marketplace and to manage the relative gross margin of each component of our business. But it was really shining through in September, not in July, or August and September.With that I'm going to switch over to the flip book and then I'll transition over to Holden. If I look at the quarter, a very good quarter. 13% sales growth in the third quarter of 2018. It's our sixth straight quarter of sales growth greater than 10%. Excellent leverage in the business. As we've talked about in the past, our big challenge as we were -- as our growth was expanding was the incentive compensation component of our cost pool, at the branch, at the district, at the region, at the distribution center, and the support functions throughout the organization, as our growth came back in 2017 and 2018 and our earnings growth improved. We reloaded up on the incentive comp and we saw meaningful inflation, because the incentive comp was expanding, a very typical thing I would expect to see in the Fastenal business. We've anniversaried that now and you see it shining through in our ability to get operating leverage at the operating expense line.The earnings per share grew 38.3%, obviously aided by tax reform. Absent this, on 13% sales growth, we grew our earnings 15%. That's the fastest rate so far in the cycle. We're very pleased with that and we're proud of what our teams did. As -- Holden's point here, incremental pricing was realized in the third quarter, largely offset incremental cost increases in the period. We exited the quarter in a much different place.Flipping over to page two, we signed 88 Onsites in the third quarter. We've talked in the past about participation and the importance of participation in our business. Last year, through nine months of the year, 64% of our district managers had signed an Onsite. We hang out for our district managers, if we can get to 80% participation on anything we do, we will be successful. Our goal is to hit 80% for the year. Through nine months of 2018 that 64% has grown to 72%. Onsite is part of Fastenal. It's not a subset within Fastenal, it's part of our business now. And you're seeing it shine through in the numbers. We've signed 269 Onsites year-to-date, last year we signed 270 for the year.Switching to vending, also part of our business now, like Onsite. We signed 5,877 vending devices in the quarter. There's 63 days in the quarter, we're signing 93 devices per day, not too far from hitting 100 devices signed each and every business day of the year. Our revenue in that is growing well, our installed base is growing well. And we feel very good about -- in both of those, Onsite is probably going to be at the lower end of that range based on our run rate, and well into the range in case of vending signings. We are taking market share here and there is something special about Fastenal that our competitors cannot bring to the marketplace in the same way we can.Total in-market locations, 3,089. If you look at it, we're up 116 year-over-year, it's about 4% increase. Branches are down 157, which is about a 6.5% decrease. But Onsites are up 273, almost a 50% increase. Lot of numbers flying around here. What it means is, as our business is morphing, our need for people is always important, because we are a service organization, and that's what we represent for our customer, but it allows us to manage the business a little bit more efficiently from a headcount perspective and you're seeing that shine through in our numbers.National accounts grew 18% in the quarter, impressive team, both the sales team, the implementation team, as well as our service teams in our branches in Onsite. Non-US daily sales, which are about 15% of our business, grew 20% in the quarter, despite some pretty extensive foreign exchange headwinds and that shined through in our gross margin a bit as well.With that I'm going to turn it over to Holden. -- Great. Thanks, Dan. Flipping over to slide 5. As covered, total and daily sales were up 13% in the third quarter, which is consistent with the growth of the first half. This runs our monthly streak of 10%-plus growth to 16 months, but perhaps is as notable to say that adjusting for acquisitions and foreign exchange, our August and September daily sales rate actually hit 14%. What that means is that nearly one and (ph) three quarters into the current year's -- into the current expansionary cycle, we're still posting new highs for organic growth. We also estimate that pricing contributed between 120 basis points and 170 basis points in the period, an increase from the first half when we did 50 basis points to 100 basis points.In addition to contribution from our growth drivers, as Dan discussed, this growth is supported by healthy macro conditions. The PMI averaged 59.7 in the third quarter and industrial production continues to expand at a low to mid-single digit rate. From a market standpoint, non-residential construction grew 16.2% and manufacturing grew 13%, in both cases, consistent with the prior quarter's growth. From a product standpoint, fasteners were up 10.8% and non-fasteners were up 14.9%. Again, in both cases, in line with the second quarter levels.Lastly, from a customer standpoint, national accounts were up 18% in the quarter with 79 of our top 100 accounts growing and non-national accounts grew mid-to-high single digits with nearly 67% of our branches growing. In terms of market tone, sentiment in the field remains constructive and we would characterize conditions being stable at high levels.Now sliding over to slide 6. Our gross margin was 48.1% in the third quarter, down 100 basis points from the third quarter last year. This was a larger decline than we expected, especially as the improved price realization largely neutralized incremental product cost increases we continued to experience in the quarter. Roughly 80 basis points of this decline was from product and customer mix, higher branch freight expenses and higher growth allowances that are attributable to the sustained strong growth we are experiencing with our largest customers. The remainder is a function of foreign exchange and other organizational factors. Sequentially, we believe the lion's share of our 60 basis points decline is due to seasonality, foreign exchange and branch freight costs.As it relates to the outlook for price costs, we think that being able to neutralize the impact of inflation in the third quarter speaks to our rebuilding of pricing muscle memory in the organization and the effectiveness of the tools we've introduced. These would be helpful as the situation with tariffs play out. Still, the latter likely means we've not seen the end of product cost increases and until greater clarity comes to the market, it's difficult to know how price cost will play out in the upcoming quarters.Our operating margin was 20.5% in the third quarter, up 30 basis points year-over-year. Strong volumes drove 130 basis points of cost leverage and generated an incremental margin of 23.1%. Looking at the pieces, we'd see 50 basis points of leverage over employee-related costs, growth in incentive compensation outpaced sales and profits, but it did moderate versus where we were last year. Occupancy-related costs were up 2.3%, generating 50 basis points of leverage. Lower branch costs were offset by higher cost related to non-branch facilities, with the increase deriving from higher vending expenses to support the growth in our installed base. We realized an additional 40 basis points of leverage from general corporate expenses.Putting it all together, the third quarter of 2018 EPS were $0.69. Now, excluding a discrete tax item, this would have been $0.68, or up 37% from the third quarter of 2017. In the absence of tax reform and the lower rate that it provides to us, EPS would have been $0.57 and growth would have been 15%. We continue to anticipate a tax rate of 24.5% to 25%, absent refinements in the application of, or discrete events arising from the recent tax reform.Flipping to page 7. We generated $185 million in operating cash in the third quarter, which is 93% of net income. This is a lower conversion rate than we might typically see in third quarters, which relates to working capital and I'll cover that in a moment. Net capital spending in the third quarter was $35 million, bringing our year-to-date outlays to $89 million, an increase of 16% over the first nine months of 2017. The timing of outlays is such that we do expect higher spending in the fourth quarter for expansions and upgrades at our properties, as well as IT assets than we have seen in any of the first three quarters of 2018. However, given the rate of spending to this point in the year, we are reducing 2018 capital spending projection to $152 million from our previous $158 million. We increased funds paid out in dividends to shareholders by 25% to $115 million and we finished the quarter with debt at 14.4% of total capital, below last year and last quarter and at levels that provide ample liquidity to take advantage of opportunities to invest in our business.The picture of our working capital grew more challenging in the third quarter. Inventories were up 14.1% in the period, representing the first quarter where growth in inventory has outpaced growth in sales since the fourth quarter of 2016. And that's largely due to inflation beginning to ripple through our balance sheet.Receivables grew 22.2% in the third quarter. This continued to be affected by growth in our national accounts and international businesses, both of which tend to have longer terms than our business as a whole, but the biggest factor continues to be customers pushing payments past quarter-end, a trend that we have seen since the fourth quarter of 2017. After that moderated last quarter, it intensified again in the third quarter, but (inaudible) we have not seen any meaningful change in hard to collect balances, the quality of our receivables remains solid.That's all for our formal presentation. And with that operator, we'll move to questions.(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Ryan Cieslak with Northcoast Research. Your Line is open. -- Hey, good morning guys. -- Good morning. -- Yes, I guess the first question, just wanted to go back to the gross margin comments, weaker than expected versus our model. It seemed like maybe below what you guys were expecting as well. Holden, maybe sequentially it sounds like the freight component once again it creeped up and was a big factor there. Can you just discuss, what changed this quarter versus last quarter and do you view this more as transitory, or how do we think about freight costs, certainly for the balance of the year, but even as we get into next year? -- Yes. I think that cost continues to go up from a freight standpoint and I think we've talked about how we did a nice job offsetting some of those issues in the second quarter. We talked a little bit about moving more product onto our own trucks, doing a better job sort of finding means of generating additional revenue and we still worked through that in Q3. But pricing is still a challenge, and I would say that that is a part of the equation still. Now, the impacts from freight was more meaningful on a year-over-year basis than it was on a sequential basis, make no mistake, right. But the -- I think if you look from a sequential standpoint, I think that you're looking at -- seasonality played a role. I think foreign exchange certainly played a role. And then you do get into some drag from branch freight and some of the customer allowances, but they are relatively smaller. So I think that the impact on -- from freight was more annual than it was sequential. -- Sequential, one thing we're seeing, and this has been our mantra all year is, fuel prices are what they are, whether that is diesel going into our semi fleet or gasoline going into our pickup fleet. The real mantra is charge freight where it's appropriate, and we've seen a pretty consistent level of that. And use our trucks. The challenge to our branch employees, our Onsite employees, use our trucks -- a challenge to our supply chain, use our trucks, because it's a lower cost, and we've seen some success in that as we've gone through the year. -- Okay. So it doesn't sound like there is anything unusual or one-time in nature as it relates to freight here in the quarter. So I know you guys aren't -- big on giving your quarterly guidance on gross margins, but directionally, is the 48.1% that you put up a good starting point and should we be thinking about just normal sequential progression into the fourth quarter, or is there something that we should be thinking about where you see it maybe playing out better than that going into the fourth quarter? -- Yes, as it relates to the freight side of it, no, I don't think there's anything unusual there. And honestly, I have to say it's been fairly impressive, the degree to which the field has been able to move some product off of third-parties onto our own fleet and other things of that nature. As Dan said, fuel was a big issue. So as it relates to branch -- to branch freight, or freight generally, I don't think there's anything unusual there.As it relates to gross margin more broadly, yes, I think thinking about typical seasonality is not unreasonable here. There are certainly some comp give and takes as we move into Q4, freight being one of those. It was in Q4 last year that we began to see a lot of these costs really beginning to move up. So I mean that's one where there might be some easier comps, but there are some other items in there that might be less favorable comps. So I think if you think about the gives or takes, I feel like you should probably think about the seasonality. And the one perhaps caution I'll give there is, seasonality is usually maybe 20 basis points to 40 basis points lower in fourth quarter than third quarter. It also tends to be a much more volatile quarter than is typical, in terms of where that comes through. I think that we can find some gives and takes that move us to the high end of that and that's what we're going to strive to do, but I don't think it's unreasonable to think in terms of normal seasonality at this point. -- I'll chime in with a couple positives when I think about going into the fourth quarter. We exited the quarter in a better position than we entered the quarter from the standpoint of our pricing in general, because of things we've put in place in July and August. Point number one. Point number two, one of our hard presses on our folks as it relates to all the noise, (inaudible) right now is be engaged with your customer from the standpoint of product substitution. That tends, historically, to help us from a gross margin perspective. And so, when I look at that, there's some built in enlist to it, but we'll continue to have the impact that we've seen in the mix of our business, that's not a new thing.The last piece is, one component of our gross margin centers on the volume allowances that either go to customers or come from suppliers. When I look at that, some years you will have a bias toward what direction one or the other might go, depending on the relative strength of that, of our overall growth for the year, because a lot of those programs are calendar based. As we've been seeing as we've gone through the year, the customer side, strong growth in national accounts, so there's a piece there, but nothing new as far as any kind of change sequentially. If I look at it on the supplier side, so now you can get an uptick or a downtick in the fourth quarter depending on where the programs come out. With our strong growth this year, the bias is toward up, not down. So I would look at that and say on the ledger there's more things that are ignoring seasonality, more things that are biased up versus down. -- Okay, that's helpful. And then just for my follow-up. Last quarter you guys gave sort of an initial estimate on what you think the direct exposure was to China from a sourcing standpoint as a percentage of your COGS. Any update there, certainly as you've gotten through, there's some additional list has come out, I'm sure you guys have done some additional work around that. And then just how do we think about, maybe just directionally going into next year, I know you guys have always talked about mix always being a net negative to your gross margins. Should we think about the tariff situation also being a net negative to your gross margins next year, or is it too early to tell at this point? Thanks. -- I think on that, there is a number of things punched into that question. So as you unwind it from a tariff perspective, it's way too early to gauge, because we don't know what the next leg is going to be, is there going to be a next leg. We don't know if we are going to be sitting here in March and 10 is at 25 or 10 is at 10 or 10 is at zero, we don't know if it's on -- the SKU is (ph) on today, if it's on expanded list or a contracted list. So I don't think anybody can intelligently predict that today. I do know we have a really good plan for how we're approaching it. If I look at historically, we have talked about -- and I'm a big believer in transparency, I might be a little opaque here, because I don't want to put our field team in a bad position from the standpoint. If I sat down with 10 different customers, the percentage of what they're buying that's sourced in one country or another or in different parts of the world, in general, can vary dramatically depending on if it's a fastener. Fastener products have a very high content of imported products and a lot of that is coming out of China.So if you think about that third of our business, a big piece of that is sourced globally and most of that had moved outside of North America, heck, before we even started in business back in the late-1960s. And that 35%, it's a pretty big piece. On the non-fastener, it's also a quite large piece and this isn't just a comment about Fastenal, this is a comment about supply chains in general. So I would suspect most companies you'll find is that you're going to have over half of their revenue -- half of their business is sourced outside of North America, and a meaningful piece of that half comes out of China and you'd see the same. I don't want to get into specifics beyond that, because one customer it might impact there, what they're spending 10%, another customer it might be 30%. -- Well, Ryan, I think, yes, just to touch on last call. You're right, I mean I had indicated at that call that we were looking at basically -- roughly 10% of our product sourced from China, in that there was a chunk of that, it was just a guess, right, just a guess, because one-quarter of our total buys across the Company are bought by the field rather than corporately. And this local capability to buy is a big reason for our industry outgrowth, but it also reduces the visibility. And as you said, we've sharpened our pencils on this and we are trying not to be overly specific about it, but I think it is fair to say that our number is north of that 10% range that I had indicated earlier. So that is definitely a larger number that comes directly from China. -- In fairness to Holden, I felt he was answering a different question on that call, or I would have corrected him on the spot. I know he was talking about the -- the first rounds being a single-digit, a low percentage impact and I didn't realize the intent of this answer. -- Yes. And not all that 30% -- not all that that amount is going to be captured in the first -- in this first round. So we'll see what happens going forward.Thank you. Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie. Your line is open. -- Good morning. Thank you. My first question is -- -- Good morning. -- Morning. Just the first question is around working capital. It seems like it's a much bigger source of cash, the first three quarters this year than the last number of years. Clearly, some of that is inventory, but a lot of that is AR. So, maybe just walk us through, are customers just paying later or just walk us through sort of how you think about that piece, does that normalize or just any color that would be great. -- So I'll throw in a few pieces, because I've got a few years under my belt that Holden doesn't have yet. If you think about our business, our local -- if you go back years ago, our days of collect (ph) would have been better, because our business was primarily a local business. And if I look at our local business, which is roughly half our revenue, you would see that our stats for that business is largely unchanged from what it would have been 10, 15, 20 years ago. In the last 20 years, we've gone from 2%, 3% of our revenue being national account to 52% of our revenue being national account. And we've gone from international being two locations in Southern Ontario to 15% of our revenue. Two things I can tell you about national account customers and international customers in general. They'd pay slower than our local customers. And so they've been attributing to 70% of our growth between Onsites. A lot of things we do Onsites, vending etc., really go toward a larger key account in that local market, whether it's a national account or not, but a larger customer and oftentimes their ability to negotiate terms that are linked to growing the business occur. And so, there are some structural aspects to it. The offset to that is that they also drive volume through our branch network and over time allow us to continually drive down the days of inventory on hand, because we're leveraging it across a bigger revenue base. So it's finding that balance, but it creates some challenges in near-term. -- Great. And then just a follow-up question is sort of, how do you think about sort of headcount growth going forward? I realize your sales are growing a lot faster, but at the same time your business mix has shifted more to Onsite. So, is historically the relationship between sales growth and headcount growth different now that the model is changed or just any thoughts on how you think about that piece would be great. Thank you. -- Yes, Hamzah. So the -- it is -- I think it's fair to say, I believe that the source of our headcount growth has diversified over the past few years, right. There was a time when we were heavily branch oriented, where most of our headcount was going into the branches and we're adding branches and filling those out. As we have become as reliant on the Onsites and vending, national account growth, then a lot of the headcount that we add is coming outside of the branches, perhaps to a degree that was not true 10 years ago, let's say. And we should be able to build a fairly significant revenue base off of that headcount relative to what we've been able to achieve before. I think it's fair to say that in the past, we would have had to throw a lot of bodies and heads into growing the revenues. And today, I think that there is more leverage in the model for headcount growth than it has been the case in the past.That said, growing 13% does require investment in the business and that investment is in the form of headcount, both in the branches, as well as outside of the branches, and we began to see in August and September those numbers begin to tick up, and we would expect to continue to add branches to support our growth going forward. -- What I might add, if you look at the table in the press release, we talk about absolute employee headcount, and I'm talking about the in-market locations, and then the FTE employee headcount in-market locations. And you see that FTE growing a bit faster than the absolute. I have challenged our team to add a little bit more absolute, but to build to our recruiting pool. And the way we build staff in our branches, we aggressively go into four-year state colleges, two-year technical colleges and recruit and ask you to come work for us part-time while they're still in school. And those numbers need to be built a little bit. And -- but if you add 1% to that number, for example, it doesn't translate into 1% FTE, because it translates into about a half, and it's a less expensive FTE, and you don't do it for the cost, you do it for the recruiting pool of the future. And so, you will see that pick up a little bit, but will be very, I believe, efficient at managing the expense of that component. -- Okay. And then just lastly, I'll turn it over, just to make sure we're consistent with how you're thinking about tariffs. At this moment, you're sort of not quantifying how much of your business is directly sourced in China or you're sort of not quantifying how much of the business is sourced in China that is impacted by tariffs, because I realize those are two different numbers. -- There is a subset of SKUs that we do import from China that are impacted. That subset is much larger in some of those categories I touched about earlier. In fasteners, it's about -- it's 10 or 11 down the list as far as subcategories. And so it hasn't been fully impacted. If you look at it, and a lot of things that I've been looking at, the fact that it's about half of the imports coming in, that $500 billion (ph) are now tariffed, that's not too far off the mark of what we're seeing in our business too. -- Got it. Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Uhlman with Cleveland Research. Your line is open. -- Hi guys, good morning. -- Morning. -- Sticking with that theme, I guess, when you think about the strategy here in the medium term of -- your purchasing strategy, I guess, should we expect the Company to be pre-buying ahead of what potentially could be bigger price increases for those tariff-related products from China, or are you looking to resource items from other countries more aggressively and not pre-buy? I guess I'm just trying to think through the inventory cadence here through the next quarter or two? -- I'd say, yes to each and every one of those to a certain degree and no to another. And that is we started some months ago in earnest looking at where we're sourcing. But you also have to look at it from the standpoint of what's the alternative source. Is there capacity available. Is the quality the same, and what's the price point. We could move some stuff out of China to another source if you add 5%, 6%, 7% and that 10% is there for the next three years, it's a good decision. If you add -- if you do that and you add 15% or 20% or 30% of the cost, it's a really bad idea. It becomes a less bad idea if 10% goes to 25% and it sticks. So in an environment where there's political variability as opposed to economic variability, it makes it very challenging to plan, and the biggest thing is having a good open dialog with your customer, but also understanding for a lot of our customers what we spend is a relatively small part of their spend, or what we sell is a relatively small part of their spend. So it's creating the least amount of disruption to their supply chain, but we have redirected some already.As far as buying ahead, the problem with that is the -- predicting exactly what's going to be needed where. And for some items you can do it, but again, depending on what's going to happen, because supply chains, when we order stuff today it's not coming in next week or next month, it's coming in three, four months from now. So you have some limited ability to do that. But to the extent we can redirect some, absolutely we've been doing that. But Adam, just to sort of flesh out the question, the inventory I would not expect it to move meaningfully based on pre-bought volumes. Again, we've looked into it, there was tight capacity for products in a lot of places and we didn't have the ability to meaningfully ramp up the amount that we pre-purchased, based on what is pre-existing tight capacity. -- Okay, thanks for that. And then just related to that, I guess, historically, what do you think the lag has been for your national account customer price realization, relative to your cost inflation and the efforts that you put into place recently. It's good to see in September price cost is covering what you'd done earlier in the year. I guess, should we expect that there is any difference as we start to think about 2019 in terms of your ability to pass along those higher costs to those big customers that push back so hard? -- Well, it's always going to be an intimate discussion with every customer and some of it's a willingness to peer into the supply chain flexibility on sourced supply. OEM fasteners has a different dynamic to it than MRO fasteners, for example. But historically, the pricing we saw in September that's more on our local customer, where time frame is different and because it's so diffused that was challenging us earlier in the year, because we didn't have great tools to manage it. I think of our national account relationships, most of that is historically on a -- kind of a six-month window that we can move pricing, and obviously extreme -- certain commodities don't fall into that, if it's things like stainless which has much more variability, we've tightened that window up. In the case of something like this, where it's a political event, you do have the ability to accelerate that, as does our supply base, accelerate that window, because the stuff we're buying last summer or last fall that came in on September 20 doesn't have a tariff. If it came in four days later, it does. So it's not about when you ordered it, it's about when it crossed the border. And so, it's being very mindful of that. And sometimes -- and that can change the timing window. But historically it would have been about a six-month window. -- Okay, thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from Evelyne Chao (ph) with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. -- Hi , good morning, Dan and Holden. -- Good morning. -- So I guess first question I have for you is just kind of thinking about inflationary impact on your inventory. Is there any meaningful difference in your turns on the fastener versus non-fastener pieces of your portfolio? And then how do we start thinking about the impact of some of this inflation on your buy, noting that pre-buy has been challenging for you? -- The turns on the fasteners will be somewhat slower than the turns on the non-fasteners, simply because we source a much greater proportion of fasteners from overseas than we do non-fasteners. Not just from China, but from other countries as well. I don't think it would be unexpected to suggest that the vast majority of our fasteners spend is from outside the US and significantly in Asia. And so you're going to have a longer turn on fasteners than you will on non-fasteners. Our non-fasteners also carry more of a branded component to them. That lends itself to -- we're sourcing it domestically. Now it might have been manufactured offshore, but we are sourcing it domestically and therefore you have a tighter window too, as far as turns. -- Makes sense, yes. And then I guess maybe on a sort of related point to this, appreciate that it's challenging to quantify right now exactly what the impact to your COGS might be from List 3 in particular, but just thinking sort of, lot of your fastener buy is from outside the US, some proportion of your buy that's non-fasteners is also outside the US. Is there any thought as to maybe pulling back on how much the field is sort of permitted to dictate the buy and make that sort of more top-down in this challenging inflationary backdrop? -- I don't know if I'd phrase it as permitted to buy. I think ultimately our customer decides what supply channel is best for their business from the standpoint of their end customer, what they expect. You know we have domestic capabilities too, where from a distribution perspective, we have the largest -- when I look at our peers, we have the largest manufacturing of fasteners capability in our industry. And so we manufacture -- 35% of our revenue is fasteners. We manufacture about 5% of what we sell . So 5% of that 35%, we manufacture domestically, for the most part, but we have some operations in Europe and Asia as well. But most of our operations are domestic. And there is a customer base that wants that. The reality of it is, for fasteners and for non-fasteners, there's not capacity to handle it domestically, even if we wanted to move more domestically. The capacity doesn't exist, because the fastener capacity that's retained in this country, we're a meaningful piece of it, because of what we've done. But much of it has moved offshore, again, a lot of that back in the '50s, '60s and '70s.Yes, Evelyn (ph) you have to also remember that the ability of our folks in the field to make decisions about what their customers need is a real important piece to how we service the customer and how we achieve the kind of outgrowth that we do. Now we've obviously encouraged the field to, wherever possible, maybe to use exclusive brands as sort of a product substitution, look for product within our network as opposed to having to go outside of our network, because obviously where we have scale in purchasing, we can do -- we can address the issues of inflation more greatly, but I think it would be a mistake to take something which has served us so well culturally and in terms of growth over such a long period of time and begin to uproot those kinds of things. I think we're far better off taking the relationships that those local sales folks have, have those conversations, use the tools that have never been better, use the experience they have in sort of having these conversations, which again has never been better and continue to service the customer in that way. -- Understood. And then maybe if I can just sneak in one on Onsites. I think you noted that you're tracking a little closer to the lower end of the range for the year. I guess what are some of the drivers of that expectation and then do we still think about a 360 to 385 (ph) type run rate into next year? -- Well, I think the expectation is if we look at the first three quarters, we divide by three, multiply by four and it gets you to the math, right. How fourth quarter plays out, we'll see. It's entirely possible that we'll sign enough to be inside that range. And so it's really just math Evelyn (ph). I will say this, if we come in at the low end of the range, around the low end of the range that will be as -- that will be as an effective job that we've done in any year of actually hitting that range. And let's not lose sight of the fact that whether it's 360 or 355 or 365, that's up from 270 last year and represents significant sort of buy-in and execution on the part of the organization. So I would perhaps put that perspective. With respect to what our expectations are for next year, frankly, we haven't addressed that yet. I think we'll have more to say about that as we get into the fourth quarter, but we haven't set that range at this point. -- All right, thanks guys. -- Thank you. We'll take one last question and then we'll wrap up the call.Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. -- Hey, good morning. This is Bupinder (ph) sitting in for Nigel here. -- Good morning. -- I just wanted to go through the third quarter, pretty nice average daily sales growth here in the quarter, especially for September. And Holden, like you mentioned about the tariffs which became effective September 24. Just wanted to see if we can get some color, did you see any kind of pre-buy in the quarter before that deadline actually for the tariff went into effect? -- Are you talking about from a customer perspective or supply perspective? -- I mean if you can give color from a customer perspective, that'll be good too. -- I'll chime in on that. If you think of what we do, we provide real time supply chain for our customers. And that's our value. When the customer needs something they walk over and they push a button on a vending machine and they instantly have what they need, their safety glasses, a pair of gloves, etc. When they're producing something, they reach over and they grab in a bin and grab the fastener they need to assemble the item they are producing. If they're doing maintenance, they go to a bin and grab it. So the value we bring is the sourcing of product (inaudible) supply. There is no sourcing cost, it's available when I need it. So it doesn't really lend itself to pre-buying. So I would say there is no pre-buying in our numbers from the context of any of our revenue numbers in the third quarter or earlier in the year for that matter. -- And I've asked that question specifically of the RVPs every month in the last couple of quarters. And the feedback from them is very much the same. They have not seen any indication that our products are being pre-bought and stockpiled if you will ahead of these sorts of things. Now, I can't tell you that's not happening somewhere else in the supply chain, but as it relates to our products and our supply chain, it's not something that any of our RVPs or corporation is seeing. -- I'm going to close up the call with just two quick thoughts. In the last two quarters, I've touched on something that we've never touched on as a company and that is the traction we're seeing in the ease of ordering for our customer through what we call Fastenal Express or Web. I personally have been making a use of the system. And I've been probably wearing our team a little bit with things to make it easier, to make it more intuitive as a buy. And I was sharing with our Board the other day. I said, yes, a couple of weeks ago I bought a case of filters, I sent the order in and after two -- after three (ph) I got a reply, order is ready to pick up and I stepped over the rope to go and pick it up. Last night, as I was leaving, after 5 o'clock, I ordered a couple of rolls of Talon duct tape, that's our brand, (inaudible), as well as a fast on (ph) Jobber drill bit set. I ordered that late in the day. At 8:02 this morning, I had an email from Fastenal, my order is ready to pick up. That's measuring fulfillment of any type of order, whether it's a vending machine, a bin, an e-commerce order in minutes and hours, not in days, and that transaction is a more efficient transaction for us. And that freight is part of our normal shipping network. What we're finding is between 93% and 94% of the time our customers buy online, they're picking it up at the Onsite or at the branch. They want certainty of supply and they want great availability.Second item I'll touch on is, we recently had Hurricane Florence hit the Southeastern part of the United States. I'm thankful to say that Fastenal and our Fastenal employees and our customers came through it largely undamaged. I love hearing the stories from customers and employees alike about fellow Fastenal blue team members stepping into support them. We are hours away from Hurricane Michael hitting the Panhandle of Florida. I believe Panama City is dead in its sites. Our best wishes and thoughts and prayers are with our team and our customers and the folks in that area. Thanks everybody, have a good day.Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

ooking at the universe of stocks we cover at  , in trading on Wednesday, shares of Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST) were yielding above the 3% mark based on its quarterly dividend (annualized to $1.6), with the stock changing hands as low as $51.64 on the day. Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return. To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) back on 12/31/1999 - you would have paid $146.88 per share. Fast forward to 12/31/2012 and each share was worth $142.41 on that date, a decrease of $4.67/share over all those years. But now consider that you collected a whopping $25.98 per share in dividends over the same period, for a positive total return of 23.36%. Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.6%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 3% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable. Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST) is an S&P 500 company, giving it special status as one of the large-cap companies making up the S&P 500 Index.In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Fastenal Co., looking at the history chart for FAST below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 3% annual yield.

 is scheduled to report third-quarter 2018 results on Oct 10, before the opening bell.The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 12.1% in the last reported quarter. However, its earnings were in line with the consensus mark in three of the trailing four quarters, resulting in an average beat of 3.03%.Fastenal is expected to benefit from its core product offerings like Onsite Locations/vending machines/managed inventory. Meanwhile, continued construction tailwinds are also expected to act as a major growth catalyst. However, higher product and freight expenses, along with changes in product and customer mix raise concerns.Let's take a look at the factors that might affect the company's results in the third quarter. Over the past few quarters, Fastenal's sales have been driven by an increased installation of industrial vending machines. Sales through vending machines grew at or near a double-digit pace in each of the trailing four quarters of 2017. Then again, sales through vending devices continued to grow at a pace of more than 20% in the second quarter of 2018, primarily due to higher installed base. A consistent increase in the number of on-site locations is likely to strengthen Fastenal's market share and boost quarterly numbers. Sales growth through Onsite was 22% in 2017. As of Jun 30, 2018, the company had 761 active sites, up 56.6% year over year. The trend is expected to continue in the third quarter of 2018 as well. Fastenal aims to achieve 360-385 onsite signings in 2018, reflecting an increase from 270 signings in 2017. Robust construction market, especially the non-residential one, has been acting as a major tailwind for Fastenal's performance over the past few quarters. The trend is likely to be carried forward in the third quarter of 2018 as well.The company is expected to report impressive top- and bottom-line growth in the third quarter, courtesy of sustained strength in most of its end markets, as well as strong momentum in vending machine installations and onsite locations. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.27 billion, implying 12.3% year-over-year growth. We are apprehensive about Fastenal's changes in product and customer mix, which have been hurting the gross margin for quite some time now. Freight and product cost inflation also added to the woes. That said, Fastenal remains optimistic about its performance in the second half of the year, given improved pricing expectation as well as reasonable gross margin comparisons through the rest of 2018.Overall, the consensus estimate for earnings is pegged at 67 cents, reflecting an improvement of 34% on a year-over-year basis. | Fastenal does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients - a positive  and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher - to increase the odds of an earnings beat.

"Chicago, IL - October 8, 2018 - Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week's list includes JPMorgan  , Citigroup  , Delta Air  , Walgreens Boots  and Fastenal  .To see more earnings analysis, visit  .Every day, Zacks.com makes their Bull Stock of the Day available, free of charge.  .Finance sector earnings were up +21.5% in the June quarter and the expectation is that growth in the Q3 earnings season, which JPMorgan, Citigroup and others kick-off with their results on Friday, October 12 th , will likely be even better. But none of that shows up in the group's stock market performance, with bank stocks one of the weakest performers in the market.Bank stocks are down -0.8% this year, underperforming the broader market's +8.5% gain, but modestly better than the Finance sector's -3% decline. The group never got its mojo back after losing ground at the start of February, but continued to lead the S&P 500 through mid-March meaningfully diverging from the broader index around mid-May. The chart below shows the year-to-date performance comparison of the Zacks Major Banks industry and the S&P 500 index.A number of factors likely account for this underperformance. The most important reason appears to be the flattening yield curve, though it has been steepening a bit in recent days. The flattening yield curve has implications for banks' profitability, as banks' net interest margins represent similar spread between their lending and borrowing rates.The chart below shows the yield spread between 2 and 10-year treasury bonds over the past year (currently at 30 basis points, as of Wednesday, October 3 rd ).There is also the issue of deposit betas, the percentage of change in market interest rates that banks pass onto their depositors. Banks are typically fairly stingy with interest rates on their deposits, but competitive pressures force them to pass on the higher rates to their customers. As a result, deposit betas have been steadily going up, another negative for bank margins.Both of these are legitimate points, but worries about them appear to over-done to us. The yield spread has started expanding again. But even if this nascent steepening trend of recent days reverses, as has happened a number of times before, the spread is still most likely expected to remain positive. Similarly, even if deposit betas reach 100%, plenty of deposits are non-interest bearing. When you combine that some growth in loan portfolios and continued expense discipline, the group should have sustainable earnings growth in the high single-digits pace, beyond the current unsustainable tax-cut induced windfall.The contrast between revenue growth and earnings growth this year speaks to the direct impact of tax cuts on bank earnings. But the growth pace comes down to normal levels from next year onwards.Total Q3 earnings are expected to be up +17.8% from the same period last year on +7.1% higher revenues, with double-digit earnings growth for 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors.As pointed out earlier, estimates for the quarter came down.Please note that the negative revisions trend for Q3 is in contrast to the three preceding quarters when the revisions trend was a lot more favorable. A big part of the positive revisions over the last two quarters was due to the direct impact of the tax cuts. With that issue now behind us, the revisions trend appears to be moving back to how it has behaved over the last few years. That said, the magnitude of negative revisions to Q3 estimates is lower than the historical norm of the last few years.With the outlook for the global economy starting to weaken and companies starting to feel the pinch of cyclical cost inflation, this negative revisions trend will likely only accelerate going forward. There is also the issue of trade protectionism having a negative earnings impact. This hasn't shown up in estimates yet, but we can easily see the negative earnings impact of trade protectionism in terms of higher expenses resulting from supply-chain disruptions and competitive forces prompting companies to absorb the increased costs instead of passing them onto end consumers.In other words, while the negative revisions trend to Q3 estimates wasn't that bad, the pace and magnitude of negative revisions could accelerate going forward.Overall growth reached its highest level in almost 8 years in each of the last two quarters, with the growth pace starting to decelerate in the second half of the year and into next year.If we look at earnings growth for the S&P 500 index on a rolling 4-quarter basis, to smooth out the quarter-to-quarter variation, then the growth acceleration trend remains in place through Q4 2018 before starting to trend down next year.We don't get into the thick of the Q3 earnings season till the following week, but the reporting cycle has gotten underway already, with results from 21 S&P 500 members out and another 9 index members on deck to report this week. All of these early reporters have fiscal quarters ending in August, but they get counted as part of the September-quarter tally.Total earnings for these 21 index members are up +23.4% from the same period last year on +9.3% higher revenues, with 85.7% beating EPS estimates and 71.4% beating revenue estimates.It is still too small a sample of results to draw any firm conclusions from, but the results at this early stage are on the weaker side relative to other recent periods, as the comparison charts below show.We have 9 index members reporting Q3 results this week, including the aforementioned big banks. Delta Air, Walgreens Boots and Fastenal are some of the other companies reporting results this week.For more details about the overall earnings picture and the Q3 earnings season, please check our weekly  report.Zacks ""Profit from the Pros"" e-mail newsletter offers continuous coverage of the industries and the stocks poised to outperform the market.  .Zacks.com is a property of Zacks , Inc., which was formed in 1978.

"tocks fell slightly last week, the first trading week of the fourth quarter. But both the  (DJINDICES: ^DJI) and the wider  (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) remain near record territory, up about 7% so far this year: data by  .Earnings reports could drive extra volatility for shareholders of  (NASDAQ: FAST) ,  (NASDAQ: WBA) , and  (NYSE: WFC) over the next few trading days. Here are a few trends to watch for in these reports.Construction parts and services specialist Fastenal will announce its third-quarter results before the market opens on Wednesday. The stock jumped immediately following its last quarterly release, which paired a healthy  with steady bottom line profitability. Fastenal has been benefiting from strong demand in the manufacturing sector, and most investors are expecting those trends to keep revenue expanding at a low double-digit rate this quarter.Fastenal's profit performance will be a key focus in this week's report, given that gross margin dipped last quarter. We'll find out on Wednesday if the company was better able to pass along rising input costs and higher wage expenses. Investors should also get an update on management's cost cutting program that has protected operating profitability this year, despite pricing pressures that have hurt gross margin.Investors are cautious heading into Walgreens Boots Alliance's fourth-quarter report, due out on Thursday morning. Shares are trailing the broader market so far this year as Wall Street tries to  against risks of disrupting competition in the pharmacy industry.Image source: Getty Images.Walgreens' management team has placed itself firmly on the optimistic side of that equation, having recently announced an aggressive stock repurchase program whose results CEO Stefano Pessina said ""demonstrate our confidence in future business performance and...our focus on driving long-term shareholder value.""Pessina and his team said in late June that fiscal 2018 earnings should land between $5.90 per share and $6.05 per share. But investors will be more focused on Walgreens' outlook for the new fiscal year, and whether it implies a return to comparable-store sales growth at its pharmacy and retailing divisions.Several of the country's biggest financial giants will post earnings results on Friday, but investors are especially interested in Wells Fargo's business update. The banking giant issued mostly disappointing figures back in July, as revenue was pulled lower by a declining loan portfolio. Wells Fargo also took a large tax charge that pushed net income to $5.2 billion from $5.5 billion in the year-ago period.Investors will be looking for evidence that the bank has made progress putting recent scandals behind it, including the  that ultimately led to a management shake up. CEO Tim Sloan and his team are hoping to show progress at recovering from that, and more recent challenges, by returning its consumer loan portfolio to modest growth over the next few quarters.Meanwhile, investors should see evidence of aggressive stock repurchase spending in Friday's report, which Wells Fargo will continue now that the Federal Reserve has approved its plans for higher direct capital returns. That's good news for shareholders, but the stock isn't likely to reverse its recent weak performance compared to rivals until the bank can show improvements in key metrics including return on assets, capital efficiency, and loan deposit levels.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Wells Fargo wasn't one of them!

"hares of Fastenal Company  are up roughly 14% over the last three months. But FAST stock has dipped 3% in the last month in a sign that investors might be nervous about the industrial and construction supplies power. So, let's see what we should expect from Fastenal's Q3 financial results to understand if FAST stock might be worth buying before Wednesday.Fastenal's second-quarter revenues surged over 13%, driven by industrial vending and Onsite locations. The company signed 5,537 industrial vending devices last quarter, which marked a 13.4% jump. Investors should note that Fastenal's vending business, which is essentially a vending machine for supplies, is expected to be a significant part of its future.Meanwhile, the Minnesota-based company's Onsite business grew significantly as well. Similarly, Fastenal's Onsite business is exactly what its name implies. The company offers clients the chance to bring on a Fastenal team and products into their business. The firm signed 19% more Onsite clients last quarter to help Fastenal close the quarter with 761 active sites. This represented a nearly 57% surge from the year-ago period.Shares of FAST have dramatically underperformed the S&P 500 over the last five years, up roughly 20% compared to the index's nearly 80% climb. With that said, the past 36 months have been much more kind to Fastenal, with its shares up 45% compared to the S&P's 43%.We can also see that FAST stock has performed rather well over the last year and crushes its peer group, which includes Lowe's  , Lumber Liquidators  , and Home Depot  . Shares of Fast jumped as high as $56.89 on Monday, which falls below their 52-week high of $61.14.FAST stock is currently trading at 20.6X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates, which marks a discount compared to its industry's 25.4X average. Furthermore, Fastenal stock has traded as high as 28.4X over the last year, with a one-year median of 21.5X. This means that Fastenal's valuation picture appears pretty attractive at its current level.Our current Zacks Consensus Estimate is calling for Fastenal's Q3 revenues to jump by 12.3% to hit $1.27 billion. Meanwhile, the company's full-year revenues are projected to reach $4.93 billion, which would also mark a 12.3% climb over fiscal 2017.At the other end of the income statement, the company's adjusted quarterly earnings are expected to soar 34% to hit $0.67 per share. Fastenal's full-year EPS figure is expected to expand by 33.6% to touch $2.56.The industrial and construction supplies firm has also received multiple upward earnings estimate revisions for Q3, fiscal 2018, and fiscal 2019 over the last 30 days, with 100% agreement to the upside.Fastenal is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) based on its positive earnings revision activity. The company also sports ""B"" grades for both Growth and Momentum in our Style Scores system. Therefore, FAST stock might be worth buying ahead of its quarterly earnings release.Fastenal is scheduled to release its Q3 financial results before the market opens on Wednesday, October 10.Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

 is slated to release second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Sep 26.The company delivered a positive earnings surprise in each of the preceding three quarters, with an average trailing four-quarter beat of 2.3%. For the impending quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 49 cents moved up by a penny over the last seven days but reflects a year-over-year decline of 34.7%. | Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Bed Bath & Beyond has been gaining from its solid transformation efforts and other customer-centric initiatives. Also, the company is witnessing robust sales at its customer-facing digital networks, which is expected to continue in fiscal second quarter. Management remains focused on strategically expanding its store count besides increasing the productivity of existing stores to suit customer preferences.The company's focus on expanding, renovating and relocating stores to adapt to the changing market conditions is encouraging as well. In fact, it aims to open more of Buybuy BABY and Cost Plus World Markets stores to boost profitability. Further, the company's capital initiatives and constant shareholder-friendly moves bode well. Bed Bath & Beyond expects to allocate more than half of the capital spending toward technology-related projects to support omni-channel capabilities. All these endeavors are likely to drive higher sales and profitability.Notably, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of $2.96 billion, up 0.7% from the year-ago quarter number.However, Bed Bath & Beyond has been witnessing soft comparable-store sales (comps) for a while now due to decline in number of transactions in stores. Also, soft comps projection for the fiscal year might hurt comps growth in the to-be-reported quarter.Bed Bath & Beyond's eight-quarter long trend of strained gross and operating margins is an added headwind in the fiscal second quarter. Gross margin in the last reported quarter was marred by higher direct-to-customer shipping expenses and rise in coupon expenses due to increased average coupon amounts. This, along with a rise in SG&A expenses negatively impacted operating margin in the quarter. For fiscal 2018, the company expects gross margin contraction due to investments in customer value proposition and constant shift to the digital channels. Though operating margin is expected to be lower than that in fiscal 2017, it is expected to decline for the fiscal.In the past month, shares of the company have gained 4.1%, underperforming the  's 6.6% rally.Given the mixed sentiments, let's see whether the company's solid strategies can break the dismal margins trend in the fiscal second quarter.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Bed Bath & Beyond is likely to beat earnings estimates in the fiscal second quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both - a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) - for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  .Bed Bath & Beyond has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company's Earnings ESP of -4.41% make surprise prediction difficult.Here are some companies that you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:America's Car-Mart, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +4.55% and a Zacks Rank #1. You can see  .Amazon.com, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +8.93% and a Zacks Rank #2.Fastenal Company  has an Earnings ESP of +0.75% and a Zacks Rank of 3.Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"inance sector earnings were up +21.5% in the June quarter and the expectation is that growth in the Q3 earnings season, which JPMorgan (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC) and Citigroup (C) kick-off with their results on Friday, October 12 th , will likely be even better. But none of that shows up in the group's stock market performance, with bank stocks one of the weakest performers in the market.Bank stocks are down -0.8% this year, underperforming the broader market's +8.5% gain, but modestly better than the Finance sector's -3% decline. The group never got its mojo back after losing ground at the start of February, but continued to lead the S&P 500 through mid-March meaningfully diverging from the broader index around mid-May. The chart below shows the year-to-date performance comparison of the Zacks Major Banks industry and the S&P 500 index.A number of factors likely account for this underperformance. The most important reason appears to be the flattening yield curve, though it has been steepening a bit in recent days. The flattening yield curve has implications for banks' profitability, as banks' net interest margins represent similar spread between their lending and borrowing rates.The chart below shows the yield spread between 2 and 10-year treasury bonds over the past year (currently at 30 basis points, as of Wednesday, October 3 rd ).There is also the issue of deposit betas, the percentage of change in market interest rates that banks pass onto their depositors. Banks are typically fairly stingy with interest rates on their deposits, but competitive pressures force them to pass on the higher rates to their customers. As a result, deposit betas have been steadily going up, another negative for bank margins.Both of these are legitimate points, but worries about them appear to over-done to us. The yield spread has started expanding again. But even if this nascent steepening trend of recent days reverses, as has happened a number of times before, the spread is still most likely expected to remain positive. Similarly, even if deposit betas reach 100%, plenty of deposits are non-interest bearing. When you combine that some growth in loan portfolios and continued expense discipline, the group should have sustainable earnings growth in the high single-digits pace, beyond the current unsustainable tax-cut induced windfall.The chart below shows the Finance sector's Q3 earnings and revenue growth expectations in the context of where growth has been over the last two quarters and what is expected in the coming three periods.The contrast between revenue growth and earnings growth this year speaks to the direct impact of tax cuts on bank earnings. But as you can see, the growth pace comes down to normal levels from next year onwards.Total Q3 earnings are expected to be up +17.8% from the same period last year on +7.1% higher revenues, with double-digit earnings growth for 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors.As pointed out earlier, estimates for the quarter came down, as the chart below shows.Please note that the negative revisions trend for Q3 is in contrast to the three preceding quarters when the revisions trend was a lot more favorable. A big part of the positive revisions over the last two quarters was due to the direct impact of the tax cuts. With that issue now behind us, the revisions trend appears to be moving back to how it has behaved over the last few years. That said, the magnitude of negative revisions to Q3 estimates is lower than the historical norm of the last few years.With the outlook for the global economy starting to weaken and companies starting to feel the pinch of cyclical cost inflation, this negative revisions trend will likely only accelerate going forward. There is also the issue of trade protectionism having a negative earnings impact. This hasn't shown up in estimates yet, but we can easily see the negative earnings impact of trade protectionism in terms of higher expenses resulting from supply-chain disruptions and competitive forces prompting companies to absorb the increased costs instead of passing them onto end consumers.In other words, while the negative revisions trend to Q3 estimates wasn't that bad, the pace and magnitude of negative revisions could accelerate going forward.Overall growth reached its highest level in almost 8 years in each of the last two quarters, with the growth pace starting to decelerate in the second half of the year and into next year, as you can see in the year-over-year quarterly earnings growth chart for the S&P 500 index below.If we look at earnings growth for the S&P 500 index on a rolling 4-quarter basis, to smooth out the quarter-to-quarter variation, then the growth acceleration trend remains in place through Q4 2018 before starting to trend down next year, as the chart below shows.We don't get into the thick of the Q3 earnings season till the following week, but the reporting cycle has gotten underway already, with results from 21 S&P 500 members out and another 9 index members on deck to report this week. All of these early reporters have fiscal quarters ending in August, but they get counted as part of the September-quarter tally.Total earnings for these 21 index members are up +23.4% from the same period last year on +9.3% higher revenues, with 85.7% beating EPS estimates and 71.4% beating revenue estimates.It is still too small a sample of results to draw any firm conclusions from, but the results at this early stage are on the weaker side relative to other recent periods, as the comparison charts below show.The chart below shows the weekly calendar of earnings releases for the entire Q3 earnings cycle. As you can see, we have 9 index members reporting Q3 results this week, including the aforementioned big banks.

nvestors interested in stocks from the Building Products - Retail sector have probably already heard of Tecnoglass (TGLS) and Fastenal (FAST). But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Tecnoglass and Fastenal are sporting Zacks Ranks of #1 (Strong Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that TGLS has an improving earnings outlook. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.TGLS currently has a forward P/E ratio of 14.73, while FAST has a forward P/E of 22.70. We also note that TGLS has a PEG ratio of 0.74. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. FAST currently has a PEG ratio of 1.62.Another notable valuation metric for TGLS is its P/B ratio of 2.49. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, FAST has a P/B of 7.48.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to TGLS's Value grade of B and FAST's Value grade of D.TGLS stands above FAST thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that TGLS is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

astenal (FAST) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2018. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 10. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the , it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.This maker of industrial and construction fasteners is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.67 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +34%.Revenues are expected to be $1.27 billion, up 12.3% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.85% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks  (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce  , and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).For Fastenal, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.28%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that Fastenal will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Fastenal would post earnings of $0.66 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.74, delivering a surprise of +12.12%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our  to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Fastenal appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate.

imilar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is  , which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) further confirms weakness in BECN.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen 11 estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with just none upward revisions. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from $3.39 a share a month ago to its current level of $3.07.Also, for the current quarter, Beacon Roofing Supply has seen 11 downward estimate revisions versus no revisions in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to $1.38 a share from $1.58 over the past 30 days.The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 8.9% in the past month. | So it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore, at least if you don't have a long time horizon to wait.If you are still interested in the Building Products - Retail industry, you may instead consider a better-ranked stock - Fastenal Company  . The stock currently holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and may be a better selection at this time. You can see  .Zacks Research has released a report that may shock many investors.

he home improvement retail segment is witnessing an uptrend courtesy of higher home prices, which is discouraging the purchase of new homes. Meanwhile, this is acting as a catalyst to home improvement retailers as households choose to overhaul and remodel their existing homes. Per analysts, U.S. home prices are expected to jump twice the speed of inflation and wages in 2018, which might prove beneficial to home improvement retailers.Notably, home improvement retailers like  and  are flying high reaching a fresh 52-week high on Sep 12. The upside can be primarily attributed to their robust growth initiatives, including omni-channel growth and focus on Pro customers. Higher demand for product categories such as lawn, garden, seasonal, outdoor living and cooling products is also driving growth. Rising demand for lumber and other building materials on gradual recovery of housing market is too adding an impetus to the company.Impressively, Home Depot and Lowe's have outperformed the broader market in a year's time. Shares of Home Depot and Lowe's have surged 33% and 45.7%, respectively, cruising ahead of the S&P 500 index's 16.3% rally.Let's explore the stocks individually.Shares of Home Depot scaled a 52-week high of $215.43, closing the session lower at $211.98. The company has been gaining from consistent focus on affording innovative products, boosting interconnected customer experience and driving productivity. Additionally, its integrated retail strategy that connects offline and online channels has been well received by customers. Home Depot is also witnessing improved customer satisfaction scores and conversion rates through investments in interconnected capabilities, which encompass both digital properties and physical store assets.Home Depot's Pro segment continues to gain traction on improving portfolio service offerings for Pro customers through the enhancement of maintenance, repair and operations (MRO) products. Notably, sales to Pro customers improved double-digits in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 with Pro heavy categories like lumber, in-stock kitchens, power tools, windows, and concrete all recording double digit comparable-store sales (comps).Home Depot's shareholder-friendly moves are impressive as well. The company repurchased 9.3 million shares for $2 billion in the second quarter and targets buying back shares worth $6 billion in fiscal 2018. Meanwhile, the company's long-term financial targets, which are likely to be achieved in fiscal 2020, are boding well.This Atlanta, GA-based company has been reporting strong financial figures since 2008, with steady improvement in revenues and earnings per share. Incidentally, the company retained its five-year-long trend of beating earnings estimates in the fiscal second quarter. Moreover, it delivered positive sales surprise in seven of the trailing eight quarters.Shares of Lowe's also touched a 52-week high of $114.54, though it closed a notch lower at $114.34. The company has been witnessing sturdy growth in comps driven by well-chalked initiatives to boost sales across stores and online. Comps rose 5.2% in second-quarter fiscal 2018 on increased traffic and growth in transactions as well as rise in average ticket. Moreover, attractive offers and effective marketing strategies have been driving comps. Strong digital presence has also been a fueling factor.During the fiscal second quarter, the company registered 18% comps growth on Lowes.com. Going ahead, management continues to augment omni-channel capabilities and enhance consumers' digital shopping experience. Further, the company plans on optimizing search capabilities that will aid in planning assortments effectively.Furthermore, Pro customers remain a key catalyst behind Lowe's business growth. The company has been strengthening pro-focused brands to augment pro customers' sales. It has also refurbished the pro-service business website, LowesForPros.com, in order to give special attention toward the needs of its Pro-customers.Lowe's consistent focus on shareholder-friendly moves is an added positive. In the fiscal second quarter, the company repurchased shares worth $1.1 billion and distributed $338 million as dividends. It plans to carry out share repurchases of approximately $3 billion in fiscal 2018.We expect these stocks to continue soaring high and create new records, given their solid strategic actions, recovery in the housing market and impressive long-term earnings growth rates. Currently, Home Depot boasts an expected long-term earnings growth rate of 13.3%, while that of Lowe's is 14.4%. Both these stocks exhibit a  of A, which clearly demonstrates further growth potential.Other stocks worth a look in the same industry are Tecnoglass Inc.  and Fastenal Company  . Shares of these companies advanced 36.4% and 34.9%, respectively, in a year. While Tecnoglass sports Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Home Depot, Lowe's and Fastenal carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see  .It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

" has been a strong performer, which is clear from the company's robust earnings surprise history and the stock momentum. Moreover, investors remain confident about its relentless focus on affording innovative products, boosting interconnected customer experience and driving productivity. It also continues to reap the benefits of a steady housing market recovery and strong customer demand.The company has witnessed an upsurge in the stock price, which hovers close to its 52-week high. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has rallied 6.3% since reporting top- and bottom-line beat for second-quarter fiscal 2018 on Aug 14. Further, the stock has outperformed the  's growth of 2.4%.Notably, the company retained its five-year-long trend of beating earnings estimates. Moreover, sales reverted to a positive surprise trend after a reporting miss in the last-reported quarter. With this, the company has delivered positive sales surprise in seven out of the last eight quarters. Results gained from a recovery in the seasonal business that impacted sales in the fiscal first quarter and the solid execution. Backed by the solid performance in the first half of fiscal 2018, the company raised its earnings and sales forecast for fiscal 2018.Driven by the robust earnings outlook, analysts remain optimistic about the stock. This is quite evident from the uptrend in earnings estimates over the last 30 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.57 and $10.25 for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 moved north by 10 cents and 6 cents, respectively. Management envisions earnings per share for fiscal 2018 to be up nearly 29.2% from $9.42 in fiscal 2017. It earlier projected earnings per share growth rate of 28%.Home Depot's integrated retail strategy, which connects offline and online channels, has been well received by the customers. The company is witnessing improved customer satisfaction scores and conversion rates through investments in interconnected capabilities that encompass both digital properties and physical store assets. Consequently, digital sales in second-quarter fiscal 2018 increased about 26%, backed by strong growth in online traffic. However, the scope of the integrated retail strategy also extends to the supply chain system, and investments for enhancing the delivery and fulfillment options for customers.In this regard, the company is continually developing and rolling out delivery capabilities. For example, it recently rolled out the small parcel express delivery from store via car and van in almost all of its key U.S. markets, and expects to expand it further in days to come. As part of its supply chain transformation over the next five years through its ""One Home Depot Supply Chain"" initiative, the company opened its first supply chain facility (market delivery operations) that are stockless locations, acting as delivery hubs for big and bulky products in the fiscal first quarter. It plans to open more of these facilities in the second half of fiscal 2018.Moreover, the company's Pro segment is a key growth driver, with Pro sales outpacing DIY (do-it-yourself) sales. The Pro segment continues to gain traction due to focus on improving portfolio service offerings for Pro customers through the enhancement of maintenance, repair and operations (MRO) products, which witnessed double-digit growth in second-quarter fiscal 2018.Notably, the company's professional sales force (mainly the Interline brands and outside sales forces) is focused on strengthening relationships with Pro customers, resulting in a deeper level of engagement and incremental spending. This has, in turn, boosted sales for this category. Sales to Pro customers improved in double digits in the fiscal second quarter, with Pro heavy categories like lumber, in-stock kitchens, power tools, windows, and concrete all recording double-digit comps.We note that commodity cost inflation, including rising raw material and transportation costs, as well as recently enacted tariffs, are likely to pressure margins. Though Home Depot delivered gross margin growth of nearly 30 bps in second-quarter fiscal 2018, it included about a 16 bps negative impact from higher transportation and fuel costs in its supply chain. Further, the company has slightly trimmed its gross margin forecast for fiscal 2018 to about a 41 bps expansion due to the higher-than-anticipated transportation costs.Despite the margin concerns, we believe, the above-mentioned growth factors clearly profess that Home Depot still has significant growth potential in the days ahead. This is also evident from the company's  of A and long-term earnings growth rate of 13.3%.Some better-ranked stocks in the retail sector are Fastenal Company  , Tecnoglass Inc.  and Canada Goose Holdings Inc.  , each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see  .Fastenal has pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 3% in the last four quarters. The company has long-term earnings growth rate of 14%.Tecnoglass, with an impressive earnings growth rate of 20%, has delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 16.5% in the trailing four quarters.Canada Goose has long-term earnings growth rate of 26.3%. Further, the company's earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 73.1%.Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

And, that appears to be the shape of things.Click to Enlarge  • The bulls' best chance at rekindling a bigger-picture uptrend was building on the dead-cat bounce following the early July plunge and subsequent effort to fill that gap. That effort faded by late July though, and the selling was renewed pretty decisively in the meantime.• Although the volume that has materialized since the late July peak hasn't matched the post-plunge rally's bullish volume, what the selloff has lacked in volume has been offset by consistency. The daily chart's Chaikin line just broke under the zero line, confirming the bearish volume trend has some momentum.• It sounds outlandish (and is), but if this selling effort retains or gains more traction, there's not another technical support level in sight until the $113 area, where Broadcom began a huge rally back in late-2015.Credit has to be given where it's due - Fastenal has capitalized on the revitalization of the housing construction market, and the more recent revamp of the nation's manufacturing and industrial sector.  , and are expected to grow again next year.The stock's getting uncomfortably expensive though, valued at 25 times its trailing earnings and 21 times its forward-looking profits.

For a fair amount of Friday's session, it looked like stocks were going to unwind part of the shortened week's setback. Though it would still book a loss for the week, at least it would be a tolerable one. By the time the closing bell rang, though, the  was down another 0.22%. The close of 2,871.68 translated into the worst weekly performance for the market since March.Leading the charge lower were  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ). Tesla shares fell more than 6% on the heels of a  , during which he appeared to be smoking marijuana. Fanning the selling flames was word that yet another executive had abruptly left. AMD, meanwhile, tumbled almost 2% mostly because traders aren't quite sure what to make of it, but know the stock is feeling the weight of recent, huge gains.Not every stock was backpedaling.  (NASDAQ:  ) advanced 2% after reporting  . There just weren't enough stories like Costco's to push the broad market over the hump headed into the weekend.It's the kind of backdrop that can make trading tricky, in that it's not clear which direction the undertow is actually pointed. To the extent stock charts help spot those trends though, it's the stock charts of  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NYSE:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ) that are the most promising possibilities. Here's why.It's difficult (and even a little dangerous) to bet against Apple. Not only is it the biggest company in the world, but it's also the most profitable. Consumers love the brand.Nevertheless, AAPL shares got a little ahead of themselves in August, leaving them at least a little vulnerable to profit-taking. Last week's action suggests that may already be underway.Click to Enlarge  • The last three daily bars speak for themselves. Three down days in a row after an accelerating run-up may have established a little more momentum than the bulls can stop anytime soon.• The volume for the past several days has been even more telling. The bullish volume seen during the last couple of days of August was actually falling, but the selling volume for the past three days not only started above average, but grew as the selloff took shape.• Zooming out to a weekly chart of Apple, we can see the RSI indicator confirms an overbought condition. We can also see just how far removed the stock has gotten from its mean, or average. Now we may be due for a return to the mean, which is closer to $200.The past few weeks generally have been good ones for food companies, and General Mills hasn't been an exception to this trend. It may be an indication that investors are slowly migrating to safer havens and reliable names as they rethink their more aggressive growth holdings, anticipating some sort of weakness.Whatever the reason, the best may be yet to come for General Mills. GIS has not only been trending higher, but has used a key moving average as a pushoff point that's put the stock within striking distance of a major technical ceiling.Click to Enlarge  • The pushoff point is the 50-day moving average line (purple) at $45.24. The stock used it as a floor for the past couple of weeks, shoving off of it on Friday.• There's a big resistance line around $47.80, where General Mills shares peaked a couple of times in August. That's also near Friday's high. That line needs to be hurdled first before the stock can get into truly bullish groove.• The upper boundary of the bearish gap left behind by the March plunge could be part of the bullish motivation in play here. But, if the gap is filled, it will also coincide with a cross above the 200-day moving average line (white). If that long-term moving average line is hurdled, that's also a bullish inspiration that could help catapult the stock out of the consolidation phase it's been in since June. Past that, the peak near $61 seen around the time 2017 was becoming 2018 is a plausible ceiling.Last but not least, an updated look at Fastenal, which was one of the  . At the time [see the pink arrow on the daily chart], FAST shares were rallying quite nicely, but had just bumped into a major technical ceiling that had the potential stop and reverse that trend.That's indeed how it happened. But, the potential weakness has only started to materialize. A great deal of untapped downside remains on the table.Click to Enlarge  • Friday's 3.1% tumble may have squashed any lingering hopes that Fastenal shares would recover before slipping into too much trouble, paving the way for more selling.• Zooming out to the weekly chart of FAST puts the pattern in perspective. The stock has been trapped in a wide and well-defined trading range since 2016, the lower boundary of which is presently around $43.

If either or both fail as a floor, there's little else left to stop a selloff.• If the 50-day moving average line (purple) ends up falling below the 200-day line, as it appears it will, that so-called ""death cross"" will only embolden any bearish undertow.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@3 Big Stock Charts for Friday: Broadcom, Fastenal and Danaher@2018-08-24@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-big-stock-charts-for-friday%3A-broadcom-fastenal-and-danaher-2018-08-24
nvestors interested in Building Products - Retail stocks are likely familiar with GMS Inc. (GMS) and Fastenal (FAST). But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Right now, both GMS Inc. and Fastenal are sporting a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that both of these companies have improving earnings outlooks. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.GMS currently has a forward P/E ratio of 7.76, while FAST has a forward P/E of 23.26. We also note that GMS has a PEG ratio of 1.11. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. FAST currently has a PEG ratio of 1.66.Another notable valuation metric for GMS is its P/B ratio of 1.82. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, FAST has a P/B of 7.67.These metrics, and several others, help GMS earn a Value grade of A, while FAST has been given a Value grade of D.Both GMS and FAST are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that GMS is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

" reported second-quarter fiscal 2018 results, wherein both top and bottom lines improved year over year and came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The solid performance was however not enough to placate investors who seem to be let down by management's trimmed outlook for fiscal 2018. Markedly, shares of the company lost almost 3% during the  session.Incidentally, Lowe's incurred non-cash pre-tax charges of nearly $230 million related to its strategic review of Orchard Supply Hardware, which, in turn, resulted in long-lived asset impairments and discontinued projects during the second quarter. Moreover, the company decided to exit these operations last week, in a drive to increase focus on its key home improvement business.To this end, Lowe's anticipates shutting down all 99 Orchard Supply Hardware stores (situated in California, Florida and Oregon), and also plans to wind up the related distribution facility by the end of fiscal 2018. In this regard, the company plans to undertake store closing sales and collaborated with Hilco Merchant Services to carry out the process seamlessly.Well, management expects to incur incremental pre-tax costs of $390-$475 million in the second half of fiscal 2018, in connection with severance and lease obligations as well as accelerated depreciation and amortization costs. These factors along with management's plan to rationalize inventory levels weighed on its outlook for fiscal 2018.Excluding the aforementioned charges incurred in the second quarter (related to Orchard Supply), this home improvement retailer's adjusted earnings came in at $2.07 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.02. Moreover, the bottom line increased 31.8% from $1.57 in the year-ago quarter, following a rise of 15.5% in the previous quarter. | Further, net sales of $20.9 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.8 billion. Sales included the impact from the new revenue recognition accounting standard of ASU No. 2014-09, which was adopted in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.Notably, sales in the second quarter advanced 7.1% year over year after posting improvement of 3% in the preceding period. Prior to that, the company posted sales growth of 1.8%, 6.5%, 6.8% and 10.7% in the fourth, third, second and first quarters of fiscal 2017, respectively.Comparable sales (comps) rose 5.2% in the quarter under review, after 0.6% rise recorded in the preceding quarter. Comps increased 4.1%, 5.7%, 4.5% and 1.9% in the fourth, third, second and first quarters of fiscal 2017, respectively. Comps for the U.S. business jumped 5.3%, after increasing 0.5% in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Comps for the U.S. business grew 4.7%, 5.1%, 4.6% and 2% in the fourth, third, second and first quarters of fiscal 2017, respectively.Moving on, gross profit increased 7.9% year over year to $7,199 million and gross profit margin expanded roughly 25 basis points (bps) to 34.5%. However, operating income declined 9.2% to $2,163 million, thanks to higher SG&A expenses.Lowe's, which competes with Home Depot  , ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $2,251 million, long-term debt (excluding current maturities) of $14,937 million and shareholders' equity of $5,781 million. Cash flow from operations amounted to $5,787 million in the first six months of fiscal 2018.In the reported quarter, the company kept its promise of returning surplus cash to stockholders as it repurchased shares worth $1.1 billion and distributed $338 million as dividends.Management remains impressed with Lowe's robust second-quarter show, which was fueled by delayed spring season demand. Going ahead, the company remains committed toward delivering an even better performance by strengthening its retail fundamentals and putting greater focus on its core plan to become a solid omni-channel home improvement retailer.While the company decided to exit Orchard Supply Hardware, it also remains strongly focused on rationalizing inventory levels. Both these factors led to a curtailed outlook for fiscal 2018.For fiscal 2018, management now projects total sales growth of approximately 4.5%, down from the prior estimate of a rise of 5%. Further, comps for fiscal 2018 are now expected to rise about 3% compared with 3.5% anticipated earlier.Additionally, Lowe's now envisions operating margin to decline approximately 180 bps in fiscal 2018 compared with a 40-bp contraction expected earlier. The updated view takes into consideration the impact from non-cash charges as well as incremental costs associated with plans to exit Orchard Supply Hardware. These costs are anticipated to be incurred in the second half of fiscal 2018.Further, effective tax rate is envisioned to be roughly 25%. Earnings are now anticipated in a band of $4.50-$4.60, considerably lower than the previously guided range of $5.40-$5.50. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 earnings is currently pegged at $5.44, which is likely to be revised downward.Moreover, the company intends to open roughly 9 home improvement stores in fiscal 2018. As of Aug 3, 2018, the company operated 2,155 home improvement and hardware store in the United States, Canada and Mexico.Lowe's currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Shares of the company have rallied 39.2% in a year, outperforming the  's growth of 34.5%.Fastenal  has long-term earnings per share growth rate of 14%. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see GMS Inc.  with a Zacks Rank #2 has a long-term earnings per share growth rate of 7%.Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

nvestors eyeing a purchase of Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST) shares, but cautious about paying the going market price of $60.37/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2020 put at the $47 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $2.45. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 5.2% return against the $47 commitment, or a 3.7% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to FAST's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $47 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Fastenal Co. sees its shares fall 22% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $44.55 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $2.45 from $47), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 3.7% annualized rate of return.Interestingly, that annualized 3.7% figure actually exceeds the 2.6% annualized dividend paid by Fastenal Co. by 1.1%, based on the current share price of $60.37. And yet, if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downside because the stock would have to lose 21.97% to reach the $47 strike price.Always important when discussing dividends is the fact that, in general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Fastenal Co., looking at the dividend history chart for FAST below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 2.6% annualized dividend yield.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Fastenal Co., and highlighting in green where the $47 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2020 put at the $47 strike for the 3.7% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Fastenal Co. (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $60.37) to be 25%.

 's  shares have sharply declined in the past six months and the downtrend is likely to continue following the company's lower-than-expected results in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. In the same time frame, the stock has declined 33.9% against the industry's rally of 2.5%. Further, raw material price inflation and stiff competition remain major concerns for the company. Let's delve deeper and find out what is resulting in this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company's downtrend. Beacon Roofing's earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in four of the trailing five quarters. In the preceding four quarters, the company's earnings missed the consensus estimate by a margin of 69.2%. Following the dismal bottom-line performance, the consensus mark for both the fourth quarter and fiscal 2018 have been sharply revised downward by 8.9% and 6.8%, respectively, indicating analysts' pessimism surrounding the stock.Further, Beacon Roofing lowered its adjusted EBITDA view for the fiscal from $555-$585 million to $510-$520 million. Consistent with the adjusted EBITDA reduction, the company lowered its adjusted EPS view as well. For fiscal 2018, adjusted EPS is expected in the $3.00-$3.10 range versus prior expectation within $3.35-$3.55. Notably, this revised EPS outlook reflects fiscal third-quarter shortfall. Raw material prices are increasing across a wide range of key items, including asphalt, steel and gypsum, as well as for inbound flatbed rates and for outbound costs, including diesel and other delivery expenses, which are likely to hamper Beacon Roofing's performance. Being the largest publicly-traded distributor of residential and non-residential roofing materials, the company is sensitive to asphalt prices, which are highly volatile and often linked to  . Increased prices may hurt demand for these products, resulting in lower sales volumes. Beacon Roofing belongs to a highly competitive industry. The commercial roofing market has been experiencing excessive competitive pricing pressures, as many smaller local players are competing directly on pricing issues. Thus, general market softness, volatile exchange rates and uncertain weather conditions remain matters of concern.Some better-ranked stocks in the  include GMS Inc.  , Fastenal Company  and Tecnoglass Inc.  . While GMS sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Fastenal and Tecnoglass both carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see  .GMS has an impressive long-term earnings growth rate of 7%.Fastenal reported better-than-expected earnings in the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 3.03%.Tecnoglass has an impressive long-term earnings growth rate of 20%.It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

he U.S. economy is picking up pace (4.1% growth in second-quarter 2018) with strong consumer spending driven by steady rise in income, strengthening labor market, as well as increasing business investments and government spending. Positive trends in the economy are driving many U.S. industries, including the housing market that has witnessed increased housing demand lately.Notably, the spring buying season witnessed significant demand for buying a home across most parts of the United States due to the steady economy and improved employment levels. However, home sales remained stable due to budget constraints as home prices and mortgage rates continued to surge. Further, rising interest rates, trade-war anxieties (due to tariffs on aluminum and steel), labor shortages, apprehension of two more hikes in 2018 and limited land availability are some concerns looming upon the housing sector.Albeit, the prospects for the building products industry, which produces and sells goods used in building homes and offices, are bright. Dealing in lumber, insulation materials, drywall, plumbing fixtures, flooring, and furniture, players in this industry are poised to gain from a shift to digitalization as the industry continues to evolve.Further, higher home prices and rising interest rates are are acting as deterrents to home purchases, leading consumers to focus on undertaking home improvement and remodeling projects. This is likely to benefit the Building Products - Retail industry due to increased demand for lumber and other building materials. This is where home improvement retailers like Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's Companies (LOW) stand to gain.Relentless efforts to enrich customers' experiences, solid focus on omni-channel capabilities and innovations, robust services to Pro-customers as well as optimizing costs and boosting productivity are driving solid performance of a sizeable number of stocks in the space.The Zacks  within the broader Zacks  has outperformed both the S&P 500 and its own sector over the past year.While the stocks in this industry have collectively gained 27.8%, the Zacks S&P 500 Composite and Zacks Retail-Wholesale Sector have rallied 26.1% and 16.4%, respectively.However, it's worth noting that there was a significant lack of synchronization in the performance of individual stocks within the group. Some Building Products - Retail stocks are grappling with strained operating margins and higher costs to support omni-channel and supply-chain capabilities as well as stiff industry competition.Due to the outperformance of the industry over the past year, the valuation looks really expensive now. One might get a good sense of the industry's relative valuation by looking at its price-to-earnings ratio (P/E), which is the most appropriate multiple for valuing Retail stocks because their earnings are effective in gauging performance.This ratio essentially measures a stock's current market value relative to its earnings performance. Investors believe that the lower the P/E, the higher the value of the stock will be.Generally, the price of a stock is directly proportional to its earnings. As earnings forecasts move higher, demand for the stock should drive its price. If the P/E of a stock is rising steadily, it means that investors are pinning their hopes on the company's inherent potential.The industry currently has a trailing 12-month P/E ratio of 23.3, which is in line with its median level but below the highest level of 26.3 witnessed over the past year, thus having more upside potential.The space looks quite expensive when compared with the market at large, as the trailing 12-month P/E ratio for the S&P 500 is 19.4 and the median level is 20.2.Solid focus on enhancing services to Pro customers, strategic acquisitions to widen footprint, expand brand assortments and effective cost-containment efforts are expected to help Building Products - Retail stocks continue generating positive shareholder returns in the near future.But what really matters to investors is whether this group has the potential to perform better than the broader market in the quarters ahead. While the earlier valuation analysis reflects that there is little upside left, there are enough reasons for investors to continue looking for a good entry point.One reliable measure that can help investors understand the industry's prospects for a solid price performance is its earnings outlook for its member companies. Empirical research shows that a company's earnings outlook significantly influences the performance of its stock.One could get a good sense of a company's earnings outlook by comparing the consensus earnings expectation for the current financial year with the last year's reported number, but an effective measure could be the magnitude and direction of the recent change in earnings estimates.The consensus earnings estimate for the Zacks Building Products - Retail industry of $6.21 implies a significant year-over-year improvement from $5.57 in August 2017. Moreover, the trend in earnings estimate revisions has been favorable lately.Looking at the aggregate estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are hopeful of this group's earnings potential.The consensus EPS estimate for the current fiscal year has been revised 11.5% upward since August 2017.The group's  , which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates continued outperformance in the near term.The Zacks Building Products - Retail industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #62, which places it at the top 24% of more than 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Our proprietary Heat Map shows that the industry's rank has improved considerably over the past four weeks.The past earnings trend of this Building Products - Retail space as a whole reveals that the group has been witnessing an uptrend since 2009, prior to which it was declining for about two years.Similarly, the top-line performance of the industry as a whole too has been mirroring growth since 2009.Healthy economic environment along with rising consumer spending and home prices gives a bright future for the Building Products - Retail industry. Further, the space is expected to gain from companies' consistent efforts to boost interconnected strategies and diversifying business operations. The players in the space are focusing on technological advancements to upgrade payment modes, better interpret customers' needs and fit their demands conveniently and quickly, facilitate business operations in a modernized way, among others.However, the Fed's interest rate hikes do remain concerns for slower activities in the evolving housing markets in the United States. Recently, The Federal Reserve has kept interest rates unchanged, paving the way for a hike in September. Apprehension of two more hikes in 2018 might make things difficult.Though the valuation looks a little pricey at this time, keeping long-term expectations in mind, investors may look for some good entry points in the stocks that will help them make the most of the momentum in the industry.Notably, we have three stocks in our Zacks Building Products - Retail industry currently having a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) that have been witnessing positive earnings estimate revisions. You can see  . (FAST): This Winona, MN-based wholesale distributor of industrial and construction products globally, has surged 28.6% in the past year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current fiscal year EPS was revised 2.4% upward in the last 30 days. (BLDR): The consensus EPS estimate for this Dallas, TX-based company moved nearly 0.5% higher for the current fiscal year in the last 30 days. The stock has rallied 5.4% over the past year. (BMCH): The Atlanta, GA-based company has gained 7% in the past year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current fiscal year EPS was revised nearly 2% upward in the last 60 days.Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

all Street's bullish wave, which commenced in July, continues in the first week of August despite the presence of trade war concerns and geopolitical conflicts. The benchmark S&P 500 index - generally used by market participants as the barometer of the broad market movement - was up for fifth straight week.Robust U.S. economy, strong labor market, solid consumer and business spending along with government's deregulation policies is likely to pave the way for further upside. Massive tax cut and fiscal stimulus will act as catalysts. Consequently, investment in S&P 500 stocks, which provided significant return in the last one month with favorable Zacks Rank and have further upside potential, will be a prudent move.In the last five weeks, the S&P 500 gained 1.5%, 1.5%, 0.1%, 0.6% and 0.8%, respectively. This marks the broad-market index's longest weekly winning streak so far this year. Year to date, the S&P 500 is up 6.2%.This indicates that the U.S. stock markets momentum remained largely unhindered in spite of recent volatility, signaling a recovery for Wall Street in the second half of 2018.U.S. GDP grew at 4.1% in the second-quarter of 2018, marking its highest gain since the third quarter of 2014 and the third-best growth rate since the Great Recession of 2008-2009.In the second-quarter, consumer spending increased 4%, business investment grew 7.3% and government spending rose 3.5%. Notably, first-quarter 2018 GDP growth rate was revised to 2.2% from 2% reported earlier.On Aug 3, the Labor Department reported that the U.S. non-firm job addition increased by 157,000 for the month of July. Moreover, data for May and June were revised upwards to add 59,000 more jobs in the economy.Unemployment rate in July fell 0.1% from June to 3.9%, its lowest level in nearly 50 years. Average hourly earnings increased by 0.3% to 2.7% over the same period a year ago, reducing investor's fear of a hyper-inflation.U.S. corporates have so far posted robust results for second-quarter 2018, maintaining the terrific earnings momentum which has begun since the first-quarter 2018.Notably, in the second-quarter, total earnings of S&P 500 companies are expected to be up 23.9% from the same period last year on 9.3% higher revenues. (Read More:  )Solid macro-economic fundamentals, government's tax reform and deregulation proposals along with sustained strong earnings performance are major tailwinds for the U.S. economy. Such factors are unlikely to disappear in the near term. At this stage, investment in the S&P 500 stocks which provided significant return in the last month and still have solid upside potential will be lucrative. However, picking winning stocks can be a difficult task.This is where our  comes in handy. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores.

The company's relentless focus on affording innovative products, boosting interconnected customer experience and driving productivity seems to be paying off. Further, it continued to reap the benefits of a steady housing-market recovery and strong customer demand.Net sales grew 8.4% to $30,463 million from $28,108 million in the year-ago quarter and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $29,981 million. The company's overall comparable-store sales (comps) increased 8% while comps in the United States grew 8.1%.During the reported quarter, comps benefited from 5% rise in average ticket and 3.1% increase in customer transactions.

"n recent trading, shares of Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $57.75, changing hands for $57.90/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 8 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Fastenal Co., but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $53.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $62.00. The standard deviation is $3.059.But the whole reason to look at the  FAST price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with FAST crossing above that average target price of $57.75/share, investors in FAST have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $57.75 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Fastenal Co.:

Generally, investors love stocks with a low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. The idea is that the lower the P/E, the higher will be the value of the stock. The simple logic that a stock's current market price does not validate (is not equivalent to) its higher earnings and therefore has room to run justifies investors' inclination toward low P/E stocks. Source: ©iStock.com/CharlieAJABut stocks with a rising P/E are also worth a bet. We'll tell you why.Investors should note that stock price moves in tandem with earnings performance. If earnings come in stronger, the price of a stock shoots up. Solid quarterly earnings and the forward guidance boost earnings forecasts, leading to stronger demand for the stock and an uptrend in its price.So, if the price is rising steadily, it means that investors are assured of the stock's fundamental strength and expect some strong positives out of it. Suppose an investor wants to buy a stock with a P/E ratio of 30, it means that he is willing to shell out $30 for only $1 worth of earnings. This is because the investor expects earnings of the company to rise at a faster pace in the future on the back of strong fundamentals.Also, studies have revealed that stocks have seen their P/E ratios jump over 100% from their breakout point in the cycle. So, if you can pick stocks early in their breakout cycle, you can end up seeing considerable gains.In order to shortlist stocks that are exhibiting an increasing P/E, we chose the following as our primary screening parameters.(These two criteria point to flat earnings or a growth trend over the years.)(These two criteria show that price of the stock is increasing consistently over the said timeframes.)(Here, the case for consistent price gains gets even stronger as it displays percentage price changes relative to the S&P 500.)(A 20% increase in the price of a stock from the breakout point gives cues of an impending uptrend.

"Chicago, IL - August 1, 2018 - Stocks in this week's article are  ,  ,  ,  and  .A profitable company is able to offer high returns to its investors even after meeting all its operating and non-operating costs. In this context, we have used a financial ratio to measure the company's profitability position. Profitability analysis is used here to differentiate a profitable company over a loss-making one.The best accounting tool to understand a company's profitability position is ratio analysis. Generally, there are four key profitability ratios - gross income ratio, operating income ratio, pre-tax profit margin and net income ratio. Here, we have used the most effective and frequently used profitability ratio - net income ratio.Net income ratio gives us the exact profit level of a company. It reflects the percentage of net income to total sales revenues. Using net income ratio, one can determine a company's capability to meet operating and non-operating expenses with its sales revenues. A higher net income ratio usually implies a company's ability to generate ample sales revenues and successfully manage all business functions.Zacks.com created the first and best screening system on the web earning the distinction as the ""#1 site for screening stocks"" by Money Magazine.

 There's lots of evidence to back up the idea that companies that regularly increase their dividends tend to outperform the broader market averages over time.It's logical, really. Companies can't pay a dividend unless they're profitable; they can't increase the dividend unless profits are growing; and they can't grow profits unless the company has some kind of edge that keeps competitors at bay.With that said, let me tell you about  (NASDAQ: FAST) ,  (NYSE: NKE) , and  (NYSE: QSR) .Image source: Getty Images.Fastenal has been in business for over 50 years selling a range of industrial supply products to large and small businesses, contractors, and individuals, primarily in the U.S. The company got its name selling fasteners, but today those products make up only about 35% of annual sales.The company operates a vast network of 2,290 retail branches, 761 onsite business locations, and 76,000 vending machines scattered throughout the country in medium-sized cities to rural areas. Through these channels, Fastenal makes the majority of its revenue selling the most unexciting but crucial stuff -- bolts, screws, rivets, saw blades, ladders, brooms, tape, glue, and much more.Sometimes boring makes the best investment. Just feast your eyes on this chart: data by  .Fastenal is one of the most consistently performing companies you'll find, and it still offers a lot of growth potential for investors. Net sales have grown from just $511 million in 1998 to $4.7 billion over the trailing-12-month period. Net income has grown even faster, from $53 million to $681 million over the same period. That's a compound growth rate of 11.4% for sales and 13.3% for net income.In the second quarter of this year, Fastenal posted impressive growth of 13.1% in sales and 36% in earnings. And there's room for growth as the company estimates North American demand for its products at more than $140 billion.The steady, predictable nature of its business has allowed Fastenal to increase its dividend 224% over the last 10 years, and it just recently increased its payout 25% to an annual run rate of $1.60 per share, which is a 2.8%  at the time of this writing.Fastenal's dividend  has historically been above 50% of earnings per share, which means there will have to be earnings growth for the dividend to continue increasing. Growth shouldn't be a problem, given that Fastenal has been growing consistently for decades and still has a tiny market share compared to its $140 billion addressable market. It will likely grow for many more years, and that should lead to continued growth in dividends.Historically, Nike has been very good at marketing its brand by signing up top sports stars to wear its products, as well as making deals with universities and professional teams to supply uniforms and other gear. This ability to effectively market its brand has made the swoosh one of the most iconic logos in history.Nike's powerful brand has consistently cranked out steady growth in revenue and profits over the years. Even as one of the largest retail companies in the world, Nike has managed to double its annual revenue over the last 10 years to $36.4 billion through fiscal 2018 (which ended in May). Over the last five years, earnings per share have grown 78% to $2.39 (adjusted for one-time items). data by  .Nike also regularly increases its dividend, usually every year. The dividend has doubled over the last five years to a current annual payout of $0.80 per share, giving the stock about a 1% yield at current prices. That's only about a third of annual earnings per share, which gives the company plenty of room to keep increasing the payout in the future.With a huge market that is constantly expanding, particularly in the Greater China region, where Nike just  year-over-year growth, the athletic-apparel giant should keep pumping out steady growth in revenue and profits, allowing it to steadily grow the dividend for years to come.Restaurant Brands International (RBI) is a holding company that is gradually assembling a worldwide empire in the fast-food market. RBI is the parent owner of Burger King, Tim Hortons, and Popeye's Louisiana Kitchen, and there will likely be other restaurants added to the roster given that RBI's largest shareholder,  , likes to do deals in order to deliver growth for shareholders.And it's certainly delivering so far. Over the last few years, restaurant-level comparable-store sales growth remained mostly positive even with a recessionary environment in the restaurant industry.And growth is starting to heat up. In the first quarter, Burger King and Popeye's experienced a surge in comparable sales of 11.3% and 10.9%, respectively -- a much better showing than the year-ago quarter's 6% growth for each restaurant.The stock is up 80% since the end of 2014. Driving these gains has been a surge of 104% in non-GAAP earnings per share since 2015. The annual dividend has more than quadrupled to $1.80 per share, providing a generous yield of 2.8%.Like Fastenal, future dividend increases will have to come from earnings growth, since RBI's current payout is about 65% of trailing-12-month net income. Analysts currently expect the company to grow earnings 19% per year over the next five years, or more than double, which could also lead to a proportionate increase in the dividend.Management sees the  opportunity for its three restaurant chains several times the company's current size, and they are committed to increasing the dividend over time as earnings grow. data by  .Both income and growth investors should find this payout very appealing, considering the growth RBI has already delivered and the huge growth opportunity management sees in expanding all of its restaurant chains internationally.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

n 2014,  (NASDAQ: FAST) identified a new growth driver for its business. Instead of having its customers come to it, the fastener, tool, and supply retailer realized its customers increasingly desired Fastenal to go to them. The company calls this its onsite business, which is even more profitable than the company's more traditional store-based operations. A key piece of this is, believe it or not, vending machines. Here's why being onsite is so important to this 3%-yielding stock's future.Fastenal provides customers with reliable and fast access to things you don't really think about much, literally the nuts and bolts that keep businesses running. It has around 2,290 physical branches where it sells fasteners, tools, and other supplies. However, that number is down from a peak of 2,687 in 2013. Yet revenues increased each year through that span, going from around $3.3 billion in 2013 to nearly $4.4 billion in 2017.Fastenal has been focusing on growing its business by getting itself deeply embedded into its customers' workflow with tools like vending machines. Image source: Getty Images.Although the company is really good at what it does, the store closures aren't a sign of an incredible increase in efficiency. They point to a business shift that started to take shape in 2014, when Fastenal realized that going direct to its customers was a key growth driver for the business. That includes three main categories: onsite locations, stocking customer supply bins, and vending machines.The main goal is to help customers free up time and resources that they can instead put toward their businesses, while Fastenal does the things it does well (making sure its customers have the parts they need when they need them), just at a different location. This leverages its distribution system, including its branch network, and integrates Fastenal into its customers' workflow in a way that makes the company hard to replace.Between 2014 and the first quarter of 2017, Fastenal increased its onsite locations from 214 to 761. If you count those locations as stores, which they effectively are, its total store count at the end of the second quarter actually rises from 2,290 to 3,051. Adding these onsite locations to the store count each year turns a steadily declining number since 2014 into a steadily rising one. And these are incredibly profitable operations, with operating expenses that are roughly half of what a typical Fastenal store would cost to operate.To break out a key piece of this puzzle, onsite vending machines, not the type that contain soda and chips, have been growing at a compound annual rate of 15% since 2013. Sales through vending machines grew 20% year over year in the most recent quarter, so this is a very real business that customers appear to like based on the installed base of over 76,000 vending machines (vending locations generally contain more than one machine).Today, onsite represents around 20% of the company's revenues, double what it was in 2013. And despite making up just 20% of the top line, Fastenal explains that 40% of its revenue growth is being driven by this business. With an onsite revenue run rate of over $2 billion a year, the company still sees plenty of potential in what it believes is an over $22 billion market opportunity. Although being onsite at a customer location isn't a unique business model to Fastenal, this is clearly the business to watch for growth at this industrial supplier.Fastenal's shares are near all-time highs, but based on its ability to continue driving growth in new ways, that makes complete sense. However, it may not be as expensive as you think. The company's  , is currently around 1.4 times compared to a five-year average of just under 1.9. This suggests it is trading at a discount relative to the valuation it has historically been afforded. The company's enterprise value to EBITDA, meanwhile, is roughly in line with its five-year average. Overall, Fastenal looks fairly priced to, perhaps, a little bit cheap based on its growth prospects -- driven by things like vending machines and onsite locations.Where things start to get really interesting is when you consider the stock's generous 3% yield, backed by 19 years of consecutive annual dividend increases. An S&P 500 Index would only get you a yield of about 2%. And the current yield is easily at the high end of the company's historical yield range. data by  .The trailing 10-year annualized growth rate on the dividend, meanwhile, is nearly 20%. That's not a realistic number to expect in the future because it includes a shift in the payout ratio from around 30% in 2008 to the 60% range more recently. However, over the trailing three years, the dividend has grown at an annualized rate of 8.6%, nearly three times  .Although Fastenal's stock price is high on an absolute level, it looks relatively cheap when you consider its growth prospects and generous 3% dividend yield. Investors looking for a mix of growth and income would do well to take a closer look at this company today, making sure to focus on its onsite business, a key growth driver and a still huge growth opportunity. At the end of the day, a fair price for a company that  is still an enticing opportunity.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"n this series, we look through the most recent  report, and then we cherry pick only those companies that have experienced insider buying within the past six months. The officers and directors of a company tend to have a unique insider's view of the business, and presumably the only reason an insider would choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money - maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both. So when stocks turn up that see insider buying, and are also top ranked, investors are wise to take notice. One such company is Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST), which saw buying by Senior Executive VP Terry Modock Owen.Back on June 6, Owen invested $103,700.00 into 2,000 shares of FAST, for a cost per share of $51.85. In trading on Wednesday, shares were changing hands as low as $55.55 per share, which is 7.1% above Owen's purchase price. Fastenal Co. shares are currently trading +0.64% on the day. The chart below shows the one year performance of FAST shares, versus its 200 day moving average:Looking at the chart above, FAST's low point in its 52 week range is $39.79 per share, with $58.735 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $56.28. By comparison, below is a table showing the prices at which insider buying was recorded over the last six months:

That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. to learn about these picks! -- Thank you, Ellen. And good morning, everybody. And thank you for participating in today's call. I realize at this stage of the economic cycle, our industry is a bit out of favor. But however, I believe we have a great story to tell. And I believe our mote is expanding in the marketplace. Let's start out by going to Holden's flipbook. If I look at some of the highlights he called out, I'll start with -- it'd be probably good if I got on the right page. I'd start with our non-residential construction business is accelerating. In June, we hit 17%. In all honesty, I don't understand the strength behind it. I know the things we've done to build momentum there. But I was very pleased with the progress we saw in the second quarter. Our manufacturing demand is stable at very healthy levels. We rolled that together. We grew our sales 13.1% in the second quarter. That's our fifth straight quarter of double digit growth. So, when I think about it, I think there's two things that are noteworthy there.One is we are growing on some good growth numbers. And I think that's a pretty strong statement. The second thing is a year ago in late March 2017, we acquired a great organization in Michigan called Mansco. We anniversaried that acquisition on March 31st. So, our growth in the second quarter was 100% organic. And we put up I think a great number. If I look at -- on the operating income side, our operating income grew 13.3%. Leverage is a beautiful thing. Our reported EPS was 74, however there was a discreet tax item in there. So, really pleased with the earnings growth we saw in the quarter and our ability to manage our expenses. Holden will touch on some of this a little bit deeper later. Onsite vending signings are on pace to achieve our 2018 targets. As mentioned, we had significant operating leverage in the second quarter including employee related expenses. And our gross margin was stable on a sequential basis, which I think was an important thing to note.And the real key to the stability from Q1 to Q2 from my perspective is we did a little bit better job using our own trucks. We've always talked about the fact that we have a great trucking network we built over the last 35 years. We have a structural advantage in the marketplace. And frankly, the marketplace is becoming increasingly more expensive. And so, our ability to divert some of our shipments off of third party carriers onto our own network serve us well in any economy. It served us really well in the second quarter. In the context of normal seasonality, our operating cashflow improved in the second quarter. We repurchased some stock. And as we announced last night, we increased our third quarter dividend from the $0.37 we had been doing in the first two quarters to $0.40. Flipping to page four of Holden's book, we signed 81 Onsites in the second quarter. That's a 19% increase over the second quarter of 2017. And we finished the quarter with 761 active sites.That's a 57% increase over last year. Our 2018 goal for Onsite signings remains somewhere between 360 and 385. Total in-market locations were 3,051 at the end of the quarter, up over the 2,937 a year ago. What you're seeing before your eyes is a morphing of the Fastenal distribution model. We are consolidating some locations throughout the marketplace, probably a little bit more in the major metros where we have a wide smattering. And some of those locations are morphing into Onsites. And so, we continue to expand our in-market presence. We signed 5,537 vending devices in the second quarter, a 13.5% increase over the second quarter of '17. Our installed base grew 14.3%. And the sales through our vending devices grew in excess of 20%. Our 2018 goal is to sign 21 to 23 thousand, and we feel good about that goal at this point. National Accounts. Our daily sales grew 19% in the second quarter. In June, we broke 20%. I have to say, that tasted pretty good.And I was proud of the team and everything they're doing to grow their business. Outside the US, our sales continued to well outpace the company, and we're seeing great results within the US and throughout the rest of the world. Before I turn it over to Holden, just wanted to share some commentary. And call this in the category of trying to be ever more transparent in what we do and what we're seeing in the marketplace. And at 7:00 this morning, Holden had his typical call with our leadership group, our regional vice presidents, our VPs that lead up support areas as well as our officers. He discussed through the earnings release to give them more insight into what we saw in the business. And he gives me a few minutes at the end to throw in a few thoughts. And I just thought I'd share with you some of the thoughts that were covered on that call. The first one we talked about with the group is we've really decided that hitting goal matters.We have hit goal -- January, we missed goal. Weather messed us up a little bit. So, we came in just shy of goal. Since February, we've hit goal every month. And we had a big goal number in June, and I was pleased to say we hit it. And in total for the first and second quarters, we hit goal. Hitting goal consistently gives you confidence to invest in where you're going. From a gross margin perspective, we maintained our gross margin. And the mantra of, ""Hey, just use our trucks,"" played out really well. We have, as I mentioned earlier, a great trucking network, and we're tapping into it a little bit more. We've been having a lot of discussions about expenses. And this is one where if I'm looking at myself in the mirror, I have to say either we're not communicating really well or you're not listening. And I think it's probably more we need to step it up on how we communicate.So, I'm taking that piece on from the standpoint -- after the first quarter, when we grew our labor expense about 14%, I got a lot of phone calls from shareholders in the sell-side community really wondering, ""What the heck's going on that you're growing your expenses so fast and you're not able to leverage?"" What we've been talking about the last two years is the investments we're making in growth drivers. We made dramatic investments in our ability to sign vending devices. We made tremendous investments in our ability to implement and improve our Onsite network. We made sizable investments a little over a year ago in our ability to grow our e-commerce locally. And the other piece is understanding the fundamentals of how we compensate. Historically, a sizable piece of conversation within Fastenal has been incentive-based. If you read our proxy, you can see that if we don't grow our earnings, our leadership better enjoy living on base pay because that's the key driver in incentive comp.In the first quarter of 2018, we added $21 million in pre-tax to our business. That was double the $11 million we had added the year before when we compare '17 to '16. That causes our incentive comp to grow quite dramatically. And if I look at the 14% labor growth in the first quarter, six points of it comes just from expanding incentive comp. One point of it comes from our Mansco acquisition. And the other seven comes from adding people in the organization. If I look at the transition from Q1 to Q2, you saw our labor expense growth drop 400 basis points from 14 to 10. What really changed there? We put a little bit of a pause on hiring. We had gotten ahead of ourselves. But that wasn't the real change. The real change was we anniversaried Mansco. And our incentive comp, while at a high level, is not disproportionately higher than second quarter of 2017 because in the second quarter of 2017, we added about $27 million in pre-tax. In the second quarter of '18, we added $31.The delta there isn't as great. So, our team throughout the organization are enjoying enhanced incentive. But they were second quarter last year. So, the comp is different. I apologize that I haven't communicated that better. But we saw a nice change in our ability to leverage. Frankly, I didn't think it was gonna happen until the third quarter. And the team did a nice job of deciding to move it up three months. If I look at the MSAs -- and I've started to talk about that more. Talked about that in the president's letter. Talked about that at our annual meeting and in previous discussions. We're really learning a lot by really taking a good look at those 100 large MSAs, communities of over half a million. What is our plan in those markets? And there was something that's jumped out for me.And this isn't an exclusive thing to the MSAs, but it stands out when I look at it from things we're doing. And so, yesterday at our board meeting, the individual that leads the e-commerce drivant -- within Fastenal, it's a relatively small business because there's so many things we do that don't lend themselves to e-commerce. We do Onsites. We do our local branch network. In many cases, we're fulfilling things for our customers that they don't even have to order. And so, e-commerce really isn't part of the Fastenal model. But one thing that's really was interesting to see is that we've been quietly building momentum in our ability to go to market in a bunch of different ways. And if I look at true, local e-commerce transactions where we're taking advantage of our last mile advantages, that's about a $100 million business, and it's growing 30% a year. I think that speaks well -- and forget the fact that it's e-commerce. It speaks well to the capabilities of the Fastenal organization to fulfill and to serve customers' needs.And the interesting thing is we're seeing really nice growth within our Onsites as well. It's about ease of doing business. And bear with me a second. I like milestones. Sometimes they're fun to point out. And this is probably a ridiculous one. But bear with me. If I go back to 1987, the year we went public, we had about 50 locations back then. We had 300 and some employees. For the year, we did just under $20.3 million. I believe it was $20,294,000 or something like that. In the month of June, on a daily basis, we broke $20.3 million. So, in June of 2018, we did more revenue every day than we did 31 years ago, that company that went public. I think that's a pretty neat milestone, and I'm proud of what our team has done in that 30-some years to accomplish that. Said another way, we're 254 times bigger than we were 31 years ago. That's kind of fun. I also thanked our regionals and our VPs and RVPs for a great quarter.I think they really the power of the Blue Team and what we can accomplish in the marketplace and some of our structural advantages. I'm blessed from the standpoint I have a wife that's not afraid to challenge me in most things in life, personal and business. And the other day, she was asking me some questions about the quarter. And I told her, ""I can't tell you because it's not public yet."" But all kidding aside, she was asking about what we're seeing from the tariffs. She said, ""You think any of your strength you're seeing is coming from the tariffs in the marketplace?"" And I answered really quickly and with confidence. I said, ""Absolutely not.""I said, ""What our business is about is we're a supply chain partner. And most of our customers are able to operate in a very lean environment because of what we do. And I don't believe there's any impact from the lift other than if there's any impact to any of our customers and their activity that would create. But there's no inventory build in the cycle from what I'm seeing,"" which caused me to immediately go to Holden and say, ""Hey, Holden. This is what I told my wife. Am I accurate?"" And he canvassed our RVP group, and he got a resounding, ""No. We're not seeing that at all."" So, I thought I'd address that in the context of the time. Second question she had which was actually just as good as the first was, ""How does Fastenal react in an environment like this?"" And I looked at her, and I said, ""Well..."" I gave her the proverbial, ""I'm a farm kid. And I learned at a young age, you don't react to the weather. You plan for it because you can't change it.""This is just like the weather. It seems to change on a daily basis. What I can tell you is Fastenal's biggest strength is our field network, our branch and Onsite network. Unlike any other regional, national, or global distributor, we source a tremendous amount of product locally. And so, we don't have a small, centralized group that has to be really agile, although they are. We have 15,000 people working in our branch and Onsite network that are agile every day. It's not easy to manage through it, but our ability to manage through it is stronger than anybody else in the marketplace. Going into a period like this, the confidence I have comes from the team we have on the ground. And that makes it pretty exciting. When I was finishing up with the RVPs this morning, I didn't say this to them because I didn't wanna get weird on the call. But I thought back to a movie -- Gene Hackman is one of my favorite actors of all time. And I thought back to a movie he made back in the early '80s called  .And at the end of the movie, he cites a line as the scene is going dark to his team that, ""I love you guys."" 22 years ago, I joined the Fastenal organization. And I didn't join because of the growth of the organization. I didn't join because of the opportunities of the marketplace. And I didn't even join because of the great people. All three of those were true. I joined because I saw in Fastenal an organization that treats people differently than other organizations I'd seen in my prior experience. And I wanted to be a part of that. In an organization where you're inclusive, and you treat others well, and you invite others to join, and the only requirement to join is a willingness to learn and change, a willingness to help each other succeed, and a willingness to be challenged by others and to be willing to challenge others to think big, when you have all that, you have a home at Fastenal. Come join us. We can do great things together.And I think you see it come through in a quarter like this and in what we're doing in the evolution of the last few years. I'll close with two thoughts, and then I'll turn it over to Holden. My mom is having a double mastectomy at 11:00 this morning. I wish her well on that. I'm gonna go visit her after the call. And Godspeed on her recovery. 60 days ago, my wife had the same surgery, and I'm proud to say that today, she looks and feels better than she ever has. So, I'm thankful for organizations like Gundersen Health down on La Crosse. Our medical in this nation can do great things. With that, I'll shut up and turn over to Holden. Thank you. -- Thank you. Good morning. Why don't we go over to slide five? As covered, the total and daily sales were up 13.1% in the second quarter. That's consistent with the growth that we logged in the first quarter of 2018. We estimate that pricing contributed between 50 and 100 basis points in the period which is also in line with last quarter. Although, we should say that this quarter did have to grow over what were modest price increases from last year's Q2. And that did mask what was some incremental progress on price in the period. The quarter finished on a healthy note with June's daily sales growing up 13.5%. This represents the 13 th straight month of organic daily sales growth ranging between 11.5% and 14.5%. And that's despite the stiffening comparisons we've seen over the period. In addition to contribution from our growth drivers as Dan discussed, this growth is supported by what remains healthy macro conditions. The PMI averaged 58.7 in the second quarter.And industrial production continued to expand at a low- to mid-single digit rate. Non-residential construction continued to accelerate for us, leading our mix this quarter with growth of 15.5%. This includes growth of 17.4% in June. Manufacturing end-markets remain stable at high levels, growing 13.3% with sustained strength in most sub-verticals. And from a product standpoint, non-fasteners were up 14.8%, and fasteners were up 11.1%. Both were in line with the first quarter levels, though it's worth noting that fasteners in June grew 13.5% which is the fastest rate we've seen this cycle. From a customer's stand  National Accounts were up 19.1% with 80 of our top 100 accounts growing. And in June, our National Accounts grew 20.4%. Growth in non-National Accounts continues to run in the mid- to high-single digits with roughly 66% of our branches growing in the second quarter.In terms of market tone, sentiment in the field remains constructive, especially as it relates to the non-residential construction market and the good demand of the past few quarters appears to be carrying into the third quarter of 2018. Now over to slide six. Our gross margin was 48.7% in the first quarter of 2018, down 110 basis points versus the second quar -- I'm sorry. Our gross margin was 48.7% in the second quarter of 2018, down 110 basis points versus the second quarter of 2017. While mix is always a factor given where we're seeing our strongest growth, it was a relatively minor factor this quarter. There were two larger impacts. In the second quarter of 2017, we had a modest price increase ahead of anticipated higher product costs. So, the large decline in the current period reflects the degree to which those costs have caught up. Higher freight expenses were also a meaningful drag on a year-over-year basis. Sequentially, on the other hand, our gross margin was flat.There were no big movers in either direction, but seasonality was offset by a little extra leverage due to the strong growth, a slightly lower mix drag, and steps to counter increasing cost of freight and imports. Price cost was slightly negative in the quarter, and there is further work to do here. We do believe we'll make further progress in coming quarters. Our operating margin was 21.2% in the second quarter of 2018, flat on a year-over-year basis. Stronger seasonal volumes and the lapping of certain cost resets generated 110 basis points of cost leverage and an incremental margin of 21.5%. Looking at the pieces, we achieved 80 basis points of leverage over general corporate expenses and occupancy related costs. The latter was up 3% with growth in vending being partly offset by flattish facility expenses. Employee related costs were up 10%.And that generated 50 basis points of leverage. We were restrained in our headcount additions this quarter with total and FTE headcount being up just 3.4% and 4.7%, respectively. This was aided further by inclusion of Mansco expenses in both periods and a moderation in the growth of incentive comp now that we have entered our second year of stronger growth. Putting it all together, the second quarter of 2018 EPS were $0.74. Though excluding a one-time tax item, this would have been $0.70 or up 36% from the second quarter of 2017. In the absence of tax reform and the lower rate that it provides to us, EPS would have been $0.59, and growth would have been 13.8. We continue to anticipate a tax rate of 24.5% to 25% absent refinements in the application of or discreet events arising from recent tax reform.Turning to slide seven, we generated $152 million in operating cash in the second quarter of 2018 or 72% of our net income. Second quarters are usually lower cash generating periods due to our having two tax payments. Still, we were pleased that the conversion rate in the current quarter was above the 57% average conversion of the past five years which reflects the lower tax rates. Based on our expectations for continued favorable cash flow, we have increased our quarterly dividend from $0.37, which we established in the first quarter of 2018 to $0.40 for the third quarter. Net capital spending in the second quarter of '18 was $25 million, bringing our year-to-date outlays to $53.8 million, consistent with the first two quarters of 2017. However, this reflects mostly timing. And we would expect higher capital spending in the second half of 2018 for expansions and upgrades at hubs and for property purchases.We've also identified a need to increase our spend for vending equipment given the strength that we're seeing in that growth driver. And as such, we are increasing our full-year of 2018 net capital spending projection to $158 million from our previous $149 million. We increased funds paid out in dividends by 15% to $106 million and repurchased $40 million in stock in the period. We finished the quarter with debt at 16% of total capital below last year and at levels that provide ample equity to invest in our business and pay our dividend which we actually increased for the third quarter. The picture for working capital was improved versus the first quarter. Inventories were up 11.4% in the second quarter of '18. Inventory on hand fell five and a half days, which we view favorably in light of inflationary pressures and plans for additional inventory investments in the field throughout 2018. Receivables grew 19.6% in the second quarter of '18, expanding days by a little more than three and a half.This continued to be affected by growth in our National Accounts and international businesses as well as customers pushing payments past quarter end. Fortunately, the intensity of this latter factor has moderated, and we have not seen any meaningful change in hard to collect balances. That's all that we have for our formal presentation. And with that, Operator, we'll take questions.Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you have a question at this time, please press the * then the No. 1 key on your telephone keypad. If your question has been answered or you wish to remove yourself from the queue, please press the # key. To prevent any background noise, we ask that you please place your line on mute once your question has been stated. Thank you. And our first question will come from the line of Ryan Cieslak with Northcoast Research. Your line is open. -- Hey. Good morning, guys. Nice quarter. -- Thank you. -- Thank you. -- The first question I had is looking at the June sales growth rate, particularly with fasteners, big acceleration there from maybe what you guys were trending in May. Dan or Holden, maybe if you could peel back the onion a little bit and think about what's ultimately driving that. Do you feel like it's a combination of both the market accelerating there but also maybe some share gains? Just trying to get a better understanding on what's driving the acceleration in fastener growth here. -- I'm not sure that I have a tremendous amount of granularity there for you. I would say that if I look at June, our fastener growth in most of our categories actually stepped up pretty nicely. And that's true of our OEM fasteners which no doubt, the Onsite growth is playing a role on that as is the general economic strength that we've seen. But construction fasteners were up quite a bit in June relative to even May as well or March or April. MRO was up as well. So, I would say that it's fairly broad. But we've definitely seen -- the same sort of acceleration that we've seen in the construction business broadly, we've seen that in the construction fasteners too. And so, I would look at it, and I would say that we're seeing stability relative to prior quarters in many categories. And then the construction piece which is accelerating broadly also. We're seeing that from the fastener component of construction too. So, that's probably what I would say about those pieces. -- Okay. Great. And then for my second question, really nice to see the operating leverage here in the quarter and the incremental margins within that range you've talked about. It feels like as you get in the back half of the year, you continue to lap some of the headwinds you saw last year from an expense standpoint. And if I hear you right, you said price cost dynamics. Maybe there's some additional opportunity there. How do we think about incremental margins then into the back half of the year? Is there anything that we should be keeping in mind from a negative standpoint or an offset that comes in that maybe keeps you at the low end of that range versus potentially getting to the higher end of that range? Thanks. -- Yeah. So, what I would say is the components that drove it in the second quarter, I think those are intact in the third quarter. And when we're talking about the occupancy leverage, the general corporate leverage, those should continue to be leverageable pieces of our overall mix. From an employee expense piece, yeah. You're right. We've lapped those resets. And that'll certainly be true in Q3. So, those pieces that led to this leverage this quarter, those are still very much intact as we go forward. You combine that with double digit revenue growth, assuming that that's what we receive in the third quarter, and I think that that is a formula to continue to make progress on the incremental margins, particularly because I would not expect the gross margin comp to be anywhere near as difficult. So, that we did 21.5 against that gross margin is fairly satisfying. And I think that where you're going with this is should we do better.We should be. I think that the math would tell you that we should do better in Q3 than we did in Q2 from an incremental margins standpoint. The one piece that I will contribute to that is the strong work that was done by everybody at Fastenal to deliver that leverage in the quarter, that does also afford us the opportunity to keep investing in growth. And so, there is the potential that we may choose to take some of that growth and reinvest it in the business to sustain the type of growth rates that we're having. But yeah. I would concur, Ryan. I think that the pieces that drove this incremental margin are still intact as you go to Q3. We shouldn't have the same difficulty with the gross margin comp. And if we continue to grow quickly, I think that the prospects for doing better on incremental margin in the back half are still pretty strong. -- Okay. Thanks. I'll get back in queue.Thank you. Our next question will come from Scott Graham with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. -- Hey. Good morning. Three questions for you all. No. 1, Holden, I harken back to the comments you made about a year ago that you have to deal with 20 to 30 basis points of gross margin headwind from mix. Is that still a number that you would go with? And maybe talk a little bit about how you will backfill in the second half on that a little bit more. Secondly -- -- Hey, Scott. Let me take them in order. And also, we're gonna take two. So, think about the second question carefully before -- -- Sure. No problem. -- As it relates to your first question, yeah. The mix elements aren't changing. Again, with National Accounts growing as quickly as they are within the mix and with the Onsites growing as quickly as they are within the mix, they continue to contribute more to our growth overall each quarter. I think this quarter, the Onsites contributed to 4% growth in our business. And a year ago, that was 3.2% Those are mix issues that we're happy to take those on. But it does push the margin down. And I still believe that 20% to 30% mix drag per year is the right number to think about. I haven't changed off those terms. -- Good. Thank you. Secondly, you've got some really good operating leverage at the operating expense line. Could you talk about the sustainability of that and how you're looking at that in the second half toward some of the incremental margin comments you made? -- Yeah. Not a lot to add versus what I just contributed. Again, the pieces that drove it this quarter, I think those pieces are intact as you go into Q3 and Q4 in terms of lapping some of these expenses. But what we won't have is we won't have the difficult gross margin comp. And so, you blend all that together, and there certainly is a path to doing better incremental margins in the third quarter and fourth quarter than what we did this quarter. The only caution I threw out there was we're afforded the opportunity to invest in our business because of the leverage that we achieved this quarter. And we might reroute some of that into sustaining the type of growth that we've enjoyed. And so, I don't have a lot to add to that. -- Well, I guess what I'm trying to get at, Holden, simply is you have this gross margin headwind. It's not gonna go away. Does that get the entire company, particularly at the regional level much more focused on their operating expenses to generate the leverage to offset that gross margin issue? -- This is Dan. I'll just chime in quick. If you go back in time, a decade ago, we were talking about the pathway to profit. And in that discussion, we talked about the inherent profitability of the Fastenal business and how that gets enhanced over time and how when I look at our most mature regions that frankly, have a higher percentage of Onsite and in many cases, national comp business than the company average, they're also our lowest operating expense businesses and typically, our highest operating margin businesses. And it comes from -- part of the expense management comes from doing -- it's hard work. You do it every day. You don't let things slip through your fingertips. You understand what's best in class across the organization. But part of it comes from the inherent leverage that comes in the Fastenal model.When the average branch is doing 120 versus 100, you pick up hundreds of points of operating margin. When it goes from 120 to 150, you pick up expense leverage. And the only partial offset to that can come from the fact that your gross margin -- typically, a branch doing 100 will lose 100 basis points of gross margin on its journey to 150 a month. But it'll also shed 450 basis points of operating expense. And your net win is a 350 point win. And so, it's really not allowing being a little bit lazy or a little bit lax on expense management today to let any of that slip through your fingertips. That academic model is what affords us to do what we're doing with Onsite. -- Thank you. -- And at the analyst day, if you recall, we showed a couple of lines. One was the gross margin declining over the past 30 years as we've invested in these growth drivers. And the other one was the SG&A's percentage of revenues declining over 30 years as we leverage. And I would just point you to -- the SG&A percentage in the first half of this year has never been lower in the history of our company. And that's how the model is supposed to work. As Dan said, this leverage came through perhaps a quarter sooner than we might have expected. But the model is working as we would have expected it to. -- Great. Thank you, both. -- Sure.Thank you. Our next question comes from David Manthey with Baird. Your line is open. -- Hey. Good morning, guys. First off, looking at that number of top 100 National Account customers experiencing growth, I guess it was 80 this quarter. And Dan, in the earlier part of this decade, I think you were talking about 75 out of 100 was normal. What is the historical low and high in that figure? -- Oh, I'm going off the hip here, Dave. So, bear with me on that. When I go back to 2015, I think we had a quarter where it got down in the 40s. And as you know, that was not helpful to our business. What I don't know here is -- obviously, we have a solid economy. We also have some growth drivers at our fingertips that either weren't there or weren't contributing at as high a level when I go back to 2015. The Onsite, as Holden mentioned has changed the game. And 75% of our Onsites are with National Account customers. I believe that's the stat. It's in the 70s. And so, we're seeing -- so, what's the cause? What's the effect? Or chicken and egg or whatever analogy you wanna use. The economy's giving lift. But are the growth drivers giving lift? The fact that our vending is operating at a really high level, that benefits all customers, including National Accounts. But 80's a really strong number. And when I go back to prior periods where we were able to grow our fasteners, especially at this kind of rate, you needed to be in the 70s. -- Okay. Maybe I'll follow up on that. But the second question for Holden, were you saying you picked up I guess $5 to $10 million year-over-year due to price? And you're saying that the price cost equation isn't quite there yet. So, I assume you're not fully recapturing your COGS increases. But am I right to assume that you're capturing enough of it that you're picking up incremental gross profit dollars, Holden? You're not getting lower gross profit dollars because you're upside down on that price cost equation, are you? -- No, we're not. We're not. Yeah, as I said, we're slightly under water just with regards to a price cost standpoint. But yeah, as we said in the first quarter, we got a little incremental pricing in the first quarter from efforts that we put into place in the fourth. We actually got incremental pricing in the second quarter over the first. That was masked a little bit because in the second quarter, we were growing over last year's modest price increases where we weren't in the first quarter. But we made some incremental progress on pricing. There was certainly some incremental moves on the inflation side as well. But yeah. We're not backwards in that regard. -- Yup. Sounds good. Thank you. -- Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie Capital. Your line is open.Hey. Good morning. The first question is just around tariffs. You mentioned they're not leading to strength. Does that mean that you didn't see any pre-buy related to tariffs? And then maybe if you could just update us what you're direct and indirect exposure is to China sourcing. -- Sure. With regards to pre-buying, I actually canvassed the RVPs this morning to get a sense of what they're seeing in the field. And it came back fairly uniformly that we really aren't seeing anything, or at least nothing's being discussed with us about pre-buying product ahead of time. Now to be fair, I'm not sure that gloves and goggles are necessarily the type of product that people load up on ahead of demand. So, we may not be that kind of product or that kind of company. But we don't believe that that is impacting our revenue growth rates in any meaningful way. As it relates to the 232 and 301, 232 at this point is just feeding inflation, generally speaking with regards to that one. As it relates to 301, I think there's a couple of threads here. One is the first $50 billion that has been talked about. There's not a huge impact on us from that. Now that we've had a chance to see how our products are being affected, I will probably stick with about $10 million of COGS perhaps being affected by that.Although, it's in places we hadn't necessarily expected, indirect shipments on things like ball bearings and welding consumables and things like that. But it's a pretty small number. I don't think particularly meaningful. And so, if it stops there, I'm not overly concerned about the direct impact to tariffs. I think the question you're really getting at is what happens with the other $200 billion, should they go into effect. And honestly, at this point, we're not sure. It's hard to speculate on that. I think you can make a case that somewhere in the neighborhood of 10% of our COGS may come from China directly and indirectly. But I'm only guessing at the indirect piece. Again, that's more art than science, figuring that one out. I don't assume that everything that we get from China will be tariffed. That would pull the impact down. And of course, we would expect to be able to shift product perhaps from China to Taiwan or Vietnam or other sources.I think one of the great values of having a significant local sourcing operation on the ground in that region is that we know where there's alternative source of product that we can shift as quickly as anybody else. And so, it's conjecture as to what the impact will be if any. You would expect that it could have an impact, but we have mechanisms and such to manage that.Great. And then just secondly, any color on just improvement in non-resi? For you, it was pretty dramatic. I know you have oil and gas in non-resi. Do you attribute it to that? And then is the margin mix on non-resi better than manufacturing? Any color there? Thank you. -- I think that the oil and gas and things around that are certainly helpful. The other thing I would point out is relative to manufacturing, we talked about how our growth has been up between organically, 11.5% and 14.5% for 13 months. That is not necessarily true of non-residential. For most of that period, our manufacturing was really driving that. If you look at the quarter a year ago in non-res, we were up about 5.5%, 6%. And so, to some extent, I think what you're seeing is an acceleration off of some easier comps. But I do think that also, we're benefiting from having injected energy over the last two or three years into the effort. If you remember, we really started talking about the tone around non-res starting to get better in March of last year. And I think that that tone transformed into actual facts on the ground in November, December of 2017.And it's just continued to run from that point. And right now, it's running against relatively easy comps. And so, that's about the color that I have for that. And from a margin standpoint, we always think about from a gross margin standpoint, construction fasteners fall somewhere in between the OEM fastener on the low end and the MRO fastener at the high end.Great. Thank you. -- Sure.Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Your line is open.Hey. Thanks. Good morning, guys. -- Good morning. -- Good morning.Congratulations on making me look completely wrong in my preview to you by the way. Nice quarter. -- Don't take it personally, Ryan.So, just to follow up on price cost, and it was slightly negative. So, I don't wanna make a big deal here. But can you just articulate for us why is price cost negative? What are the key issues there? -- Well, the key issue is that inflation continues to run very quickly. As I said, we got some incremental pricing. But the quick math is we had fee stock or product cost that was going up somewhat faster. And so, yeah. That's the environment. I don't know what more to add to it. It is inflationary for products. And that inflation has not stopped. -- I'll add just one thought to that. And I touched on this in April. I think we really started the hard press about four to five months later than we should have. We did some things last summer. Holden touched on that where we were raising some prices. Actually, in the second quarter last year, we got some nice lift in our gross margins. So, we were actually ahead of it a little bit. But in November, December time, we really should have been putting on the hard press. We have our meeting in December every year with our leadership. We should have had the hard press on. And I didn't really turn it on until April. And that's completely on me. And so, we're a little bit behind. -- And to give you a sense, in Q1, we were reacting to things. I think in Q2, we put a lot of discipline in the field just in terms of the messaging. And that messaging flowed down to the RVPs and into the field. And that was a part of that. And then in Q3, we have some additional tools that are going into the field to hopefully make this pricing process easier. And so, that's why we struggle like everyone else does with what is ramping inflation. But we believe that we continue to make incremental improvement each quarter, and I think that's gonna continue into Q3.Got it. Yeah. I'm just clarifying that it's transitory and it's not anything that's structural different than the past. It was more just being late, not passing through the pricing. So, that's good to hear. And then my second question --Okay. And then my second question, the non-National Accounts, I think you said it was up mid-single digits. And I don't think that has accelerated much -- correct me if I'm wrong -- over the past couple quarters. But my real question is is that a market growth rate? Are the smaller customers or non-National Account customers just not growing as well? Or is it just not a focus for you, and that's why the growth rate just isn't anywhere near the National Account growth rate? -- Yeah. I think there's a couple things going on. Our growth drivers, when it relates to Onsite really benefits the National Accounts and a piece of the non-national. If I think of the strength we're seeing internationally, that's much more akin to our National Accounts. Heck, our National Accounts are doing a great job. If I think of our local business, one thing that is impacting that -- and Holden, refresh me on the number. I believe our branch count is down about 6% Q2 to Q2. When we consolidate a branch in a market, historically we've talked about 65% to 70% of our business is our top ten customers in that branch. Frankly, you can retain that business without a great plan because that's a group of customers you're naturally engaging with. And you do enough business that everybody matters to each other from the standpoint of they know Fastenal's an important part of their team. And we're typically delivering the product to their backdoor.So, the fact that we're coming from a branch two miles away or seven miles away doesn't really matter. If you think of the other third of our business, so the other 35%, 5% of that is retail business. And a piece of that retail business, when you consolidate, you have a high risk of losing.Now, in a $50 thousand branch that you consolidate, there's three grand that's there. And you're gonna lose a piece of it. The other 30% of the 35%, you need to have a really good plan in place to make sure you don't lose touch with that customer because that's a customer doing $300.00, $500.00, $700.00 a month with you. And your relative importance to them might be different. And so, there, we have to have a really good plan. And so, some of the delta you're seeing, I don't think it's because it's industry growth, which it happens to be. I think it's a case of 6% of our branches disappeared. And so, there is some impact from that. Now does that account for why it's single digit versus double digit? I honestly don't know. But that comes into play. -- And Ryan, I might contribute as well. So, we are growing in the non-National Account business faster than industrial production, which I think is meaningful. In addition to what Dan talks about in terms of the branch closures, the Onsite growth -- most of our Onsites are within National Accounts, but some portion of our Onsites are not within National Accounts. And remember, we do shift revenue from a branch into an Onsite. And so, for those Onsites we sign up, maybe some of those have been serviced out of a store that wasn't a National Account business. And there might be a little bit of an impact there as well. So, there are a few pieces that are working against that number being better than what it is today. But it is outperforming industrial production. And we think the field is doing a nice job. -- And it's helped for farming the organic growth for the industry.Perfect. Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Uhlman with Cleveland research. Your line is open. -- Hi. Good morning. -- Good morning, Adam. -- Hey, I was wondering if we could cycle back to the -- -- Hey, Adam? Adam? -- Yeah? -- Good report yesterday. -- Thank you. I wanted to circle back on the investment drivers I guess as we think about the back half of the year here. We touched on it maybe a little bit. But the headcount growth has been relatively low. And it would seem as if there might be some need to add additional heads into the back half of the year to support the growth that you're seeing. And I'm just trying to understand how you guys are conceptualizing that investment spend into headcount. Could it be only a couple of points of extra growth? Or is there something where we should be expecting a bigger ramp? -- The message we've had to the team is where you're signing Onsites, where you have business growth, add people. And we've been investing at a pretty healthy clip. And as I mentioned, by the first quarter, in all honesty, we probably got a little bit ahead of ourself. And so, we just put a pause on. We didn't stop hiring. We put a pause on. But if you actually drift into the weeds a little bit, you'd see that from a pure headcount standpoint, there was more drop in the part-time than there was in the fulltime. So, the loss of hours and energy wasn't as great. The other thing is as we migrate to a bigger and ever bigger piece of our business being Onsite, we become more efficient. If I think about some time ago -- and I forget the exact time. It was a little over a year ago.We took over the hosting of our vending network. What that afforded us to do is to interconnect the vending information much more directly into our point of sales system. So, the lift, the workload for servicing vending, while it's still sizable and we're doing things every day that make it a little bit more efficient, it's much more efficient today than it would have been 12 months ago because the interconnectedness within our point of sales system and our trajectory system that runs the vending platform is much more seamless today. But we will continue to add headcount to support our growth. But we're working against comps that are really different. And that really is what speaks to Holden's confidence in our ability to achieve leverage. -- Okay. Got you. And then secondarily, thanks for the disclosure on the e-commerce business. That's a lot of incremental revenue off of a small base. I was just wondering if you could touch on anything new or different that you're doing there relative to what you've talked about in the past. And how big do you think it could get for you within your current business model? Thanks. -- Yeah. At this point, on the last part of your question, I'd be just posing a wild guess. And my wild guess would be, frankly, no better than anybody else's wild guess. But to the part about what we're doing different, for three years, our e-commerce was negative. Nominal. And it was a relatively small business because it wasn't an emphasis point. We started investing in resources into our team early part of 2017. And we added an RESS. And I hope I have the acronym right. Help me out, Holden. Regional e-commerce sales specialist. -- There you go. -- Okay. And it's a small team. But really, what they're about is engaging with our branch network, our Onsite network to go out and drive that. Our IT team is operating at a higher level today than I've ever seen in my 22 years. What the team has put in place -- we've always had great talent, but we weren't always able to muster up the resources to do great things. And right now, we're doing some great things. And the system they put in place that we -- we rolled out what we call FAST 360 a year ago. And that's really a visibility tool for our customers to see what's on their plant floor, whether it's in a vending machine or in a bin stock location. So many times historically, customers don't know always what's in their facility because a lot of what we sell is coined MRO. So, when it's bought, it's expense. So, there's no visibility to where stuff is. Even on the OEM side, most ERP systems don't give you the level of visibility to know where stuff is.Our FAST 360 does that for our customers. And we rolled that out a year ago. And that's growing nicely in our business. And it works out really well in our Onsites as well. The team is really leveraging that start and our same day capabilities at our branch network to really tap into -- we can do today what many companies aspire to do. And we've connected some of the dots electronically to do it. But I don't wanna get ahead of myself. It's still a relatively small number, but we're tapping into making it easier to buy from us. Today, 90% of our sales go through an omnichannel, goes through -- we have 10% of our sales where the customer buys through one channel. And that's typically our retail business and our what we call tier one customers. So, relatively small customers that interact with us only at the branch level. But when you start layering in where you source at the branch through an Onsite, through vending, through a bin stock, internationally, e-commerce, and put all those together, that's 90% of our revenue.So, we're doing things today and we have been naturally for years what other companies aspire to do. And you're just seeing it shine through because we have a group that has a really good plan, and they're executing to it. But it's still a relatively small part of the business, and I have the foggiest idea where it'll go to. -- Best of luck to your mom and wife. -- Thank you. With that, I see that we're at just a few minutes before the hour. I hope I'm not cutting anybody off who had a question. But thanks again for your interest this morning. And I do sincerely believe we have a great story to tell. The Blue Team is blessed with great people. And I believe we do something special for our customers, and they recognize it, and it affords us the ability to grow.

 (NASDAQ:  ) stock was on the rise Wednesday following the release of its earnings report for the second quarter of 2018. Source: ShutterstockFastenal Company reported earnings per share of 74 cents during the second quarter of the year. This is an increase over its earnings per share of 52 cents from the same time last year. It was also good news for FAST stock by coming in above Wall Street's earnings per share estimate of 66 cents for the quarter.According to the company, there are a couple of factors to thank for its higher earnings per share in the second quarter of the year. This includes discrete tax items and a lower tax rate from the Tax Act in the U.S. The company says these two factors represent a benefit of 15 cents to its earnings per share for the quarter.During the second quarter of 2018, Fastenal Company reported net income of $211.20 million. The fastener distributor company's net income from the second quarter of 2017 was $148.90 million.Fastenal Company's earnings report for the second quarter of the year also includes operating income of $269.00 million. This is up from its operating income of $237.50 million that was reported in the same period of the year prior.Fastenal Company also reported revenue of  for the second quarter of 2018.

e're still pretty quiet here on the Western front, awaiting the deluge of Q2 earnings results that begins with the spigot opening for big banks - JPMorgan  , Citigroup  and Wells Fargo  among them Friday - before opening up to the publicly traded industries at large, starting next week. Though we do have a new economic read worth looking at.June Producer Price Index (PPI) numbers have hit the tape this morning, posting gains of 0.3% on the headline - 10 basis points hotter than expected, though still down from the +0.5% reported in May. Interestingly, subtracting the often-volatile food and energy costs we still see a tally of 0.3%. Year over year, this ex-food & energy number is 2.8%, higher than the 2.6% expected and the 2.4% in the previous read.This indicates that producer pricing is experiencing inflation - though still relatively slow, especially in light of historically low unemployment (which usually leads to spiking wage increases) and a Q2 GDP number some analysts expect to reach 4% or higher. If the PPI continues to ramp up at sub-3% levels considering everything else going on in the economy, we can still behave as if we're Goldilocks - enjoying that which is not too hot, not too cold.Also this morning, although not a marquee name nor a fixture on the S&P 500 (let alone the Dow 30),  - a $14 billion market-cap manufacturing company which develops and markets fasteners for all sorts of Construction and Manufacturing goods - outperformed expectations on both top and bottom lines ahead of the opening bell. Earnings of 74 cents per share on $1.27 billion topped estimates of 66 cents and $1.26 billion, respectively. The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company rose initially 7.5% upon the release of its Q2 report, settling back to gains of roughly 6.6% a half hour ahead of the market open.

 has acquired Atlas Supply Inc., a major distributor of sealants, coatings, adhesives and related waterproofing products in the Pacific Northwest. The financial terms of the deal are not yet disclosed.Operating since 1917, Seattle-based Atlas has expanded its footprint to six locations, with stores in Seattle, Tacoma, Spokane, and Mountlake Terrace in Washington, as well as Portland, Oregon and Boise, Idaho.Based in Herndon, VA, Beacon roofing operates 551 branches in all 50 states and in 6 provinces in Canada. The addition of Atlas to Beacon's portfolio enabled it to serve customers along the entire west coast as well as a portion of the Southwest. The deal is in sync with the company's strategy to grow its strong margin complementary products business.In January 2018, Beacon acquired CRH plc's  U.S. distribution business, Allied Building Products Corp. for $2.6 billion. The buyout not only expands its product offerings, but also increases geographical reach in both existing and new markets, while ensuring significant cost synergies.Notably, Dublin, Ireland-based CRH is the largest building materials company in North America and second largest worldwide. Its subsidiary, Allied Building Products is one of the country's largest exterior and interior building products distributors. It distributes exterior products such as roofing, siding, windows and doors, as well as interior products such as wallboard and suspended ceiling systems, across 208 locations in 31 states.In addition to growing roofing supplies business, Allied Building added a wallboard and acoustical ceiling tile wholesale business to Beacon, making it the fourth largest distributor of such products in the United States, with more than $1 billion of revenues in the interior market category.Robust construction activity, given strong economic fundamentals and solid job market, bodes well for Beacon. The company remains optimistic of a strong macroeconomic backdrop for new construction and home improvement, as well as its growth initiatives. In the last reported quarter, residential roofing product sales were up around 20% year over year. Non-residential roofing product sales registered 36% growth and complementary product sales increased a whopping 263%, both on a year-over-year basis.Shares of Beacon have underperformed its industry year to date. While Beacon plunged 37.7%, its  registered 3.6% growth in the said period. Moreover, earnings estimates have trended downward by 1.2% for the current fiscal and 1.1% for the next, over the past 30 days. Moreover, the negative impact of price/cost timing on gross margins during the first half of fiscal 2018 is a significant hurdle.In the fiscal second-quarter , this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company lowered its adjusted EBITDA view for fiscal 2018. Consistent with adjusted EBITDA reduction, the company also reduced its adjusted EPS view. It lowered the guided range from $3.40-$3.70 to $3.35-$3.55 for the fiscal.That said, the latest Atlas addition as well as higher contribution from the Allied Building Products acquisition, and successful price increases associated with a solid demand environment are expected to support Beacon's growth.Some better-ranked stocks in the same sector include Builders FirstSource, Inc.  and Fastenal Company  , each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see  .Builders FirstSource has an estimated earnings growth of 47.2% for the current year.Fastenal's 2018 earnings are expected to grow 32.6%.It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The  (DJINDICES: ^DJI) and the  (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) both fell throughout the day.Data source: Yahoo! Finance.Materials stocks were hit hard; the  (NYSEMKT: XME) dropped 2.1%. The defensive utility sector was the only portion of the market in the green, with the  (NYSEMKT: XLU) closing the day up 0.9%.Among individual companies making news,  (NASDAQ: FAST) reported strong profits, while amusement park operator  (NYSE: FUN) announced a disappointing drop in early season attendance.Image source: Getty Images.Shares of industrial supply company Fastenal soared 10.1% after the company reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings and strong sales trends. Net sales increased 13.1% to $1.27 billion, about what observers were expecting. Earnings per share jumped 42% to $0.72; analysts had been expecting $0.66.The sales gains were driven by increases in underlying demand as well as by the success of Fastenal's growth initiatives. Daily sales growth in the non-residential construction end market accelerated with a 15.5% increase, and its sales to manufacturing customers grew 13.3%. Sales figures released for the month of June showed that Fastenal's business was gaining momentum late in the quarter, with non-residential construction daily sales up 17.4%, manufacturing sales gaining 14%, and total daily sales up 13.5%.Gross margin fell 1.1 percentage points year over year, the continuation of a trend that had created concern  , but the metric held steady sequentially at 48.7%. Operating margin, however, was flat from Q2 last year, thanks to  . Earnings benefited from the new tax law by $0.15 per share.Fastenal is reaping the benefits of its strategy of giving customers immediate access to its products when they're needed. It's installing vending machines with parts on customer sites, and sales through those machines increased more than 20% in Q2. It also has increased onsite locations -- sales and service employees on or near customer sites -- 56.6% since last year, helping daily sales to national accounts to climb by 19.1% in the quarter and 20.4% in June.Amusement park operator Cedar Fair announced a decline in revenue due to decreased attendance compared with last year and shares plummeted 7.9%.Revenue for the year through July 8 was down 2% to $563 million, and the 11.1 million guest visits was 314,000 (or 3%) fewer than last year at this time. Average in-park spending per capita was $45.87, exceeding the $45.41 per capita that guests spent through the July Fourth holiday last year. The $10 million decline in revenue was partly offset by a $2 million increase in out-of-park revenues, including resort accommodations.The period represents about 40% of Cedar Fair's total operating days in the year, but the majority of its revenue is still to come in the peak vacation period of July to August.""Although early season attendance at our seasonal parks through this past weekend has not met our expectations, we are encouraged by the positive guest response to our new rides and attractions, in particular our new coasters Steel Vengeance at Cedar Point and Hang Time at Knott's Berry Farm,"" said CEO Richard Zimmerman in the press release. ""We are also pleased with the growth of in-park guest spending where we are seeing year-over-year increases in food, merchandise and extra charge attractions.""Although the Cedar Fair expects attendance growth and higher guest spending in the second half, the company guided to full-year revenue of between $1.34 billion and $1.38 billion, below analysts' consensus estimate of $1.39 billion, which added to the gloom around the stock Wednesday.Motley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.

"lobal stock markets were back on the defensive as the impending trade war between the US and China rattled investors. Another round of trade tariffs against Chinese imports threw China's Shanghai Composite index to its lowest level in two-and-a-half years and drove Dow futures almost 200 points lower before Wednesday's opening bell. Industrials and metals-based stocks were hardest hit, while safe-havens appreciated.Panic selling erupted overnight after Washington unveiled plans to place a 10% tax on another $200 billion in products imported from China. Although the tariffs won't take effect until Aug. 30, leaving time for US and China trade representatives to hammer out a deal, Beijing said the action was ""totally unacceptable"" and left it little choice but to retaliate.Accordingly, US stock futures erased Tuesday's gains as trade war concerns overshadowed the good will building ahead of Q2 earnings from the banking sector on Friday.Selling pressure was also magnified by inflation data. The June producer price index increased by 0.3%, slightly higher than what was expected, while the core index was up an as-expected 0.3%.

It's right there in the name: Fasten. All. Whatever you might need to fasten together to build a house, for example -- be it a screw or a bolt, a nut or a washer,  (NASDAQ: FAST) makes it. And as we found out in its second-quarter 2018 earnings report, released this morning, Fastenal makes a lot of money providing useful parts and services to the construction and manufacturing industries.Earnings for the quarter came in at $0.72 per share, $0.06 ahead of Wall Street's expectations, and that unexpectedly good result is lifting Fastenal shares as much as 10% as of 2:10 p.m. EDT.Things are pointing up for Fastenal stock. Image source: Getty Images.Fastenal took in $1.3 billion in sales last quarter, 13% more than in the year-ago quarter. Gross margins on those sales dipped a bit, but thanks to timely cost-cutting, Fastenal was able to hold its operating profit margin steady at 21.2%, expand its net profit margin, and thus grow net earnings 43% to $0.74 per diluted share.Roughly $0.15 of those profits owed to the beneficial effects of tax reform, but even without that benefit, profits would have grown a healthy 13% -- in line with sales growth.Management didn't provide earnings guidance for the rest of the year, but according to Yahoo! Finance data, analysts expect $2.49 per share in total profit for the current year -- 30% better than last year's showing. Thanks to this unexpectedly strong Q2 report, Fastenal is now more than halfway toward reaching its goal, with $1.34 earned in the year's first six months, and only $1.15 more to go.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

 is scheduled to report second-quarter 2018 results on Jul 11, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, the company's earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. In fact, it surpassed expectations in only one of the trailing four quarters, with the average being 1%.Fastenal is expected to benefit from its core product offerings like Onsite Locations/vending machines/managed inventory. Meanwhile, continued construction tailwinds are also expected to act as a major growth catalyst.However, higher product and freight expenses, along with changes in product and customer mix raise concerns. | Let's take a look at the factors, which might affect the company's results in the second quarter. Fastenal's sales in the last few quarters have been driven by an increased installation of industrial vending machines. Sales through vending machines grew at or near a double-digit pace in each of the trailing four quarters of 2017. Then again, as of Mar 31, 2018, Fastenal operated 73,561 vending machines, up 14.2% from the year-ago quarter. During the first quarter, the company signed 5,679 machine contracts, up 4.5% year over year. A consistent increase in the number of on-site locations is likely to strengthen Fastenal's market share and boost quarterly numbers. Sales growth through Onsite was 22% in 2017. During the first quarter of 2018, Fastenal signed 100 new Onsite locations, up 56.3% from 64 signings a year ago. As of Mar 31, 2018, the company had 678 active sites, up 55.1% from the prior-year quarter. The trend is expected to continue in the second quarter of 2018 as well. Fastenal aims to achieve 360-385 onsite signings in 2018, reflecting an increase from 270 signings in 2017. Fastenal's acquisition of some assets of industrial and fastener supply distributor - Manufacturer's Supply Company (Mansco) - in March 2017 fortified its presence in the markets, in which it did not significantly contribute in the past.Backed by sustained strength in most of its end markets, as well as strong momentum in vending machine installations and onsite locations, the company is expected to report impressive top- and bottom-line growth in the second quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.26 billion, implying 12% year over year growth.However, we are apprehensive about Fastenal's changes in product and customer mix that have been hurting the gross margin for quite some time. Freight and product cost inflation also added to the woes. Overall, the consensus estimate for earnings is pegged at 66 cents, reflecting an improvement of 26.9% on a year-over-year basis.Fastenal does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients - a positive  and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher - to increase the odds of an earnings beat. You can see  .You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . Fastenal has an Earnings ESP of -1.70%.

" company's own top management tend to have the best inside view into the business, so when company officers make major buys, investors are wise to take notice. Presumably the only reason an insider would take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock of their company in the open market, is that they expect to make money - maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both. So in this series we look at the largest insider buys by the ''top brass'' over the trailing six month period, one of which was a total of $103.7K by Terry Modock Owen, Senior Executive VP at Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST).
  
Owen's average cost works out to $51.85/share. In trading on Tuesday, bargain hunters could buy shares of Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST) and achieve a cost basis lower than Owen, with shares changing hands as low as $49.14 per share. Shares of Fastenal Co. were changing hands at $49.44 at last check, trading down about 0.4% on Tuesday. The chart below shows the one year performance of FAST shares, versus its 200 day moving average:Looking at the chart above, FAST's low point in its 52 week range is $39.79 per share, with $58.735 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $49.44.The current annualized dividend paid by Fastenal Co. is $1.48/share, currently paid in quarterly installments, and its most recent dividend ex-date was on 04/24/2018. Below is a long-term dividend history chart for FAST, which can be of good help in judging whether the most recent dividend with approx. 3.0% annualized yield is likely to continue.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Top Buys by Top Brass: Senior Executive VP Owen's $103.7K Bet on FAST@2018-07-10@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/top-buys-top-brass-senior-executive-vp-owens-1037k-bet-fast-2018-07-10
Earnings season is upon us again - and it's a big one. The market has traded sideways for several months now, and a solid batch of earnings reports could be just the catalyst to move broad markets back to new all-time highs.Of late, investors have alternated between optimism toward a strong U.S. economy and fears about  and  . Moving the headlines to what should be at worst a solid earnings season could be good news for U.S. equities.After all, there's still a lot to like. Lower tax rates will help the majority of reporting companies. The economy looks like it's at - or getting very close to - full employment. The effect of inflation in areas like labor and commodities bears watching, and could pressure margins and profit growth. But overall it seems like the majority of earnings reports should be good news.This week kicks off the season - led by several key financials. But leaders in both the consumer and industrial spaces should also signal the health of their respective sectors. Strong reports from these five companies could send their stocks higher and also give investors reason for confidence heading into the next few weeks. Tuesday, before market open (NASDAQ:  ) has had a roller-coaster 2018. As of late January, PEP stock traded at an all-time high. By early May, it reached a 29-month low. An ugly start to the year for consumer products stocks was a key culprit. Not even  could stem the bleeding.Pepsi stock has rallied into earnings, however, rising 14% from those May lows. It can keep the momentum going with another beat on Tuesday. But caution might be advised. CPG stocks have struggled this year -  , as I wrote in May. The new Bubly line, meant to compete with LaCroix from  (NASDAQ:  ), needs to be a win - and may not be. Declining soda consumption, particularly relative to diet varieties, presents another long-term headwind.PEP has outperformed rival  (NYSE:  ) for years now. It may still do so going forward. But given the pressures on the industry, that doesn't necessarily mean PEP stock is going up … either on Tuesday or beyond. Wednesday, before market openOne sector that has been notably weak this year has been construction. Distributor  (NASDAQ:  ) could buoy the space with strong results on Wednesday morning.After all, FAST sales are a key data point relative to demand from builders and contractors. As such, it's possible that a good quarter for Fastenal could do as much - if not more - to help other stocks than its own. Strong revenue results will suggest confidence from Fastenal's suppliers and a continuation of solid growth in the industry.And with those suppliers not threatened by  (NASDAQ:  ), investors might see less risk in them. FAST does trade at a seven-month low, so a good report can help its own stock. But investors across the sector will be watching closely as well. Friday, before market openAfter a huge post-election run, financials have weakened - and that includes  (NYSE:  ). JPM actually trades at a seven-month low at the moment.It's difficult to see why. Fed rate hikes, which should help net interest margin for JPM and other banks, seem likely to be on the expected pace. Federal Reserve stress tests went well, leading Josh Enomoto to recommend JPM as one of  .I agree with Enomoto; I  back in March. I still like  (NYSE:  )  , but investors can't go wrong with JPM, either. And a strong earnings report on Friday should remind investors why this is a stock worth owning long-term. Friday, before market openFor  (NYSE:  ), Friday's Q2 release will be less about what the company is doing right - and more about what it's doing  . Wells continues to struggle with its  , with the Fed deciding back in February to  as a result.Strong numbers will help the stock's cause. But the quarter - and the earnings call - will be more about restoring investor confidence. Wells Fargo's largely new management will try and make the case that the bank is headed in the right direction.On that front, I'm still skeptical. Particularly with JPM and BAC on sale, there are simply  in the financial space. It will take quite a bit from Wells Fargo's Q2 report to suggest that past failures truly are behind the company. Friday, before market open (NYSE:  ) similarly has taken a hit of late. The stock actually touched an 11-month low last month before a modest rebound. And the low price sets up a potentially interesting report of its own on Friday morning.After all, C stock looks like the cheapest of the big banks. It still trades below book value and at barely 9x 2019 EPS estimates. A  will add to buybacks and move the stock's dividend yield to nearly 2.7%.But Citi has its  to worry about. It still feels much more like a turnaround play than JPM or BAC. It's not executing as well as those peers in either consumer or investment banking.That leaves room for upside if Citigroup can improve its operations. That's what investors will be watching for on Friday - and if they like what they hear, C stock could become a near-term outperformer.Discovered almost by accident, Louis Navellier's incredible trading breakthrough has delivered 148 double- and triple-digit winners over the last 5 years - including a stunning 487% win in just 10 months.Learn to use this formula and you can start turning every $10,000 invested  . to review Louis' urgent presentation.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@5 Earnings Reports to Watch This Week@2018-07-09@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/5-earnings-reports-to-watch-this-week-2018-07-09

Let's see what's in store for Conagra this time around. | Conagra is likely to continue gaining from its value-over-volume strategy, which is aimed at driving the top line. Under this regime, Conagra ensures that its robust volume performance is not driven by price discounts but by stronger innovation, as well as new merchandising, distribution and consumer trail-related investments.For instance, new investments to strengthen frozen business will likely boost sales of Refrigerated & Frozen segment, going forward. On the other hand, brand renovation initiatives, executed to reinforce snacks business, would likely aid in improving Grocery & Snacks segment's near-term sales. Moreover, the company believes favorable foreign currency translation impact will bolster its revenues in the quarters ahead. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of Grocery & Snacks and Refrigerated & Frozen segments are pegged at $789 million and $671 million, compared to the year-ago period tally of $749 million and $640 million, respectively.We also expect acquisitions to keep benefiting Conagra's sales. Incidentally, buyouts of brands like Angie's, Sandwich Bros, and Duke's and Bigs fueled third-quarter fiscal 2018 sales growth by 240 basis points. We expect these factors to augment Conagra's fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 top line, thereby continuing the year-over-year growth trend.However, Conagra's gross margin remained under pressure in the fiscal third quarter, due to increased cost of sales (mainly above the line marketing investments) and input cost inflation (of 3.7%). Input cost inflation mainly stemmed from higher packaging and transportation expenses.Though SG&A expenses and A&P costs reduced year over year, gross margin contraction more than offset these factors and led to lower adjusted operating margin. Unfortunately, input cost inflation is likely to remain a hurdle in the quarter to be reported. Nevertheless, focus on innovations and efforts to boost top line should help offset these hurdles and cushion the bottom line, which is also likely to gain from lower tax rates.Analysts polled by Zacks expect total revenues of $1,939 million, up more than 4% from the year-ago period. The current consensus mark for earnings is pegged at 43 cents, which shows a 16.2% jump from the year-ago period. The estimate remained unchanged in the past 30 days.However, our proven model doesn't show that Conagra is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter. For this to happen, the stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  .Though Conagra has an Earnings ESP of +0.39%, the company carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We caution against sell-rated stocks going into earnings announcement.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat:Helen of Troy Limited  has an Earnings ESP of +3.57% and carries a Zacks Rank #2. You can see  .Fastenal Company  , a Zacks #3 Ranked stock, has an Earnings ESP of +1.32%.Pepsico, Inc.  , a Zacks #3 Ranked company, has an Earnings ESP of +0.15%.Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.

"here's an old saying on Wall Street about insider buying: there are many possible reasons to sell a stock, but only one reason to buy. Back on April 25, Fastenal Co.'s Director, Michael J. Ancius, invested $22,181.25 into 455 shares of FAST, for a cost per share of $48.75. Bargain hunters tend to pay particular attention to insider buys like this one, because presumably the only reason an insider would take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock of their company in the open market, is that they expect to make money. In trading on Tuesday, bargain hunters could buy shares of Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST) and achieve a cost basis even cheaper than Ancius, with shares changing hands as low as $48.60 per share. Fastenal Co. shares are currently trading down about 2.8% on the day. The chart below shows the one year performance of FAST shares, versus its 200 day moving average:Looking at the chart above, FAST's low point in its 52 week range is $39.79 per share, with $58.735 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $48.67. By comparison, below is a table showing the prices at which  was recorded over the last six months:
  
The current annualized dividend paid by Fastenal Co. is $1.48/share, currently paid in quarterly installments, and its most recent dividend ex-date was on 04/24/2018. Below is a long-term dividend history chart for FAST, which can be of good help in judging whether the most recent dividend with approx. 3.0% annualized yield is likely to continue.According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, FAST makes up 1.84% of the First Trust Materials AlphaDEX Fund ETF (Symbol: FXZ) which is trading lower by about 1.7% on the day Tuesday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@FAST Trading Below Director's Recent Buy Price@2018-05-01@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/fast-trading-below-directors-recent-buy-price-2018-05-01
"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the WisdomTree U.S. Dividend ex-Financials Fund ETF (Symbol: DTN), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $97.39 per unit.With DTN trading at a recent price near $87.56 per unit, that means that analysts see 11.23% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of DTN's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Packaging Corp of America (Symbol: PKG), Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST), and Emerson Electric Co. (Symbol: EMR). Although PKG has traded at a recent price of $114.14/share, the average analyst target is 13.70% higher at $129.78/share. Similarly, FAST has 11.54% upside from the recent share price of $50.88 if the average analyst target price of $56.75/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting EMR to reach a target price of $77.12/share, which is 11.45% above the recent price of $69.20.

Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past.

ooking at the universe of stocks we cover at  , in trading on Tuesday, shares of Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST) were yielding above the 3% mark based on its quarterly dividend (annualized to $1.48), with the stock changing hands as low as $48.52 on the day. Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return. To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) back on 12/31/1999 - you would have paid $146.88 per share. Fast forward to 12/31/2012 and each share was worth $142.41 on that date, a decrease of $4.67/share over all those years. But now consider that you collected a whopping $25.98 per share in dividends over the same period, for a positive total return of 23.36%. Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.6%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 3% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable. Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST) is an S&P 500 company, giving it special status as one of the large-cap companies making up the S&P 500 Index.In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Fastenal Co., looking at the history chart for FAST below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 3% annual yield.    According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, FAST makes up 1.76% of the First Trust Materials AlphaDEX Fund ETF (Symbol: FXZ) which is trading lower by about 3.2% on the day Tuesday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Fastenal (FAST) Shares Cross 3% Yield Mark@2018-04-24@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/fastenal-fast-shares-cross-3-yield-mark-2018-04-24

"hares of Home Depot  opened lower on Tuesday after the company reported its first quarter financial results. But while the home improvement retailer might have disappointed some investors, its performance, outlook, and current valuation are actually rather attractive.Home Depot reported adjusted earnings of $2.08 per share, which marked a roughly 24.5% climb from the year-ago period and also topped our Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 cents. The opposite end of the income statement is what left some investors nervous about Home Depot. The company's Q1 revenues fell short of our $25.20 billion estimate, but did pop by 4.4% to reach $24.95 billion.Clearly, a top line miss isn't a good thing for Home Depot. With that said, if we dive a little deeper investors will see that there is a lot to be pleased with when evaluating Home Depot stock at the moment.Despite the fact that Home Depot posted lower-than-expected quarterly revenues, the company's same-store sales were encouraging. The retailer's comp sales jumped 4.2%, while U.S. comps popped 3.9%. Both of those are relatively solid for a company of Home Depot's size and age. Investors did likely compare Home Depot's comp growth to the year-ago period when the company's same-store sales climbed 5.5%, with U.S. stores up 6%.There is however a somewhat obvious reason for this year-over-year decline that was out of Home Depot's control.The weather throughout most of North America-where a large chunk of its roughly 2,200 retail stores are located-has been rough, which means spring-based home improvement shopping was subdued. ""We are pleased by the strength of our business despite a slow start to the spring selling season,"" CEO Craig Menear said in a company statement.Home Depot now expects fiscal 2018 revenues will surge by roughly 6.7%, which is almost directly in line with our current estimate that calls for full-year sales of $107.62 billion. This marks a significant increase from the 4.6% full-year sales growth Home Depot projected in the prior-year period.Meanwhile, the company projects its comp sales will climb by approximately 5%, which also tops Home Depot's 2017 full-year same-store sales guidance in the year-ago quarter. Both of these estimates help underscore the fact that Home Depot's first quarter ticket sales popped 5.8%, helping offset a 1.3% decline in overall customer transactions.The Atlanta-based company also reaffirmed its full-year earnings guidance that calls a 28% surge to touch $9.31 per share.Investors also need to take a look at Home Depot's recent price movement as well as its current valuation picture to help understand if the stock might be worth considering despite some Q1-based skepticism.Before Tuesday's dip, shares of Home Depot were up roughly 19% over the last year, topping the S&P 500's 13.8% climb. HD's gains look even better compared to its peer group's 9.1% decline-this group features both Lowe's  and Fastenal  . Investors should also note that Home Depot has crushed the S&P 500 over the last five years, up 145% compared to the index's 68% climb.Moving on, Home Depot is currently trading at 19.8X forward 12-months earnings estimates. Over the last year, HD has traded as high as 23.5X and as low as 18X. Coming into Tuesday, Home Depot was trading at a roughly 16% discount compared to where it stood in the middle of January.Home Depot stock has traded at a premium compared to its industry's average during the last year. The home improvement power's stock is also currently trading a premium against Lowe's-which is trading at 15.3X.With that said, Home Depot has consistently traded at a premium compared to its largest direct competitor since May 2015. Therefore, investors clearly have reasons to value Home Depot's future earnings over Lowe's over the last few years.Home Depot might have fallen just a bit short of top-line estimates in the first quarter. But its growth was still solid and its 2018 outlook compares favorably against the same period last year. The company's bottom line is also expected to expand at a healthy rate in 2018. Furthermore, HD's current valuation appears to be fair, if not attractive.Clearly, Home Depot stock is certainly worth considering, especially after its stock price dipped following its Q1 earnings release.It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it.

I would now like to turn the call over to Mr.Dan Florness. -- Good morning, everybody. and thank you for joining our first-quarter conference call. To sum up the quarter, I believe we had a good quarter in the first quarter 2018. We had some unusual weather as the quarter laid out, and we had the distinction of ending the quarter on Good Friday, which, while a business day, is often a muted business day.Last year, if you recall, Good Friday was in the month of April. Weather hit us hard in the quarter. And probably the best way to convey the impact of weather is to think about it from the standpoint of what my kids endure during the winter, and that is days that the school is closed because there's no bus running and to think about it from the context of our semi fleet and the number of routes we run and the impact to those routes. So we run about 4,800 routes per month.So in the quarter, we ran about 14,500 routes across our branch and Onsite network throughout North America. In the first quarter of 2017, we had about 200 routes that were canceled, so just under 1.5% of our routes were canceled due to weather impacts. In the first quarter of 2018, the number of canceled routes increased by 65% to 332, so about 2.3% canceled. Much of that product ends up getting to the branch on a different route or maybe through a third party.Unfortunately, that's usually a more expensive trip. Some of that product ends up not being sold because the customer was shut down that day or the business was impacted in some way. Three geographic areas jump out to me when I think of the first quarter. The first one probably doesn't surprise anybody on the call.Scranton, Pennsylvania, which services basically from Pittsburgh up to New England and down into the Maryland-D.C. area. They had a 50% -- excuse me -- they represented 50% of our cancellations in the quarter and their cancellation rate was about three times what it was a year ago. And for those of you who live on the East Coast, you're probably not surprised by that comment.Interestingly enough, about 7% of our cancellations occurred in Atlanta, Georgia, routes coming down into Florida, west toward Mississippi and Alabama and north into the southern part of the Carolinas. The -- normally, that area has no cancellations. So about 7% of our cancellations were there. Probably the only area that had improved weather from a year ago was our Seattle, Washington, D.C.or the Pacific Northwest. Their cancellations were 1%. Unfortunately, we do a lot more business in the other areas than we do in the Pacific Northwest. So I feel the 13.2% to be solid growth.Our pre-tax growth, and I'll break -- I'll talk about pre-tax a little bit more than net earnings because of the noise of the tax reform act. Pretax earnings grew about 10%. Frankly, not horribly impressive in the context of a 13% sales growth. Similar to -- speaking of tax reform, similar to the fourth quarter of 2017, we realized a P&L benefit of the tax reform act.About 85% of our business occurs in the United States, so anything that changes the tax rate in the United States, it's incredibly meaningful to our business. That lifted our quarter, provided about a $0.10 benefit to our quarter, and our earnings per share grew about 31% on that 10% pre-tax growth. Growth drivers. Despite the fact that I'm not overly impressed with our 10% earnings growth, I'm incredibly impressed with our growth drivers in the quarter, but more to that when I get to Slide No.4. I'm still on Slide No. 3. Leverage.It's all about gross profit. I think we're doing a respectful job managing our operating expenses. There's always some things we can improve upon, but it's about gross profit. And this quarter, despite the fact that our gross profit is down roughly 70 basis points from a year ago, I think there's some really good stories within the number and there's some things we need to fix.When I think of our growth drivers and I look at Onsite, we're doing a very nice job of managing our gross margin within that business, within Fastenal, despite the fact there is inflation going on and despite the fact we're rapidly ramping up that business. So I think we're managing that very well and our gross profit was pretty steady from Q1 to Q1. Within our vending business, about a 12-year-old business for us, again, similar to the story in Onsite, we're doing a nice job managing our gross margin there. In fact, we saw a slight uptick in our vending in the local business, offset a little bit by the national accounts, but very nice job there.I think we're doing a nice job managing our gross margin in the national accounts. Again, I say that in the context, as you all know, there's meaningful inflation going on in our business and if we don't stay ahead of it, we can run into some problems on the gross-margin line. But two things that stand out for me, which, in my estimation, cost us about $3 million this quarter, center on habits at the local level and that's habits within our fastener business. So, as you all know, about 50% of our business is national account.And if you add large regional accounts on to there, that number moves closer to 60%. Within our local book of business, we do a fair amount of fastener business, about 15% of our revenue that's completely priced and driven locally, and then we have a sizable number in non-fasteners as well. In the non-fasteners, our margin there is treading water, and we're doing a nice job managing that component. In the local fastener business, we are seeing inflation in that product.Unfortunately, in that business, we're not matching the inflation in our sell price and we gave up about 130 basis points of gross margin, 130 to 140, in that 15% of our revenue. That's disappointing, because that's a habit and it's a habit we need to fix. The good news about it is it's something that's very fixable in our business. It takes our attention.So this morning, I had a call with our leaders throughout the business. I congratulated them on a nice quarter. I also congratulated them on hitting goal for the quarter and two out of three months in the quarter. The month of January, we're just shy of goal because of weather, but we did a nice job growing the business.I challenged them on our fastener pricing at the local level. I challenged them on our freight that we charge at the local level. Fuel prices, as you all know, are going up and that impacts us like it does everybody else. We're losing a little bit of ground on the freight component.I also challenged them on accounts receivable. Our -- we added about two days of accounts receivable during the quarter. It impacted our cash flow, the last point of the -- of Page 3. And -- but all in all, I'm pleased with the results for the quarter except a couple of components within gross margin.So up into Slide 4. If you are an investor in Fastenal, Slide 4 is a pretty darn encouraging page. I think it speaks a lot to the potential that is Fastenal and our strengths as far as being a distributor within our marketplace. In the first quarter, we signed 100 Onsites.If I give that context, back in 2015 -- these are rounded numbers -- we signed about 75. 2016, we signed about 175. 2017, we signed 275. In 2018, the number I have in my head is 375.I think Holden's stated range is 360 to 385 to give us some bookends. But I'm pleased to say, with three months into the year, our 2,000 goal is intact on our challenge to sign 360 to 385 Onsites in the year and I feel really good about that. In-market locations. We just topped above 3,000, 3,007 to be exact.What I like about that is we're growing our capabilities. We're growing our footprint. We had a number of years where we were contracting our footprints and I talked about that in our -- in the president's letter to this year's annual report. I'm very excited in what we're seeing there.And that's really, obviously, being driven by our Onsite expansion. We signed 5,679 vending devices in the quarter, a nice way to start the year. Equally impressive, the number of our removals is declining. We removed 18% fewer devices in the first quarter than we did in the first quarter of last year.So we're signing more. We're pulling fewer out. It's a nice combination. Similar to my comments on the Onsite goal, our 2,000 goal is intact.Our goal is to sign 21,000 to 23,000 devices during the calendar year. Product sales through vending, not surprisingly, grew north of 20% in the quarter, driven by improvements in the existing devices out there as well as the new ones we've added. National account sales grew 17% in the quarter. Well done to the national account team in growing our relationships with customers around the planet.Well done to our branch and Onsite network to serve that business and everybody else for supporting them in their efforts. Speaking of around the globe, if I look outside the United States -- inside the U.S. and in Canada, we had some weather impacts during the quarter, but if I look at rest of world, and this includes Canada, we grew our business 25% in the first quarter of 2018. We leveraged it and grew earnings even faster.Canada grew its business in the 20s, Mexico grew its business in the 20s and the rest of the world grew even higher, so really impressive performance throughout our international operations. When I think about the business, as you all know, starting several years ago, we really began to invest heavily in what are now the growth drivers of our business. And there's a price to that. You see it -- and Holden will touch on it when we look at operating expenses.Our labor costs continue to rise, some of that because of adding resources, some of that because of inflation, some of that because of incentive comp expansion. But what I'm really excited about is the resources we've added into our growth drivers in the last two years. So we've added roughly 160 people into our national account team, half of that dedicated solely to implementing new business, including Onsites. We added 15%.Fifteen percent of that number is selling resources, most of that in what we call a TSR, territory sales rep, the quarterback for the national account business in a given geography. Fifteen percent of that increase was for construction-centered personnel. We're seeing double-digit growth in our construction these days. Fifteen percent of that in our safety personnel.We're seeing great growth on our safety products. If I look outside of national accounts, we added 225 people roughly in the last two years to support our vending initiative, most of those in the district business units, but quite a few as we took over hosting operations and continue to expand our footprint into deploying devices. We added resources into Onsite, e-com, about 15 into both. We added resources into our government business.E-com, which we'll touch on a bit next week at our Investor Day, we're seeing great -- it's a small piece of our business, but we're really seeing impressive results within that component as well. Because of our local and same-day delivery capabilities, it puts us in a unique spot. We also added roughly 50 people into IT. Those resources are dedicated to being able to roll out new products for our branch network, our Onsite network and our customers faster, increase the bandwidth and a handful of folks to improve the security within our systems.So I think we're making investments in the right places, really impressed with what the team is doing. These people will execute a little bit better on our local fastener business and our freight. With that, I'll turn it over to Holden. -- Great. Thank you, Dan, and good morning to everybody. Jumping over to Slide 5. As Dan stated, total and daily sales were up 13.2% in the first quarter.It's a deceleration from up 14.8 daily sales growth in the fourth quarter, but it is a third straight quarter of at least low-teens growth for the company. We believe that pricing contributed between 50 and 100 basis points in the period. Mansco added another 120 basis points. Bear in mind that this quarter represents the completion of Mansco's first full year as a member of Fastenal's family.In that period, it did achieve the revenue and earnings that we originally anticipated it would. It plans to build on that performance the next 12 months, but be aware that with the transaction anniversarying in the second quarter, we'll no longer be breaking out its contribution specifically. From a macro standpoint, the PMI averaged 59.7 in the first quarter and industrial production continued to expand at a low- to mid-single-digit rate. Manufacturing end-markets continued to lead our growth with strength in heavy and general manufacturing as well as manufacturing going into transportation and building verticals.Construction was up 9.6% in the first quarter, but after a weather-impacted January, we saw our growth return to the 10% to 11% range. From a product standpoint, we sustained recent quarters' growth levels in both fasteners and non-fasteners. Though the last two quarters, we have seen meaningful acceleration in safety, which grew nearly 20% in the first quarter. From a customer standpoint, national accounts were up 17.3% with 78 of our top 100 accounts growing.Growth to non-national accounts was steady, with mid- to high single-digit growth and nearly 66% of our branches grew in the first quarter. That's a new high for this cycle. In terms of market tone, the quarter started with weather disruption and finished with Good Friday moving up from April of last year, but in between, conditions remained healthy, sentiment in the field remains constructive, and the good demand of the past few quarters appears to be carrying into the second quarter of 2018. Now over to Slide 6.Our gross margin was 48.7% in the first quarter. That's down 70 basis points versus the first quarter of last year. The usual factors that we've talked about were present here. Relative growth in national accounts and non-fasteners certainly affects the mix.Mansco tends to operate at a lower gross margin. And as Dan touched on, freight remains a challenge. We began to realize pricing in the period to offset the inflation we discussed. And while that effort continued to gain traction through the quarter, it was uneven and not yet where it needs to be to offset the various elements of pressure in the marketplace.However, we would expect additional gains in the second quarter in our pricing actions. Our operating margin was 19.8% in the first quarter. That's down 50 basis points on a year-over-year basis. The 70-basis-point decline in gross margin was partially offset by 20 basis points of operating expense leverage.If I look at those pieces, we achieved 50 basis points of leverage over general corporate expenses and occupancy-related costs. The latter was up 7.7% with the largest variables being growth in vending and non-branch occupancy expenses. Selling and transportation-related expenses were up 12.3, which was equally attributable to higher fuel costs and related to an increase in our branch fleet during the period. Our employee-related costs were up 14.4%.That reduced our leverage by 20 basis points. This continued to reflect Mansco's headcount, an increase in our total and FTE headcount of up 6% and up 7.4%, respectively, and that excludes Mansco and significantly higher incentive compensation across the organization reflecting our better growth. The incremental margin in the first quarter was 16%. While the second-quarter incremental margin will likely be challenged by a difficult gross-margin comparison, the anniversarying in 2Q '18 of the Mansco acquisition and the incentive compensation reset should generate better leverage for us in the second half.Putting it all together, the first-quarter earnings were $0.61, up 31% from the first quarter of '17. In the absence of tax reform and the lower rate it provides us, EPS would have been $0.51 and growth would have been 10%. To give you a quick update on tax reform. Having had more time to evaluate the impact, we now expect our ongoing tax rate will be between 24.5% and 25%, absent any discrete events that may arise from changes in the application of the law or other ongoing activities.Flipping over to Page 7 -- Slide 7. We generated $160 million in operating cash in the first quarter, which is 92% of net income. This is a lower conversion rate than we typically see in the first quarter. Part of this is just math, as our lower tax rates benefited the P&L in the first quarter but has not yet flowed to the cash flow statement.The other piece, however, relates primarily to those accounts receivable, which I'll cover in a moment. We continue to anticipate good cash flow in 2018 based on good earnings growth and the cash flow benefits from tax reform that will begin in the second quarter of '18. Net capital spending of $32 million increased in the first quarter of 2017 on expansion and upgrades at our hubs and corporate property. Our 2018 target for total net capital spending is unchanged at $149 million.We increased funds paid out in dividends by 15% to $106 million and reduced our debt by $10 million. We finished the quarter with debt at 15.7% of total capital, consistent with last year and a level that provides ample liquidity to invest in our business and pay our dividend. The picture of our working capital is mixed. Inventories were up 12.7% in the quarter.Inventory on hand fell five days, which we view favorably in light of inflationary pressures and plans for additional inventory investments in the field through 2018. Receivables grew 19.8% in the first quarter and days there expanded by 3 1/2. Days outstanding nationally expands as we experience relative growth to our national accounts and international businesses. However, in the last two quarters, this has been compounded by customer payments being pushed out past the quarter-end.We have seen no meaningful change in hard-to-collect balances and so this is an area that we will work to improve upon the balance of the year. That's all for our formal presentation. And with that, operator, we'll take questions.Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Robert Barry with Susquehanna. Your line is now open. -- Hey, guys, good morning. So you mentioned price only partially offsetting freight and product cost inflation. Is that dynamic only in the local-fastener business? Or is it broader? And when do you think you can get to at least neutral on that price-cost dynamic? -- I'll handle that one. In the case of the fastener business, that's local. And keep in mind, when I talk about local, I'm talking about where the pricing decision is made as far as what level of price. And so this is local business.When I talk about freight, that includes both local business and national account business. So it includes all aspects of our business, but the decision of whether or not to charge freight is typically made locally. There might be some contractual limitation on certain sales, but generally speaking, that's a local-made decision. So I would put both of them in that bucket.In regards to how quickly we can crack upon it, the freight ones a challenge because in many of our growth drivers, vending is an example of growth driver, Onsite's an example of growth driver, our propensity to charge freight is typically lower. Especially in the case of vending, it's nonexistent for the most part. There are challenges to engage with a customer on doing backhauls of freight. And I often see examples of that.On a recent trip, I saw, interestingly enough, down in Indianapolis, three pallets, large pallets, and each had a truck chap -- a truck cab on it from a vintage truck that was being shipped from a scrapyard in Minnesota up to the East Coast. And that's an example of backhaul as we do on our system to offset. The freight one is going to be challenging in the short term. The fastener one, that's about habits and we can change habits tomorrow. -- I'll just sort of chip in. To give you a little bit of color, the -- if I think about the RVP commentary that came through to us over the course of the quarter, it improved as the quarter went on from January to February to March. So I think that the confidence in the field grew and the achievement in the field grew as we went along, which is what we would have expected to see. I would also tell you that if I think about the month-to-month contribution of pricing, it also grew as we went through the quarter.So we've talked before about having to rebuild that muscle memory. Obviously, for us, in our model, these conversations are very much sort of customer-to-employee. And yes, I think there are signs that we were building up that muscle memory through the quarter and we just need to make sure that we continue to bulk up as we go into the second quarter, and that's the expectation. -- Got it. I guess, just a follow-on to that, given there's a lot of talk about tariffs and raising product costs, in particular on some of your products, just given what sounds like a pretty tough pricing environment, I mean, what's the thought on the ability to pass those through or fully being able to pass those through? -- Well, to be clear, I don't think that it's a pretty tough pricing environment. We are getting pricing. It's just the rate at which we're getting it. Again, I think that the sentiment around how the RVPs are feeling about that environment has only gotten better as the quarter has gone on.So I don't think that I would characterize the pricing environment today as tough. It's just a matter of at what pace we're going to be able to put it through. As it relates to tariffs, however, if you think about 232, the increase in steel and aluminum, it's -- that would primarily have a direct impact on our manufacturing business which does source that. If I think about the Section 301s -- -- That's 5% of our revenues. -- Yes, which is 4% or 5% of our revenue on the manufacturing. If I think about the Section 301 tariffs, we looked into what products are captured in that. And there are some. I think we've identified about $11 million or $12 million in annual COGS that would be affected directly by that.There's no doubt there will be some others that would come through in -- through masters, but we're talking about metal nuts, we're talking about pallet jacks and a few other items. And so there really was no impact on tariffs in Q1 in our business. Most of what would be affected directly seems fairly modest. I think our bigger question is what impact does it have on our customers at the end of the day.And as I said, in Q1, there really was nothing there. To the extent that it contributes to either a more inflationary environment, we'll have to respond to that as we talked about. To the extent that it creates issues for our customers, have to respond to that, but no impact yet and I think that the -- it's sort of a wait-and-see kind of situation. -- I'll just chime in a little bit as well to support Holden's answer and that is, historically, our ability to pass on things like this, a tariff, a duty, etc., the marketplace gets that and is able to pass that through. The wildcard in all of it is what impact it has not to our ability to price, but to volumes. What impact does it have with the customer? Does it impact their ability to export product? Does it impact the profitability within their business on what products they sell? That's the unanswerable question, but the marketplace gets the fact that price -- the costs are going up. -- Got it. Thank you, very helpful.Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert McCarthy with Stifel. Your line is now open. -- Good morning, everyone. I have two questions because that's all we're allowed in the time we're allowed, so thank you for taking that. I guess, following up the tariffs, you mentioned 301. Could you just confirm, you just think it's a very limited set of SKU and product that is going to be affected by this? And could you just let us know broadly how much you do source from China in terms of your underlying COGS or general sourcing? -- First off, we touched on that. We have identified what we know so far. Keep in mind that the number Holden cited looks at product we're directly sourcing that we believe is impacted and -- but on top of that is product that we are sourcing from others that would be impacted. That one is a lot more difficult one to quantify because with many of our suppliers, if I think of both branded and some of the non-branded products, many of our suppliers, their source of origin can fluctuate.So they might -- a lot of fasteners come out of Taiwan and China and a lot of that production has moved into China over the last 15, 20 years. No different than 40 and 50 years ago, a lot of that production had moved from Japan into Taiwan and other parts of southeast China -- or Southeast Asia, excuse me. So there are other sources of supply, but the issue you run into is the speed at which you can change, other factors that might be going on in other countries within the Pacific Rim. Most of the fasteners sold in this country are made outside of North America.So it's not an issue that's unique to us. It's an issue that's unique to that product line. Within our non-fastener product, the percentage would be lower, but still, a sizable piece is made -- but, again, I can -- I hesitate to quantify it because there are multiple source of supply and we aren't always privy to upstream those source of supply when we run a product. But the -- so the -- but the other dynamic is this thing moves rapidly.Sometimes you have to try to follow it by the latest tweet and we prefer not to manage our business that way -- We actually have seen the list of things that we understand to be affected now, so we have something on which to sort of make a judgment, if you will. And if I look at that list, there's probably 25 things on it. Iron or steel nuts is 85% of that. And so there is a list of things out there that are supposedly affected by that.That's where we're able to give some judgment based upon. -- Yes. No, I have the documentation right here in terms of the list. But the answer to the question, I don't want to preclude my second question, so this is a follow-up to the first question is, very briefly, yes, that's the Section 301 that was kind of enumerated, but the fact of the matter is it sounds like it could be a greater effect, kind of similar to oil and gas in '14, where you had headline exposure mid-single digits, but the penumbra of the effect could be greater, I guess, is my point. -- Yes. Time will tell. There's still plenty of unknowns. What's No.2? -- Yes. No. 2 is just a very simple question. I mean, obviously, gross margin, you cited and enumerated the various -- listen, growth is good, but the challenge is the mix in gross margin and that structural mix.Given the last couple of years, you've been -- the first-quarter gross margin typically is one of the higher gross margins of the year and then typically is above the average gross margin for the year, do you think that's going to continue according to Hoyle here? Or do you think there's opportunity for you to expand sequentially gross margin this year? Or have we put in the high for gross margin for this year or particularly versus the average? -- Well, the question of expanding gross margin, I mean, we filled a hole in Q1. Q2, I can tell you is going to be a very difficult comparison based on how we performed last year, but if -- so that would be difficult. If we're talking just sequentially, the -- there is a path to be able to achieve a gross margin that is comparable to slightly below where we are in Q1, right? So I think if you look at the history, it's not uncommon to see 30 basis points or what have you, to sort of down from Q1 or to Q2, etc. There's a path to do somewhat better than that, but that path, it does rely significantly on our ability to continue to build up our sort of pricing momentum and that's kind of the wild card that we are going to be playing through in Q2.Again, we like the signals. We've certainly given a clear message as to what we need to do going forward and if we can deliver and execute on that, as we fully expect to do so, there's a path to have margins that are comparable to maybe modestly below where we finished in Q1 and perhaps do a little bit better than the normal seasonal pattern, if you will. -- I'll follow-up offline. Thanks for taking for taking the questions. -- Yup.Thank you. Our next question comes from David Manthey with Baird. Your line is now open. -- Hye, guys, good morning. First question, Dan, you said you're happy with the return on the investment in your growth drivers, but you were disappointed by the profit growth in the first quarter. When you look at the core expense leverage in addition to the changing secular mix of the business and gross-margin pressure you just mentioned, are we at an inflection point here where we'll get back to 20% to 25% contribution margin? Or are you happy with faster sales growth and maybe a contribution margin in the teens? It seems like we've been leaning that way in the last couple of quarters. -- When -- as our business was ramping up in 2017, our willingness to invest in our growth drivers expanded. That's why I touched on some of the headcount we've been adding behind the scenes to really support this. And knowing full well that I, frankly, didn't expect coming into the first half of this year -- and I'm talking about operating margin when I talk about this. I'm removing the noise of tax reform -- I fully expected our operating, our incremental margins to drop below 20% and into the upper teens.And if, ironically enough, we had been -- if we wouldn't have this fastener issue in the quarter, the old ""would have, could have, should have,"" but we would have been in the low 20s. I still firmly believe when I look at this business over a period of years -- and we are in a transition period of really investing heavily in a fundamentally different growth driver in our business, as we're in that, if you look at it over time, there's no reason why gross margin can't be in that -- the incremental margin within the gross margin line can't be in that lower half of the 40s, so 43 to 45, and our incremental spend can't be closer to 20, which would put us into, optimistically, a 25, pessimistically, lower half of 20s incremental margin. And if we're growing six, seven, eight points faster than anybody else out there and we're taking market share and we're doing things that are natural for our business and that create a more defensive of a business from the standpoint of competition from others, I think that's a win for our shareholders. Right now, like I say, we're investing heavily in that transition.And unfortunately, we stubbed our toe on local pricing this quarter, but I think that's fixable and that's fixable fast. -- And, David, just so you know, the gross margin is certainly a part of it, but the other piece, if I look at our operating expenses, bear in mind that through Q1, right, the blending in of Mansco, that obviously has an impact on the incremental margins. The reset of incentive comp. I know it seems like we started talking about that a year ago. We did.The good news is you get into Q2, Q3, and Q4, and that reset begins to anniversary as well. I take some encouragement from the fact that we got 50 basis points of leverage over corporate and occupancy. We did not get much over the headcount side, but as we do begin to anniversary that reset in Q2 and beyond, I think that there is potential there to get more leverage out of the SG&A than what you've seen to this point. And so the growth drivers, we'll -- we're going to continue to invest in those, but there are pieces of our P&L that we should leverage at a greater -- to a greater degree, certainly into the second half of this year, than we have at this point as this cycle and as our growth matures. -- OK. That's very helpful. And second question is on the freight impact on gross margin. I went back and looked and this has been an issue for you at least back to the -- by the end of 2016 and here, it's in here.When does this get fixed? Can you fix it? And can you just describe what the source of the issue is? Is it that you're using third party in that internal logistics? Or what's going on there? And can it be fixed? -- There's a number of things there. It's not external versus internal. We probably had a little bit of that in the quarter because of the weather, but that's not the fundamental issue, Dave. The -- if I look at it, we lost about 20 basis points of gross margin strictly on the pricing aspect to where we're charging it.I'd say one-third of that is because of our growth drivers pulling it down. The other two-thirds is our propensity to execute. And I think sometimes we fall victim to -- we convince ourselves that the marketplace doesn't allow people to charge freight anymore because that's what you read in the headlines every day. That's not true.The marketplace will allow you to charge freight when you're providing a value. I believe your propensity to charge freight in this environment goes up because every time I turn around, I read an article about folks can't add trucks and drivers and capacity fast enough and so freight's becoming more expensive, and we have a structural advantage there and we need to price for that. So I believe it's fixable, but the challenging aspect is our growth drivers aren't our true friend, and so when it comes to this aspect -- our great friend when it comes to growing our business, but they do hurt it on the face of it -- and there, we need to challenge ourselves with saying, ""OK, we don't charge freight here, bet this customer is shipping product out. Can we ship some pallets of product out for them?"" And that's why when I go to our big cross top [ph] facility down in Indianapolis, I'm always curious what I see when I'm down there because it tells me if we're engaging in doing that, because if our customers are having a hard time finding capacity to ship pallets and we have capacity to ship their pallets, I think we can marry that up and fix a piece of the problem there, but it's a component of what Holden's talked about, the gross-margin impact of our growth drivers.And the drop -- the natural drop we're going to see each year in our gross profit, that's a component of it. -- All right, thanks very much.Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Uhlman with Cleveland Research. Your line is now open. -- Hi, guys, good morning. Can we start with, Dan, you just mentioned 20 basis points of the impact on gross margin. Could you walk through the remainder of that, the decline in gross margin between mix and Mansco and the rest of it? -- Yes. Mansco was probably about 10- to 20-basis-points impact, right down the middle there. I would say mix this quarter was also sort of in that 10- to 20-basis-point impact. I think the transportation was about 20 basis points of impact.And those would give you the biggest pieces of the sort of the 70-basis-point decline year over year -- -- In local pricing of fasteners. -- And so -- and then, obviously, local pricing on fasteners and just general product inflation played a role and the fact that we didn't get as much as we needed to, to begin to offset that, right? -- Adam, I'll add one tidbit there. So I cited when I was talking to Dave the fact that we've given up 20 basis points on our propensity to charge. We got about half of that back in leveraging of our network itself. So the gross-margin impact was about 10 basis points for freight, 20 of it in pricing, 10 of it we got back because we still run a great fleet and we continue to utilize that fleet for moving products around the country.Even though our costs are up there, we're moving more tons of product. -- OK. Gotcha. And then, just secondly, how should we think about the working capital for the rest of the year? I guess I'm a little confused on exactly what's happening with receivables and why customers are pushing it into the next quarter. Do you have any goal that you can share with us or other process improvements that you're putting into place to get the conversion to improve? -- Yes. And to some extent, you don't want to overreact to something because, again, at the end of the day, what we're looking for is, are we seeing issues with hard-to-collect product? And the fact is we're simply not. And so in the fourth quarter, we obviously called out receivables being a bit of a challenge. And I may have sort of believed that that was primarily a function of the calendar and, in truth, it may have simply been our customers deciding to push out beyond the quarter.I don't know what the reason is for what looks to us to be a recent somewhat change in behavior. It's something that we'll have to kind of go back and check on and get our arms around, but I think the important element of it is we don't have an increase in hard-to-collect receivables out there. Those numbers have remained lean and healthy. And so all we're seeing is, we're seeing a pushback which, if it's about being able to report a clean quarter, as many of our customers are public and do so, you could be talking about days.At the end of Q4, we saw an inflow of payments at the beginning of January. I haven't had a chance to sort of look at how the beginning of the first quarter has played out yet and look at that statistic. It wouldn't surprise me if it's there. So it's something that's worth calling out because, obviously, it impacts those numbers, but I don't think that there's anything particularly worrisome there from a -- in terms of a corporate-health standpoint, I guess, is how I'll put it. -- I'll throw a little adder onto that and then we're coming up on 45 minutes past the hour so let this be the last question. When I think of it and putting my old hat on, you have customers that are growing faster than they've experienced in recent years. That growth in their businesses takes working capital. You have interest rates that are rising.It's probably not an unreasonable thing to see of people pushing, especially to do a little window dressing at the end of the quarter to see payment patterns slow down. My challenge to our team is, guys, how about challenging a customer? We're business partners here. And to cut off your payments from the 22nd through the 20th, through 25th of March, creates a lot of pain for us, too. And there's three assets on our business.There's fixed capital, of which vending is typically is placed inside their facility. There is inventory, of which with Onsite, we're placing dollars inside their facility. And there's accounts receivable. If I think of the value we bring to their business of those three things, the first two add value, the third one doesn't.So don't do that to us. Let's push back a little bit using that because every dollar we have there is a dollar we can't have in inventory and fixed capital long term and we don't think that's good for our customers. So if they want to push some other suppliers, they can do that, but don't do it to us because we have inventory and fixed capital inside your facilities to support your business. We can't do all three.With that, we're at 45 minutes past the hour. Thank you for participating in today's earnings call. We -- Holden is hosting an Investor Day next week. I believe that's being broadcast on the Internet. -- That will be webcast. -- Webcast. And again, thank you for your support of Fastenal.

Sales grew 13.2% to $1.19 billion and earnings per share increased 30.6% to $0.61. Gross margin declined 73 basis points to 48.7% after having fallen 97 basis points in Q4.Fastener products grew 11.8%, helped by the acquisition of Manufacturers Supply Company in March 2017, which added 1.3 percentage points to the overall sales growth number. Sales of non-fastener products grew 14.5%. The company said that sales growth would have been even higher if it weren't for an abnormal number of route cancellations due to bad weather in the quarter.Operating income grew 10.4% in the quarter, and CEO Daniel Florness called that performance ""frankly not horribly impressive"" on the conference call. Despite an improvement in operating expenses as a percentage of sales, the decline in gross margin caused operating margin to decline 50 basis points. Florness blamed product cost inflation as well as increased freight costs for the drop in margin, as the company did not increase prices enough to offset the higher costs. He said that gross margin in Q2 would be comparable to or even slightly lower than the Q1 figure. Analysts on the call were also concerned about the impact tariffs could have on product costs, potentially adding to Fastenal's cost pressures.Fastenal seems to be on reasonable growth trajectory, and company officials think there is room for price increases to offset costs. But investors focused on the margin issue today, taking the stock into negative territory for the year.Shares of military drone maker AeroVironment soared 17.1% to $54.28 after Stifel Nicolaus analyst Joseph DeNardi  to buy from hold and raised his price target from $45 to $65.

ote: The following is an excerpt from this week's  report. You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, Here are the key points:• Total Q1 earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up +16% from the same period last year on +7.4% higher revenues, the highest quarterly earnings growth pace in 7 years.• Earnings growth is expected to be in double-digit territory from the year-earlier level for 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors, including the Technology and Finance sectors. Only two sectors (Autos & Conglomerates) are expected to show earnings declines in Q1.• Energy sector earnings are expected to be up +60.1% from the same period last year on +16.1% higher revenues. Excluding the Energy sector, total S&P 500 earnings growth drops from +16.1% to +14.6%.• The Finance sector, which dominates the early reporting cycle, is expected to have a very strong showing in Q1 and the coming quarters.• Earnings estimates for Q1 and the following quarters have gone up in a notable way since the quarter got underway, with estimates for 13 of the 16 Zacks sectors going up.• In percentage terms, estimates have gone up the most for the Basic Materials, Energy, Construction and Industrial Products sectors. In absolute terms, positive revisions to the Finance and Technology sectors account for more than half of all estimate upgrades since the quarter got underway.• This positive revisions trend is the most dramatic change on the earnings scene in recent years; it will be interesting to see if the trend will continue in the coming days as the Q1 earnings season unfolds.• For the S&P 600 index, total Q1 earnings are expected to be up +13.4% from the same period last year on +6.9% higher revenues. This would follow +15.2% earnings growth on +7.6% revenue growth in the preceding quarter.• For full-year 2018, total earnings for the S&P 500 index are track to be up +17.9% on +5.3% higher revenues, with full-year 2019 earnings and revenues for the index expected to be up +9.4% and +4.3%, respectively.• The implied 'EPS' for the index, calculated using current 2018 P/E of 17.3X and index close, as of April 11th , is $153.80. Using the same methodology, the index 'EPS' works out to $168.30 for 2019 (P/E of 15.7X). The multiples for 2018 and 2019 have been calculated using the index's total market cap and aggregate bottom-up earnings for each year.The most profound change on the earnings scene lately has been the unusually positive revisions trend for Q1 and the following quarters. The chart below shows how 2018 Q1 earnings growth expectations have evolved since mid-December 2017.This is a sight that we haven't seen in a very long time; definitely not in the last 6 years.The most important factor driving this positive revisions trend is the tax cuts. The rise in  and the impact of higher bond yields on banks' profitability are some of the other factors.Estimates have gone up across the board for 13 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with the highest percentage positive revisions for the Basic Materials, Energy, Construction, and Industrials. In absolute terms, the positive revisions to the Finance and Technology sectors account for more than half of all aggregate positive revisions since mid-December 2017.The Finance sector's earnings outlook has notably improved as a result of tax cuts, higher interest rates, and generally favorable economic backdrop. The sector is expected to report +19.2% higher earnings on +4.5% higher revenues, which will follow the sector's flattish performance in the preceding period.The Major Banks industry, which alone brings in roughly 45% of the sector's total earnings in the S&P 500 index and which includes  (  ) and  (  ) that kick-off the reporting cycle for the industry this week, is expected to have +11.3% earnings growth on +4.8% revenue growth. The combination of improved net interest margins following additional Fed hikes, benign credit trends, and favorable momentum on the capital markets front should help produce solid results in Q1. These favorable trends should remain in place over the coming quarters as well, as reflected in current expectations for the coming quarters.The group's stock market performance this year has tracked the S&P 500 index. The Zacks Major Banks industry, which includes the big money-center banks as well as the major regional operators, is down -0.6% in the year-to-date period, roughly in-line with the S&P 500 index's -0.3% decline.Better than expected results and favorable management commentary on the earnings calls should give these stocks a big boost. Management's comments about trends in the underlying businesses like loan demand, margins and credit conditions will be closely watched. Also important will be capital deployment plans, including the outlook for dividend increases following the tax reform.The chart below contrasts the Q4 earnings growth rate with what was actually achieved in the last 5 quarters and what is expected in the coming three periods.It will be interesting to see if expectations for the following quarters follow the positive revisions trend we witnessed ahead of the Q1 earnings season or we will go back to negative revisions trend that has been the recurring theme over the last many years.Note: Sheraz Mian manages the Zacks equity research department.

 glimpse of  share price movement reveals that it has plunged roughly 11% in the past three months in line with the  . We also note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.53 and $6.12 for fiscal 2018 and 2019 has declined by 33 cents and 54 cents, respectively, in the past 60 days. So what is behind the dismal show in the bourses? Why analysts polled by Zacks are skeptical about the company's performance? Are the initiatives undertaken by management enough to revive the stock?Lowe's stock took a sharp U-turn after the company missed fourth-quarter earnings and provided soft fiscal 2018 view. The company's earnings of 74 cents per share fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 88 cents. Further, the company expects fiscal 2018 earnings in the band of $5.40-$5.50 per share, which was significantly below the analyst expectations. As mentioned above, estimates have been witnessing downward revisions.Lowe's faces stiff competition from Home Depot  and other home supply retailers on attributes such as price and quality of merchandise, in-stock consistency, merchandise assortments and customer service. This may weigh on the company's upcoming results. We noted that in the fourth, third, second and first quarters of fiscal 2016, gross margin had contracted 25, 40, 10 and 43 basis points, respectively. In the first, second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2017, margin declined a respective 64, 23, 28 and 70 basis points to 34.4%, 34.2%, 34.1% and 33.7%.We believe improving job scenario, gradual recovery in the housing market and merchandising initiatives along with efforts to enhance omni-channel capabilities bode well for Lowe's. The company's Canadian and Mexican businesses has been performing quite well. The buyout of RONA is reinforcing its position in the Canadian market.Lowe's Canada entered into a strategic partnership with Solar Brokers Canada to provide solar energy installation services to homeowners under Lowe's Solar banner. Of late, the company has been focusing on maintenance, repair and operations products, evident from its acquisition of Maintenance Supply Headquarters and also the earlier buyout of Central Wholesalers.Further, Lowe's has refurbished its pro-service business website, LowesForPros.com, in order to cater to the needs of its Pro-customers. The company's efforts to focus on Pro customers is yielding results, which is quite evident from the fact that Pro growth rate in the fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 has outpaced do-it-yourself.The company is streamlining store portfolio, which along with its strategy of enhancing customer shopping experience and merchandising transformation, is likely to generate incremental sales. We noted that comparable sales (comps) rose 4.1% in the fourth quarter, following an increase of 5.7%, 4.5% and 1.9% recorded in the third, second and first quarter, respectively. Management projects total sales growth of approximately 4%, with comps increase of about 3.5% for fiscal 2018.We believe that these initiatives are likely to bolster Lowe's performance and provide cushion to this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.Fastenal Company  has a long-term earnings growth rate of 14% and carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see  .Tailored Brands  delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 50.9% in the trailing four quarters. It has a long-term earnings growth rate of 16.5% and a Zacks Rank #2.Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

ote: The following is an excerpt from this week's  report. You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, Here are the key points:• Total Q1 earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up +16% from the same period last year on +7.4% higher revenues, the highest quarterly earnings growth pace in 7 years.• Earnings growth is expected to be in double-digit territory from the year-earlier level for 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors, including the Technology and Finance sectors. Only two sectors (Autos & Conglomerates) are expected to show earnings declines in Q1.• Energy sector earnings are expected to be up +60.1% from the same period last year on +16.1% higher revenues. Excluding the Energy sector, total S&P 500 earnings growth drops from +16.1% to +14.6%.• The Finance sector, which dominates the early reporting cycle, is expected to have a very strong showing in Q1 and the coming quarters.• Earnings estimates for Q1 and the following quarters have gone up in a notable way since the quarter got underway, with estimates for 13 of the 16 Zacks sectors going up.• In percentage terms, estimates have gone up the most for the Basic Materials, Energy, Construction and Industrial Products sectors. In absolute terms, positive revisions to the Finance and Technology sectors account for more than half of all estimate upgrades since the quarter got underway.• This positive revisions trend is the most dramatic change on the earnings scene in recent years; it will be interesting to see if the trend will continue in the coming days as the Q1 earnings season unfolds.• For the S&P 600 index, total Q1 earnings are expected to be up +13.4% from the same period last year on +6.9% higher revenues. This would follow +15.2% earnings growth on +7.6% revenue growth in the preceding quarter.• For full-year 2018, total earnings for the S&P 500 index are track to be up +17.9% on +5.3% higher revenues, with full-year 2019 earnings and revenues for the index expected to be up +9.4% and +4.3%, respectively.• The implied 'EPS' for the index, calculated using current 2018 P/E of 17.3X and index close, as of April 11th , is $153.80. Using the same methodology, the index 'EPS' works out to $168.30 for 2019 (P/E of 15.7X). The multiples for 2018 and 2019 have been calculated using the index's total market cap and aggregate bottom-up earnings for each year.The most profound change on the earnings scene lately has been the unusually positive revisions trend for Q1 and the following quarters. The chart below shows how 2018 Q1 earnings growth expectations have evolved since mid-December 2017.This is a sight that we haven't seen in a very long time; definitely not in the last 6 years.The most important factor driving this positive revisions trend is the tax cuts.

 is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 11, before the opening bell.In the last quarter, the company's earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company surpassed expectations in only one of the trailing four quarters, the average being 1%.Let's look at the factors which might affect the company's results in the first quarter. : Fastenal's sales in the last few quarters have been driven by an increased installation of industrial vending machines. Sales through vending machines grew at or near a double-digit pace in each of the four quarters of 2017. The company signed 19,355 vending machines in 2017, up 7.2% from the prior-year quarter and the highest since 2013. A consistent increase in the number of on-site locations is likely to strengthen Fastenal's market share and boost the quarterly numbers. Sales growth through Onsite was 22% in 2017. The trend is expected to continue in the first quarter of 2018. Fastenal aims to achieve 360-385 onsite signings in 2018, reflecting an increase of 270 signings in 2017. We are encouraged by Fastenal's acquisition of certain assets of industrial and fastener supply distributor - Manufacturer's Supply Company (Mansco) - in March 2017. This fortifies Fastenal's presence in markets where it has not significantly contributed in the past. Mansco contributed 140 basis points (bps) to total sales growth of 14.8% in the last reported quarter and is expected to maintain the same in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Backed by sustained strength in most of its end markets as well as strong momentum in vending machines installations and onsite locations, the company is expected to report solid top- and bottom-line growth in the first quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.18 billion, implying 12.9% year over year growth. The consensus estimate for earnings is pegged at 61 cents, reflecting an improvement of 32.6% on a year-over-year basis.However, we are apprehensive about Fastenal's changes in product and customer mix that have been hurting the gross margin for quite some time. Gross margin of 49.3% in 2017 dropped 30 bps from the prior-year period. Also, storms in the eastern and southern regions of United States care likely to mar prospects, as it had a significant impact on business activity in the first half of January 2018.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Fastenal has the right combination of two main ingredients - a positive  and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher - for increasing the odds of an earnings beat. : The Earnings ESP for Fastenal is +0.21%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . : Fastenal carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP. | Here are some other companies in the  that, according to our model, which have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +1.34% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see  .Nordstrom, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +2.36% and a Zacks Rank #2.Amazon.com, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +12.11% and a Zacks Rank #2.It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over.

 reported mixed results in the fourth quarter of 2017. Although the company's earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, revenues missed the same.Following the quarterly results, shares of Lumber Liquidators declined 9.3% on Feb 27 primarily due to lower-than-expected top line and soft first-quarter 2018 comparable sales projection.In the past six months, the company's shares have plunged 42.4% against the  's gain of 26.5%.Per management, first-quarter comparable store sales (comps) are likely to be impacted by soft January sales as promotion toward the end of 2017 was less effective than the year-ago period. Further, weakness in the company's Northern division sales is expected to negatively impact first-quarter results.For 2018, the company projects total revenues to increase by mid-to-upper single digits.

Higher sales and lower adjusted SG&A expenses supported the bottom line.Net sales rose 6.1% to $259.9 million but lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $264.2 million for the second straight quarter. Comparable-store net sales increased 4.5% primarily owing to a 3.4% rise in average sales and a 1.1% gain in customers invoiced. Moreover, non-comparable store sales were up $4.1 million in the prior-year quarter. While adjusted SG&A expenses declined 3.1% to $86.4 million in the quarter, SG&A expenses - as a percentage of sales - decreased to 33.3% from 36.4% in the year ago period.Gross margin came in at 35.4% compared with 32.9% in the prior-year quarter.

ith the oldest members being 37 years old and the youngest just 18, millennials believe that they have a long way to go before they reach retirement. But time flies faster than one thinks and when their retirement age arrives, these millennials may not have sufficient savings.Some experts believe that given their current lack of savings, the majority of this generation won't be able to retire even in their 70s. This has also been supported by a recent study from National Institute on Retirement Security, which states that two-thirds of the working millennials have saved nothing for their retirement.Some experts believe that the generation's interest on holidaying rather than saving is the main reason for their failure to save. Others believe that millennials are overburdened with their monthly payments like education loan and credit card bills. Apart from these, one-fifth of the generation supports aging parents by paying for their medical bills and other expenses.All these circumstances have made it tougher for the generation to set aside money for their sunset years.The generation is expected to have a longer life span - thanks to the continuous advancements in medical science and healthier lifestyles - which means they will need more funds. Escalating healthcare costs also pose a challenge.Although U.S. citizens will have social security but it is difficult to say whether it will be adequate to maintain their lifestyle. Their woes will mount if the U.S. government closes this facility after 25-30 years. It already costs the federal government more than $1 trillion, which will increase exponentially as the majority of the citizens will fall under the senior category by that time.Whatever small amount you save today, if invested wisely, it can give you a healthy return in the long run. There are plenty of investment options available but given the young age of millennials and their risk taking capabilities, we suggest investing in equities as these offer maximum returns.The improving domestic as well as global economic scenario is likely to have a positive impact on the market. Additionally, with Donald Trump's 'America First' policies, the manufacturing sector is poised to witness huge investment in the next few years, thereby generating employment and increasing wage rate opportunities. All this is likely to further strengthen the U.S. economy, which will tend to reflect in the stock market.Considering an annual return of 8%, a monthly investment of just $100 in equities by a 25-year old till his 65th birthday will save him or her approximately $341,120.However, investing in equities has its own share of risks. Not every stock will have a remarkable run. Also, the risk of a market crash remains.Therefore, investing in stocks that generate solid regular returns with minimum associated risks is prudent. Also, the return should cover the investment and inflation costs.Blue chip  boast solid financial structure and healthy underlying fundamentals, and are less affected by market turbulence. Such stocks are believed to be safer and more durable than an average stock. Most of these companies consistently raise dividends and are typically large in size.The companies' dominating market position, large customer base, sustainable business model, long track of profitability and strong liquidity help them offer outsized payouts or sizable yields on a regular basis, irrespective of the market direction. As a result, these stocks provide greater stability and offer continued income for investors, as well as more scope for capital appreciation.It is difficult to pick the right stocks from a wide range of available investment opportunities.This is where the Zacks  comes in handy.

" is slated to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Apr 11. The question lingering in investors' minds is whether or not this home furnishings retailer will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported.The company posted a positive earnings surprise of 22.2% in the last reported quarter. However, it lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 1.8% over the trailing four quarters. Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement. | The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is $1.41 per share, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 23.4%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has remained unchanged in the past 30 days. Further, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of $3.67 billion, up about 4% from the year-ago quarter.Notably, Bed Bath & Beyond has outperformed the broader industry in the last three months, reflecting positive investor sentiment ahead of earnings. The company's shares inched up 0.3%, against the  's decline of 9.8%.Bed Bath & Beyond is gaining from its focus on transformation plan to deliver a seamless customer experience. The transformation plan focuses on improving operational efficiency through the overhaul of IT and business processes, as well as adopting customer-centric plans like enriching product assortment and enhancing services.In this regard, it adopted a new model to better recognize and prioritize technology-related needs. It has also set up a strategic portfolio management office (""SPMO"") to allocate resources toward more profitable areas. Through the SPMO, the company is creating an integrated portfolio of strategies to improve gross margin, optimize inventory levels, enhance supply chain and implement customer service transformation.Further, the company's capital initiatives and constant shareholder-friendly moves bode well. Additionally, the company is progressing well with its strategic store expansion plans. It also targets increasing the productivity of existing stores by adjusting the breadth and depth of its merchandise offerings to suit customer preferences. Consequently, it remains focused on expanding, renovating and relocating stores to adapt to the changing market conditions. We believe these initiatives will go a long way in retaining the company's existing customers while attracting new ones.However, Bed Bath & Beyond has been grappling with soft gross and operating margins for the past six quarters now. Management expects this trend to continue in fiscal 2017 due to higher shipping and coupon expenses as well as rise in SG&A expense.Additionally, the company's dismal comparable store sales (comps) trend remains a concern. Driven by initial comps performance in the fiscal fourth quarter, it projects comps to decline in the low-single-digit percentage range. Further, it envisions fiscal 2017 earnings per share of roughly $3.00, which reflects a decline of more than 30% from the year-ago period.Though Bed Bath & Beyond is striving hard to spark a turnaround, the current dismal trends cannot simply be overlooked. So, let's see what is in store for the company in the upcoming release.Our proven model shows that Bed Bath & Beyond is likely to beat earnings estimates because it has the right combination of two key components. A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. The company has an Earnings ESP of +0.07%. This, along with the company's Zacks Rank #3, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.

"he construction industry in the United States is expected to grow by leaps and bounds in 2018. Also, a ratio which measures the optimism surrounding the sector's growth hit a record high recently. Further, hiring in the sector has been unusually high over the last one year. Meanwhile, a leaked draft of Trump's infrastructure spending plans indicates that the GOP will prioritize improving the existing roads and highways as well as non-federally funded utilities in the country.Lastly, strong economic growth and recent tax reforms continue to boost the industry's growth. Such a scenario quite naturally calls for investing in construction stocks.In November 2017, construction spending increased, surpassing expectations. The figure came in at $1.26 trillion, logging an annual growth rate of 2.4%. Such strength in spending was the result of increased investments across real estate, commercial and residential projects. Further, spending on private construction remained high and invited gains to the industry.To top it all, firms operating in the space are also looking to expand their workforce as evident from unusually high hiring even under dire circumstances. Per the latest data by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the construction industry added as many as 30,000 jobs to the U.S. economy in December, when parts of the country were ravaged by harsh winters.In 2017 alone, the sector added 210,000 jobs, which represented a surge of 35% from 2016. Economists have already stated that such figures are indicative of excellent performance by the space in 2018.Moreover, the ratio which measures the industry optimism over business growth hit a record high. Such optimism is backed primarily by business-friendly economic conditions and overall growth. Also, economists have stated that construction in the office market, transportation and retail will see a boom this year.Optimism regarding growth of the construction industry surged post President Trump's victory as one of his key priorities was infrastructure investment. Although spending on government projects have declined 3.4% year to date, the figure is still close to an increase of 3% -- the highest monthly gain in three years - that it hit in October 2017. This is courtesy of higher spending at the federal, state and local levels.Increased infrastructure spending was the cornerstone of Trump's pesidential campaign. As a matter of fact, he had proposed a $1 trillion infrastructure spending financed by new tax credits to encourage private equity investors. He plans to deploy $200 billion in federal money over the next decade to ""incentivize another $800 billion in spending from state and local authorities and private entities.""That said, the question on investors' mind is: Will infrastructure spending be increased at all? One can roughly gauge that this might be possible. Efforts made by members of the GOP to push through tax reforms are indicative of their legislative intent. More than anything, it is the repute and the goodwill that President Trump and his team would like to maintain.A leaked draft of Trump's infrastructure policy, published on  on Jan 23, 2018, clearly mentions that the administration is not keen on building new roads or highways and taking up ""unsustainable projects."" The administration instead focuses on improving the conditions of the existing roads and highways. The plan also hints at protecting non-federally funded utilities within the country. Such statements give a clear indication that the citizens will soon witness the passing of the Infrastructure Spending Bill.The year started with a disappointing reading for housing starts. Per the Department of Commerce, housing starts declined 8.2% in December - its largest percentage drop since November 2016. However, analysts see such a downturn as temporary. Further, housing possibly felt the chill from December's brutally low temperatures.Also, the 2.4% increase in homebuilding to 1.202 million units in 2017 is one important point to be noted. This is the highest level recorded in a decade. Strong economic growth, a robust labor market and tax cuts are continuing to bolster the housing industry.Future demand is also likely to remain strong given the shortage in supply of existing homes. Also, homebuilders are not planning more speculative homes. These are units which still do not have a buyer.

t has been about a month since the last earnings report for  . Shares have added about 4.5% in the past month, outperforming the market.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is FAST due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Fastenal's adjusted earnings of 45 cents per share in the fourth quarter of 2017 were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Without the pretax gain adjustments, earnings per share came in at 53 cents, up 33.5% year over year.Net sales of $1.09 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.08 billion. Sales grew 14.8% year over year on increased units owing to higher underlying market demand and growth in industrial vending business and existing Onsite locations. The acquisition of Manufacturers Supply Company (Mansco) contributed 1.4% to sales.Fastenal's daily sales grew 14.8% in the quarter, higher than the 13.6% increase recorded in the third quarter of 2017.On a monthly basis, daily sales increased 14.7% in December, 15.4% in November and 13.8% in October 2017, compared with 2.8%, 1.2% and 3.9%, respectively, a year ago.Daily sales of fastener products (used mainly for industrial production and accounting for approximately 35% of the company's fourth-quarter sales) increased 13.4% in the quarter, 3.9% of which came from the acquisition of Mansco.Non-fastener product Daily sales (used mainly for maintenance and represented 65% of the quarterly sales) increased 16.1% year over year.As of Dec 31, 2017, Fastenal operated 71,421 vending machines, up 13.7% year over year. During the quarter, the company signed 4,266 machine contracts, reflecting an increase of 13.5% year over year.After a soft 2013, vending trends improved as management's efforts to enhance the quality of signings/installs paid off.Fastenal signed 57 new Onsite locations during the quarter, up 32.6% from 43 signings a year ago. As of Dec 31, 2017, the company had 650 active sites, representing an increase of 50.9%.Additionally, Fastenal signed 32 new national account contracts in the fourth quarter (representing 49.8% of its total revenues in the quarter). Daily sales to its national account customers grew 18.5% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis.Gross margin of 48.8% in the fourth quarter of 2017 declined 97 basis points (bps) year over year owing to changes in product and customer mix, the addition of Mansco (which has a lower gross profit product mix than the company), higher freight expenses, investments in hub assets and commodity inflation.Operating margin declined 57 bps year over year to 18.7% in the quarter, owing to an improvement in operating and administrative expenses, offset by a decline in gross profit.Earnings of $2.01 per share in fiscal 2017 increased 16.2% year over year and managed to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.93. The company reported net sales of $4.39 billion, up 10.8% year over year. Net sales surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.38 billion.Cash and cash equivalents were $116.9 million as of Dec 31, 2017, up from $112.7 million as on Dec 31, 2016. Long-term debt was $412 million, up from $379.5 million at 2016-end.In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates. There have been three revisions higher for the current quarter. | At this time, FAST has a great Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a bit on the momentum front with a B. However, the stock was also allocated a grade of F on the value side, putting it in the bottom 20% quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Our style scores indicate that the stock is more suitable for growth investors than momentum investors.Estimates have been trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. It comes with little surprise FAST has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). We expect an above average return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"nvestors in Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST) saw new options begin trading this week, for the April 20th expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the FAST options chain for the new April 20th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $52.50 strike price has a current bid of $1.35. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $52.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $51.15 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of FAST, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $54.37/share today.Because the $52.50 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 66%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.57% return on the cash commitment, or 16.77% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Fastenal Co., and highlighting in green where the $52.50 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $55.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.00. If an investor was to purchase shares of FAST stock at the current price level of $54.37/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $55.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 4.84% if the stock gets called away at the April 20th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if FAST shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Fastenal Co., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing FAST's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $55.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $55.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 54%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).

"n recent trading, shares of Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $57.00, changing hands for $57.10/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 8 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Fastenal Co., but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $54.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $61.00. The standard deviation is $2.563.But the whole reason to look at the  FAST price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with FAST crossing above that average target price of $57.00/share, investors in FAST have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $57.00 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Fastenal Co.:

After years of underperformance, American manufacturing is back. Industrial companies are enjoying massive bull markets in their shares. While tech has led the way for years, old-economy stocks are starting to play catch-up.This is all great news for  (NASDAQ:  ). FAST stock hasn't gone anywhere for the past five years. But the current American manufacturing revival could change all that.Before you jump aboard the Fastenal train, however, make sure to consider the risks. The stock is still expensive and sits at technical resistance. And looming competitive threats could ding the company's margins. Overall, is FAST stock ready to break out or fall back yet again? : FAST stock is currently trading at 28 times earnings. For a company that isn't in tech or another fast-growth sector, 28x earnings is quite a stretch. Analysts are bullish on Fastenal. The company scored an impressive seven ratings upgrades in 2017 alone.And yet, despite that, analysts only see Fastenal's earnings growing by around 10% next year, taking the forward PE ratio to 25. That's still expensive, even if the bullish analyst forecasts are achieved.That problem played out with Fastenal's earnings this week. Despite beating the company's revenue guidance and matching on EPS, FAST stock slumped after the company released the numbers. It is hard for an unglamorous business to sustain such a huge PE ratio without blowout earnings numbers.For dividend investors, FAST stock is attractive due to its consistently rising dividend payout. However, at a 2.8% yield now, Fastenal doesn't pay much more than U.S. treasury bonds. With interest rates soaring, the conservative yield-focused investors that previously bought stocks like FAST for safety may jump ship for safer options in fixed income. : Fastenal's profit margins have slid in recent quarters. The market has interpreted this as a sign that  (NASDAQ:  ) and other online players are eroding Fastenal's core business. Fastenal's bread-and-butter business is distribution. Amazon makes its living upending existing distribution models.On top of that, Fastenal's expansion in the vending and on-site businesses will further cut into its margins, as it can't mark up these services as much as its traditional offerings. Fastenal is evolving to stay relevant as times change. But the change in the company's business focus could cause earnings growth to slow down. : FAST stock just hit the $55 level that was its all-time high dating back to 2012. At that point, shares sold off smartly following a so-so earnings report.This will give short sellers ammunition to press their bets against Fastenal. Already, short sellers have sold 9% of FAST stock short. That's an unusually high amount for an industrial company. In many cases, high short interest might be fuel for a potential short squeeze.In this situation, however, the short sellers could be problematic. The stock just failed at overhead resistance, and shorts will feel emboldened to press their bets. The declining margins argument by the bears may or may not be correct. Here's the bullish counterpoint. Throughout 2017, Amazon fears spread into many sectors, such as grocery and auto parts, that had previously seemed resistant to the internet threat.To give one example,  (NYSE:  ) plunged from $800 to $500 in 2017, before roaring back to $780 now.You can make a similar case that investors are not understanding Fastenal's true position. Sure, the internet could disrupt FAST's traditional distribution business. However, customers are pretty sticky for its services.For niche specialized products, it makes less sense to abandon trusted vendors to save a few cents. And Fastenal's on-site and vending businesses are largely internet-immune, even if the older store model takes a hit. : It's inarguable that FAST is an expensive stock. However, bulls can rightfully retort that it is cheaper than it used to be. Incredibly, between 2009 and 2013, FAST stock ended every single year with a trailing PE ratio over 30. And recently, its PE ratio has consistently hung out in the high 20s.In fact, FAST stock first hit $55 way back in 2012 and has pretty much traded in a steady range between $45 and $55 for the past five years. Thus, despite being expensive, it's relatively cheap compared to its recent history. Also, when it finally breaks out above that long-running resistance at the $55 mark, it could really get going technically. : The industrial stocks are on fire right now.  (NYSE:  ), not usually a highflier, is giving the FAANG stocks a run for their money. BA stock is up 115% over the past year. (NYSE:  ) is having a similar performance. Left for dead in early 2016, CAT stock has pulled off more than just a bounce. It's nearly tripled off the 2016 low and is up 90% within the past 12 months.It's not hard to see why investors are excited. The president's efforts to create American manufacturing jobs are a boon for the industrial sector. And the tax cut package and a potential deal for infrastructure spending could stimulate yet more demand for the products that Fastenal distributes.This an exciting moment for Fastenal stock. After five years of stagnation, shares are pushing up against long-running resistance at $55. If it tops that, shares should soar.However, don't expect it to happen this quarter. The company's latest earnings report wasn't good enough to get the job done. If anything, expect short sellers to circle the wagons here as the company's margins drop off and Amazon fears persist. There could be a good trade coming up on FAST stock in 2018, but it isn't here just yet.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Should You Buy the Earnings Dip in Fastenal Stock? 3 Pros, 3 Cons@2018-01-22@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/should-you-buy-earnings-dip-fastenal-stock-3-pros-3-cons-2018-01-22

"fter a strong 2017 for the construction industry and most signs pointing to continued growth, it might be a great time to jump on some construction and homebuilding industry stocks.Three-quarters of U.S. construction firms plan to increase their payrolls in 2018, according to a new survey from the Associated General Contractors of America. Last year, the construction industry added 210,000 new jobs, which marked a 35% year-over-year jump, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  in the real estate sector, commercial and residential industry and in private construction projects.""Construction firms appear to be very optimistic about 2018 as they expect demand for all types of construction services to continue to expand,"" Associated General Contractors of America CEO Stephen E. Sandherr said in a  .""This optimism is likely based on current economic conditions, an increasingly business-friendly regulatory environment and expectations the Trump administration will boost infrastructure investments.""With that said, let's take a look at three construction stocks that investors might want to scoop up before the spring-time building boom really picks up.1. Last week, this industrial and construction supply wholesale giant posted Q4 sales that climbed 14.8% year-over-year. Fastenal's strong fourth-quarter helped its shares climb to a new all-time high of $56.73 per share on Wednesday. However, it doesn't seem like the company will have a hard time breaking into a new range as its growth is expected to continue.Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2018, Fastenal is projected to see its revenues surge 10.63% to hit $1.16 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. Earnings are expected to jump by 30.43% in the quarter. Fastenal is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and sports ""A"" grades for both Growth and Momentum in our Styles Scores system.On top of all of this, the company has earned six upward earnings estimate revisions against no downgrades for its current quarter, against no downgrades, all within the last 60 days. During this same time period, Fastenal earned a nine to zero ratio for its full year, as it seems analysts are indeed projecting a big year for this construction industry firm.2. Shares of this construction industry titan are currently hovering around their all-time high as investors anticipate strong fourth-quarter results from CAT, which is set to report Q4 earnings Thursday morning before the opening bell.Caterpillar is expected to see its Q4 EPS skyrocket 113% to hit $1.77, while its sales are projected to pop by 24%, based on current Zacks Consensus Estimates. These estimates take into account the massive construction industry gains at the close of 2017 that saw total construction spending hit a record $1.257 trillion in November, according to the Commerce Department. If these estimates are topped or matched-which CAT has done in 15 of the last 16 quarters, including the trailing 11 periods-shares of the construction icon are likely to fly into a new range.CAT is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and looks poised to benefit from the 2018 construction industry expansion.3. Shares of this manufacturing and construction equipment firm have soared 26.93% in the last 12 weeks and currently rest just below their all-time high. Deere's recent climb comes after the company posted strong Q4 results in late November. Looking ahead, investors should note that 2018 is projected to be another great year for Deere.Within the last 60 days, Deere has earned eight upward earnings estimate revisions for its current full-year against no downgrades. What's more, the company has topped or matched earnings estimates every quarter for the last four years.Deere is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and rocks an overall ""B"" VGM score, supported by ""B"" grades for Value and Momentum in our Style Scores system. In its upcoming quarter, Deere is projected to see its earnings reach $1.13 per share, which would mark an 85.25% year-over-year jump. On top of this EPS growth projection, Deere's sales are expected surge over 36% to reach $6.40 billion.Looking even further down the road, the company is expected to see both its top and bottom-line grow by over 22% during its full fiscal 2018-and these might only go up if the U.S. construction industry expansion predictions prove true.Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Improving job scenario, housing market recovery, merchandising initiatives and post hurricane activities along with efforts to enhance omni-channel capabilities have played an instrumental role in the company's success.The stock has surged 39.3% in six months, outperforming the  's gain of 37.7% and S&P 500's increase of 13.7%. Further, a  of B and long-term earnings growth rate of 14.6% highlight this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock's inherent potential.Home Depot has been implementing several initiatives to drive long-term growth. It remains keen on building the interconnected capabilities and improved fulfillment options by launching its customer order management system and the buy online deliver from store capability. Further, the company is gaining from consistent focus on improving customer experience, solid execution and consistent housing market recovery.Also, the company has been revamping itself by concentrating on square footage growth and maximizing productivity from its existing store base. Management has implemented significant changes in its store operations to make them simpler and more customer-friendly. We believe these initiatives will induce more traffic to its stores and boost Home Depot's performance.Meanwhile, Home Depot has undertaken several initiatives to deliver growth with regard to pro-customers. Evidently, the Compact Power Equipment buyout marked another step toward improving portfolio service offerings for its pro customers and is likely to contribute to the company's gross margin in fiscal 2017. Additionally, the company's disciplined capital allocation strategy aids it to make strategic business investments and shareholder-friendly moves.Home Depot has been reporting strong financial figures since 2008 with steady improvement in revenues and earnings per share. This robust trend continued in third-quarter fiscal 2017, which marked fifth consecutive sales beat with earnings maintaining its five-year trend of positive surprises. Consequently, management raised its fiscal 2017 guidance and anticipates earnings per share to be up nearly 14% to $7.36 in fiscal 2017, up from the previous guidance of 13% growth to $7.29.Furthermore, analysts are growing bullish on the stock as apparent from the rise in the company's earnings estimates.

 is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Jan 17, before the opening bell.Increased installation of industrial vending machines is expected to boost sales and profits in the to-be-reported quarter as it is one of the primary growth drivers. Sales through its vending machines continued to grow at or near a double-digit pace in each of the first three quarters of 2017. Fastenal signed 15,089 vending machines during the first nine months of 2017, reflecting an increase of 5.5% from the prior-year quarter.Notably, the average daily sales growth rate of 15.4% in November was higher than the 13.8% increase in October 2017. However, average daily sales growth rate of 13.8% in October was lower than the 15.3% increase in September 2017.Moreover, a continual increase in the number of on-site locations is likely to expand Fastenal's market share and contribute to the quarterly numbers. The company signed 213 new onsite locations during the first nine months of 2017 and had 555 active sites as on Sep 30, 2017, reflecting an increase of 47.6% year over year. The company aims to achieve 275-300 onsite signings in 2017, compared with 176 signings in 2016.We are also encouraged by Fastenal's acquisition of certain assets of industrial and fastener supply distributor - Manufacturer's Supply Company (Mansco) - in March 2017. This ensures Fastenal's presence in markets where it has not meaningfully contributed in the past. Mansco contributed 130 basis points (bps) to total sales growth of 11.8% in the last reported quarter and is expected to contribute in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Based on sustained strength in most of its end markets and strong momentum in vending machines installations and onsite locations, the company is confident about reporting solid top-line growth in the fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.08 billion, implying 14.2% year over year growth. The consensus estimate for earnings stands at 45 cents, reflecting a 12.5% year-over-year increase.However, we are apprehensive about Fastenal's changes in product and customer mix that have been hurting the gross margin for quite some time now. Gross margin of 49.4% in the first nine months of 2017 dropped 10 bps from the prior-year quarter.Also, foreign exchange headwinds may dampen prospects. Unfavorable currency impacted sales by 0.5% in October and 0.4% in November 2017.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Fastenal has the right combination of two main ingredients - a positive  and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher - for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.

 is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jan 5. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 14.4%.In fact, its earnings have outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 13.6% in the trailing four quarters. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement. | The question lingering in investors' minds now is whether Constellation Brands will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal third quarter has declined in the last 30 days. The current estimate of $1.87 per share for the to-be-reported quarter reflects year-over-year decline of nearly 4.7%. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1.86 billion, which is 2.9% higher than the year-ago quarter.We note that the stock has outperformed the industry in the last three months. The company's shares have surged 14.3%, while the  grew 3%.Constellation Brands has been on a roll owing to strong brand portfolio, strategic initiatives and robust quarterly results. The company's focus on brand building, strength in beer business and efforts to include new products in its wine and spirits portfolio are the key catalysts. Further, it has been gaining from effective integration and growth of recently acquired brands, higher margins, solid overall depletion trends and strong consumer demand.In fact, these factors assisted the company to showcase another sterling performance in first-quarter fiscal 2018, marking its 16th straight quarter of earnings growth year-over-year and 11th straight positive surprise. Moreover, sales advanced while favorable pricing, volumes and lower cost of goods sold provided a boost to margins.Further, the company continues to gain from the recent buyouts and strength in the beer business, which encouraged management to raise fiscal 2018 earnings view. Management also hiked fiscal 2018 operating income targets for the beer segment. The company now envisions adjusted earnings guidance in a range of $7.90-$8.10 per share. Operating income is now anticipated to grow 13-15% for the beer segment.The company is also on track with its Nava brewery expansion, while it also enhanced wine portfolio with the buyout of Schrader Cellars. These factors make us optimistic about the company's upcoming results.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Constellation Brands is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

 has been gaining from its store growth initiatives, omni-channel strategies, solid earnings and sales growth trend, and effective inventory management. Further, the recent Petsense acquisition is likely to bolster the company's presence in the pet specialty space, which is a growing market.These factors helped the stock gain 18.9% in the last three months, surpassing the  's 4% growth. Also, the company has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a long-term earnings growth rate of 14%.Let's discuss the initiatives taken by the company to induce long-term growth.Tractor Supply is on track with its growth initiatives including expansion of store base and incorporation of technological advancements to induce traffic and drive sales. Additionally, the company leverages an extensive network of stores to penetrate into target markets, which in turn enables it to generate healthy sales and gain market share. Evidently, the company is planning to achieve its long-term domestic store growth target of 2,500 stores.Tractor Supply is keen on synchronizing its physical and digital operations to provide a seamless shopping experience to its customers. This is clear from progress on its One Tractor initiative, which focuses on connecting stores and online shopping. Of late, the company also initiated Buy Online Pick Up in Store program that has been successful in contributing nearly 75% to online sales in the third quarter. Meanwhile, Tractor Supply continues to expand its Neighbor's Club customer rewards program. Both these initiatives are expected to boost the top line. The company expects long-term results to benefit from its mobile POS and stockyard initiatives as well.Tractor Supply has been stringently focusing on managing inventories to minimize effect of weather on its results and capitalize on seasonal demand. In fact, the key focus here has been enhancement of IT systems and supply chain. Additionally, it has been investing in various new systems including demand planning, improved pricing, inventory allocation, all of which are directed toward generating supply chain efficiencies in order to better manage global inventories.Furthermore, the company remains focused on the execution of its digital priorities lending support needed to bolster growth at merchandising, customer facing and logistics capabilities. In this regard, Tractor Supply expects to complete the construction of its planned New York distribution center by the third quarter of 2018.Tractor Supply is progressing well with the integration of the recently acquired Petsense LLC, which has opened its doors to the roughly $60 billion pet market. Notably, this acquisition complements its existing pet business operating under the HomeTown Pet Stores banner. As part of the integration, the company successfully converted its two HomeTown Pet stores to Petsense in the first quarter.In addition, the company is on schedule to launch a premium dog and cat food brand - True Source - in its Petsense stores. Tractor Supply also intends to launch an e-commerce site for Petsense toward the end of the fourth quarter with the Buy Online Pick Up in Store facility expected in spring 2018.Tractor Supply has a notable record of delivering earnings and sales growth for more than two years now. Following a miss in the second quarter, the company's top- and bottom-line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in third-quarter 2017 backed by solid comparable store sales (comps) growth and effective inventory management. Comps were driven by strength across all regions and major product categories. Further, the top line was fueled by sales of emergency response products.For the fourth quarter, the company remains well-positioned to drive growth owing to increased demand for cold weather products. Backed by these trends, management raised its earnings and sales outlook for 2017.Despite the above-mentioned tailwinds, deflation remains a concern for Tractor Supply, which is likely to linger in 2017. Furthermore, management expects SG&A expenses deleverage in the fourth quarter. The headwinds related to unfavorable product mix and elevated transport costs are also likely to dent gross margin this year.Nevertheless, the company is poised for long-term growth driven by its inherent strength and growth initiatives.Investors interested in the sector may consider Beacon Roofing Supply Inc.  , Fastenal Company  and Canada Goose Holdings Inc.  . While Beacon Roofing sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Fastenal and Canada Goose carry a Zacks Rank #2.

hares of  have rallied 28.3% in the last six months, outperforming the 21.8% gain of its  and 11% increase of the S&P 500 companies.The company's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and  of B also indicate that it is a compelling investment proposition at the moment. This is because our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 offer the best investment opportunities for investors.Further, earnings estimates have risen over the past few weeks, suggesting that sentiments on Fastenal are moving in the right direction. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings inched up 0.5% reflecting bullish analyst sentiments.Let us delve deeper into the other factors that make this stock a lucrative pick.Increased installation of vending machines and onsite locations along with the Mansco acquisition are expected to boost sales.In fact, Fastenal's industrial vending process has been a key growth driver. Sales through vending machines continued to grow at or near a double-digit pace in each of the first three quarters of 2017. In the first nine months of 2017, the company signed 15,089 vending machines reflecting an increase of 5.5% from the year-ago period.Apart from vending machines, increased onsite locations have contributed significantly to sales. Notably, Fastenal provides onsite location in which a mini-Fastenal shop is basically located in a customer's plant. The company signed 213 new onsite locations in the first nine months of 2017 and had 555 active sites as on Sep 30, 2017, indicating a year-over-year increase of 47.6%.In 2017, Fastenal intends to achieve 275-300 onsite signings compared with 176 in 2016 and 80 in 2015. Increased number of onsite locations is likely to boost Fastenal's market share.Again, the acquisition of Mansco establishes Fastenal's presence in a market where it has not meaningfully contributed in the past. In the third quarter of 2017, Mansco contributed 130 basis points to total sales growth of 11.8% and is expected to contribute further.Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is expected to increase 10.7% in 2017 more than the industry's projected growth rate of 7.7%. Additionally, sales in 2018 are expected to increase 9.1%.Fastenal's trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) supports its growth potential. Its ROE in the trailing 12 months is 27.3%, way more than its industry's average of 14.3%. This reflects the company's efficient usage of shareholders' funds.The Zacks Building Products - Retail Industry rallied 34% year to date, outperforming the S&P 500's gain of 20%. Also, a solid industry rank (among the top 28% out of 265 industries) signals that the companies in this space are likely to benefit from favorable broader factors in the immediate future.A few better-ranked stocks in the  are Beacon Roofing Supply, Inc.  , Tecnoglass Inc.  and Restaurant Brands International Inc.  .While Beacon Roofing sports a Zacks Rank #1, the other companies carry a Zacks Rank #2. You can see  .Beacon Roofing is likely to witness 41.3% earnings growth in fiscal 2018.Tecnoglass is expected to see 30.2% growth in 2018 earnings.Restaurant Brands is expected to see 36.2% growth in 2018 earnings.Full disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

 has been gaining from robust earnings trend, disciplined capital allocation, growth of pro-category, steady housing market recovery and strong consumer demand. This has helped the company's stock surge 41.5% year to date, outperforming the  's 35.6% growth.Additionally, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock boasts a  of B and a long-term earnings growth rate of 13.4%. Let's delve into the other factors which are driving the stock.The company's both top and bottom lines grew year over year and topped estimates in third-quarter fiscal 2017. While sales marked fifth straight beat, earnings retained its five-year long trend of positive surprises. Results gained from strength in the company's core business, continued focus on introducing innovative products, boosting interconnected customer experience and driving productivity. Further, the company continued to reap the benefits of a steady housing market recovery and strong customer demand.Backed by solid year-to-date performance, strength of its core business and estimated gains from hurricane recovery activities, the company raised fiscal 2017 sales and earnings guidance. Consequently, the company's estimates witnessed an uptrend in the last 30 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 moved up by 1 cent each to $1.62 and $7.37, respectively.Home Depot is gaining from consistent focus on improving customer experience and solid execution, retaining its leading position in the home improvement industry. The company has been revamping itself by concentrating on square footage growth and maximizing productivity from its existing stores. Further, the company remains focused on developing merchandising tools and increasing investment in e-commerce to boost the top line and enhance market share.The company has also been gaining from its focus on Professional Customers or Pro-Customers and has undertaken several strides in this regard, like the acquisition of Compact Power Equipment. Prior to this, the company invested in Interline brands and maintenance, repair and operations products, which are generating impressive results.In response to the changing customer preferences, Home Depot has been building its interconnected capabilities to establish sync between physical and digital stores. For this, the company redesigned its website with enhanced features for better search and faster checkout, upgraded mobile app, and addition of the estimated time of arrival feature.Further, the company improved fulfillment options by launching its customer order management system and the Buy Online Deliver From Store capability. These initiatives led online sales to improve nearly 19% in third-quarter fiscal 2017, representing 6.2% of total sales. We believe that these initiatives will drive the company's top- and bottom-line growth in the long run.Despite such positives, Home Depot continues to be plagued by strained gross margin over the past few quarters. While hurricane-related activities aided comps growth, gross margins on such sales were significantly below the company's average. Evidently, the company's gross margin contracted 10 basis points (bps) in third-quarter fiscal 2017. Prior to this, the company's gross margin declined 6 bps in the preceding quarter, and 10 bps each in first-quarter fiscal 2017 and fourth-quarter fiscal 2016. Moreover, management expects gross margin to decline about 12 bps from last year in fiscal 2017.Investors interested in the same sector may consider Beacon Roofing Supply Inc.  , Fastenal Company  and Canada Goose Holdings Inc.  . While Beacon Roofing sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Fastenal and Canada Goose carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see  .Beacon Roofing delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 6.4% in the trailing four quarters.

 is slated to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jan 3. The big question facing investors is whether this drug store retailer will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported.Last quarter, the company reported loss per share of 1 cent, which was in line with estimates. Further, the company has underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 20.8% in the trailing four quarters. Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement. | The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is a loss of 2 cents per share, against earnings of 2 cents per share reported in the year-ago quarter. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable ahead of the earnings release. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $7.74 billion, down 4.4% from the prior-year quarter.Following the recent sale of 250 stores to Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc.  , Rite Aid's shares have shown some momentum. The company's shares dipped 2.4% in the last three months, narrower than the  's decline of 7.1%.After the aforementioned sale of stores to Walgreens, Rite Aid is poised to improve financial leverage and balance sheet using the funds from the transaction. To strengthen operations, Rite Aid remains focused on remodeling wellness stores. These newly renovated wellness stores tempt customers to spend more time on selecting their personal care products, consequently enabling the company to generate increased sales.In another move to enhance customer experience, Rite Aid started accepting payments via digital wallets like Apple Pay, Google Wallet, as well as other tap and pay credit and debit cards. Recently, the company resorted to accepting Apple Pay online, as customers are using smartphones to make transactions. In fact, management stated that over half of its website visitors access www.riteaid.com from their mobiles, the most being iPhone users. This development is likely to provide customers with a more convenient and better shopping experience that in turn will attract more traffic.Additionally, the company has been undertaking a number of strategies to drive growth such as the expansion of its pharmacy and clinical services, along with the reduction of costs. Rite Aid has utilized additional resources, such as the introduction of HealthSpot telehealth booths at its Ohio pharmacies, addition of RediClinics to its stores, its Wellness+ with Plenti program, as well as the Flu Immunization program to stimulate customer demand amid the soft macroeconomic scenario. The company also acquired EnvisionRx, which will enable it to offer cost-friendly health plans and solutions for employers, drive growth and bolster shareholder value.On the cost front, the company is focusing on generating cost savings through centralized indirect procurement of drugs and reduction in supply chain costs. We believe that these programs and initiatives will enable the company to increase customer base and facilitate the generation of long-term profitability as well.However, the company remains prone to competition from rivals. Rite Aid's generic drug sales have been adversely affected by Wal-Mart's strategy of entering the retail generic drug market. Due to Wal-Mart's wide array of manufacturers in India, Israel, and the United States, the mass merchant offers generic drugs at a discounted price compared with its rival companies. Further, speculations about Amazon.com Inc.'s  entry in the drugstore business remain a threat.Nonetheless, let's see if Rite Aid's growth drivers can help counter the challenges this time around.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Rite Aid is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  .Rite Aid has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, with both the Zacks Consensus Estimate and Most Accurate Estimate pegged at a loss of 2 cents per share.

"With earnings season over and the likelihood of a tax reform deal baked into stock prices, some traders are wondering if there are any other catalysts that can drive stocks higher - yes, short squeeze stocks!Click to Enlarge According to our biweekly Short Squeeze Model Report. According to the most recent run of this data, the short sellers have been increasing their bearish bets on a number of stocks over the previous two weeks, creating a generous number of short squeeze rally candidates.It is normal to see short interest go higher as some traders try to fade a rally by increasing their bets against further gains.Our proprietary model scans for those stocks that are maintaining strong, low volatility trends higher that may see some short-term selling, but are more likely to continue higher. This creates a volatility rally as the shorts finally move to close their positions to avoid further losses.The following stocks are among the top choices of our most recent short cover rally contender list. Let's take a look at the top three on our list according to the short interest data and their charts.Software company  (NASDAQ:  ) posted a nice quarter of earnings results in late October and the stock has maintained its rally until we started to see some rotation out of the technology universe toward the end of November.The reversal in Verisign and other technology issues appears to be more of a function of profit-taking than anything else as portfolio managers try to lock-in gains near their high watermarks. Considering this, the recent pullback should be seen a ""healthy"" and an opportunity to grab a good stock on a dip.The rub here is that the short sellers are now on the defensive and haven't been closing positions on the rally. The current short interest ratio indicates that it will take more than 18 days to cover current short positions. Furthermore, the current short interest represents 15% of the outstanding shares available to trade.This indicates that a bounce in Verisign's stock price, which has technical support at $110 from its rising 50-day moving average, will spark a short covering rally that will likely target a move to $120-$125.Industrial companies are in the crosshairs of the bulls considering the more recent data on economic growth. A focus on the housing and infrastructure areas of the economy means companies like  (NASDAQ:  ) are in the right place at the right time.Fastenal's chart has been strong recently as the migration of cash into the industrial names has pumped prices higher. The shorts have got to be feeling the pain, but we've not seen signs that the rally has been driven by shorts covering their positions. This means that the stock is still ripe for a ""covering rally.""Short interest on Fastenal sits at an awesome 16 times the average daily volume. This sets Fastenal up for another leg in the rally.The recent pullback, about 3.5%, is likely to engage the ""buy the dip"" crowd, which will then see Fastenal move back toward its highs at $55. At that point, we expect a short squeeze rally to push shares toward $63.Another industrial name that is garnering the attention of traders is  (NYSE:  ). The company, well-known for its tools, has been on a tear lately by tacking more than 8% on to its price after crossing above chart resistance at $160.This stock is in the earlier stages of a rally cycle and gaining momentum, which bodes poorly for the short sellers betting against it.Currently, Snap-on shares are set-up to see a ""golden cross"" formation as the 50-day moving average gets ready to cross above the 200-day moving average. This is often seen as a bullish signal for intermediate-term outlooks.That signal is the enemy of the short sellers that currently hold more than 15 days worth of the stock's daily volume as bets against it moving higher.That's going to end as soon as the stock will start to attract buys on the current dip. Watch for a break above $173 to trigger the short covering rally that will target a move to $195.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@3 Stocks to Buy Before the Shorts Get Squeezed@2017-12-13@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-stocks-buy-shorts-get-squeezed-2017-12-13
"n recent trading, shares of Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $51.50, changing hands for $52.39/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 8 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Fastenal Co., but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $47.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $55.00. The standard deviation is $3.162.But the whole reason to look at the  FAST price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with FAST crossing above that average target price of $51.50/share, investors in FAST have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $51.50 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Fastenal Co.:

 is slated to release third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Nov 16. The question lingering in investors' minds is, whether this leading specialty retailer will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the soon-to-be reported quarter.The company's earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 9.3%.Let's see how things are shaping up prior to the earnings announcement.In order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before earnings release, let's have a look at the earnings estimate revisions. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal third quarter has been stable at 55 cents in the past 30 days but reflects more than 8% decline from the year-ago quarter.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $3.8 billion to be almost in line with the prior-year quarter. The consensus mark for net sales at the Gap Global, the Banana Republic Global and the Old Navy Global segments are pegged at $1,269 million, $540 million and 1,773 million, respectively. While these estimates reflect growth of 3% for Gap Global and 0.9% for Old Navy Global, it reveals a decline of 6.7% for the Banana Republic Global segment, compared with the last quarter.Gap's shares have gained 14.4% year to date, as against the  's decline of 20.6%. This performance was driven by its solid focus on enhancing product quality and responsiveness to changing consumer trends. Meanwhile, the company has been making constant efforts to boost its digital and mobile offerings, besides improving product acceptance. Also, Gap's new growth strategy focused on growing its Old Navy and Athleta brands looks promising.However, results continue to be soft at the company's namesake and Banana Republic brands. Moreover, going forward, management expects SG&A expenses to increase at a higher rate than the first half. This mainly stems from increased product, marketing and digital investments for the significant back-to-school selling season. The company expects the rise in costs to hurt its bottom line.Further, Gap's significant international presence exposes it to adverse currency fluctuations. Though the company's earnings and sales topped estimates in the previous quarter, currency headwinds caused results to decline year over year. Unfortunately, management expects these hurdles to persist in fiscal 2017, which in turn might dent the quarterly results.Our proven model does not show that Gap is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both - a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) - for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . | Gap has an Earnings ESP of -0.76%. Although its Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, the stock's negative ESP does not make us confident of a positive earnings surprise.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Zumiez Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +0.69% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see  .The Home Depot, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +0.40% and a Zacks Rank #2.Fastenal Company  has an Earnings ESP of +0.12% and a Zacks Rank #3.It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over.

ore than a month has gone by since the last earnings report for  . Shares have added about 6.9% in that time frame, outperforming the market.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Fastenal's earnings of 50 cents per share in the third quarter of 2017 were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Earnings also grew 13.4% year over year.Net sales of $1.13 billion were also in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Sales grew 11.8% year over year driven by higher units owing to improvement in underlying market demand and growth in industrial vending business and existing Onsite locations.Fastenal's daily sales grew 13.6% in the quarter, better than the 10.6% increase in the second quarter of 2017.On a monthly basis, daily sales increased 15.3% in September, 12.8% in August and 12.9% in July, compared with 2.8%, 0.3% and 2.1%, respectively, a year ago.Sales of fastener products (used mainly for industrial production and accounting for approximately 35.6% of the company's third-quarter sales) increased 12.1% in the quarter, 3.8% of which came from the acquisition of the Manufacturers Supply Company (Mansco) business. Non-fastener product sales (used mainly for maintenance and represented 64.4% of the quarterly sales) increased 14.6%.As of Sep 30, 2017, Fastenal operated 69,058 vending machines, up 14.3% year over year. During the quarter, the company signed 4,771 machine contracts, in line with the year-ago figure.After a soft 2013, vending trends improved through 2014, 2015 and 2016 as management's efforts to enhance the quality of signings/installs paid off.Fastenal signed 81 new Onsite locations during the quarter, up 97.6% from 41 a year ago. As of Sep 30, 2017, the company had 555 active sites, representing an increase of 47.6%.Additionally, Fastenal signed 42 new national account contracts in the third quarter (representing 48.7% of total revenues in the quarter). Net sales from its national account customers grew 17.3% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis.Gross margin of 49.1% in the third quarter of 2017 declined 20 basis points (bps) year over year owing to changes in product and customer mix, the addition of Mansco (which has a lower gross profit product mix than the company), disruption owing to the recent hurricanes and commodity inflation.Operating margin improved 20 bps year over year to 20.2% in the quarter, mainly driven by lower operating and administrative expenses.Cash and cash equivalents were $133.4 million as of Sep 30, 2017, up from $112.7 million as of Dec 31, 2016. Long-term debt was $432 million, up from $379.5 million at the end of 2016.Analysts were quiet during the last month as none of them issued any earnings estimate revisions. | At this time, Fastenal's stock has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a bit on the momentum front with a C.The stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.The company's stock is suitable for growth investors and to a lesser degree momentum.The stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

 's  industrial vending process has the potential to revolutionize the industrial distribution system and boost profits. Industrial vending is one of the primary growth drivers for Fastenal which has the potential to drive sales and profits.Sales through vending machines continued to grow at or near a double-digit pace in each of the first three quarters of 2017. Fastenal signed 15,089 vending machines in the first nine months of 2017, reflecting an increase of 5.5% from the year ago period.Apart from vending machines, increased onsite locations have contributed significantly to sales. Fastenal provides onsite location, in which a mini-Fastenal shop is basically located in a customer's plant.The company signed 213 new onsite locations in the first nine months of 2017 and had 555 active sites as on Sep 30, 2017, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 47.6%. The company aims to achieve 275-300 onsite signings in 2017, compared with 176 in 2016 and 80 in 2015. Increased number of onsite locations is likely to boost Fastenal's market share.Additionally, Fastenal's cost-saving program Pathway-to-Profit is encouraging. Under this, the company focuses on increasing the average store size which leads to better earnings. Notably, shares of Fastenal have gained 23% in the last six months, compared with 13% growth of its  .Negative customer/product mix as a result of faster growth of lower margin national accounts and a lower proportion of higher margin fasteners are likely to affect results. The customer mix shifted toward the large-account end-market and the product mix shifted from high-margin fastener products to low-margin non-fastener products.Gross margin of 49.4% in the first nine months of 2017 dropped 10 basis points (bps) from the prior-year period. Overall, 2016 gross margin dropped 80 bps from the 2015 level.The company buys and sells various types of steel products, primarily consisting of different types of threaded fasteners. As such Fastenal is subjected to the impact of change in the price of steel. In the first nine months of 2017, the company saw a inflation in steel pricing.Nevertheless, increased onsite locations and installation of vending machines along with the cost control initiatives are expected to boost growth. Notably, earnings estimates for 2018 moved up 0.5% over the last 30 days, reflecting analyst optimism.A few better-ranked stocks in the  are Beacon Roofing Supply, Inc.  , Tecnoglass Inc.  and Famous Dave's of America, Inc.  .Beacon Roofing sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while the other companies carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see Beacon Roofing is likely to witness 41.3% earnings growth in fiscal 2018.Tecnoglass is expected to see 30.2% growth in 2018 earnings.Famous Dave's of America earnings estimate for fiscal 2018 improved from a loss of 6 cents to earnings of 6 cents.Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

While most of the retail sector has struggled over the past few years,  (NYSE:  ) stock has gone the other way. Home Depot stock is up 30% in the last year, 80% in the last three years and 160% over the past five years. One key reason for the optimism toward HD stock is that its model should be more resistant to e-commerce competition - that is,  (NASDAQ:  ) - than other retailers. Source: That's certainly been the case so far. Comparable-store sales in the U.S. rose 6.2% in fiscal 2016 (ending January) and another 6.3% in the first half of FY17. Home Depot comps continue to outpace those of rival  (NYSE:  ), which is one reason HD stock continues to outperform LOW.One big reason for the share gains against Lowe's, and the growth in a challenging time for brick-and-mortar retail, is Home Depot's success with professional customers. As Nicole Sinclair pointed out at Yahoo! Finance this summer, Home Depot gets  , against ~30% for Lowe's. And that category has driven recent growth in particular, with HD management disclosing on both the Q1 and Q2 conference calls that the same-store sales growth rate for professional customers was double that of DIY buyers.For now, that's good news. But for two different reasons, it's worth wondering whether in the long term, the increasing reliance on professional customers might actually turn out to be a concern.The primary concern surrounding the increasing reliance on professional customers is the potential cyclical impact should the current, reasonably strong housing cycle reverse. Home Depot comps are rising, and some of those gains are coming from taking market share. But the company also is benefiting from increased demand both in terms of renovation and new home construction. And that direct demand is going to be most notable in the professional category, which has larger spend and is more economically sensitive.That alone doesn't suggest that HD stock is overvalued at the moment. But from a long-term standpoint, it is a potential risk. Part of Home Depot's current outperformance appears to be coming from the pro category. And those are precisely the customers that will be the first to lose work if macro conditions turn. For now, with broad markets at an all-time high and the U.S. economy reasonably strong, that doesn't seem like a near-term risk. But it does leave Home Depot potentially more exposed than Lowe's when the cycle does turn.There's a secular concern to Home Depot's strategy as well. HD has moved aggressively into the B2B (business to business) and MRO (maintenance, repair, and operations) distribution spaces with both its emphasis on professional sales and its  in 2015. But in that space, Amazon may be a bigger problem than in the legacy Home Depot stores.After all, Home Depot is having  , as James Brumley pointed out earlier this month. The need for DIY customers, in particular, to view objects in person and/or ask for assistance helps limit online competition. So does the low dollar value of many home improvement items, which can make shipping costs prohibitive.But, in B2B, it's a different story. And it's worth noting that the distribution space, in particular, is one where investors are showing a lot of caution. The  has sent shares of major distributors like  (NYSE:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ) tumbling. GWW shares have recovered after a strong earnings report, but they still fell nearly 40% just between February and August. FAST stock still trades below early-2012 levels.Mid- to long-term, the category where HD is having the most strength right now may turn out to be its most competitive. Pro customers generally know what they want and for how much. Home Depot's delivery efforts and incentive programs mean it will likely keep most of those customers. But the Amazon threat HD bulls dismiss in the consumer business may be larger than some realize on the professional side.To be sure, those risks don't suggest a short of HD stock, or anything close. This remains a dominant franchise, with impressive earnings growth. The dividend yields over 2%, and Home Depot has raised its targeted payout ratio to 55% from 50%, implying larger increases going forward. And a ~20x forward EPS multiple isn't particularly aggressive, especially relative to recent growth.But an investor still needs to trust the cycle to buy HD at current levels, and trust that the company can manage the Amazon threat in B2B. On both fronts, I'm optimistic, but cautiously so. And I see enough risk to keep HD stock from being  compelling just off all-time highs.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Could Home Depot Inc Stock Have a Professional Problem?@2017-10-24@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/could-home-depot-inc-stock-have-a-professional-problem-2017-10-24

"n this series, we look through the most recent  report, and then we cherry pick only those companies that have experienced insider buying within the past six months. The officers and directors of a company tend to have a unique insider's view of the business, and presumably the only reason an insider would choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money - maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both. So when stocks turn up that see insider buying, and are also top ranked, investors are wise to take notice. One such company is Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST), which saw buying by Director Stephen L. Eastman.Back on August 22, Eastman invested $32,464.00 into 800 shares of FAST, for a cost per share of $40.58. In trading on Thursday, shares were changing hands as low as $46.33 per share, which is 14.2% above Eastman's purchase price. It should be noted that Eastman has collected $0.32/share in dividends since the time of their purchase, so they are currently up 15.0% on their purchase from a total return basis. Fastenal Co. shares are currently trading +1.63% on the day. The chart below shows the one year performance of FAST shares, versus its 200 day moving average:Looking at the chart above, FAST's low point in its 52 week range is $38.09 per share, with $52.74 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $47.42. By comparison, below is a table showing the prices at which insider buying was recorded over the last six months:
  
The DividendRank report noted that among the coverage universe, FAST shares displayed both attractive valuation metrics and strong profitability metrics. The report also cited the strong quarterly dividend history at Fastenal Co., and favorable long-term multi-year growth rates in key fundamental data points.The report stated, ''  ''The annualized dividend paid by Fastenal Co. is $1.28/share, currently paid in quarterly installments, and its most recent dividend ex-date was on 10/24/2017. Below is a long-term dividend history chart for FAST, which the report stressed as being of key importance. Indeed, studying a company's past  can be of good help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Fastenal Named Top Dividend Stock With Insider Buying and 2.75% Yield (FAST)@2017-10-26@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/fastenal-named-top-dividend-stock-insider-buying-and-275-yield-fast-2017-10-26
e expect  to beat expectations when it reports third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Oct 11, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company's earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4%. Moreover, Fastenal surpassed expectations in two of the last four quarters, the average being 1.8%.Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Our proven model shows that Fastenal is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. :  , which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is pegged at +0.60%. A positive Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . |  : Fastenal currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates. Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Fastenal's Zacks Rank #3 and +0.60% ESP makes us reasonably confident about an earnings beat in the to-be-reported quarter.Increased installation of industrial vending machines is expected to boost sales and profits in the to-be-reported quarter as it is one of the primary growth drivers for Fastenal. Moreover, a continual increase in the number of on-site locations is likely to expand Fastenal's market share and contribute to the quarterly numbers.We are also encouraged by Fastenal's acquisition of certain assets of industrial and fastener supply distributor - Manufacturer's Supply Company (Mansco) - in March 2017. This ensures Fastenal's presence in markets where it has not meaningfully contributed in the past. Mansco contributed 3.6% to fastener daily sales growth of 7.9% in the last reported quarter and is expected to contribute in the to-be-reported quarter as well.However, we are apprehensive about Fastenal's changes in product and customer mix that have been hurting the gross margin for quite some time now. Also, sales in the quarter could be adversely affected owing to the impact of Hurricane Harvey and Irma.For the quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stands at 50 cents, reflecting a 13.4% year-over-year increase. Meanwhile, the estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.13 billion, implying 11.1% growth.Here are some companies in the  sector that, according to our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:McDonald's Corporation  has an Earnings ESP of +1.29% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see  .The company is slated to release quarterly results on Oct 24.Domino's Pizza Inc  has an Earnings ESP of +2.12% and a Zacks Rank #2. The company is scheduled to release quarterly results on Oct 12.Bravo Brio Restaurant Group, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +6.25% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is expected to release quarterly results on Nov 1.It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over.

Maintaining a focus on the fact that the market is entering one of the weaker seasonal periods of the year, traders are wise to maintain a vigil watch on any changing trends in the market. As of this week, we've seen an increase in the number of companies trading below their respective 50-day moving average, signaling that the market may be headed for some weakness.Today's three big stock charts takes a look at the charts of  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ) as three stocks that the market should be watching as they fight it out with their critical 50-day trendlines.Fastenal has been a good proxy for the market and industrial companies as they provide products for all types of industrial applications. The company is in the process of falling back into a bearish trend that should have investors selling and traders shorting the stock.Semiconductor companies are seeing a flow of cash from this outperforming group back into financials and healthcare companies. The result is that these companies are now starting to see critical technical trends get challenged.This applies more selling pressure and lowers price targets over the short-term.

nvestors considering a purchase of Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST) shares, but tentative about paying the going market price of $44.08/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2019 put at the $33 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $1.40. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 4.2% return against the $33 commitment, or a 3.2% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to FAST's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $33 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Fastenal Co. sees its shares decline 25.3% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $31.60 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $1.40 from $33), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 3.2% annualized rate of return.Worth considering, is that the annualized 3.2% figure actually exceeds the 2.9% annualized dividend paid by Fastenal Co., based on the current share price of $44.08. And yet, if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downside because the stock would have to lose 25.31% to reach the $33 strike price.Always important when discussing dividends is the fact that, in general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Fastenal Co., looking at the dividend history chart for FAST below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 2.9% annualized dividend yield.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Fastenal Co., and highlighting in green where the $33 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2019 put at the $33 strike for the 3.2% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Fastenal Co. (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $44.08) to be 24%.

e expect  to beat expectations when it reports second-quarter fiscal 2017 (ending Jul 29) results after the closing bell on Sep 6. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 25.00%. The company also surpassed expectations in each of the last four quarters, with the average beat being 25.02%. Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement. | Our proven model shows that RH is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key components. ESP: RH has an  of +2.88%. That is because the Most Accurate estimate is 49 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 47 cents. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . RH currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have significantly higher chances of beating earnings estimates. Conversely, stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.The combination of RH's favorable Zacks Rank and positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.The company's efforts toward redesigning its supply chain network, rationalizing product offerings and the Waterworks acquisition are driving growth and are expected to contribute in the to-be-reported quarter as well. RH's initiatives like RH Modern, RH Teen, RH Hospitality, redesign of RH Interiors Source Book, and rollout of Design Ateliers across its retail Galleries are expected to contribute to growth in 2017 and beyond.The company expects second-quarter revenues to be in the range of $595-$610 million, suggesting increase of 9-12% on a year-over-year basis.The company also announced the completion of its $700 million share repurchase program in July. RH repurchased 12.4 million shares during the second quarter, bringing the new share count to about 21.1 million shares. Combined with the 7.85 million shares repurchased under the company's $300 million program during the first quarter, RH has repurchased 20.2 million shares in fiscal 2017, representing roughly half of the shares outstanding at the end of fiscal 2016. The company exercises aggressive repurchase activity that has helped in driving the stock significantly.Given the completion of the share-repurchase program, second-quarter earnings are now projected to be in the range of 43-50 cents, assuming about 30 million weighted average shares for the second quarter. The company had expected EPS of 38-43 cents on 34.5 million weighted average shares previously.That said, the company had earlier stated that the margin outlook for the second quarter will be impacted by the continued disposition and discounting of inventory, and hence expects modest improvement. Gross margin is likely to be modestly positive.For the fiscal second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stands at $2.07, reflecting a 64.2% year-over-year increase. The estimate for revenues is pegged at $2.46 billion, implying 15.2% growth.Here are a few companies in the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector that, according to our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Dave & Buster's Entertainment, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +1.54% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is scheduled to release quarterly results on Sep 5.Zumiez Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +16.67% and a Zacks Rank #2. The company is slated to report quarterly results on Sep 7.Fastenal Company  has an Earnings ESP of +2.65% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see  .The company is expected to release its quarterly results on Oct 10.Since 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year. With compounding, rebalancing, and exclusive of fees, it can turn thousands into millions of dollars.But here's something even more remarkable: You can master this proven system without going to a single class or seminar. And then you can apply it to your portfolio in as little as 10 minutes a month.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

ooking at the universe of stocks we cover at  , in trading on Thursday, shares of Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST) were yielding above the 3% mark based on its quarterly dividend (annualized to $1.28), with the stock changing hands as low as $42.01 on the day. Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return. To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) back on 12/31/1999 - you would have paid $146.88 per share. Fast forward to 12/31/2012 and each share was worth $142.41 on that date, a decrease of $4.67/share over all those years. But now consider that you collected a whopping $25.98 per share in dividends over the same period, for a positive total return of 23.36%. Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.6%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 3% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable. Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST) is an S&P 500 company, giving it special status as one of the large-cap companies making up the S&P 500 Index.In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Fastenal Co., looking at the history chart for FAST below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 3% annual yield.    According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, FAST makes up 1.50% of the First Trust NASDAQ-100 Ex-Technology Sector Index Fund ETF (Symbol: QQXT) which is trading lower by about 1.3% on the day Thursday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@FAST Dividend Yield Pushes Past 3%@2017-08-17@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/fast-dividend-yield-pushes-past-3-2017-08-17
t has been about a month since the last earnings report for  . Shares have lost about 1.8% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Fastenal's earnings of $0.52 per share in the second quarter of 2017 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.50 by 4%. Earnings also grew 13.4% year over year.Net sales of $1,121.5 million surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,110 million by 1%. Sales grew 10.6% year over year on higher units owing to improvement in underlying market demand and growth in industrial vending business and existing Onsite locations.Fastenal's daily sales grew 10.6% in the quarter, higher than the 6.2% increase in the first quarter of 2017.On a monthly basis, daily sales increased 13% in June, 9.7% in May and 8.9% in April, compared with 0.0%, 1.1% and 3.8%, respectively, a year ago.Sales of fastener products (used mainly for industrial production and accounting for approximately 36.1% of the company's second-quarter sales) increased 7.9% in the quarter, 3.6% of which came from the acquisition of the Manufacturers Supply Company ('Mansco') business. Non-fastener product sales (used mainly for maintenance and represented 63.9% of the quarterly sales) increased 12.2%.As of Jun 30, 2017, Fastenal operated 66,577 vending machines, up 14.1% year over year. During the quarter, the company signed 4,881 machine contracts, up 0.3% year over year.After a soft 2013, vending trends improved through 2014, 2015 and 2016 as management's efforts to enhance the quality of signings/installs paid off.Fastenal signed 68 new Onsite locations during the quarter, up 54.5% from 44 signings a year ago. As of Jun 30, 2017, the company had 486 active sites, representing an increase of 45.9%.Additionally, Fastenal signed 51 new national account contracts in the second quarter (representing 47.8% of its total revenues in the quarter). Net sales from national account customers grew 13.2% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis.In order to better serve its customers, Fastenal introduced additional product Stock Keeping units (SKUs) in many of its branches at the end of 2015 and through most of 2016.

The upside was driven by improvement in supply chain initiatives, including relative growth in the sale of Fastenal brands, increased purchase throughout the organization and more efficient fleet utilization. However, changes in product and customer mix continued to affect gross profit as did the addition of Mansco.Operating margin improved 60 bps year over year to 21.2% in the quarter, mainly driven by higher gross profit and lower operating and administrative expenses.Cash and cash equivalents were $115.1 million as of Jun 30, 2017, up from $112.7 million as of Dec 31, 2016.

"n this series, we look through the most recent  report, and then we cherry pick only those companies that have experienced insider buying within the past six months. The officers and directors of a company tend to have a unique insider's view of the business, and presumably the only reason an insider would choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money - maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both. So when stocks turn up that see insider buying, and are also top ranked, investors are wise to take notice. One such company is Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST), which saw buying by Executive Vice-President William Joseph Drazkowski.Back on July 21, Drazkowski invested $42,359.00 into 1,000 shares of FAST, for a cost per share of $42.36. In trading on Wednesday, shares were changing hands as low as $43.73 per share, which is 3.2% above Drazkowski's purchase price. It should be noted that Drazkowski has collected $0.32/share in dividends since the time of their purchase, so they are currently up 4.0% on their purchase from a total return basis. Fastenal Co. shares are currently trading +0.15% on the day. The chart below shows the one year performance of FAST shares, versus its 200 day moving average:Looking at the chart above, FAST's low point in its 52 week range is $37.70 per share, with $52.74 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $44.16. By comparison, below is a table showing the prices at which insider buying was recorded over the last six months:
  
The DividendRank report noted that among the coverage universe, FAST shares displayed both attractive valuation metrics and strong profitability metrics. The report also cited the strong quarterly dividend history at Fastenal Co., and favorable long-term multi-year growth rates in key fundamental data points.The report stated, ''  ''The annualized dividend paid by Fastenal Co. is $1.28/share, currently paid in quarterly installments, and its most recent dividend ex-date was on 07/24/2017. Below is a long-term dividend history chart for FAST, which the report stressed as being of key importance.

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the WisdomTree U.S. Dividend ex-Financials Fund ETF (Symbol: DTN), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $89.22 per unit.With DTN trading at a recent price near $80.75 per unit, that means that analysts see 10.49% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of DTN's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are The Gap Inc (Symbol: GPS), Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST), and Exxon Mobil Corp (Symbol: XOM). Although GPS has traded at a recent price of $22.68/share, the average analyst target is 15.58% higher at $26.21/share. Similarly, FAST has 14.29% upside from the recent share price of $41.61 if the average analyst target price of $47.55/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting XOM to reach a target price of $86.08/share, which is 12.87% above the recent price of $76.26. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of GPS, FAST, and XOM:Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
  
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past.

Consumers' rapid shifts to online shopping have hit retailers hard, by affecting their top line. Consequently, retailers are in the process of switching from their traditional store concept to the new and attractive omni-channel concept.This in turn has led to intensifying industry competition, which in turn remains a threat for margins.

In the preceding quarter, the company reported in-line earnings. Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.The question lingering in investors' minds now is whether Kroger will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 57 cents, reflecting a year-over-year decline of over 18%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable in the past 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $35,475 million, up more than 2% from the year-ago quarter.A dominant position among the nation's largest grocery retailers enables Kroger to sustain sales growth, expand store base and boost market share. We believe there remain enormous opportunities to augment identical supermarket sales, alleviate gross margin pressure and improve operating margin. In our view, Kroger's long-term earnings per share growth rate target of 8-11% seem achievable. However, stiff competition, deflationary environment and cautious consumer spending are making things tough for the company. Management had earlier projected first-quarter earnings in the band of 55-59 cents a share. | Our proven model does not conclusively show that Kroger is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can see  .Kroger has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 57 cents.

Revenues for printed educational text books plunged 27% in third-quarter fiscal 2017. Despite reporting second straight quarter of earnings beat along with a year-over-year increase, as it posted third-quarter fiscal 2017, management still expects fiscal year earnings per share to be down by mid-single digits. Moreover, the company expects revenues to decline by low-single digit decline in fiscal 2017.John Wiley generates about half of its revenue from international operations and consequently, remains susceptible to adverse currency movements with regard to the euro and pound sterling, in particular. Foreign currency fluctuations hurt revenue by $12.9 million and $36.8 million in the third quarter and nine months, respectively. Earlier, the company stated it anticipates these headwinds to persist and impact fiscal 2017 results. | Our proven model does not conclusively show that John Wiley & Sons is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

"t's always useful to look for stocks that have underperformed the market and their sector because it can illuminate some great investing ideas. In this regard,  (NYSE: GE) ,  (NYSE: MSM) and  (NASDAQ: FAST) are all stocks investors should be taking a closer look at, and here's why. data by  .With a market cap of nearly $240 billion, GE's size dictates that its stock performance is a large determinant of how the industrial sector performs in general -- a fact that makes its significant under-performance even more notable. So, what's gone wrong with GE's stock in 2017? As ever, it's a matter of conjecture, but it's clear that analysts don't think the company will hit its  .Moreover, the company missed revenue targets in 2016 and  with weak free cash flow in the first quarter, while questions have  about its core power segment and oil & gas operations. It's not been a happy time for GE investors.However, what matters now is the investment proposition going forward, and despite disappointing the investment community in recent times, GE's underlying growth prospects still  . A combination of cost cuts -- structural and unit cost production reductions -- earnings-enhancing deals with  and  , digital initiatives, and the potential for significant restructuring when new CEO John Flannery completes his review are all potentially positive catalysts for GE.Meanwhile, the stock's valuation stands at a discount to its peers. data by  .One of the reasons the industrial sector has done well in 2017 is the return to growth of U.S. industrial production.  That's good news for U.S. manufacturing, and it's good news for industrial supply companies like MSC Industrial and Fastenal.Indeed, both companies have reported a significant uptick in end market conditions. Readers  that Fastenal's first quarter saw the company reporting mid single-digit growth in daily sales growth in both of its end markets (manufacturing and non-residential construction) for the first time since the spring of 2015.Meanwhile, the following chart of average daily sales growth at MSC Industrial demonstrates the improvement in end markets.Data source: MSC Industrial Direct Co. presentations.The improvement in sales is one thing, but unfortunately, it hasn't been accompanied by a significant improvement in both companies' pricing power, and consequently, margin growth has been challenged. This is somewhat disappointing since during many cyclical recoveries, companies see revenue and margin expanding leading to a significant pick-up in earnings. Both companies have generated less-than-stellar performance on margin. data by  .Essentially, the recovery hasn't been strong enough to allow any of the industrial supply companies to have any pricing power as yet.For example, here is MSC Industrial Erik Gershwind on the : ""To be clear, even if things pick up, competition remains fierce, and the pricing environment remains challenging."" The company did implement a small price increase in February, but according to Gershwind, ""it is not material to our overall results, nor do we expect it to be so for our fiscal third quarter."" For the record, MSC's gross margin in the second quarter was 44.7%, a decline of 40 basis points (where 100 basis points is 1%) compared to the same period last year.Image source: Getty Images.By coincidence, Fastenal's gross margin was also down 40 basis points to 49.4% in its first quarter. Around 30 basis points of the decline was due to an unfavorable customer and sales mix. Relatively more sales to large customers dilute margin -- MSC Industrial tends to see a similar dynamic -- and relatively more non-fastener sales. As CEO Dan Florness pointed out in the  when talking about gross margin, ""fastener product line runs in the 50s, our non-fastener products as a group run in the 40s.""While some of Fastenal's gross margin issues are structural -- the company is deliberately growing national accounts and non-fastener sales -- it's still not in a position to increase pricing. Here is CFO Holden Lewis on the : ""Pricing was not a meaningful factor in the quarter. Price is something that we just continue to review at this point.""However, if the recovery continues -- as you can see below, leading industrial indicators indicate ongoing strength -- then it's reasonable to expect that Fastenal and MSC Industrial will be able to increase pricing in due course, which could be good news for stock holders. data by  .The aim of GE's new CEO will surely be to regain investor confidence, and he has a good opportunity to do this as GE has solid underlying growth prospects. Meanwhile, Fastenal and MSC Industrial are likely to see a better pricing environment in the future provided the industrial recovery continues.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

 is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on May 31. In the last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.2%. Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Michael Kors has a remarkable history, at least in terms of the bottom line. The company continued with its positive earnings surprise streak for the seventh straight quarter, when it reported third-quarter fiscal 2017 results. In the trailing four quarters, the company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 7.6%. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is 70 cents, reflecting a year-over-year decline of over 28%. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1,048 million, down over 12% from the year-ago quarter.Well the obvious question that comes to mind, will Michael Kors be able to continue with its positive earnings surprise streak in the third quarter. Well past trends do indicate toward that direction but it will not feasible to jump to a conclusion without analyzing the factors at play.Michael Kors has been constantly deploying resources to expand product offerings, open new stores, build shop-in-shops along with upgrading its information system and distribution infrastructure. Management intends to upgrade eCommerce platform and expects the channel to be a significant contributor in the long run. We note that despite the possibility of heavy investments weighing upon the margins in the short term, management continues to take up strategic endeavors. These are important in the light of competitive retail landscape, sluggish mall traffic and short-term challenges such as foreign currency headwinds.Shares of Michael Kors came under pressure after the company posted a decline in the top line during the third quarter of fiscal 2017 and provided a bleak outlook. Results were hurt by comparable sales performance of North American and European markets. Further, it stated that headwinds in the aforementioned market will continue throughout the spring season. Michael Kors had earlier forecast total revenue between $1.035 billion and $1.055 billion, and anticipates comparable sales to decline in the low-teens range during the fourth quarter. Management had projected earnings in the range of 68-72 cents a share. | Well our proven model does not conclusively show that Michael Kors is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive  for this to happen.

 is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Jun 1. In fourth-quarter fiscal 2016, the company recorded a positive earnings surprise of 5.7% following negative earnings surprises of 3.3% and 0.9% in the third and second quarters, respectively. Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is 99 cents, reflecting a year-over-year decline of roughly 4%. Analysts polled by Zacks anticipate revenues of $5,598 million, up over 6% from the year-ago quarter. Well the obvious question that comes to mind, will Dollar General be able to post positive earnings surprise in the first quarter. Let's take a look at factors defining the quarter.Of late, Dollar General has been bearing the brunt of price deflation and the reduction in SNAP benefits that are weighing on comparable-store sales performance. In the final quarter of fiscal 2016, Dollar General informed that price deflation and the reduction in SNAP benefits adversely impacted comparable-store sales for fiscal 2016 by about 115 to 125 basis points. The current administration is suggesting on reducing food stamps program. Cut in SNAP benefit will hamper Dollar General performance as people with low income will have less money to spend and could restrict their spending to low margin products.Nevertheless, we believe that the company's commitment toward better price management, cost containment, private label offering, effective inventory management, merchandise and operational initiatives should drive sales and margin trends. Moreover, in order to increase traffic, Dollar General is focusing on both consumables and discretionary items. | Well our proven model does not conclusively show that Dollar General is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

 is slated to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 12, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company's earnings met the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company surpassed expectations in only one of the last four quarters, the average being a negative 0.80%.Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Increased installation of industrial vending machines is expected to boost sales and profits in the to-be-reported quarter as it is one of the primary growth drivers for Fastenal. The company is also increasing the proportion of safety supplies in its total revenue that will likely help it to drive its top line.We are also encouraged by Fastenal's acquisition of certain assets of industrial and fastener supply distributor -- Manufacturer's Supply Company (Mansco) in Mar 2017. This ensures Fastenal's presence in markets where it has not meaningfully contributed in the past.Moreover, a continual increase in the number of on-site locations is likely to expand Fastenal's market share and contribute to the quarterly results.However, we are apprehensive about Fastenal's unfavorable product mix, pricing and competitive pressure that are hurting the gross margin for quite sometime now. Gross margin in the first quarter of 2017 contracted 40 bps to 49.4% from the prior-year quarter due to a change in customer and product mix, higher freight costs, and expenses related to an inventory tracking initiative for international markets. The trend is likely to continue in the to-be-reported quarter.Notably, management believes that the second quarter of 2017 will see lower operating cash flows. For the quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stands at 50 cents, reflecting a 10.6% year-over-year increase. Meanwhile, the estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.10 billion, implying 8.7% growth.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Fastenal is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. : Fastenal has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. That is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 50 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . |  : Fastenal has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company's 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Meanwhile, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some companies in the Retail-Wholesale sector that, according to our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:McDonald's Corporation  has an Earnings ESP of +4.94% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see  .The company is slated to release quarterly results on Jul 25.America's Car-Mart, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +11.11% and a Zacks Rank #3.

The company is expected to release quarterly results on Aug 29.Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

 is set to release first-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Jun 1. The question lingering in investors' minds is if this yoga-inspired athletic apparel company will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the to-be reported quarter. In the trailing four quarters, the company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 2.1%, though it delivered a negative earnings surprise in the last reported quarter. Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 28 cents, reflecting a year-over year decline of 5.1%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable in the last 30 days. On the positive side, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $512.7 million, up about 3.5% from the year-ago quarter.Lululemon forms part of the  sector. Per the latest  , as of May 24, the Consumer Discretionary sector's earnings are expected to advance 13.9%, with 12.5% revenues growth.While the prospects for the Consumer Discretionary sector appear favorable for the first quarter, we are not sure if Lululemon will be able to follow the industry trends. Incidentally, the company has underperformed the Zacks categorized Consumer Discretionary sector over the last three months, with its shares having plunged 26.2% against the sector's growth of 3.3%. This bearish run is mainly accountable to management's soft first-quarter outlook, which was provided with Lululemon's last quarterly earnings report. The drab view was based on sluggish traffic in stores and lower conversions on Lululemon's e-Commerce site, as it entered the first quarter.Based on those trends, Lululemon projected revenues in the range of $510-$515 million, with constant dollar comps expected to decline in the low single-digits range. A likely improvement in product margin is expected to boost gross margin. However, deleverage in product and supply chain costs, and occupancy and depreciation expense due to bleak sales in the fiscal first quarter may hurt results.Further, the company predicts SG&A expenses deleverage of about 100-150 bps in first-quarter fiscal 2017, based on the sluggish comps trends. All said, Lululemon predicted earnings in the range of 25-27 cents per share, lower than the prior-year figure of 30 cents.Nonetheless, the company remains focused on improving its e-Commerce and store trends, through strategies like solidifying product assortment, enhancing website and accelerating its omni-channel model. Additionally, the company is committed toward achieving its goal of doubling revenues and more than doubling earnings by 2020. These factors encouraged management to issue a decent view for fiscal 2017. Given the mixed signals, let's wait and see if Lululemon can counter the aforementioned obstacles with its growth initiatives.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Lululemon is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  .Lululemon currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 28 cents.

"The stock market has spent much of the early summer months ""melting higher"" as investors have been hesitant to push their cash into a market that refuses to budge from all-time highs. Of course, we know there are always quality stocks to buy out there, regardless of what the market is doing. Source: ShutterstockBreakout stocks, comeback stocks, you name it - the market always provides ways to pad our accounts with fast profits.What's on our radar right now? The recent pullback in the market, which has a large number of tech stocks sitting pretty according to a number of things - our scoring models, longer-term technicals and, naturally, fundamentals. Specifically, we've recently identified a list of about 15 stocks that have seen short-term weakness, but now appear ready to shift back into breakout mode.Today, we want to focus on the seven best stocks of the bunch.Here's a look at seven stocks, all clustered in the tech sector, to buy for some early summer rally returns. 11%When you think of hot semiconductor companies, you think of  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ) or  (NASDAQ:  ). (NASDAQ:  ) hasn't provided the same caliber of returns over the past year, but it's still up by more than 45% in 52 weeks to easily outpace every major market index.Xilinx's last earnings report helped trigger a breakout above $64. Now, traders are looking at the stock as another bullish prospect with earnings just about a month down the road.XLNX shares have been stuck in a range between $64 and $68, which has been great for the chart watchers as they have been able to collect a lot of profits in this well-defined range. I expect this to change.As July's earnings slowly begin to approach, we're going to see more participation in the technical bounce from $64. That added participation will help XLNX break through $68 this time around and drive even more of a breakout.Our models like Xilinx shares to cross $73 before the company's next announcement. 20% (NYSE:  ) has been a market laggard for most of the year, down 4% versus an S&P 500 that has gained more than 8% year-to-date. On a slightly longer 12-month basis, IBM shares are only up 2% compared to the S&P 500's returns of 17%.Needless to say, IBM stock hasn't been a winner.Yet.IBM shares just spent the past month trading at a consolidation level of $150. If you look at historical charts, you'll find that this is actually a key level for IBM, and should serve as a long-term bottom.A rally won't be without its challenges. A break below $150 will bring about a new round of selling pressure. Meanwhile, IBM's 50-day moving average - just overhead at $156 - is declining and preparing to apply its own downward force.However, a break above this mark will take IBM stock to a challenge at their 20-month trendline, and a break above that will put shares back into a bull market for the first time in three months.That'll attract the long-term buyers and really get IBM into gear. We see prices as high as $180 in IBM's future. 12% (NASDAQ:  ) shares have suffered following the company's most recent earnings report, which failed to impress. However, political uncertainty has also affected industrial companies such as Fastenal, whose shares are trading 4% lower for the year and flat for the past 12 months.Despite this, our models are forecasting a technical breakout for FAST shares over the next few weeks that have the potential to change the stock's direction into a breakout.The stock is currently fighting its 50-day moving average - in my opinion, the most important trendline for any stock. A break above this trendline, currently at $44.81, will immediately put the shares in position to challenge their 200-day moving average at $45.43.Clearing these two technical hurdles in a short period of time will change the trajectory of Fastenal's price trend. Our models indicate a price target of $50. 11%Streaming giant  (NASDAQ:  ) has suffered a 10% decline of late. However, this massive pullback has set up a perfect buying opportunity for nimble chart watchers.See, the 10% correction took NFLX stock to an almost perfect test of the 100-day moving average. Currently, this trendline is sitting at $148 - just below today's lows. A hold of this trendline will maintain an intermediate-term bullish outlook.That decline has also taken Netflix shares to an oversold reading for the first time since April.There's a group of technical traders that are always looking for the opportunity to get into Netflix on a pullback. The recent drop has put the ball on the tee, and our models suggest these traders will hit it out of the park - good for a breakout to $170. 12%Calling for a breakout in  (NYSE:  ) might seem silly or cliche, depending on your viewpoint. After all, that's  Alibaba has been doing of late.Still, our models indicate that BABA stock will remain a leader throughout the rest of 2017.The opportunity for Alibaba at this point is the ""buy the dip"" breakout. Shares have seen a crowd of traders sell the news after their earnings release a few weeks ago. The stock dipped from about $148 to a base at $135 where it started its most recent rally.The technical crowd is grabbing these shares on this dip, and at strong volume no less. In other words, this rally will set a course for prices  recent highs.For now, our model is suggesting prices between $150-$155, which moves Alibaba back into new high territory. 12% (NASDAQ:  )  is one of those companies that has been putting up numbers that traders have just been ignoring. But that's an opportunity for those of us willing to front-run the moment everyone else figures out they should own this stock.Right now, Garmin shares are matching the market's performance as they trade above 8% higher year-to-date, but the stock has been stuck in a range that looks ready to release and allow shares to rally significantly.We just watched the stock get support from the 50-day again, and shares are now heading toward $53 again on rising volume. This indicates that the crowd is starting to take note of the potential breakout.Our model loves the fact that 0% of the analysts covering the stock have it ranked a buy, which means there is room for upgrades to drive a breakout. In addition, there are still some shorts that are trying to get out of the shares, which helps fuel the rally.A break above $53 is going to target a breakout above $55, likely to the $57-$58 level, as Garmin sill then be trading in a technical bull market! 11%Last is  (NASDAQ:  ), which you'll need to keep an eye on very soon, as it's set to announce earnings on Tuesday afternoon.A crowd of traders are scooping up ADBE on a strong ""buy the rumor"" rally since bouncing off its 50-day moving average last week. In all honesty, there was a great technical trade there for those who were looking at this pre-earnings strength.And normally, short interest on the stock is much higher than its current 1.5 days to cover, which suggests to us that we won't see as much of a shot higher in the immediate response to earnings.Still, our historical data shows that Adobe is a strong performer around earnings season. And the stock is lightly recommended by the analyst community, with just 79% of those covering ADBE - which is up 45% over the past year! - ranking it a buy.Here's how our models see this breakout playing out:Adobe should see a little selling pressure after its Tuesday announcement. This will set things up for a buyable dip that will allow nimble traders to grab this stock at a bargain.From there, the models are targeting a move above $155.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@7 Stocks to Buy on the Verge of Double-Digit Breakouts@2017-06-19@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-stocks-to-buy-on-the-verge-of-double-digit-breakouts-2017-06-19

"he  formula at  ranks a coverage universe of thousands of  , according to a proprietary formula designed to identify those stocks that combine two important characteristics - strong fundamentals and a valuation that looks inexpensive. Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST) presently has an excellent rank, in the top 25% of the coverage universe, which suggests it is among the top most ""interesting"" ideas that merit further research by investors.But making Fastenal Co. an even more interesting and timely stock to look at, is the fact that in trading on Monday, shares of FAST entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $44.305 per share. We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30. In the case of Fastenal Co., the RSI reading has hit 28.9 - by comparison, the universe of dividend stocks covered by  currently has an average RSI of 52.5. A falling stock price - all else being equal - creates a better opportunity for dividend investors to capture a higher yield. Indeed, FAST's recent annualized dividend of 1.28/share (currently paid in quarterly installments) works out to an annual yield of 2.87% based upon the recent $44.74 share price.A bullish investor could look at FAST's 28.9 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. Among the fundamental datapoints dividend investors should investigate to decide if they are bullish on FAST is its dividend history. In general, dividends are not always predictable; but, looking at the history chart below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue.According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, FAST makes up 1.32% of the First Trust NASDAQ-100 Ex-Technology Sector Index Fund ETF (Symbol: QQXT) which is trading up by about 0.1% on the day Monday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Relative Strength Alert For Fastenal@2017-05-15@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/relative-strength-alert-fastenal-2017-05-15

ooking at the universe of stocks we cover at  , in trading on Wednesday, shares of Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST) were yielding above the 3% mark based on its quarterly dividend (annualized to $1.28), with the stock changing hands as low as $42.32 on the day. Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return. To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) back on 12/31/1999 - you would have paid $146.88 per share. Fast forward to 12/31/2012 and each share was worth $142.41 on that date, a decrease of $4.67/share over all those years. But now consider that you collected a whopping $25.98 per share in dividends over the same period, for a positive total return of 23.36%. Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.6%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 3% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable. Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST) is an S&P 500 company, giving it special status as one of the large-cap companies making up the S&P 500 Index.In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Fastenal Co., looking at the history chart for FAST below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 3% annual yield.    According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, FAST makes up 1.28% of the First Trust NASDAQ-100 Ex-Technology Sector Index Fund ETF (Symbol: QQXT) which is trading lower by about 1.5% on the day Wednesday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@FAST Crosses Above 3% Yield Territory@2017-05-17@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/fast-crosses-above-3-yield-territory-2017-05-17
 is slated to release first-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Jun 1. The question lingering in investors' minds is whether this specialty retailer of action sports related apparel, footwear and accessories will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported.In the trailing four quarters, the company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 31.4%. Notably, Zumiez has delivered positive earnings surprises consistently in the last six quarters. Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at a loss of 20 cents, wider than the year-ago loss of 8 cents. Further, we noted that our loss estimate has widened in the past 30 days, by a couple of cents. On the positive side, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $179.4 million, up about 3.7% from the year-ago quarter.Zumiez forms part of the  sector. Per the latest  , as of May 24, the Retail - Wholesale sector's earnings are expected to inch up 0.5%, with 3.1% revenues growth.Zumiez recently came up with comparable store sales (comps) and sales data for the four-week period ended Apr 29, 2017. The company recorded a 7.8% increase in April comps, which marked its second consecutive month of comps growth. Also, net sales for the month advanced 10.3% year over year. However, management tweaked its bottom-line outlook for the first quarter owing to a higher-than-expected tax rate.The company now projects bottom-line results for first-quarter fiscal 2017 at the lower end of its previous guidance of net loss per share of 17-21 cents. The previous projection (provided during the fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings release) remained dismal on account of a challenging retail environment stemming from sluggish mall traffic, volatile consumer spending and macroeconomic volatility.These factors have been largely weighing upon investors' sentiment, evident from the company's bearish run as it approaches its earnings release. Notably, shares of Zumiez have dropped 4.5% over the past five trading sessions. Moreover, the company has slumped 26.5% over the last three months, underperforming the Zacks categorized  industry's drop of 14.5%.Nevertheless, Zumiez remains on track with cost-control efforts and multi-year growth targets, which are aimed at generating greater profits and shareholder-value in the long run. Further, the company's strategic initiatives, focus on omni-channel growth, authentic lifestyle positioning and commitment to customer service position it well to gain market share.Given the mixed signals, it remains to be seen whether Zumiez will break or maintain its solid positive surprise trend.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Zumiez is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  .Zumiez currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company has an Earnings ESP of -5.00% as the Most Accurate estimate of a loss of 21 cents is wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 20 cents. The combination of Zumiez' Zacks Rank #3 and negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Fred's, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +16.67% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see  .Lithia Motors, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +0.91% and a Zacks Rank #3.Fastenal Company  has an Earnings ESP of +4.08% and a Zacks Rank #3.Did you miss Apple's 9X stock explosion after they launched their iPhone in 2007?

"Industrial supply company  (NASDAQ: FAST) recently reported its first-quarter earnings, and in common with its peer  (NYSE: MSM) , the company beat sales expectations in the quarter. However, also like MSC Industrial, the stock sold off heavily post earnings. data by  .There are three separate reasons that Fastenal's earnings are significant. First, industrial supply companies are early indicators of a pickup in manufacturing and nonresidential construction activity. As you can see below, Fastenal's daily sales growth, in both sectors, has improved markedly in recent months -- a good sign for the industrial sector.Data source: Fastenal Company presentations. Chart shows year-over-year growth.Second, while sales were good, Fastenal's results mimicked MSC Industrial's in the sense that pricing and margin were somewhat disappointing. When a cyclical company sees its sales turning, it's reasonable to expect prices to increase and margin to improve -- translating into strong profit growth. However,  sees the pricing environment as still ""challenging"" and the ""modest"" pricing increase implemented in February is not expected to be material to its upcoming quarter.Meanwhile, Fastenal's gross margin declined to 49.4% from 49.8% in last year's first quarter. Furthermore, operating income margin declined to 20.3% from 20.4%. Sure, Fastenal met earnings-per-share expectations, but that was due to sales being better than expected rather than margin expansion.Finally, the strong market reaction to both sets of earnings is perhaps a sign that industrial valuations are a little stretched right now and optimism of a recovery in U.S. industrial production is largely baked into stock valuations.Image source: Getty Images.If you are a long-term investor and focused on the fundamentals of both stocks, and there was nothing in the earnings to make you materially change your investment case, then the initial sell-off is not something you should unduly worry about. Pricing and margin are concerns at both companies, but it's probably too soon in the cycle to make any firm conclusions, as the recovery is still in its early stages.If you are looking at MSC Industrial's and Fastenal's sales data from a broader market perspective, then it's a further confirmation that U.S. manufacturing and nonresidential end markets have entered 2017 in good shape -- and that's good news.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"n this series, we look through the most recent  report, and then we cherry pick only those companies that have experienced insider buying within the past six months. The officers and directors of a company tend to have a unique insider's view of the business, and presumably the only reason an insider would choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money - maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both. So when stocks turn up that see insider buying, and are also top ranked, investors are wise to take notice. One such company is Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST), which saw buying by Director Daniel L. Johnson.Back on April 17, Johnson invested $15,983.34 into 350 shares of FAST, for a cost per share of $45.67. In trading on Tuesday, bargain hunters could buy shares of Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST) and achieve a cost basis 0.8% cheaper than Johnson, with shares changing hands as low as $45.30 per share. It should be noted that Johnson has collected $0.32/share in dividends since the time of their purchase, so they are currently down 0.1% on their purchase from a total return basis. Fastenal Co. shares are currently trading +1.08% on the day. The chart below shows the one year performance of FAST shares, versus its 200 day moving average:Looking at the chart above, FAST's low point in its 52 week range is $37.70 per share, with $52.74 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $45.90. By comparison, below is a table showing the prices at which insider buying was recorded over the last six months:
  
The DividendRank report noted that among the coverage universe, FAST shares displayed both attractive valuation metrics and strong profitability metrics. The report also cited the strong quarterly dividend history at Fastenal Co., and favorable long-term multi-year growth rates in key fundamental data points.The report stated, ''  ''The annualized dividend paid by Fastenal Co. is $1.28/share, currently paid in quarterly installments, and its most recent dividend ex-date was on 04/24/2017.

"The stock price of industrial distribution company  (NYSE: WCC) fell around 12% in April driven by a disappointing set of first-quarter earnings. As you can see in the chart below it's not been a happy time for investors in industrial wholesale and distribution stocks.  (NASDAQ: FAST) and  (NYSE: MSM) have also reported disappointing results this earnings season. data by  .While all of these companies have reported an improving end-market environment -- in line with a broadly improving industrial economy in 2017 -- and sales have been improving, they have disappointed with margin.For example, Fastenal saw its operating income decline in the first-quarter to 20.3% from 20.4% in the same period last-year. Meanwhile, MSC Industrial spoke of a pricing environment that ""remains challenging"" and management  much help from pricing in the near-term.WESCO's operating margin of 3.8% in the first-quarter came in at the bottom end of its guidance range and CFO Dave Schulz  of pricing pressure in the quarter.Image source: WESCO International.It matters because the strong run-up in share prices of stocks in the sector has been built upon hopes of an industrial recovery -- and recoveries usually bring about a combination of revenue growth and margin expansion. Unfortunately, the latter hasn't happened yet. Moreover, cost pressures are rising as metals & minerals prices have generally increased in the last year.WESCO's CEO John Engel talked of a ""lag effect"" before price increases start to push through. Essentially, this is the argument that as the recovery gathers steam pricing conditions will improve as the slack in the sector is picked up. If he's right -- and the historical chart below suggests he is -- then the recent dip in stock prices is a good buying opportunity. You would be buying into companies that are set to expand sales and margin -- earnings should grow significantly. data by  .On the other hand, there is no telling the strength or longevity of the industrial recovery, and therefore whether industrial supply companies will be able to gain traction on pricing in 2017.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"he  formula at  ranks a coverage universe of thousands of  , according to a proprietary formula designed to identify those stocks that combine two important characteristics - strong fundamentals and a valuation that looks inexpensive. Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST) presently has an excellent rank, in the top 25% of the coverage universe, which suggests it is among the top most ""interesting"" ideas that merit further research by investors.But making Fastenal Co. an even more interesting and timely stock to look at, is the fact that in trading on Wednesday, shares of FAST entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $47.01 per share. We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30. In the case of Fastenal Co., the RSI reading has hit 29.7 - by comparison, the universe of dividend stocks covered by  currently has an average RSI of 52.2. A falling stock price - all else being equal - creates a better opportunity for dividend investors to capture a higher yield. Indeed, FAST's recent annualized dividend of 1.28/share (currently paid in quarterly installments) works out to an annual yield of 2.54% based upon the recent $50.34 share price.A bullish investor could look at FAST's 29.7 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. Among the fundamental datapoints dividend investors should investigate to decide if they are bullish on FAST is its dividend history. In general, dividends are not always predictable; but, looking at the history chart below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue.According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, FAST makes up 1.39% of the First Trust NASDAQ-100 Ex-Technology Sector Index Fund ETF (Symbol: QQXT) which is trading lower by about 0.1% on the day Wednesday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Fastenal Enters Oversold Territory@2017-04-12@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/fastenal-enters-oversold-territory-2017-04-12

 's  earnings of 46 cents per share in the first quarter of 2017 came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Earnings grew 6.2% year over year.Net sales of $1,047.7 million surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,033 million by 1.4%. Sales also grew 6.2% year over year driven by higher units owing to increase in sales at existing store locations and growth in industrial vending business and existing Onsite locations.Fastenal's daily sales grew 6.2% in the quarter, higher than the 2.7% increase in the fourth quarter of 2016.On a monthly basis, daily sales increased 8.4% in March, 6.1% in February and 3.8% in January 2017 compared with 0.0%, 2.6% and 3.3%, respectively, in the year-ago comparable periods.Sales of fastener products (used mainly for industrial production and accounting for approximately 35.6% of the company's first quarter sales) increased 0.8% in the quarter. Non-fastener product sales (used mainly for maintenance and represented 64.4% of the quarterly sales) increased 9.4%.As of Mar 31, 2017, Fastenal operated 64,430 vending machines, up 13.3% year over year. During the quarter, the company signed 5,437 machine contracts, up 17% year over year.After a soft 2013, vending trends improved through 2014, 2015 and 2016 as management's efforts to enhance the quality of signings/installs paid off.Fastenal signed 64 new Onsite locations during the quarter, up 33.3% from 48 signings a year ago. As of Mar 31, 2017, the company had 437 active sites, representing an increase of 51.2%.Additionally, Fastenal signed 43 new national account contracts in the first quarter (representing 48.4% of its total revenues in the quarter). Net sales from its national account customers grew 9.2% in the quarter year over year.Gross margin of 49.4% in the first quarter of 2017 declined 40 basis points (bps) year over year. The decline stemmed from unfavorable customer mix and product mix. Its major growth initiatives (i.e. Onsite locations, non-fastener products, national accounts) tend to have lower gross profits. Moreover, higher freight expenses due to increased business activity and expenses related to the final stage of a new inventory tracking system add to the woes.Operating margin also declined 10 bps year over year to 20.3% in the quarter mainly due to lower gross profit level.Cash and cash equivalents were $134.3 million as of Mar 31, 2017, up from $112.7 million as of Dec 31, 2016. Long-term debt was $354.1 million, down from $379.5 million at the end of 2016.The company plans to continue opening stores in 2017 to sustain and improve its network, and drive growth. | Fastenal carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Other stocks worth considering in the same space are Tecnoglass Inc  , BMC Stock Holdings, Inc.  and Builders FirstSource, Inc.  .Tecnoglass carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

t’s that time again! This morning Delta Airlines () and industrial and building products supply company Fastenal () reported earnings for the first quarter of the calendar year 2017. Tomorrow, JP Morgan Chase (), Citibank () and Wells Fargo () will follow suit.Earnings season is upon us.Over the next few weeks we will hear results from hundreds of major corporations, and given that the stock market has been bogged down and moving essentially sideways for a couple of weeks those earnings numbers could easily decide the direction of the next move.So, what can we expect?So far the indications are mixed. Both Delta and Fastenal essentially matched expectations on the bottom line and reported better than expected revenues, but Delta surged on a positive outlook while Fastenal is down nearly five percent despite the decent results. The most interesting thing here is what happened to Fastenal, as it highlights one of the potential problems that we may see over the next few weeks, where even beats may not be good enough for traders.Generally, earnings are supportive of the market. There is a kind of dance played out throughout the year by analysts, executives, and investors - it is in the interest of the boards of public companies to under-promise and over-deliver when it comes to earnings, as the market reaction to a positive surprise can be so exaggerated. Wall Street analysts base their forecasts for earnings off of the outlook given by the companies, so inevitably they too tend to underestimate.That is why two thirds of companies beat EPS expectations on average every quarter.As the Fastenal situation this morning shows, though, even if that pattern is repeated this time around it still may not be enough to push stocks in general higher. The problem is that the official consensus expectation is not the only thing by which actual results are judged.There is also another number built into stock pricing as earnings approach, the so-called “whisper number.” This is the result expected by traders that may differ from the published analysts’ consensus.Over the last few months, as the “Trump Trade” has continued and there have been signs of reflation in the global economy, traders have become increasingly optimistic. Indeed, the Trump trade itself is based more on optimism and assumptions than reality. It is reasonable to assume that tax cuts, both corporate and personal, are coming at some point and also that the general business environment will be improved.So far, though, the one major policy shift that has been attempted, in healthcare, has been an embarrassing failure. Despite that, optimism persists in the pricing of stocks.That general sense of optimism based on politics can also be seen in the whisper numbers for earnings. There have been a lot of upward revisions already to analysts’ estimates, yet the whisper numbers generally still outstrip those upwardly revised expectations. For example, according to  all three major banks releasing earnings tomorrow are expected to beat expectations, if you see what I mean.This raises the question: Have expectations gotten out of hand?If so, then even a decent earnings season could be seen as somewhat of a disappointment and could, when combined with the geopolitical tensions that have weighed on the market in recent days, send stocks lower. Over time, the trend towards reflation and better growth globally will be supportive, but from where we are now, a temporary dislocation, even in the face of the usual earnings beats, looks distinctly possible.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Earnings Season Preview@2017-04-12@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/earnings-season-preview-2017-04-12

"e expect  to beat expectations when it reports first-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Apr 12. Last quarter, the company reported a positive earnings surprise of 5.26%. However, it failed to surpass the expectations in two of the last four quarters, with the average being negative 0.80%. Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Our proven model shows that Fastenal is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key components. Fastenal has an  of +2.17%. That is because the Most Accurate estimate is 47 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at 46 cents. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . Fastenal currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates. Conversely, stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Fastenal's Zacks Rank #2 and +2.17% ESP makes us reasonably confident of a positive earnings beat.Fastenal is a wholesale distributor to industrial and construction customers. It serves the manufacturing and non-residential construction markets. Industrial and manufacturing activity are the major drivers of the business and Fastenal business looks to benefit if the new presidential administration successfully lowers the corporate tax rate and speed up domestic infrastructure spending.During the fourth-quarter 2016 , management had already indicated that the company is in ""a stable margin environment"" as it believes that recent improvements in margins on non-fasteners, a higher mix of sales of exclusive brands and better purchasing can continue to offset the ongoing mix headwinds. Additionally, recent increases in steel and other commodity prices also add to the positives.However, Fastenal's top line was soft since 2015 and continued to experience a slowdown throughout 2016, including a contraction of 2.4% in the fourth quarter. Again, lack of inflation, unfavorable product mix (less fasteners which generate higher margins), strong emphasis on growing average store sales, pricing and competitive pressure are hurting gross margins. Though gross margin improved 50 basis points (bps) sequentially in the fourth quarter, it was still down 10 bps year over year. Overall, 2016 gross margin dropped 80 basis points from the 2015 level.If we take a closer look at the company's sales trend, Fastenal's net sales for February increased 1.1% and that for January 9% year over year. The daily sales growth rate was 6.1% in February, higher than the 3.8% increase in Jan 2017. Although daily sales remained stagnant for the most part, it did show pulse in recent times.For the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stands at 46 cents, reflecting a 4.6% year-over-year increase. Meanwhile, the estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.03 billion, implying 4.7% growth. | Here are some companies in the Retail-Wholesale sector, that, according to our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Group 1 Automotive, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +1.75% and a Zacks Rank #2.

On the other hand, an uptick in  produced solid gains for the second straight day for  (NYSEMKT: JNUG) , which rose 4%.As for individual stocks, both  (NYSE: DAL) and  (NASDAQ: FAST) attracted heavy investor interest following their quarterly earnings reports.Image source: Getty Images.Delta shares dipped 0.5% after the company posted quarterly results that included disappointing sales and profit growth -- but also a few tantalizing  ahead. Revenue per available seat mile fell 0.5%, missing management's guidance that called for an increase of 1% at the midpoint. Rising costs, especially on fuel, contributed to a sharp drop in profitability as operating income dove 32%.Image source: Getty Images.Yet the company believes that profitability will show solid improvements over the next three quarters of the year. It sees revenue speeding up and is encouraged by the fact that March was the first month of positive passenger unit revenue since November 2015.Fuel costs aren't likely to pinch profits through the rest of 2017, either. ""With an improving revenue profile and further improvement as our cost growth moderates in the second half, we are on track to expand margins for the balance of the year,"" Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson said.Delta's guidance calls for operating margin to grow to between 17% and 19% in the fiscal second quarter as revenue per available seat mile rises 1% to 3%.Shares of industrial supply specialist Fastenal lost 8% after the company announced fiscal first-quarter earnings results. Revenue improved 6.2% to reach $1.05 billion and earnings rose at the exact same pace to $0.46 per share. The actual sales figure was a hair higher than consensus estimates while Wall Street analysts were right on the mark with their EPS projections.Fastenal executives said they were encouraged by a pickup in the industry following a relatively weak 2016 fiscal year. ""We are pleased with the improving pace of business growth,"" CEO Dan Florness said. ""This is a welcome sign of improving business activity and of the traction we are gaining in our growth drivers,"" he added.One drawback of the success in these growth initiatives is that they tend to carry lower margins than the core business. That was a key factor behind a 40-basis-point decline in gross profit margin, to 49.4% of sales. But Fastenal managed to offset most of this drop through discipline around administrative and operational expenses. As a result, bottom-line earnings rose at a slightly faster pace than revenue, to $134 million.Looking forward, investors can expect Fastenal to slowly shrink its store footprint as it continues to adjust to the weak industry conditions that marked last year's results. At the same time, it aims to aggressively invest in growth initiatives like its network of industrial vending machine sites, which could keep pressure on its profit margin.

 is scheduled to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2016 results on Apr 5. The big question facing investors is, whether this leading home furnishings retailer will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported.Bed Bath & Beyond has been delivering negative earnings surprises for three straight quarters now. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for both, fourth-quarter and fiscal 2017 has been stable, over the last 30 days. However, the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.78 per share for the fiscal fourth quarter reflects a year-over-year decline of 4.1%. Nonetheless, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $3.5 billion, up 2.5% from the year-ago quarter.Bed, Bath & Beyond has underperformed the Zacks categorized  industry in the past one year. Shares of the company have slumped 20.2% over the past year, as compared with the industry's decline of 6.4%.The company has been reeling under the impact of sluggish mall traffic for a while now. This was also evident from Bed, Bath & Beyond's last quarterly results, wherein slow traffic in stores more than offset online sales growth, thereby leading to a dismal outcome. Further, the gross margin remained pressurized owing to higher direct-to-customer shipping expenses, as well as a rise in coupon costs. Moreover, the company witnessed a rise in selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses due to higher payroll and payroll-related expenses, as well as an increase in technology expenses. Management expects these factors to linger and consequently impact gross margin and SG&A expense in fiscal 2016, which is likely to dent the company's bottom-line.Considering these factors and the current business trends, along with the expected impact from the company's recent acquisitions of One Kings Lane, and PersonalizationMall.com, management provided its fiscal 2016 earnings guidance. The company envisions fiscal 2016 earnings per share at the lower end of its historical range of $4.50 to a little over $5.00.Additionally, given its international exposure, Bed, Bath & Beyond remains prone to foreign currency headwinds. Adverse currency has troubled the company to a great extent in the past and hence, any persistence of currency woes remains a challenge for Bed, Bath & Beyond. All said, it seems unlikely for the company to break its dismal earnings surprise trend this quarter.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Bed, Bath & Beyond is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below: Bed, Bath & Beyond currently has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

"n recent trading, shares of Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $50.14, changing hands for $50.88/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 7 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Fastenal Co., but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $35.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $56.00. The standard deviation is $7.01.But the whole reason to look at the  FAST price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with FAST crossing above that average target price of $50.14/share, investors in FAST have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $50.14 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Fastenal Co.:

n Mar 21, we issued an updated research report on  - a national wholesale distributor of industrial and construction supplies.The company is boosting sales performance at stores through additional sales support and vending machine installations. The company's cost-saving initiative, Pathway-to-Profit, also bodes well.Meanwhile, shares of Fastenal outperformed the Zacks categorized  industry in the past six months. Also, analysts' expectations have been trending upward. The current quarter has seen two upward estimate revisions in the past 60 days, while full-year estimates have seen five upward revisions over the same time frame. As a result, the current quarter and year consensus estimates moved north, justifying the company's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Fastenal has adopted FAST Solutions, an industrial vending process that has the potential to revolutionize the industrial distribution system and increase profitability. Industrial vending is one of the primary growth drivers for the company. In fact, the company is optimizing its vending machines to drive signings and boost efficiency.Also, in order to increase profitability, the company has gradually grown from a fastener distributor to a full-line industrial supplier. It has expanded its product lines to include an internal manufacturing division, government sales, Internet sales, metalworking and industrial vending.The Pathway-to-Profit program is also encouraging. Under this, the company focuses on increasing the average store size which leads to better earnings leverage by spreading operating costs over higher sales and thereby driving pre-tax margins.However, unfavorable product mix and the on-site rollout continue to exert pressure on margins. Lack of inflation, strong emphasis on growing average store sales, pricing and competitive pressure are hurting gross margins. Overall, gross margin in 2016 dropped 80 basis points from the 2015 level.Nonetheless, management believes that the recent improvement in margins (improved 50 bps sequentially in fourth quarter) on non-fasteners, a higher mix of sales of exclusive brands and better purchasing will continue to offset the ongoing headwinds. Additionally, recent increases in steel and other commodity prices add to the positives.Investors may consider other favorably ranked stocks in the Retail Wholesale sector like BMC Stock Holdings, Inc.  , Bob Evans Farms, Inc.  and Darden Restaurants, Inc.  .BMC Stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and is expected to witness 52.9% growth in 2017 earnings. You can see  .Bob Evans, a Zacks Rank #2 stock, surpassed earnings in all of the past four quarters, the average beat being 12.5%.Darden, also a Zacks Rank #2 company, is expected to witness 11.2% growth in fiscal 2017 earnings.If the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.

"ith persistent focus on developing its business portfolio, strategic initiatives and a disciplined capital allocation strategy,  remains confident of performing well in future. Moving ahead, the company plans to sustain its solid momentum in 2017, where it aims to achieve volume growth via content gains, new products and enhanced market share.Leggett has successfully completed the first two parts of its long-term strategic plan, which was announced in Nov 2007. These parts focused on divesting low-performing businesses and improvement in margins as well as returns. Currently, management is on track with its third part of the plan, which aims to achieve top-line growth in the range of 4-5% annually. And we believe Leggett has significant operating leverage to accomplish this phase, as it has a considerable amount of retained spare production to meet the demand.Further, the company remains focused on enhancing its business portfolio by increasing investments in areas that provide a competitive edge. Some recent actions include the acquisitions of a manufacturer of aerospace tube assemblies; a distributor of geosynthetic products, and a South African innerspring manufacturer. On the other hand, the company divested four small ventures in 2016. All these actions position Leggett well toward achieving its goals for 2019.Leggett performed well in 2016, as it witnessed record EPS, superb EBIT margin, healthy cash flows and its 45th dividend hike. In fact, the company posted its highest ever EBIT margin in 2016, ever since 1999. Going forward, it also expects solid profit margins and increased EPS for 2017 alongside predicting sales growth in the band of 5-8%.Additionally, Leggett outlined its goals for 2019, based on the achievement of its top-third total shareholder return target, over the next three years. These targets include revenues of about $4.75 billion, EBIT margin of 13.3%, EPS of $3.25 and a dividend of $1.70 per share. The company intends to achieve these goals, given a stable macro environment, with decent demand enhancement and persistent content gains as well as product introductions.However, Leggett posted dismal results for fourth-quarter 2016. In fact, its quarterly adjusted earnings from continuing operations of 53 cents per share declined nearly 17% year over year and also came below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 58 cents. The bottom line was primarily hurt by a sudden inflation in steel costs toward the end of 2016, which is expected to persist in 2017, thereby posing threats. Likewise, the company's sales also fell year over year and missed our estimate.In addition, Leggett remains exposed to major volatility in raw material prices, with steel being one of the company's key raw materials and the steel market being cyclical in nature. Apart from this, the company is also susceptible to fluctuating metal margins as it is a manufacturer of steel rods. These factors are likely to weigh adversely upon the company's performance.Furthermore, the company's significant global presence exposes it to various risks operating internationally. Intense competition coupled with macroeconomic headwinds, also pose significant threats to the company.We noted that this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock returned 6.3% over the past one year, clearly underperforming the Zacks categorized  industry, which gained 12.8%. Only time will tell whether the company's endeavors will help it combat the aforesaid challenges and, in turn, help the stock propel higher. Leggett boasts a  of ""B"", which boosts confidence.Better-ranked stocks in the broader Consumer Discretionary space include Masonite International Corporation  , American Woodmark Corporation  and Fastenal Company  .Masonite International Corporation has posted an average earnings beat of 18.1% in the past four quarters. Also, it increased 28.7% over the past six months. The stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see  .American Woodmark Corporation, which carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) has jumped 27.2%, in the past one year. Moreover, the stock posted an average earnings beat of 10.6% over the trailing four quarters.Fastenal Company, a Zacks Rank #2 stock has a long-term earnings growth rate of 16.3%. Also, the stock rose 28.7%, over the past six months.Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

 is slated to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2016 results on Mar 23, after the closing bell. In the previous quarter, the company's earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.3%.Notably, in the trailing four quarters, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate with a positive earnings surprise of 5.8%. Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.The question lingering in investors' minds now is, whether GameStop will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is $2.29, reflecting a year-over-year decrease of nearly 5%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable in the past 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $3,116 million, in comparison with $3,525 million reported in the prior-year quarter.We note that the stock has underperformed the Zacks categorized  industry and the S&P 500 in the past one year. The company's shares have declined 15.1%, while the Zacks categorized industry has gained 12.6% in the past six months. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 has gained 9.4% during the same time frame.GameStop's shares have been hit hard lately and have underperformed the industry in the past six months. The challenging retail landscape, aggressive promotional strategies and waning store traffic have been weighing on the company's performance. Further, this was evident in the company's holiday sales results. The company generated total global sales of $2.50 billion, down 16.4% year over year. Comps decreased 18.7%, reflecting a drop of 26.6% and 13% in November and December, respectively. New hardware sales plunged 30.3% due to significant decline in PlayStation 4 and Xbox One hardware sales. Even the sturdy performance of new hardware, such as the Nintendo NES Classic failed to act as the savior.Following a sluggish holiday season, management expects comps to decline in the range of 16-18% in the final quarter compared with 7-12% drop projected earlier. For fiscal 2016, GameStop envisions comps to decline between 10% and 12% compared with the prior estimate of 6.5-9.5% decline. However, management reiterated its earnings projection. GameStop continues to expect earnings in the band of $2.23 to $2.38 for the fourth quarter and between $3.65 and $3.80 per share for the fiscal year.GameStop's basic concern is the weakness prevailing in new software sales, which is heightening apprehensions about the impact of digital downloads on the same.Our proven model does not conclusively show that GameStop is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.GameStop has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $2.29. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  .Moreover, GameStop carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Conagra Brands, Inc.  currently has an Earnings ESP of +4.44% and a Zacks Rank #2.

"n the past three months,  has exhibited an impressive run in the index. The stock has not only outperformed the Zacks categorized  industry but also the broader sector. In the said period, the stock has increased 15%, while the industry gained 11.3%. Meanwhile the broader  sector advanced 5.5%.An improving job scenario, gradual recovery in the housing market and merchandising initiatives along with efforts to provide better omni-channel customer experience bode well for Lowe's. It also remains well positioned to reap the benefits of strategic acquisitions done earlier such as that of Orchard Supply Hardware Stores, ATG Stores and RONA.While the stock has outperformed the industry as well as the broader sector there is still a value-oriented path ahead, as validated by  of ""B"". Considering price-to-book (P/B) ratio, Lowe's looks pretty attractive when compared with the industry. The stock has a trailing 12-month P/B ratio of 11.03, which is above its median level of 9.55 but below the high level of 11.29 scaled in the past one year. On the contrary, the trailing 12-month P/B ratio for the industry is 17.13.We observed that after two straight quarters of earnings miss, the company posted positive earnings surprise of 8.9% in the final quarter of fiscal 2016. Net sales also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate, after missing the same in the preceding two quarters.The better-than-expected results prompted management to provide an encouraging outlook for fiscal 2017. Management now projects total sales growth of approximately 5% and expects comparable sales to increase about 3.5% during fiscal 2017. The company now anticipates fiscal 2017 earnings to be approximately $4.64 per share, up significantly from $3.99 posted in fiscal 2016.Following the sturdy results and upbeat outlook, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been trending upwards.

 is scheduled to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Mar 24. The big question facing investors is, whether this leading mall-based specialty retailer will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported.Though Finish Line has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 5.3% in the trailing four quarters, last quarter it posted a negative earnings surprise of 33.3%. A look at Finish Line's earnings estimates revisions shows that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both the fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 has been stable over the last 30 days. However, the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of 71 cents per share for the fiscal fourth quarter reflects a year-over-year decline of 14.6%. Also, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $554.2 million, down 4.5% from the year-ago quarter.Finish Line has underperformed the Zacks categorized  industry in the past six months. Shares of the company have slumped 27.5% over the past six months compared with the industry's decline of 12.5%. Finish Line delivered lower-than-expected results in the last quarter, which was largely hampered by weakness in the soft goods category.Following the fiscal third quarter, management stated that it expects the soft goods category to remain unfavorable in the near term. Also, a delay in tax refunds is expected to shift February sales into March, thus weighing on the fiscal fourth-quarter top line. Considering these factors, management forecasted fiscal fourth-quarter comps to decline in a range of 3-5%, while earnings were projected in a range of 68-73 cents per share. Moreover, an intensely promotional retail environment is expected to dent product margins, which is anticipated to decline 150-200 basis points.Nonetheless, thanks to the absence of additional costs related to the the supply chain disruption experienced in the year-ago period, the company expects SG&A expenses to improve as a percentage of sales. Also, the company remains focused on solidifying its foundation, expanding its footwear division and strengthening its ties with Macy's. The company also remains on track with its stores and e-commerce expansion, which is likely to attract more traffic and drive sales.However, given the aforementioned challenges and a conservative outlook, we prefer to wait and see what is in store for Finish Line in the upcoming earnings release.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Finish Line is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below: Finish Line currently has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both, the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 71 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . Finish Line's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company's ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Conagra Brands, Inc.  , slated to release earnings on Apr 6, currently has an Earnings ESP of +4.44% and a Zacks Rank #2.

"enchmarks eked out gains on Friday after comments from Fed Chair Janet Yellen and other officials hinted at a rate hike in March. Financial shares gained the most, with banks taking an upward trajectory since the banking sector's profitability increases with interest rate hikes. Optimism about President Donald Trump's plan to slash taxes and regulations had already provided an impetus to the sector to scale higher. All the major indexes ended the week in the green, with the Dow posting a fourth consecutive weekly gain and the S&P 500 registering its sixth consecutive weekly advance.For a look at the issues currently facing the markets, make sure to read today's  article.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) gained a meagre 0.01% to close at 21,005.71. The S&P 500 advanced 0.1% to close at 2,383.12, with five of the 11 main sectors finishing in positive territory. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 5,870.75, increasing 0.2%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) declined 3.7% to settle at 11.37. A total of around 3.5 billion shares were traded on the NYSE on Friday. Advancers outpaced declining stocks on the NYSE. For 50% stocks that advanced, 46% declined.Yellen pointed out that the Fed will likely resume hiking rates at the U.S. central bank's policy meeting to be held on Mar 14-15. In a speech to The Executive's Club of Chicago, she said that the ""Federal Open Market Committee will evaluate whether employment and inflation are continuing to evolve in line with our expectations, in which case a further adjustment of the Federal funds rate would likely be appropriate"". The language is similar to what Fed has used in the past to signal at an imminent rate hike.It's a welcome move as she wanted to get rates off the ground throughout her three-year tenure. Also, the gradual improvement in the economy, inflation rising toward the central bank's 2% target and investors aligned around the idea of a rate hike prepare the grounds for a hike. She added that the Fed still has scope to raise rates at a gradual pace and has penciled in three hikes this year.Based on some market measures, investors now see the odds of a March rate hike at 75%, up from 22% last week. Interest-rate futures, in the meantime, suggest that markets now expect the Fed to raise rates 2.5 times this year, moving closer to the Fed's projections of three increases.Bank stock gained on higher chances of an interest rate hike this month. Higher longer-term interest rates can boost bank profits as they increase the spread between what banks earn by funding longer-term assets, such as loans, with shorter-term liabilities. The spread between long-term and short-term rates also expands during interest rate hikes, because long-term rates tend to rise faster than short-term rates.The Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF) rose 0.5% on Mar 3, the highest among the S&P 500 sectors. Shares of banking behemoths including Bank of America (  ), Wells Fargo (  ), Citigroup (  ) and JPMorgan Chase (  ) scaled up 0.8%, 0.3%, 0.6% and 0.7%, respectively. In the last one year period, all of them had already registered massive double digit growths. You can see Stock market booked weekly gains, with the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq increasing 0.9%, 0.7% and 0.4%, respectively. The indexes moved north as investors continued to bid up the prices as Fed aims to hike rates based on more growth and fiscal stimulus.Shares of Big Lots Inc.

 is scheduled to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2016 results on Mar 22. The big question facing investors is whether this textile-apparel company will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported.Last quarter, PVH Corp. posted a positive earnings surprise of 7.9%. Further, the company has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8.1% in the trailing four quarters. A look at PVH Corp.'s earnings estimates revisions shows that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both, the fourth quarter and fiscal 2016 has been stable, over the last 30 days. However, the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.23 per share for the fiscal fourth quarter reflects a year-over-year decline of 19.4%. Also, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $2.1 billion, down a little over 1% from the year-ago quarter.On the back of solid performance delivered by the company's premium brands - Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger - PVH Corp. has been putting up a superb show even amid a tough macroeconomic backdrop. Consequently, the company has outperformed the Zacks categorized  industry in the past one year, with a return of 4.5%, compared to the industry's decline of 24.7%.While these factors and a raised forecast for fiscal 2016 highlight its potential, management remains cautious of the overall volatility in the U.S. retail segment, intense promotions and unpredictable global consumer spending. Further, the company's international presence and outlets in various tourist destinations in the U.S. expose it to foreign currency risks in the current scenario.In fact, the company expects currency headwinds to persist and impact results in the fourth quarter and fiscal 2016. Evidently, the company envisions fiscal 2016 adjusted earnings per share in the range of $6.70-6.75, which includes an expected $1.65 per share negative impact from currency headwinds. Revenues for fiscal 2016 are anticipated to grow 2% year over year, while on a currency neutral basis revenues are expected to rise about 3%.For the fourth quarter, the company expects total revenue to dip 1% year over year, while it is anticipated to inch up 1% on a constant-currency basis. Further, fourth quarter revenues are expected to bear the brunt of Mexico deconsolidation and the licensing agreement with G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. Adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter are expected to be $1.13-$1.18, including 23 cents per share negative impact from currency translations. Thus, we remain somewhat apprehensive of the company's ability to maintain its robust earnings surprise trend.Our proven model does not conclusively show that PVH Corp. is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below: PVH Corp. currently has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both, the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.23. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . PVH Corp. carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Conagra Brands, Inc.  , expected to release earnings on Apr 6, currently has an Earnings ESP of +4.44% and a Zacks Rank #2.

" has signed an agreement to acquire assets of Manufacturer's Supply Company (Mansco), based in Hudsonville, MI. However, the terms of the deal have not been disclosed.The deal, which is expected to close by the end of March, will boost Fastenal's market footprint with commercial furniture Original Equipment Manufacturers or OEMs. On the other hand, it will provide Mansco with additional tools to serve its customer base.Mansco had generated 2016 sales of approximately $50 million, largely from its flagship Michigan location. The company also has been generating sales at two other facilities in Madison, AL, and McAllen, TX. Fastenal believes that this transaction will likely be accretive to its financials in the first twelve months, though it should not be material to earnings per share.Based in Winona, MN, Fastenal is a national wholesale distributor of industrial and construction supplies. The company has gradually grown from a fastener distributor to a full-line industrial supplier. It has expanded its product lines to include an internal manufacturing division, government sales, Internet sales, metalworking and industrial vending.If we take a closer look at Fastenal's fourth-quarter earnings release, the top line was soft since 2015 and continued to experience a slowdown throughout 2016, including a contraction of 2.4% in the fourth quarter of 2016.Again, lack of inflation, unfavorable product mix (less fasteners which generate higher margins), strong emphasis on growing average store sales, pricing and competitive pressure are hurting gross margins. Though gross margin improved 50 basis points (bps) sequentially in the fourth quarter, it was still down 10 bps year over year. Overall, 2016 gross margin dropped 80 basis points from the 2015 level.Considering the above factors, the latest acquisition is expected to drive the company's revenues.Shares of Fastenal gained over 20% in the last six months, outperforming the 10.5% gain of the Zacks categorized  industry. Estimates for the current year and the next moved up over the last 30 days. The company's cost-control initiative (Pathway to Profit) and increased vending machine installations to boost sales should drive the stock's performance in the upcoming quarters as well. Its long-term (3-5 year) EPS growth rate is pegged at 16.3%.Management indicated that the company is in ""a stable margin environment"" as it believes that recent improvements in margins on non-fasteners in the fourth quarter, a higher mix of sales of exclusive brands and better purchasing can continue to offset the ongoing mix headwinds. Additionally, recent increases in steel and other commodity prices add to the positives. If the company manages to check gross margin erosion in a low-growth environment, its stock price should reflect the same.Fastenal carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the sector include Pier 1 Imports, Inc.  , Williams-Sonoma, Inc.  and GMS Inc.  .Pier 1 sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see Pier 1 has an impressive earnings surprise history, beating estimates in three of the last four quarters at an average of 23.21%.Williams-Sonoma is expected to see earnings growth of 1.1% in the current year.GMS is expected to see earnings growth of 19.1% in the current year.Williams-Sonoma and GMS carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2017?

 , one of the largest discount retailers, is slated to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2016 results on Mar 16. In the preceding quarter, Dollar General underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.3%. In the trailing four quarters, it beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average 1.9%. Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.The question lingering in investors' minds now is, whether Dollar General will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is $1.41, reflecting a year-over-year increase of over 8%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable in the past 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $5,976 million, in comparison with $5,287 million reported in the prior-year quarter.We note that the stock has underperformed the Zacks categorized  industry and the S&P 500 in the past one year. The company's shares have declined 14%, while the Zacks categorized industry has lost 3.4% in the past one year. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 has gained 16.4% during the same time frame.Of late, Dollar General has been bearing the brunt of price deflation and the reduction in SNAP benefits that are weighing on comparable-store sales performance. In third-quarter fiscal 2016, Dollar General informed that price deflation and the reduction in SNAP benefits adversely impacted comparable-store sales by about 150 to 175 basis points. Moreover, the company's lower-than-expected sales in the last 13 quarters remain a matter of concern.On Mar 10, the company provided long-term growth model and stated that it expects earnings to fall in the range of 10% to 15%. However, during third-quarter fiscal 2016 conference call, the company stated that it expects earnings growth for fiscal 2016 to be at the low end of the earlier guidance of 10-15%.However, we believe that the company's commitment toward better price management, cost containment, private label offering, effective inventory management, merchandise and operational initiatives should drive sales and margin trends. Moreover, in order to increase traffic, Dollar General is focusing on both consumables and discretionary categories, and items. | Our proven model does not conclusively show that Dollar General is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

hares of  advanced more than 17% on Feb 21, after the company reported narrower-than-expected loss and robust revenues in the fourth quarter of 2016.In the fourth quarter of 2016, the company posted a loss of 20 cents that fared better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 29 cents. In the fourth-quarter of 2015, the company's losses were 73 cents per share. Notably, this is the first quarter in the past six quarters, where the company has reported narrower-than-expected loss.Net sales rose 4.3% to $244.9 million and also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $242 million. Comparable-store net sales increased 2.8% primarily owing to 3% surge in average sales marginally offset by a 0.2% dip in customers invoiced. However, non-comparable store sales increased $3.6 million in the prior-year quarter. Notably, the company's revenues have beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second consecutive quarter. In the past six months, the company's shares have gained 10.3%, outperforming the Zacks categorized  industry which has increased 3.4%.Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses rose 4.9% to $89.7 million in the quarter, while SG&A expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased to 36.6% from 36.4%.Gross margin for the quarter came in at 32.9% in comparison with 23% in the prior-year quarter. Sharp increase in gross margin can chiefly be attributed to prior-year decrease in the carrying value of the company's inventory of laminate flooring obtained from China, related moldings as well as due to other inventory adjustments and shifts in the mix of products. | Lumber Liquidators ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $10.3 million compared with $26.7 million in the year-ago quarter. Merchandise inventories at the end of the quarter amounted to $301.9 million compared with $244.4 million at the end of the year-ago quarter.Lumber Liquidators which shares space with Lowe's Companies, Inc.  and The Home Depot, Inc.  currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

ith expectations for a recovery in U.S. industrial output in 2017 already in place, investors in industrial products provider  (NYSE: WCC) must have eagerly awaited the company's fourth-quarter results. In the end, the headline numbers in the quarter were less important than the nuance within them and management's positive outlook for the year. There are subtle but real signs of recovery here, so let's take a closer look at the report and what management said.Let's start with the headline figures:As you can see, the headline numbers were slightly disappointing and in themselves didn't suggest that a recovery is on the way. However, the guidance for 2017 and associated commentary was more positive. First-quarter and full-year guidance for 2017 were as follows:Management merely reiterated the guidance given on its outlook call in December, so no surprises there, and no upgrade to 2017 expectations.A quick look at year-over-year growth for each end market demonstrates that three of the company's four end markets remained in negative territory in the quarter.Data source: WESCO International, Inc. CIG = commercial, institutional and government. Chart by author.Looking past the numbers, the tone on the  was a lot more positive:Indeed, other companies have also reported an improving environment. For example, industrial supply company  (NYSE: MSM) recently reported some  in its monthly sales data. In addition, industrial supplier  (NASDAQ: FAST) reported sales growth of 2.7% in December for its stores that have been open for more than five years -- its fastest growth rate since July 2015.Although WESCO's numbers or commentary weren't quite as positive as those given by MSC Industrial or Fastenal, those companies tend to have a higher exposure to maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) spending, which typically improves before capital spending -- where WESCO has heavy exposure -- starts to flow.Image source: Getty Images.In addition, the picture of its construction end markets will become a lot clearer toward the spring and summer when construction activity kicks in, while CIG end markets will also be influenced by federal government spending under President Donald Trump.All told, WESCO's numbers were lackluster but the commentary was positive, and companies across the industrial sector are starting to report improving conditions. Investors will want to look out for more budding shoots of recovery before feeling fully confident, but the company appears to be on the right track.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

There were several companies over the past week,  to shareholders. I isolated six of those companies, which have managed to increase dividends for at least a decade.In general, I look for companies that:1) Have raised dividends for 2) Have managed to grow earnings per share over the past decade3) Are available at attractive valuationsThis is a quick and dirty method that I use to determine if a company  or whether I should throw it away from further consideration.This is a qualitative characteristic which is important, because only a certain type of business will have the dependability to manage to grow dividends per share every single year for at least a decade. I then try to analyze further whether dividend hikes were supported by growth in earnings per share over the past decade.I do this in order to determine if this dividend growth was supported by growth in fundamentals, rather than by merely increasing the dividend payout ratio. After a company that passes this test, I check if  .Otherwise, I may place an alert if the stock price falls below a certain level. If the stock is attractively valued, I will analyze it and determine if it is a buy.Here are the six companies features this week: (  ) operates as an energy company primarily in Michigan. It operates through three segments: Electric Utility, Gas Utility, and Enterprises. The company raised its quarterly dividend by 7.20% to 33.25 cents per share. This marked the 11th annual dividend increase for this dividend contender. Over the past five years, CMS energy has raised its annual dividend at a rate of 8.10% per year. The company has also managed to grow earnings per share from $1.23 in 2008 to an estimated $2.02 in 2016.Currently, the stock is overvalued at 20.90 times forward earnings and yields 3.10%. I would put it on my list for further research, in case its valuation gets compelling. (  ), through its subsidiaries, engages in regulated electric, gas, and steam delivery businesses in the United States. The company raised its quarterly dividend by 3% to 69 cents per share. This marked the 43rd annual dividend increase for this  . Over the past decade, Consolidated Edison has raised its annual dividend at a rate of 1.50% per year. The slow dividend growth was due to slow growth in earnings per share and the high dividend payout ratio 78%of a decade ago. Earnings per share grew from $2.54 in 2006 to an estimated $3.97 for 2016.Currently, the stock is selling at 18.40 times earnings and yields 3.80%. Due to the slow growth in earnings and dividends, I view the stock as a hold at best. (  ), together with its subsidiaries, engages in the wholesale distribution of industrial and construction supplies in the United States, Canada, and internationally. It offers fasteners, and other industrial and construction supplies primarily under the Fastenal name.The company raised its quarterly dividend by 6.70% to 32 cents per share. This marked the 18th annual dividend increase for this dividend contender. Over the past decade, Fastenal has raised its annual dividend at a rate of 19.60% per year. This was supported by the growth in earnings per share from 66 cents in 2006 to an estimated $1.71 for 2016.Currently, the stock is overvalued at 30 times forward earnings but yields 2.50%. I like the story, and I would consider initiating a position on dips below $34 - $35/share. Unfortunately, my buy limit order to buy Fastenal stock has been sitting patiently for quite some time. (  ) is a publicly traded  which makes investments in commercial real estate. The REIT raised its monthly dividend by 4% to 21.05 cents per share. The monthly dividend company has raised dividends to its shareholders for 23 years in a row. Over the past decade, Realty Income has raised its annual dividend at a rate of 4.70% per year. I like the slow and steady nature of this defensive business model, where you rent out commercial properties to a diverse list of tenants, under long-term leases with built in rent escalation clauses. Long-term readers do know that we require a decent valuation before entering a buy order.Currently, the stock is overvalued at 20.70 times forward FFO and yields 4.20%. I would consider Realty Income attractively priced on dips below $51/share. (  ) designs, manufactures, and markets a line of analog integrated circuits worldwide. The company raised its quarterly dividend by 3.10% to 32 cents/share. This marked the 25th annual dividend increase for this dividend champion. Over the past decade, Linear Technology has raised its annual dividend at a rate of 7.90%/year. Linear Technology has steadily raised earnings per share from $1.39 in 2007 to an estimated $2.18 for FY 2017.Currently, the stock is overvalued at 28.60 times forward earnings and yields 2.10%. The company is expected to be acquired by  (  ), and the deal is expected to close by the end of 2017. As a result, it makes sense to look elsewhere. (  ) operates as a utility holding company that provides regulated electricity and natural gas services to residential, commercial, industrial, and wholesale customers in the Midwest region of the United States. It operates through three segments: Electric, Gas, and Other. This marked the 14th annual dividend increase for this dividend contender. Over the past decade, Alliant Energy has raised its annual dividend at a rate of 7.40% per year. Over the past decade, Alliant Energy has managed to deliver an anemic growth earnings from $1.45/share in 2006 to $1.69 in 2015. The company is expected to earn $1.88 per share in 2016.Currently, the stock is close to being overvalued at 20 times forward earnings and yields 3.30%. As a result of the high valuation, and the lack of consistent earnings growth, I would give the stock a pass at this time.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@6 Dividend Growth Stocks Raising Dividends Like Clockwork@2017-01-23@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/6-dividend-growth-stocks-raising-dividends-clockwork-2017-01-23

"he stock market was mixed on Wednesday, as the Dow Jones Industrials fell 22 points even as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite rose slightly on the day. Investors continue to expect an improving economy that will likely spur the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, and that led to some solid results from the financial sector today. Yet many see markets being stuck in a holding pattern until after the inauguration, when the new president will have an opportunity to make good on promises to change government policy in a number of key areas. Meanwhile, some individual stocks posted extensive gains, and  (NASDAQ: FAST) ,  (NYSE: MJN) , and  (NASDAQ: CLCD) were among the best performers on Wednesday. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so well.Image source: Fastenal.Fastenal gained 6% after the maker of fasteners and other industrial products for business customers reported its fourth-quarter financial results. The company said revenue was up 3% for the period, pushing net income up by the same percentage and leading to earnings of $0.40 per share. Fastenal has cut its headcount by more than 1,100 employees, due largely to attrition, and net reductions in store counts have played a role in cost control while having little impact on sales. The company's Onsite initiative has helped drive sales with key customers, and the safety-supply business in particular has benefited from availability through industrial vending machines that Fastenal has developed in recent years. With the prospects for the industrial economy looking brighter, Fastenal hopes to ride the coattails of its customers to better results ahead.Mead Johnson Nutrition climbed 5% on speculation that the maker of infant formula and other nutritional products might be a takeover target. Some believe  could be in the market to acquire Mead Johnson Nutrition, but this isn't the first time the Illinois-based company has seen M&A interest. Reports suggest a major European investment bank could be providing advice on a possible combination of the two companies, but the relatively small jump in the stock reflects investors' skepticism that things will be any different this time around than they have been in the past, when similar ideas were floated.Finally, CoLucid Pharmaceuticals soared 33%. The small developer of migraine headache treatments announced Wednesday that  (NYSE: LLY) would acquire CoLucid for $960 million. Under the terms of the deal, CoLucid shareholders will receive $46.50 per share in cash. Interestingly, CoLucid's lasmiditan migraine drug was initially discovered at Lilly, but CoLucid licensed the drug 12 years ago. Now that Lilly's priorities have changed, the fit was good, and CoLucid CEO Thomas Mathers said he was ""excited that lasmiditan will be back at Lilly ... for the conclusion of Phase 3 development and potential commercialization."" With Lilly's expertise in marketing and development, the outcome might be best for all involved.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Foreign exchange hurt daily sales in the quarter by 0.2% while acquisitions contributed 0.2% to sales.Fastenal's sales, in the past few quarters, have been affected by price deflation of fastener products, currency headwinds and lack of new products and services. The top line has been dented by lower sales to manufacturing and construction customers due to overall weakness in the industrial economy.On a monthly basis, daily sales increased 3.2% in December, 1.2% in November and 3.9% in October of 2016 compared to -3.8%, -1.1% and -0.8%, respectively, in December, November and October of 2015.This industrial and construction supplies wholesale distributor serves customers in the manufacturing and non-residential construction markets.Daily sales to manufacturing customers (representing almost 50% of revenues) rose 3%, better than the 2.2% decline in the prior-year quarter and the 1% rise in the previous quarter.The daily sales growth rate of fastener products (used mainly for industrial production and accounting for approximately 35--40% of the company's business) declined 2.4% in the quarter, compared with a 6.2% drop in the year-ago quarter and a 2.9% decline in the previous quarter.Price deflation of fasteners and lower demand from the heavy machinery manufacturing customer base -- due to lower production requirements -- has been denting fastener sales.Non-fastener product sales (used mainly for maintenance) increased 5.9%, higher than 1.2% recorded in the year-ago quarter and 4.9% in the previous quarter. Though the non-fastener business is doing better than fasteners driven by strong vending trends, it has nonetheless weakened due to softness in the industrial environment.In the non-residential construction market, daily sales to non-residential construction customers (representing 20% to 25% of revenues) declined 1.6% as compared with a 6.1% decrease in the prior-year quarter and a decline of 1.9% in the previous quarter. Volatility and softer energy prices impacted sales in this market.As of Dec 31, 2016, Fastenal operated 62,822 vending machines, up 13.2% year over year. During the quarter, the company signed 3,760 machine contracts, down 6.4% year over year.After a soft 2013, vending trends improved through 2014 and 2015 as well as in 2016 as management's efforts to enhance the quality of signings/installs paid off.Gross margin of 49.8% in the fourth quarter of 2016 declined 10 basis points (bps) year over year but improved 50 bps sequentially. Gross margin was hurt by an unfavorable customer mix and product mix.Pre-tax earnings increased 1.5% to $180.8 million. Pre-tax margins declined 20 bps to 19.1% in the quarter.Fastenal's earnings of $1.73 per share in fiscal 2016 decreased 2.3% year over year but managed to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.72 slightly. The company reported net sales of $3.96 billion, up 2.4% year over year. The net sales were almost on par with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.97 billion.Cash and cash equivalents were $112.7 million as of Dec 31, 2016, down from $129.0 million as on Dec 31, 2015. Long-term debt was $379.5 million, up from $302.9 million at 2015-end.The company plans to continue to open stores in 2017 to sustain and improve its network and drive growth. Fastenal expects net capital expenditures at around $119 million in 2017, a decrease of $64 million or 35% from 2016. | Fastenal has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better -ranked stocks in the sector include Bob Evans Farms, Inc.  , The Cheesecake Factory Inc.  and AutoZone, Inc.  .Bob Evans carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

arnings season is upon us and that means the market will be focused on what really matters for stock prices, the health and well-being of corporate America, rather than reacting to the latest tweet from the President-elect and the fashionable take on what his economic policies will be. There are several important releases due this week, and they will likely provide opportunities to traders and investors alike.Morgan Stanley () reported this morning and followed Bank of America (), JP Morgan Chase () and Wells Fargo () in beating the street’s expectations. While strength in the banking system is welcome, however, it tells us little about the state of the economy outside the financial sector, especially when, as was the case in Q4, those beats came mainly from higher than expected trading revenues.We should not forget that while financials have been a leader in the so called “Trump Rally” it has also been about improving prospects for manufacturing and energy, so this evening’s results from CSX () should be watched closely. An upward revision from them in guidance for this year would fuel the rally even further but caution or worry about the possible negative effects of a trade war could turn things around quickly.Banks will also grab much of the attention tomorrow, when Citigroup () and Goldman Sachs () report, but once again more mundane names such as the building supply company Fastenal () and energy services company Kinder Morgan () will tell us a lot more about the underlying strength in the economy.The most interesting release scheduled for Wednesday, however, is Netflix ().It is easy to lose sight of just what a remarkable story of corporate adaptability Netflix is. They started as a disruptor of the video rental business, offering DVDs by mail, but quickly shifted to an online presence. Then, when consumer habits changed again, they pivoted to streaming and original content. This ability to see shifts in behavior and react quickly is not an accident. It is the result of superb management, and regardless of what tomorrow’s numbers show, that makes the stock a good long term investment.In fact, it could even be argued that a miss from NFLX would be the best thing for potential investors, allowing for some discounted purchases over the next few weeks.Thursday also has its share of financial companies reporting, but with the big names out of the way the focus then will be more on the regional banks. Of those, the earnings from BB&T () should be particularly closely watched. The North Carolina based bank is known for a fairly conservative, traditional approach to the banking business, with loans rather than trading being the generator of revenue and profit. Higher interest rates will certainly have helped BB&T as they will have all banks, but results and commentary regarding the bank’s core business will be illuminating with regard to the bigger economic picture.On Friday yet more regional banks report, including Sun Trust () and Citizens () but the focus here will probably be on the usually somewhat boring results from General Electric (). It is not that GE’s business is boring; it is just that with a company as large, transparent and well covered as them earnings rarely contain any surprises.That should be the case this time around too, but, as with CSX, changes in guidance from GE could well influence the direction of the broader market. They have interests in so many areas of manufacturing that a trend for them can be seen as a trend for the economy overall.It will, then, be an interesting week. If history is our guide, we can expect the majority of companies reporting this week to beat expectations, but as is often the case, investors should be looking beyond the bare results. The forward looking statements, particularly from those outside the financial sector, will determine the direction of the stock market in the immediate future and should therefore be the focus of our attention.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Week Ahead: Earnings in Focus@2017-01-17@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/week-ahead-earnings-focus-2017-01-17
 is set to report fourth-quarter 2016 results on Jan 18, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 2.22%. The company has posted one positive earnings surprise in the past four quarters. Hence, it has an average four-quarter negative surprise of 2.74%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Fastenal is a wholesale distributor to industrial and construction customers. It serves the manufacturing and non-residential construction markets.Recently, the company revealed that its volume, revenue and customer count showed solid growth in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. The company's revenues in the fourth quarter rose 174% year over year on 209% volume growth. The upside was mainly driven by the addition of new stations as well as a higher utilization per station compared to the year-ago quarter. The company also added 3,177 new customers in the quarter, reflecting an increase of 92% year over year.Meanwhile, Fastenal added that almost 13,000 full electric vehicles were on road in the Netherlands at the end of 2016, representing approximately 38% growth year over year.For the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stands at 38 cents, reflecting a 2.3% year-over-year decrease. Meanwhile, the estimate for revenues is pegged at $951.4 million, implying 3.1% growth.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Fastenal is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here, as you will see below. The Earnings ESP is 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 38 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . Fastenal's Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.However, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum. | Here are some companies in the construction sector, that, according to our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Chicago Bridge & Iron Company N.V.  , expected to release its quarterly results on Feb 23, has an Earnings ESP of +2.76% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see  .Home Depot, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +2.27% and a Zacks Rank #3.

n Nov 28, we issued an updated research report on  - a national wholesale distributor of industrial and construction supplies, mainly serving the manufacturing and non-residential construction markets.Fastenal reported lower-than-expected results in the third quarter of 2016, missing estimates for both earnings and sales. Adjusted earnings of 44 cents per share in the third quarter missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 45 cents by 2.2%. Earnings also declined 6.4% year over year due to higher expenses and weak margins.Net sales of $1,013.1 million lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,014 million by 0.1%. Sales, however, increased 1.8% year over year. Fastenal's sales, in the past few quarters, have been affected by price deflation of fastener products, currency headwinds and lack of new products and services. The top line has been impacted by lower sales to manufacturing and construction customers due to overall weakness in the industrial economy.Lack of inflation, unfavorable product mix, strong emphasis on growing average store sales, pricing and competitive pressure have been hurting the gross margin for quite sometime now. In fact, gross margin of 49.3% in the third quarter of 2016, 49.5% in the second quarter of 2016, 49.8% in the first quarter of 2016 and 49.9% in the fourth quarter of 2015 was below the company's long-term average of around 50%.The customer mix shifted toward the large-account end-market, which produces low-margin gross profit but stronger operating income. The product mix shifted from high-margin fastener products to lower margin non-fastener products. In fact, the company does not see any improvement in gross margin rates through the rest of 2016 as well.Fastenal has adopted FAST Solutions, an industrial vending process that has the potential to revolutionize the industrial distribution system and boost profits. The company has installed vending machines at customer locations which also provide information on the products.Industrial vending is one of the primary growth drivers for Fastenal and has the potential to significantly increase sales and profits. As of Sep 30, 2016, Fastenal operated 60,400 vending machines, up 12.8% year over year. During the quarter, the company signed 4,783 machine contracts, up 2% from the earlier-year quarter. Vending machines now account for 45% of the company's sales, higher than 44.6% in the prior quarter.Fastenal currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Better-ranked stocks in the Retail-Wholesale sector include Domino's Pizza, Inc.  , McDonald's Corp.  and Papa John's International Inc.  .Domino's Pizza sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and is expected to witness a 22.1% increase in full-year 2016 earnings. You can see  .McDonald's carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and is likely to see a 14.2% rise in full-year 2016 earnings.Papa John's - a Zacks Rank #2 stock - is expected to witness a 19.9% increase in full-year 2016 earnings.In addition to the recommendations that are available to the public on our website, how would you like to follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time?Our experts cover all kinds of trades… from value to momentum . . . from stocks under $10 to ETF and option moves . . . from stocks that corporate insiders are buying up to companies that are about to report positive earnings surprises.

 (  ) is emerging to be one of the most promising companies involved in the vending machine industry. While it sees itself as an industrial supplies company, Fastenal has over the last eight years encroached in the technology sector with a key focus on vending machine technologies.Founded in 1967 and incorporated a year later, Fastenal begun by selling mostly fasteners such as screws, threaded rods and nuts, which are used in construction and manufacturing.The company has since expanded its portfolio of products, bringing its total product offering to more than 690,000 alongside a variety of services, including inventory management, SKUs, vending and machining.Fastenal does not develop its own products, but rather it sells products manufactured by other companies. It acts as a facilitator in the distribution chain by helping customers to find specific products for specified needs.After diversifying its offerings, it has managed to redesign its growth model, which now seeks to capitalize on evolving technologies in the consumer market.    The company has seen a significant growth in revenues and net income over the last seven years, with the top line growing from $2 billion to nearly $4 billion without breaks. On the other hand, the bottom line managed to increase from about $184 million to more than $510 million in the same time, again illustrating the milestones gained since the company launched its first vending machine in 2008.Right now, companies are trying to develop innovative ways of dispensing products in small units in a bid to initiating valuable customer engagements with their products. While  (  ) has for many years been one of the leading companies in the dispensing technology market, more players have joined the lot and now, even the likes  (  ) have begun to see the sense in vending technologies.Coca-Cola allows people to purchase a variety of its drinks from vending machines located across the world in retail malls, restaurants and cafes rather than buying the already packaged products. With such access, customers can mix hundreds of flavors to their desired quantities to come up with unique cocktails.Apple, on the other hand, has placed its vending machines at strategic locations such as airports and high-end hotels. These are places that could give consumers ample time to take a closer look at the products.Vending machines are common in food products, cosmetics, snacks and pharmaceuticals, but based on recent developments, tech devices, tools and fasteners also appear to be taking their place in the cue. The industry is attracting players from all over the world as it continues to gain traction across several markets.One of the latest vending machine innovations comes from Chile, a nation that is firmly on its way up towards reaching developed country status. Entrepreneurship is driving growth in the private sector as investors continue to find ways of alleviating some of the common hygiene issues in urban centers. Algramo is a Santiago, Chile-based company founded by Jose Manuel Moller and Salvador Achondo. The company is trying to cut the costs of various products by taking the packaging out of the equation.Instead, it uses small re-usable containers which consumers can fill with various products from their vending machines that are installed across major cities in the country. Consumers can buy various cereals including lentils, chickpeas and rice, as well as common cleaning detergents from the vending machines.These developments indicate that the future of vending technologies remains bright and companies that have invested heavily in the industry could reap the benefits within the next few years. As discussed at the beginning, Fastenal is one of the main players, and as per recent reports, the company has already launched more than 60,000 vending machines in North America.Fastenal is fine-tuning its strategy for vending machines by incorporating internet sales such that whenever one of its vending machines is running out of supplies, restocking can be ordered instantly. This helps in maintaining optimum levels for each product in the machine. The company can also engage with its customers to know which products are in high demand for a given vending machine at a certain location, thereby enabling it to manage the inventory respectively.Fastenal may not be involved directly with other players in the vending machine business like Apple, Coca-Cola and Algramo.

"Image source: WESCO International.Distributing industrial supplies when U.S. industrial production is in a recession is a tough business: Just ask management at  (NYSE: WCC) . It gets worse. Much of WESCO's end market consists of precisely the kind of industries (oil and gas, mining, heavy industries, and more) which have largely been responsible for the slowdown in the industrial sector.However, this quarter it was the turn of its construction end markets to disappoint. What happened, and why?The headline numbers from the quarter:As you can see above, sales declined more than expected, and margin came in at the low end. In this context, it's no surprise that management lowered its expectations for the full year:Clearly, the difficult third quarter took its toll, and management was forced to cut guidance across the board. In fact, the only positive change to expectations was that free cash flow is now expected to represent more than 125% of adjusted net income, compared to a previous forecast of more than 100%.WESCO is doing a good job of generating cash in a slowdown. But don't get too excited, because it's partly to do with taking on less inventory and reducing accounts payable -- things are likely to reverse if sales improve.Going into the results, investors had cause to be blase about events. After all, when WESCO's industrial-supply peer  (NASDAQ: FAST) reported, Fastenal's CEO Dan Florness outlined end markets that were little changed in the quarter. However, Fastenal is more of a general industrial supplier, while WESCO has more exposure (direct and indirect) to areas of relative weakness in the industrial economy.A quick look at organic sales growth by end market demonstrates weakness across each area: All reported organic sales declined. However, as stated above, management expected a sales decline in the quarter, it's just that construction sales in particular were disappointing. WESCO CEO John Engel put it clearly in the earnings release: ""Sales were below expectations, reflecting a decline in construction in both the U.S. and Canada.""Image source: WESCO International presentation.As you can see above, industrial sales (in which the company has heavy exposure to oil and gas, metals, and mining customers) has had a difficult time in the last two years -- it's no surprise to see ongoing weakness there. Moreover, management claimed that outside of construction, its end markets performed as expected.Regarding the weakness in construction, a few themes emerged from the earnings report:When pushed on the issue, WESCO's management candidly admitted that results were disappointing; however, it claimed they were not due to canceled activity, but rather to project-timing issues causing delays. Here again, it appears that exposure to oil and gas and the industrial sector (specifically, industrial construction) has hurt the company.WESCO International needs large commercial-construction activity to pick up. Image source: Getty Images.All told, a combination of factors hit WESCO in the quarter. It's especially disappointing because just last quarter, management had guided analysts toward its construction markets being between flat and up low single digits for the full year (a stronger outlook than that given at the end of its fiscal 2015).Going forward, investors will be hoping industrial conditions turn positive, so supply companies like Fastenal and WESCO can flourish again.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. And we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in-the-know investors!

"n this series, we look through the most recent  report, and then we cherry pick only those companies that have experienced insider buying within the past six months. The officers and directors of a company tend to have a unique insider's view of the business, and presumably the only reason an insider would choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money - maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both. So when stocks turn up that see insider buying, and are also top ranked, investors are wise to take notice. One such company is Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST), which saw buying by Director Michael J. Ancius.Back on October 13, Ancius invested $27,174.00 into 700 shares of FAST, for a cost per share of $38.82. In trading on Wednesday, shares were changing hands as low as $47.00 per share, which is 21.1% above Ancius's purchase price. It should be noted that Ancius has collected $0.30/share in dividends since the time of their purchase, so they are currently up 21.8% on their purchase from a total return basis. Fastenal Co. shares are currently trading +5.64% on the day. The chart below shows the one year performance of FAST shares, versus its 200 day moving average:Looking at the chart above, FAST's low point in its 52 week range is $35.18 per share, with $51.56 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $50.98. By comparison, below is a table showing the prices at which insider buying was recorded over the last six months:
  
The DividendRank report noted that among the coverage universe, FAST shares displayed both attractive valuation metrics and strong profitability metrics. The report also cited the strong quarterly dividend history at Fastenal Co., and favorable long-term multi-year growth rates in key fundamental data points.The report stated, ''  ''The annualized dividend paid by Fastenal Co. is $1.28/share, currently paid in quarterly installments, and its most recent dividend ex-date was on 01/30/2017. Below is a long-term dividend history chart for FAST, which the report stressed as being of key importance. Indeed, studying a company's past  can be of good help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Fastenal Named Top Dividend Stock With Insider Buying and 2.65% Yield (FAST)@2017-01-18@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/fastenal-named-top-dividend-stock-insider-buying-and-265-yield-fast-2017-01-18

" (  ) may no longer be as relevant to the U.S. economy and the stock market, but the company gets plenty of mileage from the widely-held belief that its earnings report kick-starts each quarterly reporting cycle. Some in the market even see the company's earnings report as a leading indicator of what to expect from the rest of corporate America. This view is most likely overstating the company's status, notwithstanding aluminum's growing role in the automotive, aircraft manufacturing and construction end markets.The bottom line is that the relevance of Alcoa's results and outlook is fairly limited; it doesn't tell us much beyond what may be useful for the broader industrial metals space. Results the same day from industrial nuts-and-bolts supplier  (  ) and the following day (October 12th) from railroad operator  (  ) have a lot more relevance to the economically sensitive parts of the U.S. economy.This week will bring earnings results from 29 companies, including 9 S&P 500 members that include most of the money center banks. These wouldn't be the first Q3 reports, as companies with fiscal quarters ending in August have already been coming out with results and those reports get counted as part of the Q3 tally. In total, 25 S&P 500 members with fiscal quarters ending in August have reported Q3 results already.The chart below shows the weekly calendar of Q3 earnings reports for the S&P 500 index.Estimates for Q3 declined as the quarter got underway, in-line with the trend that we have become used to seeing over the last few years. That said, the magnitude of negative revisions that Q3 estimates suffered was smaller relative to other recent quarters.Total earnings for the S&P 500 index are currently expected to be down -2.9% from the same period last year on +1.2% higher revenues. This would compare to 2016 Q2 earnings growth of -2.8% on +0.2% higher revenues.The table below shows the summary picture for Q3 earnings, revenues and margins contrasted with the corresponding results from the previous quarter.As you can see, Energy still remains the biggest drag on the aggregate growth picture, with Autos and Transportation as the other major growth laggards. Tough comparisons at  (  ) and the air carriers, particularly  (  ) and  (  ), explain the growth issues in those two sectors.For the two biggest sectors, Technology earnings are expected to be down -1.8% on -1.1% lower revenues while Finance earnings are expected to be up +3.9% on +1.3% higher revenues. The Tech decline is solely a function of  (  ), which is expected to see earnings decline -20.7% from the same period last year on -9.6% lower revenues. Excluding the Apple drag, the Tech sector's earnings would be up +3.0%.The chart below shows current quarterly earnings growth expectations for the index in 2016 Q3 and the following four quarters contrasted with actual declines in the preceding four quarters. Earnings growth has been in negative territory for 5 straight quarters through 2016 Q2, but Q3 is expected to be the last quarter with earnings declines. As you can see, positive growth is expected to resume from Q4, with the growth pace expected to ramp up meaningfully in the following quarters.The Energy sector drag is expected to end in 2016 Q4 and beyond, as the chart below of the sector's earnings shows.The improved Energy sector outlook makes sense, given shifting comparisons and the recent momentum in  . But we will have to wait to find out if estimates for the other sectors will hold up as companies report Q3 results and provide guidance for Q4 and beyond. It will be interesting to see if the decelerated pace of negative revisions that we saw the last earnings season will get repeated this time as well. (  )Total earnings for the 25 S&P 500 members that have reported results already are up +2.6% from the same period last year on +4.2% higher revenues, with 80% beating EPS estimates and 64% coming ahead of revenue estimates. This is better performance than we have seen from the same group of 25 index members in other recent periods, as the comparison charts below show.The picture emerging from the above comparison chart would be in-line with our modestly favorable commentary on the Q2 earnings season when we were detecting an ever-so-slight improvement in the growth picture. Earnings growth was in negative territory in Q2 - the 5th quarter in a row of earnings declines for the index - but the pace of declines was nevertheless an improvement over what we had seen in the preceding two quarters. This gave rise to the narrative that the worst was likely behind us now on the growth front and that the picture will steadily be improving going forward.We will see if those hopes will pan out in the coming days, but we probably shouldn't read too much into the very small sample of reports at this stage. .

"Shutterstock photoThings are breaking in favor of manager Joseph Fath and the T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund (  ) he manages. The $44.6 billion portfolio was outperforming 98% of its large-cap growth fund rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. over the three months, going into Thursday.That could help lift the  , which has been roughly in the middle of the pack so far this year, back to its longer-term record of outperformance, as Fath approaches his three-year anniversary at the helm in January.Over the past three years the fund's average annual gain of 9.53% has topped 85% of its peers, which averaged 7.37% yearly. The S&P 500 notched a 9.18% annual pace.The fund's recent rally stems from the market's rotation back toward the type of growth stocks that Fath favors. Earlier in the year, the market was rewarding deep cyclical stocks. ""That's not an area we play,"" Fath said.Fath prefers stocks with superior growth in earnings and cash flow, in good times or bad.The fund's long-term success has made it one of  . It outperformed the S&P 500 over the one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods ended Dec. 31. Only 9% of U.S. diversified stock funds accomplished that. And it was in the top 100 in three categories: all U.S. equity, all growth funds and all large caps.How is the fund managing this rebound? Eight of its 10 largest holdings as of Sept. 30 had IBD Composite Ratings of 83 or better. Five of its top 10 new buys also had Comp Ratings of at least 83. (  ) is one the fund's top holdings. It has trended higher since early July, and it did well on Wednesday, the first day after Donald Trump's election victory. But it pulled back on Thursday, finishing 4% below its all-time high. (  ) is among the fund's top buys. The stock has rallied this month, adding 8% this week. Many investors look at it as a way to benefit from investments in U.S. infrastructure under a Trump administration. Fath instead is focused on the stock's ongoing fundamentals, not its potential macroeconomic drivers.""It's more of a mergers-and-acquisitions story within industrials,"" he said. ""And it is a disciplined, well-run company with seven business units. They're all doing well, all pushing margin structure over 20%. Only the welding unit is under pressure.""Fath added that the company management has executed ""good deployment of capital. They've gotten rid of bad stuff, focused on their best stuff and made good deals in recent years.""Another of his holdings,  (  ), is more of a Trump infrastructure play, he says. The stock, which has an IBD Composite Rating of 94, gapped up 12% on Wednesday on massive volume and was up again Thursday. That puts Martin Marietta shares above the level at which you'd want to buy them under CAN SLIM rules.The company produces crushed stone, and an other aggregates for construction.Earnings per share grew 886%, 56% and 22% the past three quarters.The company stands to benefit from programs like the Free and Secure Trade (  ) program, which is a commercial clearance program for known low-risk shipments entering the United States from Canada and Mexico. ""(Those programs) have been slow to roll out but are ramping up now,"" he said.Also, Fath sees the company's low single-digit volume and high single-digit pricing as set to recover into high single-digit growth as the heavy rain and flooding in the Southeast that hurt them earlier this year have passed.Many investors expect certain financial stocks to benefit from a lighter regulatory burden during a Trump regime as well as from a rising-rate environment.  (MS) gapped up 7% on Wednesday and was up again Thursday.Trading around 38, that left the big financial firm's shares extended above their 32.47 buy point.""(A bullish outlook for a) lot of financials is predicated on a rising-rate environment,"" Fath said. ""We think Morgan Stanley is a good company-specific story.""Fath likes Morgan Stanley's heightened focus on wealth management.And the company's bank is becoming a bigger source of income and profit as the firm does more lending. (RACE) is another holding that Fath likes. The Italy-based sports- and luxury-car maker was spun off from Fiat just over a year ago.""This stock does not get a lot of attention,"" Fath said. ""European car analysts follow it. But it is really a luxury goods company. It does not have a lot of capital requirements and it does have a lot of demand backlog.""The company enjoys production growth of roughly 4% a year, Fath says. And it has annual pricing power of about 3% to 5%.""This is a company that can grow in the midteens for the rest of the decade,"" Fath said. ""Other luxury goods makers like Hermes trade at much higher multiples. In today's market, we like a company that can be defensive as well as offensive.""Generally, superwealthy consumers don't downshift their car buying even during a time of slow or uncertain economic growth, Fath says.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Vroom!

A study of analyst recommendations at the major brokerages shows that  (  ) is the #6 broker pick, on average, out of the 30 stocks making up the  , according to  .In forming this rank, the analyst opinions from the major brokerage houses were tallied, and averaged; then, the underlying components were ranked according to those averages. Investors often interpret analyst opinions from different angles - a popular analyst pick could mean that many sharp minds individually came to the same bullish conclusion, and therefore the stock should do well, but it could also mean that if the company stumbles, that would come as a negative surprise. Home Depot also comes in above the median of analyst picks among the broader  components, claiming the #118 spot out of 500.From the other direction, when companies have a low rank among analysts, it isn't necessarily the case that investors should conclude that the stock will perform poorly. It can, of course, but a bullish investor could also take the contrarian angle and read into the data that there is lots of room for upside because the stock is so out of favor.For these reasons, we at  find value to putting together these rankings, because both the top and the bottom ends of the lists can often make for some interesting stock picking ideas for further research.The post appeared first on .The post ) appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@How Home Depot Inc Ranks As a Top Analyst Pick (HD)@2016-10-12@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/how-home-depot-inc-ranks-as-a-top-analyst-pick-hd-2016-10-12
"Each week, Felix and Oscar host a poker game. We listen in on current trading ideas in the few minutes before the game starts. They like to call this their ""Stock Exchange."" I am the only human present, and the only one using fundamental analysis. Their methods are excellent, as you will learn if you join us for a few weeks. As the time frames and risk profiles differ, so do the stock ideas.This is the only place you can get several great technical ideas each week, along with a response based upon the fundamentals. I have placed more background at the end of the article. Each week features a different expert. The names help you pick a favorite trading style. Comments, dissent, and specific stock questions are welcome!Our featured expert is Oscar. Vince (our modeling guru) designed Oscar to be an aggressive sector trader. The time horizon is about three weeks. Oscar's trading universe is over 30 sectors. Unlike most other sector models, Oscar uses baskets of stocks chosen through a statistical analysis of actual trading. If there are important gaps, we use an ETF instead. Oscar takes more chances than the other models, but employs two elements of risk control:Even if you do not trade market sectors, Oscar's top choices are a good place to begin your own research.Here are the ideas for this week, beginning with Oscar, our featured expert.I still like the Energy and Utilities sectors we've been discussing lately, but the  (  ) is my pick for this week. This is a sector that's underperformed for the past 6 months, but has still shown some overall steady growth. This would be an example of the ""sleeper"" everyone wants to pick up for their weekly fantasy football team.You can see the same below with American Airlines (  ). It is one of the major holdings in JETS - and it's not hard to see why. If you're looking for a stock like the overall industry, AAL is likely your best bet.Is this another pick you got from your bookie? The football Jets are playing someone they can beat this week.  No! I found this one on my own. And I don't care for the Jets, no matter who is at quarterback. Richard Branson said that you can become a millionaire by starting with a billion dollars and buying an airline. Who is Richard Branson? I am going by the chart. At least you picked a company that has earnings, although we only have three years of history since the last bankruptcy. You are so negative! I said it was a sleeper. Right. Fantasy football. You are not even playing in the office fantasy pool. That is child's play. I am in a league with some of those Chicago models. Any of us could win your league.As people should know by now, I love to buy the dips. (See last week's  for more information about Holmes). This week, Fastenal (  ) is on my buy list. This wholesale distributer of industrial and construction supplies has suffered mightily since April, but it looks to me like it's ready for a bounce, and I'm ready to pounce. I'll be very cautious and get out below $37, but I'm looking for a rebound to $41.25 or better.I think this could lose another 30% or so.  That is why I use stops.I have studiously selected Basic Materials: Metals and Minerals this week. U.S. Silica (  ) is a prime textbook example of what a chart should be. It has great momentum and should be around for a long time.I also like basic materials, but you have picked another company with no earnings! I keep trying to teach you all what NMF means when you look at the P/E ratio.  Look at the chart. Look at this chart from Chuck Carnevale. Only losses this year.Look at the price momentum. The market is sending you a message.  of SeekingAlpha says: Hi anpere, you've a long list of energy stocks, and my opinion is not specific to those, but to energy. I, too, have a long list of energy holdings, and I hope they are all winners! Good luck with your picks, they should coincide with mine! I rate DIS near the bottom of the 700-stock universe. I think it is OK - reasonable value now, and projected earnings increases. SPWR is not in my current trading universe. They are asking me to expand the universe for questions, but have not yet agreed to raise my pay. I prefer either a solid record of earnings. If I am choosing to speculate, I need a very good story. I don't see either one in SPWR. And to my many fans: Please keep your questions coming. I could use the overtime pay! Ask about a specific stock, or perhaps an ETF. I am interested in sectors, but need a representative ETF to help.I do not have a new idea this week. Most of my choices are from April, and they are all doing well. No new idea? What do you think we are paying you for? Wisdom. Sometimes the smartest course is to do nothing. I like my current positions. The only soft one is Carter (  ), which just did well on earnings. You do not do any earnings forecasts. The chart tells all... you just need to pay attention.What is this about? Since launching this series, I have had good questions on three general themes. Here are the questions and some brief answers.If you want an opinion about a specific stock or sector, even those we did not mention, just ask! Put questions in the comments. Address them to a specific expert if you wish. Each has a specialty. Who is your favorite? (You can choose me, although my feelings will not be hurt very much if you prefer one of the models). is fussy, precise, and very cautious. He looks for what is working, but it also must have upside potential. He is an investor who thinks long term. Felix will not usually announce new picks, but he will answer questions, saying what he thinks about specific stocks. He will also comment on favorite themes and sectors. is naturally optimistic and a bit excitable. He likes to go with winners, and focuses on a one-month time frame. He trades either sector ETFs or a basket of stocks (equally weighted) that reflect a sector. Oscar will mention a favorite sector each week, and will also answer questions about sectors. is a trader, but a cautious one. Holmes emphasizes asset protection through profit-taking, stops, and trailing stops. He is careful in selecting new positions, and generally looks at an intermediate time frame. While he does not know the definition of ""mean reversion,"" he loves rebounds! There is no set holding period, but two or three months is not unusual. Holmes will tell us one stock recommended that week. For those who sign up for his email list (no charge, privacy respected, holmes at newarc dot com), he will report exits with a one-day delay. trades more frequently than the others, but still limits risk. Her inspiration helps to find good ideas. Her excellent quant skills find attractive risk/reward opportunities. Her wisdom leads her to exit trades that are not working. Athena will provide a new idea each week. usually has some comments about stock or market fundamentals. Unlike the other witty participants, he sounds like an old prof.The conversation is light-hearted, but the stock analysis is serious. We own positions in each of the stocks mentioned.See also  on seekingalpha.comThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Stock Exchange: Oscar And Airlines; Fastenal And U.S. Silica Attractive Trades@2016-10-27@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/stock-exchange-oscar-and-airlines-fastenal-and-us-silica-attractive-trades-2016-10-27

 is a national wholesale distributor of industrial and construction supplies. It distributes its products through company-owned stores mostly located in North America. The company has gradually grown from a fastener distributor to a full-line industrial supplier.Weakness in sales of the industrial fasteners, lower sales to customers in the oil & gas industry, a stronger U.S. dollar, softness in the Canadian business and overall weakness in the industrial economy is hurting the company's sales.

 is set to report third-quarter 2016 results on Oct 11, before the market opens.Last quarter, Fastenal posted a negative earnings surprise of 6.25%. The company has posted two positive earnings surprises in the past four quarters. However, it has an average four-quarter negative surprise of 1.65%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Our proven model shows that Fastenal is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. , which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, stands at +2.22%. This is a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. The Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 46 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at 45 cents. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. Fastenal carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates.Meanwhile, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 and 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement. | Fastenal is a wholesale distributor to industrial and construction customers. It serves the manufacturing and non-residential construction markets.Fastenal's revenues are being hurt by lower sales in the oil & gas industry and softness in the Canadian business. These trends are likely to impact results in the soon-to-be reported quarter. The bearish trend had affected Jul 2016 sales figures, as the company continued to report weakness in its fasteners business. Net sales in July decreased 7.2% while daily sales improved 2.1%.The picture was quite impressive in the month of August. Net sales in the month increased 9.9% year over year while daily sales improved 0.3%, softer than the July figure. Unfavorable currency impacted sales by 0.3% in the both the months.Indeed, lack of price inflation, an unfavorable product mix along with pricing and competitive pressure are hurting gross margins. The product mix has shifted from high-margin fastener products to lower margin non-fastener offerings. The customer mix has shifted toward the large-account end-market, which produces low gross margin but high operating income.However, on a positive note, vending trends improved in the second quarter of 2016. After remaining soft in 2013, vending trends improved through 2014 and 2015 as well as the first half of 2016, as management's efforts toward enhancing the quality of signings/installs paid off. The company intends to increase its investments in the vending program and expects it to outperform in 2016 and beyond.For the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stands at $1.64, reflecting a 39.3% year-over-year decrease. Meanwhile, the estimate for revenues is pegged at $3.97 billion, implying 2.53% growth.Here are some companies to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Wingstop Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +9.09% and a Zacks Rank #2.

"e're less than six weeks from the November elections, and election season usually has investors picking stocks based on the prospective policies of candidates, leading to a certain amount of market volatility. Uncertainty around the global economy and monetary policy has only helped to boost volatility this election season.But betting on stocks that win on one particular candidate is a crap shoot at best, especially in this election. Clinton and Trump differ so radically across nearly every talking point that betting on stocks favored by a particular party means the potential for massive losses if the other candidate wins.The Real Clear Politics aggregate of national polls puts Clinton's lead at just 2.3%, close to the tightest the race has been for months. Nobody is able to call this one yet.Unbelievable as it may seem, the candidates actually do agree on one topic. They've both made one particular sector of the economy a key position of their platform.For that sector, the news after November could range from good to very good and a leader in the space is primed to takeoff.While unprecedented monetary stimulus helped to boost stock prices over the last seven years, it didn't do much to jumpstart the U.S. economy. Retail sales and industrial production both disappointed last month, even as the Fed tried to ease markets into the next rate increase.As the Fed closes the tap on monetary stimulus, there's just one source that can help to keep the economy growing.Both candidates have made fiscal stimulus a key to their economic plans. Government spending has been a drag on U.S. economic growth, with Stifel Nicolaus estimating that fiscal contraction has cost GDP 0.8% on an annualized basis since 2009.Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton has proposed a $275 billion infrastructure plan and has released a report showing that every $1 billion in infrastructure spending creates 13,000 jobs. Clinton's plan calls for $50 billion annually spent on roads and bridges over five years, in addition to $25 billion to seed an infrastructure bank that could raise another $225 billion in private investment.Trump pointed to the nation's worsening infrastructure in his acceptance of the Republican nomination saying, ""Our roads and bridges are falling apart and our airports are in third-word condition."" The real estate mogul is characteristically vague on an estimate of total spending, but has said his plan would be at least double Clinton's amount.A report by the American Society of Civil Engineers found a needed $5.2 trillion in infrastructure spending to bring the network up to an acceptable level by 2040. The ASCE has warned the government for several years of the crumbling infrastructure, and U.S. roads and bridges earned a D+ in its last assessment.Either outcome in November would be a win for construction and engineering firms in the country. The sector is already seeing a lift from the December 2015 passage of the Fixing America's Surface Transportation (  ) Act, a five-year $305 billion spending bill for surface transportation and investment. is the country's largest supplier of construction aggregates like crushed stone, sand and gravel, with public-sector contracts accounting for half its shipments. The company has made cost-cutting and debt repayment a priority over the last several years, paying down $791 million in debt and increasing its operating margin to 18% from just 7% in 2013.The company recently completed a four-year turnaround in 2013, reducing debt by $800 million and divesting more than $1 billion in non-core assets. On a demand recovery in late 2013, Vulcan has been able to increase gross profit per ton by 18% and reauthorized its share repurchase program last year.Shipments last year increased to 178 million tons, still 43% below the 255 million tons the company sees in normal demand over the next several years. Reaching full industry demand could help Vulcan more than double its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) from $944 million over the last four quarters to $2 billion.Beyond public-sector demand, residential and commercial construction is still growing on low interest rates and moderate economic growth. Vulcan has reported more than 50 years' worth of aggregates in reserves, and benefits from a strong position in the South where demand is forecast to grow at a faster pace.Analysts expect earnings of $4.04 per share over the next four quarters, an increase of 42% over trailing earnings and based on a 15% increase in sales to $4.08 billion. My target is for $140 per share on a more modest 35 times earnings and a continued repurchase program.Risks To Consider:  . Take advantage of the momentum in infrastructure spending with shares of Vulcan Materials which should benefit over several years of increased construction aggregates demand. We don't yet know who our next president will be. But one truth is  : for nearly two centuries our economy (and investment landscape) has disintegrated in an election year. And it's going to happen again...  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@The Big Winner No Matter Who Wins In November@2016-09-27@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/big-winner-no-matter-who-wins-november-2016-09-27
icron Technology Inc.  is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2016 results on Oct 4. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 27.27%. It is worth noting that Micron has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the four preceding quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 19.02%.Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Micron reported mixed third-quarter fiscal 2016 results. While the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the bottom line fared better than the same. The year-over-year comparisons on both the counts were unfavorable, primarily due to softness in the PC segment. Also, pricing pressure in client SSD and lower-than-expected sales of trade Non-Volatile products impacted the top line.However, the acquisitions of Elpida and Rexchip (now known as Micron Memory Japan, Inc. and Micron Memory Taiwan Co., Ltd., respectively) will increase Micron's traction in the memory market.Micron is positive about the product launches and growing demand, particularly SSD products. The company has been constantly innovating in memory technologies, spanning DRAM, NAND and NOR Flash memory solutions, which are being widely used in the latest mobile computing devices as well as in consumer, networking and embedded products.However, Western Digital Corporation  , a key player in the NAND space, could increase competition in the industry. | Our proven model does not conclusively show that Micron will beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at a loss of 9 cents. Hence, the difference is 0.00%. Micron has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some other companies, which you may want to consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming release:DragonWave Inc.  with an Earnings ESP of +29.47% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

N-based casual dining foodservice retailer,  is scheduled to report its first-quarter fiscal 2017 figures on Oct 6, after market closes.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.The company recently announced preliminary results for first-quarter fiscal 2017. Ruby Tuesday expects adjusted loss in the range of 10 cents to 12 cents per share. Meanwhile, total revenue, including franchise revenue, is projected to come around $256.7 million. On the other hand, comps are anticipated to be down roughly 2.7% in the to-be-reported quarter.The company has an  of 0.00% and the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at a loss of 11 cents per share. Notably, the company reported a loss of 3 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. | In fact, Ruby Tuesday has incurred losses in four out of the last six quarters. Moreover, higher labor costs and other expenses are expected to take a toll on the company's profits in the quarter as well. Also, traffic may continue to decline due to persistent softness in the casual dining industry and attractive discount offerings by competitors.Nonetheless, Ruby Tuesday is aggressively pursuing brand transformation initiatives. Menu innovation, limited time offers, streamlining of operations, increased marketing efforts and digital initiatives coupled with re-imaging of restaurants should draw customers and likely boost the quarterly results.According to our quantitative model, a company needs the right combination of two key factors - a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) - to increase its odds of an earnings surprise.Here are some companies to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Wingstop Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +9.09% and a Zacks Rank #2.

 reported lower-than expected results in the third quarter of 2016, missing estimates for both earnings and sales. Shares declined almost 0.3% in  .Adjusted earnings of 44 cents per share in the third quarter missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 45 cents by 2.2%. Earnings also declined 6.4% year over year due to higher expenses and weak margins.Net sales of $1,013.1 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,014 million by 0.1%. Sales, however, increased 1.8% year over year.Daily sales growth at the Canadian business was about 5% in the quarter while it was 4% increase in the previous quarter.Fastenal's total average daily sales increased 1.8% in the third quarter of 2016, higher than a 1.5% increase in the prior-year quarter. It was also higher than 1.6% increase reported in the second quarter. Foreign exchange dragged down daily sales growth rate in the quarter by 0.1% while acquisitions added 0.6% to sales.Fastenal's sales, in the past few quarters, have been affected by price deflation of fastener products, currency headwinds and lack of new products and services. The top line has been adversely impacted by lower sales to manufacturing and construction customers due to overall weakness in the industrial economy.On a monthly basis, daily sales increased 2.8% in September, 0.3% in August and 2.1% in July. The growth rates were -0.3%, 1.6% and 3.2%, respectively, in September, August and July of 2015.This industrial and construction supplies wholesale distributor serves customers in the manufacturing and non-residential construction markets.Daily sales to manufacturing customers (representing almost 50% of revenues) rose 1%, down from growth of 1.1% in the prior-year quarter but up from 0.7% in the previous quarter.The daily sales growth rate of fastener products (used mainly for industrial production and accounting for approximately 35-40% of the company's business) declined 2.9% in the quarter, compared to 4.4% decline in the year-ago quarter and a 2.4% decline recorded in the previous quarter.Price deflation of fasteners and lower demand from the heavy machinery manufacturing customer base -- due to lower production requirements -- has been hurting fastener sales.Non-fastener product sales (used mainly for maintenance) increased 4.9%, lower than 5.9% growth in the year ago quarter but higher than an increase of 4.7% in the prior-year quarter. Though the non-fastener business is doing better than fasteners driven by strong vending trends, it has nonetheless weakened in the last eight quarters due to prevailing weakness in the industrial environment.In the non-residential construction market, daily sales to non-residential construction customers (representing 20% to 25% of revenues) declined 1.9% as against a 1.7% decrease in the prior-year quarter and a decline of 1.7% in the previous quarter. Volatility and softer energy prices impacted sales in this market.As of Sep 30, 2016, Fastenal operated 60,400 vending machines, up 12.8% year over year. During the quarter, the company signed 4,783 machine contracts, up 2% from the last year quarter. Vending machines now account for 45% of the company's sales, higher than 44.6% in the prior quarter.After remaining soft in 2013, vending trends improved through 2014 and 2015 as well as the first nine months of 2016, as the management's efforts on enhancing the quality of signings/installs paid off. | Gross margin of 49.3% in the third quarter of 2016 declined 120 basis points (bps) year over year and 20 bps sequentially. Gross margin was hurt by an unfavorable customer mix and product mix.Pre-tax earnings declined 8.2% to $201.2 million. Pre-tax margins declined 210 bps to 19.9% in the quarter.Fastenal Company has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Cash and cash equivalents was $147 million as of Sep 30, 2016, up from $129 million as on Dec 31, 2015. Long-term debt was $432.4 million, up from $303 million at 2015-end.Some better-ranked stocks in the building products sector include The Home Depot, Inc.  and BMC Stock Holdings, Inc.  . While BMC Stock Holdings sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), The Home Depot carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see Builders FirstSource, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #1.

Government spending has been a drag on U.S. economic growth, with Stifel Nicolaus estimating that fiscal contraction has cost GDP 0.8% on an annualized basis since 2009.Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton has proposed a $275 billion infrastructure plan and has released a report showing that every $1 billion in infrastructure spending creates 13,000 jobs. Clinton's plan calls for $50 billion annually spent on roads and bridges over five years, in addition to $25 billion to seed an infrastructure bank that could raise another $225 billion in private investment.Trump pointed to the nation's worsening infrastructure in his acceptance of the Republican nomination saying, ""Our roads and bridges are falling apart and our airports are in third-word condition."" The real estate mogul is characteristically vague on an estimate of total spending, but has said his plan would be at least double Clinton's amount.A report by the American Society of Civil Engineers found a needed $5.2 trillion in infrastructure spending to bring the network up to an acceptable level by 2040. The ASCE has warned the government for several years of the crumbling infrastructure, and U.S. roads and bridges earned a D+ in its last assessment.Either outcome in November would be a win for construction and engineering firms in the country. The sector is already seeing a lift from the December 2015 passage of the Fixing America's Surface Transportation () Act, a five-year $305 billion spending bill for surface transportation and investment. (  ) is the country's largest supplier of construction aggregates like crushed stone, sand and gravel, with public-sector contracts accounting for half its shipments. The company has made cost-cutting and debt repayment a priority over the last several years, paying down $791 million in debt and increasing its operating margin to 18% from just 7% in 2013.[More from StreetAuthority.com:  ]The company recently completed a four-year turnaround in 2013, reducing debt by $800 million and divesting more than $1 billion in non-core assets. On a demand recovery in late 2013, Vulcan has been able to increase gross profit per ton by 18% and reauthorized its share repurchase program last year.Shipments last year increased to 178 million tons, still 43% below the 255 million tons the company sees in normal demand over the next several years. Reaching full industry demand could help Vulcan more than double its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) from $944 million over the last four quarters to $2 billion.Beyond public-sector demand, residential and commercial construction is still growing on low interest rates and moderate economic growth. Vulcan has reported more than 50 years' worth of aggregates in reserves, and benefits from a strong position in the South where demand is forecast to grow at a faster pace.Analysts expect earnings of $4.04 per share over the next four quarters, an increase of 42% over trailing earnings and based on a 15% increase in sales to $4.08 billion. My target is for $140 per share on a more modest 35 times earnings and a continued repurchase program.[More from StreetAuthority.com:  ]Risks To Consider:  . Take advantage of the momentum in infrastructure spending with shares of Vulcan Materials which should benefit over several years of increased construction aggregates demand.

ooking at the universe of stocks we cover at  , in trading on Wednesday, shares of Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST) were yielding above the 3% mark based on its quarterly dividend (annualized to $1.20), with the stock changing hands as low as $39.99 on the day. Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return. To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) back on 12/31/1999 - you would have paid $146.88 per share. Fast forward to 12/31/2012 and each share was worth $142.41 on that date, a decrease of $4.67/share over all those years. But now consider that you collected a whopping $25.98 per share in dividends over the same period, for a positive total return of 23.36%. Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.6%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 3% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable. Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST) is an S&P 500 company, giving it special status as one of the large-cap companies making up the S&P 500 Index.In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Fastenal Co., looking at the history chart for FAST below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 3% annual yield.    According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, FAST makes up 4.00% of the First Trust RBA Quality Income ETF (Symbol: QINC) which is trading lower by about 0.1% on the day Wednesday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Fastenal (FAST) Shares Cross 3% Yield Mark@2016-09-14@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/fastenal-fast-shares-cross-3-yield-mark-2016-09-14
e expect leading mall-based specialty retailer,  to beat expectations when it reports second-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Sep 23. Last quarter, the company had delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4.6%, which marked its second consecutive beat.Our proven model shows that Finish Line is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. The Most Accurate estimate is 54 cents and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 53 cents. So the ensuing +1.89% ESP and the company's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) make us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Management remained impressed with its performance in the last quarter - wherein despite a tough retail scenario, the company managed to top earnings and sales estimates, following which it retained its fiscal 2017 earnings and comparable store sales (comps) guidance. Coming to the second quarter, some analysts anticipate comps to witness a sequential improvement, gaining from the improved trends witnessed in the sneaker industry, backed by various product launches. Moreover, Finish Line's second-quarter performance is expected to benefit from the Rio Summer Olympics that took place during the quarter.These factors, along with the company's progress with regard to supply-chain optimization and overall business execution bode well, thus making us reasonably confident about the upcoming results.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Coca-Cola European Partners Plc  has an Earnings ESP of +4.11% and a Zacks Rank #3.Carnival Corp.  has an Earnings ESP of +2.13% and a Zacks Rank #3.

"ith the second-quarter earnings season now effectively behind us, the retail sector is the only one still hogging the limelight, as a few stocks are lined up to report their financials. The conclusion derived from recent reports of retailers is that this sector's performance has not lived up to the expectations. For more details on earnings of this sector and others, please read our  report.The initial assumptions that the improved household buying power, as a result of energy savings, would reflect in the retail sector's results, failed to translate much into reality. Market experts believe that global economic headwinds such as yet-to-recover Chinese economy, Brexit, softness in the Eurozone and fluctuating commodity prices hurt consumers' sentiment. Analysts pointed out that a competitive retail landscape, foreign currency headwinds, aggressive pricing strategy or promotional activities adopted to win back consumers might be the culprit behind the lower-than-expected performance.With respect to the retail stocks' Q2 scorecard, as of Aug 19, we have results from 37 retailers on the S&P 500 index (out of the 44 total), wherein total earnings grew 3.9% from the year-ago period and revenues increased 4.3%. However, only 59.5% companies beat earnings estimates (the second lowest for the entire S&P 500 index), while only 43.2% have surpassed revenue expectations. The decent-looking growth picture, however, is a reflection of strong results at  . Once we exclude Amazon from the retail sector results, the comparisons start looking unfavorable.Thus, as we gear up to enter another earnings season, it is time again to reshuffle your portfolio, and get rid of stocks that may hurt your returns. Here we have highlighted seven Retail-Wholesale stocks that posted a negative earnings surprise in the last concluded quarter. These stocks are also witnessing downward revisions in estimates and carry a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell). Falling estimates clearly indicate analysts' skepticism about the future performance of these stocks.Beware of  that delivered lower-than-expected second-quarter 2016 results and holds a Zacks Rank #5. The company's quarterly earnings of $1.90 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10.8%. This automotive aftermarket parts provider has underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 4.8% over the trailing four quarters. Following the dismal performance, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.44 and $8.23 for 2016 and 2017 has dropped 36 cents and 44 cents, respectively, over the past 30 days.Don't let your portfolio fall prey to  carrying a Zacks Rank #5. The company's second-quarter 2016 earnings of 34 cents per share trailed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 15%. The parent company of the Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana fast casual restaurant brands has underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 6.8% over the trailing four quarters. Following the drab results, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.34 and $1.50 for 2016 and 2017 has decreased 17 cents and 21 cents, respectively, over the past 30 days. , which carries a Zacks Rank #5, also does not deserve a place in your list of stocks. The company continued with its dismal run as it reported second-quarter 2016 results. The quarterly earnings of 9 cents per share came in way below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 16 cents. This operator of travel center and convenience store locations has underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 95% over the trailing four quarters. Following a disappointing quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 11 cents and 68 cents for 2016 and 2017 has tumbled 18 cents and 14 cents, respectively, over the past 30 days. is another touch-me-not stock that delivered lower-than-expected second-quarter 2016 results and holds a Zacks Rank #5. The company's quarterly earnings of 28 cents a share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9.7%. This online travel research company has underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 2.6% over the trailing four quarters. Following the dismal performance, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.14 and $1.52 for 2016 and 2017 has declined 13 cents and 17 cents, respectively, over the past 30 days.Another stock that you should forget for now is  , carrying a Zacks Rank #4. The company's second-quarter fiscal 2016 earnings of 3 cents a share lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 5 cents. This operator of specialty department stores has underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 33.5% over the trailing four quarters. Following the miserable performance, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 18 cents and 30 cents for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017 has declined 5 cents and 9 cents, respectively, over the past 30 days.Adding  to your portfolio might also hurt your overall return. This Zacks Rank #4 company posted second-quarter 2016 earnings of 45 cents per share, which fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6.3%. The company, which is engaged in the wholesale distribution of industrial and construction supplies, has underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 1.7% over the trailing four quarters.

Following the disappointing results, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 11 cents and 2 cents for 2016 and 2017 has decreased 16 cents and 15 cents, respectively, over the past 30 days.Remember the idiom, ""A stitch in time saves nine""? It simply means that timely action may prevent serious loss later on. You can apply the same principle to your portfolio. Exiting the underperforming stock at the right time helps maximize your portfolio's return. Thus, for the time being, you can shift your focus to better-ranked retail stocks.Investors can confidently end their search at stocks with a better Zacks Rank status of either #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), which encompasses its strong fundamentals, promises price movement and highlights analysts' constructive view on the same via positive estimate revisions.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

 could be a stock to avoid from a technical perspective, as the firm is seeing unfavorable trends on the moving average crossover front. Recently, the 50 Day Moving Average for FAST broke out below the 200 Day Simple Moving Average, suggesting short-term bearishness.This has already started to take place, as the stock has moved lower by 6.6% in the past four weeks. And with the recent moving average crossover, investors have to think that more unfavorable trading is ahead for FAST stock.If that wasn't enough Fastenal isn't looking too great from an earnings estimate revision perspective either. It appears as though many analysts have been reducing their earnings expectations for the stock lately, which is usually not a good sign of things to come.Consider that in the last 30 days, 3 estimates have been reduced, while one has moved higher. Add this in to a similar move lower in the consensus estimate, and there is plenty of reason to be bearish here.That is why we currently have a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) on this stock and are looking for it to underperform in the weeks ahead. So either avoid this stock or consider jumping ship until the estimates and technical factors turn around for FAST.Beyond this Tale of the Tape, would you like to see Zacks' best recommendations that are not available to the public?

 is slated to release second-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Oct 5. Last quarter, the company had delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.99%.In fact, it has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 8.9% over the trailing four quarters. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement. | Constellation Brands has been gaining from its strategy of boosting growth via acquisitions, efforts to include new products in its wine and spirits businesses as well as strong demand for beer. The company's top and bottom lines are benefiting from strength in the beer business, improving trends at its wine and spirits business, and solid overall depletion trends. This assisted the company to post its seventh straight earnings beat in the last reported quarter. Further, the company's impressive outlook for fiscal 2017 reflects that it expects these robust trends to continue in the future.While these factors make us hopeful of Constellation Brands' upcoming results, we prefer to remain somewhat cautious, given the intense competition in the industry from other major players and the risk of increasing taxes.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Constellation Brands is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below: Earnings ESP for Constellation Brands is currently 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.66. Constellation Brands carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Though a favorable Zacks Rank increases the predictive power of ESP, the company's ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Fastenal Company  , scheduled to report earnings on Oct 11, has an Earnings ESP of +2.22% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Mondelez International Inc.  , anticipated to report earnings on Oct 26, has an Earnings ESP of +2.33% and a Zacks Rank #3.

With the earnings beat from aluminum giant Alcoa  after the bell Monday afternoon, we have now entered into the ramp-up to a plethora of earnings reports that will turn into a deluge in a couple weeks. We start slowly, but with big companies - specifically some of the biggest banks on Wall Street: JPMorgan Chase  , Citigroup  and Wells Fargo  reporting later in the week.Ahead of the bell this morning, following Alcoa's generally positive results yesterday, the U.S.'s largest fastener distributor Fastenal  disappointed investors on a Q2 sales and earnings miss. The company - whose products appear across many industries, from transportation to chemicals to construction - saw lower margins in the quarter, which helped cause the earnings miss.After the bell today we will hear from two more S&P 500 firms: rail major CSX Corp.  and global fast food corporation Yum! Brands  . Lower energy prices in the quarter may negatively affect CSX's top line and the continuing sag in the Chinese economy may give Yum! some quarterly headwinds (the company owns KFC, which has a large presence in China), but surprises to the upside would of course be welcome.With markets at or near all-time highs, a better-than-expected Q2 earnings season appears to be somewhat priced in already. As quarterly results in aggregate tend to perform 3-4% higher than pre-quarter estimates, this might stand to reason, especially with many economists looking for economic strength to build here in the second half of 2016. But with expectations for overall earnings results for the S&P 500 expected to be down roughly 6%, we look to continue the year-plus earnings recession.We are up again in the pre-market, appearing to want to continue the post-Brexit bounce. Dow futures are up around 72 points, the Nasdaq almost 25 points higher and the S&P up nearly 12 points.Mark VickerySenior EditorWant the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

 (FAST) reported second quarter EPS on Tuesday July 12 and missed the Zacks Consensus by 3-cents, or 6.25%. Earnings were down 5.4% compared to the year-ago quarter while revenues were up 1.6% year over year to $1.01 billion.Gross margins were 49.5% and also disappointed analysts as they contracted 80 bps vs. 50.3% in 2Q15. Operating margins were 20.6%, which contracted 100 bps vs. 22.6% a year ago. Analysts responded quickly and unison to the report by lowering EPS estimates for this year and next.The Zacks Consensus for 2016 profit estimates fell from $1.82 to $1.76 while 2017 projections were knocked down from $1.96 to $1.88. Respectively, these new EPS estimates represent flat growth for this year and only 6.77% for next year.Fastenal is strongly associated with the threaded screws, bolts, and other fasteners that give the company its namesake, but it also sells industrial and construction supplies grouped into ten other product lines including tools, metal cutting tools, fluid transfer components and accessories for hydraulic and pneumatic power, material handling and storage products, janitorial and paper products, electrical supplies, welding supplies, safety supplies, and raw materials.The company has over 2,600 branches throughout the US, Canada, Mexico and Europe along with 13 distribution centers.CEO Daniel Florness suggested that the industrial economy likely showed incremental weakening Q2. Management spoke about the Construction segment in particular where they saw a slowdown in their energy customers in both May and June.This is clearly an effect of energy companies holding off on projects that are typically seen in the spring and summer.Moreover, Fastenal is witnessing projects that were still going on from a year ago not being replaced. Management also estimated that several temporary plant shutdowns impacted the month of June by ~1.0% revenue growth.Trading at 23 times next year's EPS projection, Fastenal is neither a value play nor a growth play.

"Chicago, IL - July 15, 2016 -  highlights  as the Bull of the Day and  as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on  and Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: (  ) is a $2 billion medical staffing company that specializes in temporary/travel and permanent assignments across the US.They provide physician and nursing recruitment and placement services for thousands of hospitals, clinics, medical centers, government facilities, and other healthcare organizations.The company is expected to reach revenues of $1.86 billion this year, representing 27% year-over-year growth. And the bottom line is strong too with the current Zacks Consensus EPS estimate at $2.24 from three analysts, for 36% annual profit growth.Next year's growth projections are not as strong, but still impressive at 9% on the top line and 11.3% at the bottom.After finding strong support at $34 in May following a 22% earnings beat, AHS shares barely flinched during the Brexit correction.The stock hit new all-time highs just above $41 on June 8 and only pulled back to $38 in late June. The month of July has seen nothing less than 5 new highs as the strong jobs data, especially in the Healthcare sector, bodes well for second quarter results due on August 4.According to the Labor Department's May JOLTS report (Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey), which was released on Tuesday July 12, data for May in the healthcare and social assistance category were positive for healthcare staffing. Job openings growth accelerated to 10.4% YoY on a seasonally-adjusted basis from 3.4% in April while growth in ""quits"" also saw an increase to 10.6% in May from 8.5% in April.To provide insight into how AMN is more than a staffing, recruiting and placement firm, a testimonial from a customer that required specialized consulting is appropriate.The client was a major nonprofit healthcare provider who needed a new staffing structure. Here's what the chief nursing executive said about AMN's approach to the problem and the solid outcomes, courtesy of the AMN website Testimonials page...""Our large organization did not have true centralized staffing, so AMN Consultants came in, worked side-by-side with us and helped put together a fully functional staffing office. With the help of these outside experts, we were able to execute our goals much more quickly and more efficiently and to do what's right for our patients.""Implemented solutions resulted in dramatically increased staffing efficiency and effectiveness. Spending on agency staff and payroll costs declined, saving the healthcare system approximately $5.6 million annually.""With this approach to intelligent, system-focused solutions, AMN Healthcare Services appears to be an important player in a growing field. (  ) reported second quarter EPS on Tuesday July 12 and missed the Zacks Consensus by 3-cents, or 6.25%. Earnings were down 5.4% compared to the year-ago quarter while revenues were up 1.6% year over year to $1.01 billion.Gross margins were 49.5% and also disappointed analysts as they contracted 80 bps vs. 50.3% in 2Q15. Operating margins were 20.6%, which contracted 100 bps vs. 22.6% a year ago. Analysts responded quickly and unison to the report by lowering EPS estimates for this year and next.The Zacks Consensus for 2016 profit estimates fell from $1.82 to $1.76 while 2017 projections were knocked down from $1.96 to $1.88. Respectively, these new EPS estimates represent flat growth for this year and only 6.77% for next year.Fastenal is strongly associated with the threaded screws, bolts, and other fasteners that give the company its namesake, but it also sells industrial and construction supplies grouped into ten other product lines including tools, metal cutting tools, fluid transfer components and accessories for hydraulic and pneumatic power, material handling and storage products, janitorial and paper products, electrical supplies, welding supplies, safety supplies, and raw materials.The company has over 2,600 branches throughout the US, Canada, Mexico and Europe along with 13 distribution centers.CEO Daniel Florness suggested that the industrial economy likely showed incremental weakening Q2. Management spoke about the Construction segment in particular where they saw a slowdown in their energy customers in both May and June.This is clearly an effect of energy companies holding off on projects that are typically seen in the spring and summer.Moreover, Fastenal is witnessing projects that were still going on from a year ago not being replaced. Management also estimated that several temporary plant shutdowns impacted the month of June by ~1.0% revenue growth.Trading at 23 times next year's EPS projection, Fastenal is neither a value play nor a growth play. Keep your eye on the Zacks Rank to let you know when that changes.Summer is peaking. The lousiest start for stocks in a New Year on record has reversed. The S&P500 finally broke out of a tight mid-2016 range. The S&P500 passed (in mid-July) its all-time high seen in June 2015.The 12-month forward look on earnings growth matters in mid-summer. Consensus sees +0.8% in annual S&P500 EPS growth for 2016 and a hockey stick +13.4% for 2017. In 2015, the S&P500 saw -1.1%. In 2014, it saw +4.8%.(1) U.S. manufacturers grew in June at the fastest pace in 15 months, signaling a clear if modest uptrend after a bout of extended weakness.(2) On top of that, economic activity in the non-manufacturing sector grew in June for the 77 th consecutive month.(3) If it is my guess, the U.K. Brexit event will be a non-event for U.S. consumers.(4) However, for firms and banks, Brexit will delay any inward investment into the U.K. by U.S. and non-U.S. groups alike.The optimistic thing that can be noted about the post-Brexit situation in the U.K. is the government -- all of it, previous ones, future ones and the present one -- have time to sort this out. As an economist who thinks mightily of the U.K. and its long history, I hope they do. They can do this. They can emerge with a positive and forward-looking solution for their country.To summarize the U.S. macro situation, a Fed economist duly noted:""… Yes, the U.S. remains in expansion. Recent monthly labor market evidence emerged conclusive. The U.S. created 287K jobs in June, bouncing back after adding just 11K new jobs in May. June was the biggest job addition this year. Heath Care got back to the top of the sector pack in late June. The industry leader here became the Drug companies, particularly the Large Caps. The other sector surge was seen from the Info Tech sector, with the Electronics and Semiconductor industries leading the way. The big surprise sector loser was Consumer Discretionary. It fell all the way back to Very Unattractive. Downgrades hit the Consumer Staples and Materials sectors too. The industry exception was Steel, with new tariffs on China dumping. Financials also took a hit. Major banks struggle with the ever-continuing sink of interest rates -- now into negative territory on $11 trillion of bonds.(1) Health Care went back to Very Attractive. Drugs led the way on the upgrade. Medical Care is still attractive. Medical Products rests at Market Weight. (  )Align Technology Inc. designs, manufactures and markets the Invisalign System, a proprietary method for treating malocclusion(a misalignment or incorrect relation between the teeth of two dental arches when they approach each other as jaws close).The System corrects malocclusion using a series of clear, removable appliances that gently move teeth to a desired final position.(2) Info Tech rose all the way to Very Attractive. Electronics and Semiconductors led the way back. (  )Mettler-Toledo is the world's largest manufacturer and marketer of weighing instruments for use in laboratory, industrial and food retailing applications(3) Consumer Staples fell back one notch to Attractive. Food/Drug Retail, and Misc. Staples, & Tobacco all look good again. Food fell back to Market. (  )Helen of Troy Limited is a leading designer, producer and marketer of brand name consumer products. The Company's products include hair dryers, curling irons, hair setters, women's shavers, brushes, combs, hair accessories, home hair clippers, mirrors, foot baths, body massagers, depilatories and paraffin baths.(4) Materials fell back one notch to Attractive. The best is Containers & Glass and Steel. Metals-Non-Ferrous look better, as gold and  rise.(5) Telcos stayed a Market Weight.(6) Utilities stayed a Market Weight.(7) Energy stayed a Market Weight. The best are the Pipelines. Drillers remain in the tank, along with Oil-Misc.(8) Industrials fell one notch to Unattractive. Machinery-Electrical is the sole strong industry. Railroads, Industrial Products & Services, Machinery, Construction-Building Services, and Airlines all slipped.(9) Financials stayed Unattractive. Major Banks are struggling with negative rates. Investment Banking & Brokering sees a Brexit stall in deals. The best industry niche looks to be Real Estate.(10) Consumer Discretionary fell to Very Unattractive. Auto and Consumer Electronics industries look poor. Apparel and Leisure Services also took a hit.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

"Chicago, IL - July 11, 2016 - Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week's list includes  and  .To see more earnings analysis, visit  . . (  ) may no longer be as relevant to the U.S. economy and the stock market, but the company's name gets plenty of sunshine from the widely-held belief that its earnings report kick-starts each quarterly reporting cycle. Many in the market even see the company's earnings report as a leading indicator of what to expect from the rest of corporate America. But that is most likely overstating the company's status, notwithstanding aluminum's growing role in the automotive, aircraft manufacturing and construction end markets.The bottom line is that the relevance of Alcoa's results and outlook is fairly limited; it doesn't tell us much beyond what may be useful for the broader industrial metals space. Results the day after Alcoa's report from industrial nuts-and-bolts supplier  (  ) and the following day (July 13th) from railroad operator  (  ) have a lot more relevance to the economically sensitive parts of the U.S. economy.This week will bring earnings results from 30 companies, including 13 S&P 500 members that include most of the money center banks. These wouldn't be the first Q2 reports as companies with fiscal quarters ending in May have already been coming out with results and those reports get counted as part of the Q2 tally. In total, 23 S&P 500 members with fiscal quarters ending in May have reported Q2 results already.Total earnings are expected to be down -6.2% on -0.6% lower revenues, with growth in negative territory for 9 of the 16 Zacks sectors. This will be the 5th quarter in a row of negative earnings growth for the S&P 500 index.As has been the pattern in other recent periods, the Energy sector remains the biggest drag on the aggregate growth picture, with total earnings for the sector expected to be down -76.8% on -27% lower revenues. Excluding the Energy sector, earnings for the rest of the index would be down -3.0%.As negative as this revisions trend looks, it is nevertheless an improvement over what we had seen in the comparable period(s) in other recent quarters. The improved commodity-price backdrop and the reduced dollar drag are some of the explanations for this development. It will be interesting to see if this trend of decelerated negative revisions will continue this earnings season. But we will have to wait a few more weeks to get a better read on this development after companies start reporting June quarter results and guide towards Q3 estimates. Current estimates for Q3 are showing flat growth from the year-earlier level.While Energy stands out for its very tough comparisons, there is not much positive growth coming from the other major sectors either. The Finance and Technology sectors, the two biggest earnings contributors in the S&P 500 index, are also expected to see earnings decline in Q2 from the year-earlier levels.For the Finance sector, total Q2 earnings are expected to be down -6.6% on -0.5% lower revenues, which will follow -6.9% decline in the sector's earnings in the preceding quarter. It has been a tough period for the sector, with benchmark treasury yields going down the summary 2012 record lows on the back of the Brexit surprise and Fed expectations. This low interest rate environment is a big restraint on the group's earnings power through continued pressures on net interest margins.The recent completion of the Fed stress tests has improved the outlook for share buybacks and dividend increases across the major banks space, but the group's earnings outlook continues to remain under pressure, as recent estimate cuts to all the major banks show. On the docket for reports this week include  (  ) on Thursday (7/14).The Technology sector, total earnings are expected to be down -6.4% on +2.7% higher revenues, which would follow the sector's -4.5% earnings decline on +0.4% higher revenues in Q1. The big culprit for the Tech sector's weak showing this quarter (as well as last one) is  (  ), whose June quarter earnings are expected to be down -28.4% on -15.2% lower revenues from the same period last year. Excluding Apple, the Tech sector's Q2 earnings would be down only -0.9% (Apple alone brings in roughly a fifth of the Tech sector's total earnings).On the positive side, Q2 earnings are expected be up at Autos (up +8.2%), Construction (+8.9%), Conglomerates (+11.8%), and Utilities (+21%). The Utilities and Conglomerate sectors' strong growth numbers are solely due to easy comparisons.Since 1988, the Zacks Rank has proven that ""Earnings estimate revisions are the most powerful force impacting stock prices."" Since inception in 1988, #1 Rank stocks have generated an average annual return of +28%. During the 2000-2002 bear market, Zacks #1 Rank stocks gained +43.8%, while the S&P 500 tumbled -37.6%. Also note that the Zacks Rank system has just as many Strong Sell recommendations (Rank #5) as Strong Buy recommendations (Rank #1). Since 1988, Zacks Rank #5 stocks have significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (+3% versus +10%). Thus, the Zacks Rank system allows investors to truly manage portfolio trading effectively.Zacks ""Profit from the Pros"" e-mail newsletter offers continuous coverage of the industries and the stocks poised to outperform the market.  .Zacks.com is a property of Zacks , Inc., which was formed in 1978.

 reported lower-than expected results in the second quarter of 2016, missing estimates for both earnings and sales. Shares declined almost 4% in  .Adjusted earnings of 45 cents per share in the second quarter missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 48 cents by 6.25%. Earnings also declined 6.3% year over year due to weak sales and margins.Net sales of $1.01 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.02 billion by 0.8%. Sales increased 1.6% year over year.Net sales at the Canadian business increased about 4% in local currency during the quarter while it was less than 7% increase in the previous quarter. Fires in Western Canada in the month of May hurt sales in the country.Fastenal's total average daily sales increased 1.6% in the second quarter of 2016, much lower than a 5% increase in the prior-year quarter. It was also softer than 1.9% increase reported in the first quarter. Foreign exchange dragged down daily sales growth rate in the quarter by 0.4% while acquisitions added 0.6% to sales.Fastenal's sales, in the past few quarters, have been affected by price deflation of fastener products, currency headwinds and lack of new products and services. The top line has been adversely impacted by lower sales to manufacturing and construction customers due to overall weakness in the industrial economy.On a monthly basis, daily sales remained flat in June but increased 3.8% in April and 1.1% in May. The growth rates fell short of 6.1%, 5.3% and 3.7%, respectively, in April, May and June of 2015.This industrial and construction supplies wholesale distributor serves customers in the manufacturing and non-residential construction markets.Daily sales to manufacturing customers (representing almost 50% of revenues) rose 0.7%, down from growth of 3.8% in the prior-year quarter and 0.9% in the previous quarter.The daily sales growth rate of fastener products (used mainly for industrial production and accounting for nearly 40% of the company's business) declined 2.4% in the quarter, compared to flat in the year-ago quarter and a 1.7% decline recorded in the previous quarter.Price deflation of fasteners and lower demand from the heavy machinery manufacturing customer base -- due to lower production requirements -- has been hurting fastener sales.Non-fastener product sales (used mainly for maintenance) increased 4.7%, same as last quarter but much less than an increase of 9% in the prior-year quarter. Though the non-fastener business is doing better than fasteners driven by strong vending trends, it has nonetheless weakened in the last eight quarters due to prevailing weakness in the industrial environment.In the non-residential construction market, daily sales to non-residential construction customers (representing 20% to 25% of revenues) declined 1.7% as against a 1.6% increase in the prior-year quarter and a decline of 0.4% in the previous quarter. Volatility and softer energy prices impacted sales in this market.As of Jun 30, 2016, Fastenal operated 58,346 vending machines, up 15.3% year over year. During the quarter, the company signed 4,869 machine contracts, up 4.8% from the last quarter. The daily sales to customers with industrial vending grew 2.7% year over year. Vending machines now account for 44.6% of the company's sales, higher than 44.5% in the prior quarter.After remaining soft in 2013, vending trends improved through 2014 and 2015 as well as the first half of 2016, as the management's efforts on enhancing the quality of signings/installs paid off.Gross margin of 49.5% in the second quarter of 2016 declined 80 basis points (bps) year over year and 30 bps sequentially. Gross margin was hurt by an unfavorable customer mix and product mix.The customer mix shifted towards the large account end-market, which produces low gross margins but stronger operating profits. The product mix shifted from high-margin fastener products to non-fastener products.Pre-tax earnings declined 7.7% to $207.8 million due to higher payroll costs. Pre-tax margins declined 210 bps to 20.5% in the quarter.Fastenal Company has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). | Some better-ranked stocks in the building products sector include Beacon Roofing Supply, Inc.  , The Home Depot, Inc.  and Lowe's Companies, Inc.  . While Beacon Roofing Supply sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), The Home Depot and Lowe's Companies carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The big culprit for the Tech sector's weak showing this quarter (as well as last one) is  (  ), whose June quarter earnings are expected to be down -28.4% on -15.2% lower revenues from the same period last year. Excluding Apple, the Tech sector's Q2 earnings would be down only -0.9% (Apple alone brings in roughly a fifth of the Tech sector's total earnings).On the positive side, Q2 earnings are expected be up at Autos (up +8.2%), Construction (+8.9%), Conglomerates (+11.8%), and Utilities (+21%). The Utilities and Conglomerate sectors' strong growth numbers are solely due to easy comparisons at  (  ) and  (  ), respectively.The chart below shows current quarterly earnings growth expectations for the index in 2016 Q2 and the following four quarters contrasted with actual declines in the preceding four quarters. As you can see, Q2 is on track to be the 5th quarter in row of earnings declines and estimates of Q3 growth starting to go deeper into negative territory as well.The only meaningful positive earnings growth this year is expected to come from the last quarter of the year, which is then expected to continue into 2017 when earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up in double-digits. We will see if those estimates will hold up as we reach the last quarter of the year. But given what we have seen over the last few quarters, the odds don't look that favorable. :  : For a complete analysis of 2016 Q2 estimates, please check out weekly  .Here is a list of the 30 companies reporting this week, including 13 S&P 500 members .

astenal Company  is a national wholesale distributor of industrial and construction supplies. It distributes its products through company-owned stores mostly located in North America. The company has gradually grown from a fastener distributor to a full-line industrial supplier.Weakness in sales of the industrial fasteners, lower sales to customers in the oil & gas industry, a stronger U.S. dollar, softness in the Canadian business and overall weakness in the industrial economy is hurting the company's sales. However, Fastenal's vending trends are improving as efforts on improving the quality of signings/installs paid off.Investors should also note the recent earnings estimate revisions for FAST has been mostly downwards. However, FAST has an average history in earnings season. Fastenal has delivered two positive earnings surprises in the last four quarters, making an average positive surprise of 0.45%.Currently, FAST has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), but that could definitely change following Fastenal's earnings report which was just released.

ccording to our  , construction companies are scheduled to post an 8.9% year-over-year increase in earnings in the second quarter of 2016, lower than the 27.5% increase recorded in the first quarter. On the other hand, the revenue projections are fairly optimistic with sales likely to increase 5.2% year over year, better than the 3.9% increase reported in the preceding quarter.Despite volatility in the U.S. stock market, uncertainty surrounding the Fed rate hike, panic in the global financial markets triggered by the unexpected Brexit vote and volatile gasoline prices, the homebuilding market remained stable. More importantly, the departure of U.K. from the European Union is believed to have no major impact on the sector.Last month, homebuilders Lennar Corporation  and KB Home  reported better-than-expected second-quarter results, beating estimates for both earnings and sales. Despite a slower sales trend in the Houston market, both companies recorded a double-digit increase in home deliveries and new home orders in a successful spring selling season.In fact, stronger job data for June is encouraging. The month reported an addition of 287,000 jobs in the market, which represents the highest in eight months. With improved job prospects and historically low mortgage rates, more young adults will opt to purchase their own homes, which will eventually drive the top line in the homebuilding space. In addition, the home remodeling market is also picking up pace. These factors eventually lead to higher demand for building products.On Jul 12, two of the building product companies are scheduled to report their quarterly results. Let us steal a peek into how the companies are placed ahead of the release. Based in Winona, MN, Fastenal Company is a national wholesale distributor of industrial and construction supplies. The company is set to report results before the market opens.Last quarter, Fastenal posted in-line results. Meanwhile, the company has posted two positive earnings surprises in the past four quarters. However, it has an average four-quarter negative surprise of 0.45%. | The company has an  of -2.08% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at 48 cents.Fastenal's revenues are being hurt by lower sales to customers in the oil & gas industry, softness in the Canadian business and overall weakness in the industrial economy. These trends are likely to impact results in the soon-to-be reported quarter.Moreover, lack of price inflation, an unfavorable product mix and pricing and competitive pressure are hurting gross margins.Based in Tucker, GA, Gypsum Management and Supply is a North American distributor of wallboard and suspended ceilings systems. The company initiated its initial public offering on May 25. The company is set to report fourth-quarter results before the market opens. | The company has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3.

"When President Obama signed a $305 billion highway bill into law last December, it was good news for  (  ).For one, it meant Vulcan stood to gain more than any other building materials company from the legislation. But it also was one of many signs that the provider of aggregates -- crushed stone, sand and gravel -- is now paving a path to prosperity, a year after it was losing money.Another positive sign came late last month, when Britain decided to exit the European Union. The move rattled global markets, but Vulcan was among a handful of stocks that stood up well during the selling frenzy. Showing strength, its stock dipped just 0.4% on June 24, while the Dow industrials fell 611 points.Chief Executive Tom Hill told analysts on a recent  that several things have come together for the company, most notably a long-term housing recovery. There also has been better execution on customer deliveries, fixed-cost leveraging and lower costs of goods sold. Meanwhile, prices continue to migrate upward toward longer-term higher return on capital.[ibdchart symbol=""VMC"" type=""daily"" size=""threequarter"" position=""leftchart"" ]Hill also said the housing recovery still has legs.""I want to emphasize that we continue to believe that the recovery in our markets still has a long way to go. Our business is in the midst of a long, gradual recovery in demand,"" he said. ""This is, to our way of thinking, a recovery with real staying power.""Vulcan is the nation's largest pure-play maker of aggregate building materials. Public works account for about 50% of construction materials spending, and the Fixing America's Surface Transportation (  ) Act allocated funds for work on U.S. roads, bridges, public transit and rail transportation systems over the next five years.Of the remainder, commercial buildings account for 30% of construction materials spending, and housing makes up the final 20%. With incomes slowly rising and housing recovery steady, driven by low interest rates and unemployment, Vulcan's prospects are bright, according to BB&T Capital Markets analyst Adam Thalhimer.""When I talk to private aggregates companies, they point to Vulcan as the best-run company in the space. They are the most consistent,"" Thalhimer said in an interview with IBD.Thalhimer said it's really not a complicated business. Vulcan's sales are all domestic.""Their cash cow is turning big rocks into little rocks"" and selling them, he said. He has a buy rating on Vulcan with a 135 price target.Birmingham, Ala.-based Vulcan, also a major producer of aggregates-based construction materials such as asphalt and ready-mixed concrete, crushed profit estimates in its most recent quarter, reporting 26 cents fiscal-first-quarter earnings per share on May 3, swinging from a 16-cent loss in the same quarter a year earlier. That was more than triple the analyst consensus estimate of 7 cents a share.The company recorded a 20% hike in first-quarter revenue to $755 million, easily beating forecasts for $711 million, while gross profit climbed 112%.""It is certainly true that you can't extrapolate the full picture from a single quarter's results, but when you look at our results in the context of the last several quarters, you see very solid and improving fundamentals,"" Hill said on the May 3 call with analysts.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters call for earnings per share to climb 52% in the current quarter vs. the same quarter in 2015, to $1. Revenue is projected to grow 13% to $1.1 billion.Vulcan operates 315 sites that produce construction aggregates and more than 100 facilities that produce asphalt and/or concrete. It's costly to transport rocks and other construction materials, so Vulcan's nationwide quarry-to-construction-site reach gives it a defensible market position, according to D.A. Davidson analyst Brent Thielman.""It does come down to local domination,"" Thielman told IBD. ""You're not going to get outsiders in your end markets once you're in there and serving addressable areas,"" because it's just too costly for smaller companies to ship rocks long distances.Thielman has a neutral rating on Vulcan, based on its strong stock valuation, with a 115 price target.RBC Capital Markets analyst Robert Wetenhall called out Vulcan in a June 17 client note as a top performer in its markets. Wetenhall noted that housing starts for the month of May increased by 9.5% to a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 1.167 million units, topping estimates of 1.15 million.""From an investment standpoint, we remain confident that a healthy labor market will continue supporting a slow and steady recovery in the housing market,"" Wetenhall said. He has an outperform rating on Vulcan with a 114.08 price target.In February, Vulcan expanded its management team, including creating new positions. Stan Bass, who was a vice president with responsibility for the company's Western and Mountain West divisions, was named to the newly created post of chief growth officer.CEO Hill said in making the announcement that an executive growth officer was needed because ""our company is poised for a new era of strategic growth, building on our unparalleled positions in recovering and growing markets across the United States.""Additionally, former general counsel Michael Mills was named to the newly created chief administrative officer post. Former assistant counsel Jerry Perkins stepped up to the general counsel position. Brock Lodge, who previously was manager of Vulcan's Western division, including its strategic California operations, was promoted to president of that division.Although Vulcan is the 800-pound gorilla of construction aggregates in the U.S., it has competition.  (  ) is the other large, publicly traded aggregates supplier. But the Raleigh, N.C.-based company also sells specialty chemicals such as magnesia and has aggressively  .Like Vulcan, Martin Marietta boasts a best-possible 99 IBD Composite Rating, meaning its stock has outperformed at least 99% of all stocks on key metrics such as sales and profit growth in recent quarters.Large international companies also have a toehold in the U.S. market, including Ireland's  (  ), the largest company in the building materials group, with nearly $26 billion annual sales vs. about $3.6 billion each for Vulcan and Martin Marietta. However, CRH also sells security gates and fencing, bricks, shutters, awnings and other items.It's a fragmented market, and large local aggregate materials suppliers also vie in some regional markets, though they're much smaller than Vulcan and Martin Marietta.Vulcan's stock price reached a new intraday high of 120.83 Thursday and matched it again on Friday, its highest point since June 2007, just before the start of the 2007-2009 recession. Shares ended trading on both days around 120, and shares were down slightly Tuesday after the holiday weekend to end the day at 119.66.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Investors Love Vulcan Materials' Results Like A Rock@2016-07-01@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/investors-love-vulcan-materials-results-rock-2016-07-01
 is set to report second-quarter 2016 results on Jul 12, before the market opens.Last quarter, Fastenal delivered in line results. The company has posted two positive earnings surprises in the past four quarters. However, it has an average four-quarter negative surprise of 0.45%. | Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Fastenal's revenues are being hurt by lower sales to customers in the oil & gas industry, softness in the Canadian business and overall weakness in the industrial economy. These trends are likely to impact results in the soon-to-be reported quarter.Moreover, lack of price inflation, an unfavorable product mix, and pricing and competitive pressure are hurting gross margins. The product mix has shifted from high-margin fastener products to lower margin non-fastener products. The customer mix has shifted toward the large-account end-market, which produces low gross margins but stronger operating income.Indeed, the company does not see any improvement in gross margin rates through the rest of 2016 as well. Estimates have been going down ahead of the company's second quarter earnings release.These trends are reflected in May 2016 sales figures, as the company continued to report weakness in the fasteners business.While May net sales increased 6.2% year over year, daily sales improved 1.1%, which was softer than the 3.8% increase in April. Unfavorable currency impacted sales by 0.5% in the month, compared to a negative impact of 0.4% last month.On a positive note, vending trends improved in the first quarter of 2016 as efforts to improve the quality of signings/installs paid off. The company intends to increase its investment in the vending program and expects it to outperform through 2016 and beyond.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Fastenal is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here, as you will see below. The Earnings ESP is 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 48 cents. : Fastenal's Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.However, we caution against stocks with Zacks Rank #4 and #5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some companies in the construction sector, that, according to our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Louisiana-Pacific Corp.  , with an Earnings ESP of +4.0% and a Zacks Rank #1.Owens Corning  , with an Earnings ESP of +9.41% and a Zacks Rank #2.Potlatch Corporation  , with an Earnings ESP of +42.86% and a Zacks Rank #2.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

nvestors considering a purchase of Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST) stock, but tentative about paying the going market price of $42.45/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2018 put at the $35 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $2.95. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 8.4% return against the $35 commitment, or a 5.4% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to FAST's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $35 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Fastenal Co. sees its shares decline 17.6% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $32.05 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $2.95 from $35), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 5.4% annualized rate of return. Worth considering, is that the annualized 5.4% figure actually exceeds the 2.8% annualized dividend paid by Fastenal Co. by 2.6%, based on the current share price of $42.45. And yet, if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downside because the stock would have to fall 17.61% to reach the $35 strike price. Always important when discussing dividends is the fact that, in general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Fastenal Co., looking at the dividend history chart for FAST below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 2.8% annualized dividend yield.

 is slated to release first-quarter fiscal 2016 results on Jun 8. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 6.3%.In the trailing four quarters, the company has reported in-line results in two and positive earnings surprise in one quarter, while in the remaining one quarter, earnings lagged estimates. Lululemon has delivered an average positive surprise of 0.2% in the last four quarters. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement. | Going into fiscal 2016, Lululemon remains confident of resuming earnings growth driven on the back of continued top-line momentum, gross margin expansion and efficient inventory management. As a result, the company provided an encouraging guidance for fiscal 2016. For the first quarter, Lululemon expects revenues in the range of $483-$488 million, with constant dollar comps growth in the mid-single digits range. Lululemon anticipates earnings in the band of 28-30 cents per share, compared with 34 cents in the year-ago quarter.Also, the company's four newly formulated growth strategies that target to double revenues to about $4 billion and more than double earnings by 2020, demonstrate prospects for long-term growth.However, the company remains prone to unfavorable currency movements, which are expected to hurt results throughout fiscal 2016. Management expects modest SG&A deleverage in the year, which is partially accountable to currency movements. This raises concerns for the company's performance during the year.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Lululemon is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below: Earnings ESP for Lululemon is currently -3.23%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of 30 cents is below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 31 cents. Lululemon currently has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company's ESP of -3.23% makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements:Nike Inc.  , expected to report earnings on Jun 23, has an Earnings ESP of +2.08% and a Zacks Rank #3.Fastenal Company  , expected to report earnings on Jul 12, has an Earnings ESP of +4.17% and a Zacks Rank #3.Aaron's Inc.  , expected to report earnings on Jul 22, has an Earnings ESP of +1.75% and a Zacks Rank #3.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

 is slated to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2016 results on Jun 1. The big question facing investors now is, whether the company will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported.In the last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 8.9%. Notably, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 9.6%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement. | Our proven model does not conclusively show that Michael Kors Holdings' is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Michael Kors Holdings has an  is -2.08% as the Most Accurate estimate stands at 94 cents whereas the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at 96 cents. So, although Michael Kors Holdings carries a Zacks Rank #3, a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.In an effort to drive the top line, Michael Kors has been focusing on store expansion. In the third quarter of fiscal 2016, the company opened 34 new stores, which includes 15 in the Americas, 16 in Europe and three in Japan. These stores should help the company generate higher revenues.However, the new stores opening will increase operating costs, which in turn, will contract margins going ahead. Moreover, investments across the board will lead to an increase of about 230 basis points in operating expense as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal 2016.Michael Kors generates a portion of its net sales outside the U.S. Given its exposure to international markets, the company remains prone to currency fluctuations. The weakening of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar may require the company to either raise prices or contract profit margins in locations outside of the U.S. An increase in price may have an adverse impact on the demand for the products.

Home Depot also comes in above the median of analyst picks among the broader  components, claiming the #175 spot out of 500.Investors often interpret analyst opinions from different angles - a popular analyst pick could mean that many sharp minds individually came to the same bullish conclusion, and therefore the stock should do well, but it could also mean that if the company stumbles, that would come as a negative surprise.From the other direction, when companies have a low rank among analysts, it isn't necessarily the case that investors should conclude that the stock will perform poorly. It can, of course, but a bullish investor could also take the contrarian angle and read into the data that there is lots of room for upside because the stock is so out of favor.For these reasons, we at  find value to putting together these rankings, because both the top and the bottom ends of the lists can often make for some interesting stock picking ideas for further research.The post appeared first on .The post ) appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Why Home Depot Inc Ranks As a Top 15 Pick (HD)@2016-05-13@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-home-depot-inc-ranks-as-a-top-15-pick-hd-2016-05-13
 is slated to release first-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Jun 2. Last quarter, the company had delivered a significant negative earnings surprise of 59.3%. In fact, it has underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 36.5% over the trailing four quarters. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Conns has posted lower-than-expected earnings for two straight quarters now, reflecting softness in comparable store sales (comps) and high year-over-year delinquencies.The company recently reported sales and delinquency data for the month and first quarter ended Apr 2016, with comps declining 1.9% and 3.4%, respectively. On excluding the impact of Conns' decision to discontinue the sale of video game products, digital cameras and certain tablets, comps for April remained flat while dropping 1.3% for the quarter. Moreover, the greater than 60-day delinquency rate expanded by 20 basis points year over year, as of Apr 30, 2016, on account of persistent deceleration in portfolio growth rate. Hence, we remain cautious about the company's performance in the to-be-reported quarter.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Conns is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below: Earnings ESP for Conns is currently pegged at 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at breakeven. Conns carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Ctrip.com International Ltd.  , expected to report earnings on Jun 1, has an Earnings ESP of +17.91% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Nike Inc.  , expected to report earnings on Jun 23, has an Earnings ESP of +2.08% and a Zacks Rank #3.Fastenal Company  , expected to report earnings on Jul 12, has an Earnings ESP of +17.91% and a Zacks Rank #3.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

We view the sequential strengthening of sales as evidence of abating energy and F/X headwinds as well as share gains in manufacturing and construction end markets.

"Chicago, IL - April 11, 2016 - Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week's list includes  (  ),  (  ),  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ) To see more earnings analysis, visit  .Every day, Zacks.com makes their Bull Stock of the Day available, free of charge.  . (  ) may no longer be as relevant to the U.S. economy and the stock market as it may have been at some stage in its long life. But the company's name gets plenty of sunshine from the widely-held belief that its earnings report kick-stars each quarterly reporting cycle. Many in the market even see the company's earnings report as a leading indicator of what to expect from the rest of corporate America. But that is most likely overstating the company's bellwether status, notwithstanding aluminum's significance to the automotive, aircraft manufacturing and construction end markets.The bottom line is that the relevance of Alcoa's results and outlook is fairly limited; it doesn't tell us much beyond what may be useful for the broader industrial metals space. Results the day after Alcoa's report from railroad operator  (  ) and industrial nuts-and-bolts supplier  (  ) have a lot more relevance to the economically sensitive parts of the U.S. economy. In total, we will get results 14 S&P 500 members this week, including all the money center banks.Here are this week's key earnings reports (4/11): Alcoa is the key report today after the close, with the company expected to earn 2 cents in EPS on $5.3 billion in revenues. Estimates have been under pressure given the commodity price headwinds, with the current EPS estimates one-third of what was expected three months back. The stock has responded negatively to recent earnings releases irrespective of whether the surprises were positive or otherwise. (4/12): Fastenal is the key report in the morning while CSX Corp will report after the close. Fastenal is expected to earn 44 cents on $975 million in revenues compared to EPS of 43 cents on $953 million in revenues in the year-earlier quarter. CSX is expected to report 37 cents in EPS on $2.7 billion in revenues vs. 45 cents EPS on $3.02 billion in revenues in the year-earlier quarter. Estimates and the stock have been under pressure lately given headwinds from the weakness in coal and overall soft demand backdrop from the manufacturing sector. (4/13):  (  ) will report results before the market's open, with the bank expected to earn $1.26 in EPS on $23.9 billion in revenues, which will compare to $1.45 in EPS on $24.1 billion in revenues in the 2015 quarter. J.P. Morgan shares are down almost -12% year to date on the back of the broadly unfavorable backdrop for the major banks (Finance has been the weakest performing sector of the market year to date).J.P. Morgan and its peers have been weighed down by the flattening yield curve, a weak capital markets and investment banking business as a result of heightened market volatility and rising estimates of provision expenses as a results of the Energy sector's deteriorating credit profile. J.P. Morgan's Q1 EPS estimate of $1.26 is down -17% from what was expected two months back. For the Finance sector as a whole, total Q1 earnings are expected to be down -10.7% on -4.7% lower revenues. (4/14):  (  ) reports after the close. Delta is expected to earn $1.29 in EPS on $9.24 billion in revenues vs. EPS of 44 cents on $9.4 billion in revenues in the year-earlier period. (4/15):  is the key report in the morning, with the bank expected to earn $1.04 in EPS on $17.7 billion in revenues vs. $1.39 in EPS on $19.7 billion in revenues in the March 2015 period.Here are four key points to know about the Q1 earnings season. , Q1 estimates fell sharply over the last three months and are continuing to come down. Total earnings for the quarter are expected to be down -11.1% on -2.3% lower revenues. Earnings growth is expected to be negative for 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors, including Technology and Finance, the two largest in the index. , the negative earnings growth in Q1 will be the fourth quarter in a row of earnings declines for the S&P 500 index. The headwinds remain unchanged from other recent periods, essentially a combination of Energy sector weakness, the dollar strength and global growth constraints. Please note that Q1 earnings growth would still be in the negative even on an ex-Energy basis. , the magnitude of negative revisions that Q1 estimates suffered over the last three months has been the highest of all recent quarters in the comparable periods. Fresh weakness in  at the start of the period was no doubt a big driver of pushing estimates down. But Energy isn't the only sector that suffered negative revisions. In fact, estimates fell for 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors since the start of the period, with only two sectors (Utilities & Retail) experiencing modest positive revisions. , the growth challenge isn't restricted to Q1 or the preceding few quarters; it is actually no better for the current and following quarters either. Total 2016 Q2 earnings are currently expected to be down -5.5% on -2.1% lower revenues, a growth pace that will go down more in the coming days as companies report Q1 results and guide lower for Q2. All of this year's growth has effectively evaporated, with the modest positive growth for 2016 as a whole entirely a function of current expectations for the last quarter of the year.Estimates for 2016 Q1 started coming down at an accelerated pace as companies predominantly guided lower on the 2015 Q4 earnings calls, consistent with the trend we have been seeing for more than two years now. Total Q1 earnings for companies in the S&P 500 are currently expected to be down -11.1% from the same period last year, a material decline from the -1.1% decline expected at the start of the quarter.Zacks ""Profit from the Pros"" e-mail newsletter provides highlights of the latest analysis from Zacks Equity Research.  .

The holding grew past 20% in the third quarter 2013, and management continued to buy until it reached its peak weighting of 36% in the second quarter 2015. By September, accounting missteps and short-seller accusations sparked ValeantAAAs 90% loss of market value over the past 10 months that dragged the typically disciplined, outperforming Sequoia Fund to a loss of 28%, compared to a 6% rise in the S&P 500.The negative impact led to the retirement of Ruane Cunniff ( Trades , Portfolio )AAAs CEO, Robert Goldfarb, though the firm said in the April client note that its investment philosophy AAA finding companiesAAA intrinsic values through intense research and letting management create value AAA would remain intact.ValeantAAAs price fell a further 15% Tuesday when it lowered full-year guidance for 2016 in its first quarter financial statement after missing the deadline for filing early in the year.

 reported adjusted earnings of 44 cents per share in the first quarter of 2016, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Earnings rose 2.3% year over year.Net sales of $986.7 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $984 million by 0.3% and increased 3.5% year over year. The net sales increase was driven by higher unit sales at older store locations during the quarter.Net sales at the Canadian business increased about 7% in local currency during the quarter, better than a 4% increase in the previous quarter.However, sales were hurt by price deflation of fastener products and unfavorable currency translation.The top line was also adversely impacted by lower sales to its customers in the oil & gas industry, a stronger U.S dollar and overall weakness in the industrial economy.Fastenal's total average daily sales increased 1.9% in the first quarter of 2016, much lower than an 8.8% increase in the prior-year quarter. However, it was better than a 2% decline reported in the fourth quarter. Foreign exchange dragged down daily sales growth rate in the quarter by 0.8%.On a monthly basis, daily sales remained flat in March but increased 2.6% in February and 3.3% in January. The company had recorded daily sales growth of 5.6%, 8.6% and 12%, respectively, in the corresponding year-ago months.This industrial and construction supplies wholesale distributor serves customers in the manufacturing and non-residential construction markets.Daily sales to manufacturing customers (representing almost 50% of revenues) rose 0.9%, down from growth of 6.9% in the prior-year quarter, but better than 2.2% decline reported in the previous quarter.The daily sales growth rate of fastener products (used mainly for industrial production and accounting for nearly 40% of the company's business) declined 1.7% in the quarter, compared with a 5.5% increase in the year-ago quarter and a 6.2% decline recorded in the previous quarter.Lower demand from the heavy machinery manufacturing customer base, mainly from those engaged in oil and gas business, hurt fastener sales due to lower production requirements.Non-fastener product sales (used mainly for maintenance) increased 4.7%, compared to increase of 11.7% in the prior-year quarter and 1.2% in the last quarter. The non-fastener business also weakened over the last few months as improved vending trends were offset by overall weakness in the industrial environment.In the non-residential construction market, daily sales to non-residential construction customers (representing 20% to 25% of revenues) declined 0.4% as against a 6.2% increase in the prior-year quarter. Volatility and softer energy prices hurt sales in this market. However, daily sales decline was narrower than 6.1% decline reported in the previous quarter.As of Mar 31, 2016, Fastenal operated 56,889 vending machines, up 17.2% year over year. During the quarter, the company signed 4,647 machine contracts, up 15.7% from the last quarter. The daily sales growth rate to customers using vending machines was 3.6%, up from 0.7% in the previous quarter. Vending machines now account for 44.5% of the company's sales, higher than 43.9% in the prior quarter.After remaining soft in 2013, vending trends improved through 2014 and 2015, as management's recent efforts on enhancing the quality of signings/installs paid off.Gross margin of 49.8% in the first quarter of 2016 declined 100 basis points (bps) year over year and 10 bps sequentially. Gross margin was below the company's average of around 50% owing to an unfavorable customer mix and product mix.The customer mix shifted toward the large account end-market, which produces low-margin gross profit but stronger operating income. The product mix shifted from high-margin fastener products to non-fastener products. In fact, the company expects these trends to continue in the future as well.Fastenal Company has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the construction sector include Beacon Roofing Supply, Inc.  , Gibraltar Industries, Inc.  and Headwaters Inc.  .

The major indexes are on track for a modestly positive open on the back of oil market gains, but the focus is shifting to the Q1 earnings season, which ramps up in the coming days.Many in the market see the sharp drop in Q1 EPS estimates over the last three months as providing companies with easy paths towards positive earnings surprises. That's a plausible argument, and the ratio of earnings surprises this earnings cycle could very well surpass what we have been seeing in other recent periods.The question is whether positive earnings and revenue surprises will be enough to push stocks higher. I doubt it. More than positive earnings and revenue surprises, market participants will be looking to management's guidance for the current and coming quarters. We see this in play in the market's reaction this morning's report from Fastenal (  ) and Monday evening's Alcoa (  ) release. Both of these reports were OK relative to Q1 estimates, but they fail to inspire confidence about the current period.Management's guidance will determine how estimates for the current period evolve over the coming days as companies report Q1 results. Current estimates put S&P 500 earnings growth in 2016 Q2 at a decline of -5.5% on -3.3% lower revenues, which will be the 5th quarter in a row of negative earnings growth for the index.We know that these estimates will come down in the coming days. But the question is whether they will go down as much as Q1 estimates did over the last three months, or we will see an improvement on the revisions front? The answer to that question will determine how stocks perform over the next four weeks.Sheraz MianDirector of ResearchWant the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

 is set to report first-quarter 2016 results on Apr 12, before the market opens. Last quarter, Fastenal delivered a negative surprise of 2.50%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Fastenal reported disappointing sales and profits in the fourth quarter of 2015. Revenues were hurt by lower sales to customers in the oil & gas industry, a stronger U.S. dollar, softness in the Canadian business and overall weakness in the industrial economy. We do not expect any significant improvement in sales in the to-be reported quarter as well.Sales of Industrial fasteners have been declining since the past few quarters due to lower demand from the heavy machinery manufacturing customer base, mainly from those engaged in the oil & gas business, which resulted from lower production requirements. Since the volatility in the oil & gas business continues, industrial fasteners sales are unlikely to improve in the soon-to-be reported quarter.Lack of price inflation, an unfavorable product mix, and pricing and competitive pressures are hurting gross margins. The product mix has shifted from high-margin fastener products to lower margin non-fastener products. The customer mix has shifted toward the large-account end-market, which produces low-margin gross profit but stronger operating income. In fact, the company expects these trends to continue.Nonetheless, vending trends improved in 2015 as efforts to improve the quality of signings/installs paid off. This trend is expected to benefit results in the to-be reported quarter. Management's cost control initiatives are also impressive and should support the bottom line.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Fastenal is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here, as you will see below. The Earnings ESP is 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 44 cents. Fastenal's Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.However, we caution against stocks with Zacks Rank #4 and #5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some companies in the construction sector, that, according to our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:CEMEX, S.A.B. de C.V.  , with an Earnings ESP of +66.67% and a Zacks Rank #1.Headwaters Incorporated  , with an Earnings ESP of +11.11% and a Zacks Rank #1.Trex Co.

The upside came after the company won a lawsuit alleging its negligence in informing consumers about the presence of formaldehyde in some of the products.

"Chicago, IL - April 05, 2016 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include  and Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.  .Following a weak start to the year, markets have posted strong returns last month. Gains have come on the back of two major factors, a decline in rate hike fears and resurgence in  . Stocks gained again on the first trading day of the month, raising hopes of better times ahead.However, concerns continue to linger just beneath the surface, even though they are being ignored at this point in time. This is why it is necessary to pick stocks from stolid, safe sectors which may look boring but provide resilience if volatility recurs.An increase in oil prices was one of the major reasons for last month's remarkable performance. Rising possibilities of a production freeze, a weaker-than-expected rise in crude inventories and a decline in the oil rig count played major roles in boosting oil prices.Meanwhile, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decided to keep interest rates flat at between 0.25% and 0.50% and its new forecast reduced the number of rate hikes likely this year from four to two. Data on job additions and GDP also remained promising.However, familiar concerns continue to persist beneath the surface. The FOMC also mentioned last month that ""global and financial developments continue to pose risks,"" which was one of the primary reasons why it did not hike rates. Additionally, the committee reduced its forecast for economic growth and offered an inflation rate outlook for this year which was weaker than that expected earlier.Meanwhile, the future of an agreement on a possible oil production freeze among major producers continues to remain tenuous. WTI and Brent Crude have lost 7% and 3% last week. Meanwhile, an important member of Saudi Arabia's oil family said last Friday that it will freeze production only if other large producers, including Iran also do so.Additionally, dismal manufacturing data emerged from Japan. U.S. economic data continued to remain mixed in nature. While employment and manufacturing reports showed gains, construction spending and auto sales data were disappointing.One way of guarding against a market reversal is to invest in stolid yet dependable industries. Boring at first glance, these companies deliver steady, even impressive returns. Of course, corporate history is littered with companies which no longer dominate the mindscape of investors. Old world advertising has fallen by the way side as Alphabet Inc. (  ) and its ilk has taken control through the power of digital advertising. Innovation has reduced the importance of these names significantly.However, some businesses are insulated against innovation to a great degree or can resist it for significant periods of time. This includes such names as Fastenal Company (  ) and Balchem Corp., the first of which is in the business of nuts and bolts. Meanwhile, the second sells products which provide nutrition to livestock. They continue to perform appreciably well and have literally stood the test of time.Despite strong market performance in recent times, it may still be necessary to insulate your portfolio against possible volatility. One of the ways of doing this is investing in so called boring stocks which have provided significant returns over long periods.At the same time, it is important to select companies which can provide significant returns over the short term as well.

"'s second-quarter results were a mix of positives and negatives, and there is something in them for glass-half-full and -empty proponents. Its end markets aren't improving, but they aren't getting much worse. The company continues to execute well and maintain gross margin, but sales growth is disappointing. It was truly a mixed quarter, so let's take a closer look at the details and what to expect going forward. In common with fellow industrial supply companies, and have  in 2016. It's a sign that the market is anticipating a bottoming process in U.S. industrial conditions. However, the evidence from MSC Industrial's second quarter is tantalizingly vague. Th e headline numbers:IMAGE SOURCE: MSC INDUSTRIAL DIRECT CO. INC.As you can see above, revenue c ame in below the midpoint of guidance -- a sign that end-market conditions were weaker than expected -- but the company executed well with gross margin at the high end of expectations and operating expenses below guidance.In addition, management claims that MSC Industrial is gaining market share -- a key objective as part of its expansion strategy. In one sense, a depressed marketplace throws up opportunities for the large players such as MSC, Fastenal, and Grainger to grab share in what is a highly fragmented market. A look at average daily sales growth by month shows how the improvement seen in December failed to carry through into MSC Industrial's second quarter. This is somewhat disappointing given that Fastenal and Grainger had both reported  in early 2016.IMAGE SOURCE: MSC INDUSTRIAL DIRECT CO. INC PRESENTATIONS.Moreover, the company's core manufacturing sales (68% of revenue in the quarter) saw growth weaken in the quarter. In contrast, non-manufacturing sales growth was stronger on a sequential basis. PRESENTATIONS.On a more positive note, management's guidance indicates that conditions are likely to get better. A brief summary of company expectations for the third quarter:Also, commentary on the  suggested overall conditions were stabilizing. CEO Erik Gershwind said, ""W e just completed a survey of our customers and the prevailing sentiment is that business will at least stay the same and possibly improve in the months ahead,"" and he then described how ""we historically see roughly a four-month lag between movements in sentiment indices and our growth rates.""In other words, the current numbers may not look good, but conditions appear to be stabilizing and could improve in a few months' time. However, any improvement is unlikely to be linear or even consistent. As you can see in the average daily sales chart (second chart above), sales are erratic and sensitive. On the , CFO Rustom Jilla described how March started strongly but then descended into ""mid-month softness"" led by weakness in oil and gas and heavy equipment and machinery, the usual culprits.More surprising was the "" weakness in aerospace driven by a push out in orders of commercial aircraft and in government, the timing of quarter-end budget crunches."" It's a salutary reminder of how uneven and bumpy the recovery since 2010 has been. Assuming that, end demand will grow in an orderly fashion. In the third quarter, investors will be looking to see if the relatively better industrial data translates into some improvement -- or at least stabilization -- in MSC Industrial's sales growth. Meanwhile, management needs to carry on executing and increasing productivity while grabbing market share. In the end, these actions will prepare the company for substantive margin expansion, if and when sales start growing again.All told, MSC Industrial is executing well, and there are signs of improvement to come, but it hasn't shown up in the results just yet.

 has acquired Charlotte, NC-based distributor of siding, windows, gutters, vinyl railings and related products, Lyf-Tym Building Products. With this buyout, Beacon will further solidify its presence in the Carolinas and Southern Virginia where there is strong demand for complementary products, while better serving its customers with broader product offerings.Founded in 1966, Lyf-Tym currenly operates six branches, with two locations in Charlotte and branches in Hickory, Monroe, and Greensboro, NC as well as Roanoke, VA. Lyf-Tym also fabricates gutters and aluminum-reinforced vinyl railings systems from its fabrication facility in Charlotte, NC. The acquisition will be a strategic fit for Beacon Roofing. Lyf-Tym is known as a high quality supplier of siding, windows, gutters and railings that will complement Beacon Roofing's existing business in the Carolinas and Southern Virginia. The company will thus be able to capitalize on the solid demand for complementary products in these regions.Beacon Roofing has expanded its business through strategic acquisitions and diversification of its product offering. Last October, Beacon Roofing acquired Roofing Supply Group for approximately $1.1 billion. The buyout will help the company to expand its geographic footprint as well as provide better product diversification and customer service. Moreover, the RSG acquisition will improve the company's earnings per share with a minimum accretion of 30 cents in fiscal 2016. Again, in Dec 2015, Beacon Roofing acquired three companies, RCI Roofing Supply of Omaha, Roofing and Insulation Supply of Dallas, and Statewide Wholesale of Denver. These acquisitions will provide the company with additional geographic and product density.Beacon Roofing also continues to focus on organic greenfield growth. It opened 6 new Beacon branches in 2015, 26 new branches in 2014, and 10 new branches in 2013. These 42 new branch locations in the past three years have allowed the company to strategically penetrate deeper into many of its existing markets as well as enter new markets. The greenfields are located in markets that have strong dynamics, making it easier for the company to establish its presence and gain local market share.Further, Beacon Roofing's record first quarter has set a strong pace for fiscal 2016. For the balance of the year, the company will retain its focus on sales growth, gross margin stability and improving operating leverage. The company will also benefit from increase in roofing and re-roofing demand.Beacon Roofing currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Other favourably ranked stocks in the sector include Headwaters Inc.  , Gibraltar Industries, Inc.  and Fastenal Company  .

 posted a negative earnings surprise in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 after reporting earnings beat for seven consecutive quarters. Adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter were 98 cents, well below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.39. The figure also declined 3.9% year over year.GAAP earnings in the reported quarter came in at 79 cents per share compared with $1.02 earned in the prior-year quarter.The company's fourth-quarter results were negatively impacted by shipment delays. Recently, the company launched two businesses - RH Modern and RH Teen. While the RH Modern division is focused on manufacturing luxury furniture with a modern twist, RH Teen engages in the making of superior quality furniture, linens, lightning and decor for teens.The initial response to RH Modern has been exceptional, however, only a few vendors are facing problems related to trial of this new product. This in turn is causing delay in shipments and is also hampering the quarterly results. However, analysts are optimistic about the company's prospects in this business line as they believe that the problem is temporary and will be resolved soon. The recent 4% rally in the company's stock price reinforces analyst confidence on the stock.Apart from launching the new businesses, the company has adopted various initiatives like product category expansion, stores transformation and multi-channel platform, and infrastructure enhancement to drive growth.Though revenues increased 11.1% to $647.2 million, the figure lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $712 million, marking the third miss in the last seven quarters. Apart from delayed shipping, the revenue miss can also be attributed to currency fluctuation.Restoration Hardware's comparable brand revenues, including direct revenues, went up 9% year over year compared with 24% in the prior-year quarter. Further, the company's direct and store revenues came in at $328.4 million and $318.8 million, advancing 8% and 15% year over year, respectively.Meanwhile, adjusted operating income increased 0.5% to $74.2 million from the year-ago quarter while adjusted operating margin contracted 120 basis points to 11.5%.At the end of fourth-quarter 2015, Restoration Hardware operated 69 retail outlets, including 53 legacy galleries, 6 large format galleries, 4 next generation design galleries, 1 RH Modern Gallery and 5 Baby & Child galleries. The company also has 17 outlets across the U.S. and Canada.Restoration Hardware, which shares space with Williams-Sonoma Inc.  , ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $349.9 million, merchandise inventories of $725.4 million, convertible senior notes (net) worth $298.3 million due in 2019 and $221.5 million due in 2020, and total shareholders' equity of $886.2 million.To resolve production delays at RH Modern, the company plans to invest this year which will impact the company's fiscal 2016 financial numbers. This will reduce the company's revenue by nearly $15 million and adjusted EPS by 22 cents in fiscal 2016.For fiscal 2016, management projects net revenue growth in the range of low to mid-single digit. The company expects adjusted EPS to be nearly flat to marginally down year over year. Capital expenditures are projected in the range of $175 million to $200 million.For the first quarter of fiscal 2016, the company expects net revenues in the range of $452 million to $456 million compared with $422 million reported in the prior fiscal. Adjusted earnings per share are likely to be between 4 cents and 6 cents compared with 23 cents reported in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter is currently pegged at 18 cents per share, which could witness a sharp downward revision in the coming days.Restoration Hardware currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

What's going on, and can it continue? data by  .There is little doubt that conditions grew worse during the fourth quarter, and most companies have been cautious with their guidance in their most recent reports -- not usually a good sign. For example,  , a major product supplier to MSC Industrial and Fastenal, referred to a U.S. industrial recession on the company's  in February, when CFO Jan Kees Van Gaalen outlined a cut in full-year guidance (Kennametal's fiscal year ends in July):Regular Fool readers already know how  in the fourth quarter, and that  saw  in all of its key end markets. Meanwhile Fastenal's fastener sales -- around 40% of its total business and the key to its industrial business -- declined 6.2% in the fourth quarter.However, markets tend to anticipate economic conditions, and the appreciation of the industrial supply sector -- usually seen as highly cyclical -- is an indication the market is pricing in some sort of recovery in the second half. But is there any evidence for this?I have three pieces of evidence:A look at U.S. industrial and manufacturing production suggests, albeit tenuously, that a trough was formed in December. Recall that the company results discussed above encompassed this period, so relatively better conditions could show up in future earnings figures.IMAGE SOURCE: TRADINGECONOMICS.COM.Hard macroeconomic data is also backed up by the ISM survey data. As you can see below, manufacturing has picked up a bit in 2016 (index readings above 50 indicate expansion) and the non-manufacturing index remains in positive territory. data by  . Wesco International CEO John Engel outlined how its request-for-proposal activity level grew successively each quarter in 2015. In this case, RFPs are solicitations for industrial supply companies to submit business proposals.Meanwhile, on MSC Industrial's , CFO Rustom Jilla suggested that average daily sales would be down 4% in January and February -- not fantastic, but better than the 5.9% decline reported in November.Fastenal always gives great monthly data. Here is a chart of daily sales growth for its stores open more than five years (it's better to use mature stores to analyze sales data).DATA SOURCE: FASTENAL COMPANY PRESENTATIONS.A look at Grainger's daily sales growth in U.S. stores reveals very similar sales trends.DATA SOURCE: W.W. GRAINGER, INC COMPANY PRESENTATIONS. There is no guarantee that the tentative trends outlined above will continue in 2015, so it's probably too early to get out the bunting. On the other hand, it looks like the U.S. could be over the worst of the industrial slowdown. Moreover, the industrial supply companies will have weaker numbers to compare with going into the second half of 2016.For investors looking to play this theme and jump in ahead of the next move upward in a sector, it's probably a good idea to focus on broader industrial stocks with a heavy U.S. focus. The industrial supply companies are always early in the cycle, and their stock price movements and sales trends could be signalling a better second half for the industrial sector.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

"re you still holding shares of home furnishing retailer,  and waiting for a miracle to take the stock higher in 2016? If yes, then you might lose more money as chances are very slim that the stock, which lost its value by nearly 57% in the past one year, will take a U-turn in the near term.Usually investors want their portfolio to have stocks with a solid track record of earnings beat, surging share price and a favorable recommendation. Let's delve deeper and find out why Lumber Liquidators is no more a favorite pick for investors.Recently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (""CDC"") announced that the risk of cancer from the company's flooring products is much higher than reported earlier. The study found a high level of formaldehyde, a well-known carcinogen, in the company's flooring products. Per CDC, exposure to the company's laminate flooring may cause cancer in 6 to 30 people per 100,000, up from the previous estimate of 2 to 9 persons per 100,000. The use of Chinese laminate flooring may increase respiratory problems for people suffering from asthma and lung disease. Even healthy people may face problems such as eye, nose and throat irritation.Lumber Liquidators has been in troubled waters since a report aired on ""60 Minutes"" on Mar 1, 2015, accused it of selling Chinese flooring laminates containing formaldehyde levels that far exceed California's standards.These legal troubles have left a serious dent in Lumber Liquidators' bottom and top lines. The company's bottom line has lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing six quarters, with an average earnings miss of a whopping 432.4%. The company has also not performed well on the revenue front, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate in six out of the trailing seven quarters.Following dismal earnings, analysts trimmed the company's earnings estimates. In the past 30 days, the company's loss estimate for 2016 has widened to 56 cents from a loss of 24 cents. On the other hand, over the same time frame, the company's loss estimate for the first quarter of 2016 has moved up to a loss of 29 cents from a loss of 16 cents.Lumber Liquidators, which shares space with Lowe's Companies, Inc.  , has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Why buy a company that is bogged down by lawsuits and mending its reputation when there are plenty of other companies not dealing with such issues, and with rising earnings estimates? If you want to own a company in the same space, consider Fastenal Company  and Beacon Roofing Supply, Inc.  . Both these stocks hold a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

" has felt the pressure from the downward trend in demand from companies associated with the oil and gas industry, as well as the strong U.S. dollar. That said, the company still generates excess free cash flow and has actually grown in-store sales. Earnings and revenue increased 5% and 4%, respectively, year over year in the most recent earnings report. I expect the company to grow free cash flow in the years ahead. Should this thesis play out, it would be just one of the many reasons Fastenal could be a buy right now. Stock prices surged after the company's recent earnings release in January, but shares were still down 11% from the highs in 2014. Let's see if Fastenal is a buy at current levels. data by  . Fastenal originated in 1967 as a supplier of threaded fasteners -- screws, nuts, and bolts. Today, although the industry is quite fragmented, the company counts itself as one of the leading sellers of business-to-business supplies to end users. The company sells supplies through 2,637 stores in 22 countries and employs more than 18,000 people. Fastenal has four times as many stores as the next largest competitor.What makes the company great is its strategy of placing stores next to its distribution network of 14 centers in North America. The proximity of the stores to the distribution centers allows the local stores to operate at a higher-than-average profitability level versus the competition. Fastenal expects to open another 60 to 75 stores in 2016, a rate consistent with that of years past.Image source: Fastenal presentation. Fastenal has many critics who challenge the sustainability of the company's competitive advantages. Many argue that Fastenal's competitors could easily access the same products through other companies. Substitute products are a legitimate concern; however, Fastenal's business model appears to be far superior to the competition's. At 50.37% and 21.42% gross and operating margins, Fastenal generates abnormally high margins in the industry. Any company producing these kinds of margins will invite competition, but the company's well-placed distribution centers give it an advantage and a barrier to entry because of the high capital outlay involved in building such distribution centers. Also, Fastenal is known as having one of the best customer service teams in the industry.The company's broad market coverage and in-house distribution give it a scale advantage over the competition, as Fastenal continues to take share from smaller local players. Above-average industry margins should continue as the company continues to roll out on-site industrial vending machines; as of year-end 2015, it had 55,510 vending machines, a nearly 19% increase over 2014.I believe the company's competitive position is intact for now. The business model should keep potential competitors out for the time being, but investors should keep an eye out for declining margins and revenues. Fastenal's broad product line at convenient locations has helped the company grow over the years. The bundling of products into a ""one-stop shop"" has significant advantages to the buyer and seller in the form of cost and pricing. Not only does this type of business model create a ""sticky"" customer relationship, but it also creates unique customer offerings for specific company projects and demands.The company is positioned well for growth, as management sees the potential for 3,500 stores in North America. The current store count sits around 2,600, leaving plenty of room for growth in North America alone. Fastenal is a long-term play -- its shares aren't for those looking to make a quick buck. Over the last five years, the company has grown earnings 22% and dividends 23% annually. data by  .While not cheap by historical measures, the stock appears reasonably priced for a company with sustainable competitive advantages that should compound investors' returns over the long term -- providing you can stomach gut-wrenching volatility until the industry rebounds.

e expect the Washington-based retailer of sports-related teen apparel,  to beat expectations when it reports fourth-quarter 2015 results on Mar 10.Our proven model shows that Zumiez may beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key components. Zumiez currently has an  of +2.08%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at 49 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 48 cents. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. Zumiez carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Zumiez's Zacks Rank #2 and Earnings ESP of +2.08% makes us reasonably confident of a positive earnings beat.Despite the lingering soft comparable-store sales trend, Zumiez has gained some momentum due to its focus on turning its performance around by testing new brands; analyzing every aspect of its business across brands and geographies; reviewing its coordinated marketing and product plans; and revisiting its promotional strategies along with the strategic use of private label. Further, the company remains optimistic about its performance in the European market.Though the company posted soft January sales, it reiterated its previously announced guidance for the fourth quarter, anticipating sales in the range of $237-$239 million, with earnings per share of 45-47 cents.Moreover, Zumiez's focus on investing in global expansion, enhancing omni-channel capacities and its customer-centric approach, bode well. Alongside, shareholder-friendly moves underscore its financial strength.Zumiez has topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 6.04%, with in line results in three quarters. In the last concluded quarter, the company delivered an earnings beat of 24.14%.Zumiez is not the only firm looking up this earnings season. The following companies are also likely to beat earnings in the to-be-reported quarter:Amazon.com, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +89.83% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).GameStop Corp.  has an Earnings ESP of +0.44% and a Zacks Rank #3.Fastenal Company  has an Earnings ESP of +2.27% and a Zacks Rank #3.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

 is slated to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2016 results on Mar 11. In the last quarter, the company had delivered a positive earnings surprise of 7.7%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Genesco recently posted a 5% increase in its holiday comparable store sales (comps), mainly on the back of robust performance witnessed at its Journeys Group division, which has been consistently performing well. Management remained impressed with its overall sales trends across North America even amid a tough holiday season. However, the company lowered its adjusted earnings guidance for fiscal 2016, anticipating the impact of the Lids Sports Group's excess inventory clearance on its results. The company envisions earnings per share in the range of $4.30-$4.40, compared with the prior expectation of $4.50-$4.60.However, Genesco recently divested its Lids Team Sports unit to BSN SPORTS, in an effort to revitalize the performance of this division. While the company's earnings surprise history provides a negative picture, we remain encouraged by its persistent omni-channel endeavors, which are likely to be the key growth drivers.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Genesco is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below: Genesco has an Earnings ESP of -1.85%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of $2.12 stands below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.16. Genesco's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements:Zumiez, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +2.08% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).GameStop Corp.  has an Earnings ESP of +0.44% and a Zacks Rank #3.Fastenal Company  has an Earnings ESP of +2.27% and a Zacks Rank #3.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"What a difference a few weeks can make in the stock markets. The  is now challenging its 2016 highs as short sellers are adding slowly to their bets against the market.Click to Enlarge  This combination means that there are more potential short squeeze opportunities for those of us ready to comb through the data.This time around, our short squeeze models identified 34 S&P 500 companies that are set up for bullish moves based on their charts and recent short interest. This is by far the largest number of companies within the benchmark index that we've seen qualify for this list year-to-date - a reflection of the market's recent strength.A word of caution, though: While this market has helped to raise all boats in the harbor, the market's internals and technical trends continue to suggest that the recent volatility storm is all but over.That said, we've identified three short squeeze candidates that appear ready to outpace the market:  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ).Low interest rates and continued activity in the real estate market continue to favor housing-related stocks like Fastenal. Year-to-date, Fastenal stock has led the market considerably, returning 15% and maintaining technical dominance.Short interest on Fastenal stock is holding at its highest levels in more than two year as the bears keel trying to call a top in FAST - a costly mistake.The 18.7 short interest ratio is excessive for almost any stock, but especially for one trading with the technical and relative strength that has carried Fastenal against the rest of the market.Wall Street analysts' buy recommendations on Fastenal shares currently weigh in at a paltry 18%, with 80% of the same group sitting in the ""hold"" category. This indicates that the stock is far from representing a ""crowded"" trade, which good news for those holding or buying the shares now.Watch for a break above $47.50 to slingshot Fastenal shares 10% higher to a short-term target of $52.50.Nothing runs like a Deere, right?While Deere is sliding a bit of late, it's still breaking away from the market as it moves back into intermediate-term bull market territory on recent positive fundamental improvements. Short sellers are betting against a move into bull territory, as the short interest ratio is hovering near two-year highs at a hefty 9.1, meaning that any moves higher will start to squeeze the bears.Analyst recommendations on Deere & Company stock are bearishly biased as only 17% of the analysts covering the stock have it ranked a buy. A move back into bull market territory will likely force some upgrades, helping to drive prices even higher.Watch for a break above $85 to trigger the next short covering rally for Deere & Company, with a target of $100.Darden has made its way to the short squeeze list multiple times over the last two years, each time resulting in great short squeeze results. This month, the casual dining giant makes its way back up the list as short sellers are again increasing their bearish bets.Short interest in that latest report showed an increase of 10% on Darden stock, bring the number shares short on the stock to its highest level since November 2014! The short squeeze that occurred at that time shot DRI from $48 to $63 (31%) in a matter of six months.The current short squeeze scenario looks very similar to the November 2014 signal as the stock is once again breaking through to new highs. Fundamentally, the restructuring of Darden - including the recent spinoff of  (  ) - is paying off to Darden's business and bottom line.Of course, Wall Street is still sitting on the sidelines, with only 39% of the analysts tracking DRI rating it a buy. The strong technical breakout to new highs will shake some upgrades out of Wall Street, helping to fuel the short covering rally that is likely to drive Darden stock to the $80 level.The post ), Deere & Company () and Darden Restaurants, Inc.

 is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2016 financial numbers before the opening bell on Mar 8.In the second quarter of fiscal 2016, the company registered a negative earnings surprise of 3.7%. Notably, the company has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average earnings surprise of 5.2%. Here's a discussion on the determinants of its third-quarter results:Our proven model does not conclusively show that John Wiley & Sons is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. John Wiley & Sons has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at earnings of 76 cents. The company carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which when combined with an ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.John Wiley & Sons continues to face weak demand for printed books as is evident from the 22% decline in revenues from printed educational text books in the preceding quarter. Sales for printed books at the Professional Development segment were also down 6%. Management anticipates the overall book market to remain under pressure, at least over the near term. To counter such dismal sales, management is restructuring its books portfolio to focus on higher value content apart from cutting down on expenses. The company has a widespread global presence and hence, the strengthening of the U.S dollar will impact its performance to a certain extent.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Zumiez, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +2.08% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).GameStop Corp.  has an Earnings ESP of +0.44% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Fastenal Company  has an Earnings ESP of +2.27% and a Zacks Rank #3.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

 is slated to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2015 results on Mar 11, before the opening bell. In the last quarter, the company reported break-even results, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of earnings of 2 cents. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Last month, Citi Trends reported soft sales results for fourth-quarter fiscal 2015. The company's total sales for the quarter ended Jan 30, 2016, slipped 2.8% to $176.1 million from $181.1 million recorded a year ago. Comparable store sales (comps) for the 13-week period fell 5.0%, as against a 13.9% jump reported in the year-ago period.The soft comps performance was due to comps declines during the holiday season (November and December) that followed into January. The slump in January comps is mainly attributable to a delayed start to tax refunds. Overall, fourth-quarter comps remained soft owing to unseasonable warm weather, which in turn adversely impacted apparel sales.However, the company witnessed gross margin expansion in the fourth quarter as well as fiscal 2015, benefitting from efficient inventory management coupled with the new merchandise planning and allocation structure. The latest system enables the company to plan inventory by class, weather zone and store, to about 50% of its merchandise classes. This keeps us optimistic about the bottom line results for the fourth quarter.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Citi Trends is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below: Earnings ESP for Citi Trends is currently pegged at 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are at 28 cents. Citi Trends carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which increases the predictive power of ESP.

 has released disappointing sales figures for the month of February, as the company continued to report weakness in the industrial fasteners business.February net sales increased 7.7% year over year to $321.3 million. Daily sales improved 2.6% to $15.3 million. Unfavorable currency impacted sales by 0.8% in the month, less than a negative impact of 1.2% last month.However, the daily sales growth rate of 2.6% in February was softer than the 3.3% increase in January.We note that this industrial and construction supplies wholesale distributor serves customers in the manufacturing as well as non-residential construction markets. Notably, both the end markets witnessed decelerating growth in the month.Daily sales to manufacturing customers inched up 1.5%, slightly lower than 1.9% growth in January.Daily sales to non-residential construction customers (representing 20% to 25% of revenues) were flat year over year, worse than the 1.2% increase in Jan 2016. Further, daily sales of Fasteners products dipped 0.5%, which was worse than the 0.4% decline recorded in January.Fastenal's revenues have softened significantly over the past few quarters primarily due to weakness in the industrial fasteners business. Revenues were also hurt by lower sales to customers in the oil & gas industry, a stronger U.S. dollar, softness in the Canadian business and overall weakness in the industrial economy.Fastenal currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader building sector include Gibraltar Industries, Inc.  , Builders FirstSource, Inc.  and Beacon Roofing Supply, Inc.  . While Builders FirstSource and Gibraltar Industries sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Beacon Roofing holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

 is slated to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2016 results on Mar 11. In the last quarter, the company had delivered a positive earnings surprise of 8.8%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Hibbett has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 5.2% over the past four quarters. The company's earnings in the previous quarter benefited from solid back-to-school sales, improved margins and lower costs, along with continued gains from its merchandise initiatives. This also encouraged management to raise its earnings guidance for fiscal 2016. The company now envisions earnings in the range of $2.87-$2.94 per share, compared with $2.80-$2.90 projected earlier.However, Hibbett's top line came in below expectations in the third quarter due to the significant sales decline in the company's colder weather category items. Further, the company now anticipates comparable store sales growth to be close to flat, compared with flat-to-low single-digit growth expected earlier, thus making us somewhat cautious of the upcoming results.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Hibbett is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below: Hibbett has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are both pegged at 76 cents. Hibbett carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company's ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements:Zumiez, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +2.08% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).GameStop Corp.  has an Earnings ESP of +0.44% and a Zacks Rank #3.Fastenal Company  has an Earnings ESP of +2.27% and a Zacks Rank #3.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

n Jan 22, we issued an updated research report on  .On Jan 15, 2016, the distributor of industrial and construction supplies, reported fourth-quarter 2015 and full-year results. Fastenal's fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of 39 cents per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and year ago level by 2.5% due to soft sales. Sales, on the other hand, met estimates, but decreased 0.4% year over year. Moreover, the company's fourth-quarter gross margin of 49.9% was below the company's long-term average of around 50%. Gross margin was hurt owing to a drop in the discretionary spending power of Fastenal's customers, and unfavorable customer and product mix.Sales slowed down significantly in all the quarters of 2015. The company's top line was hurt by lower sales to customers in the oil & gas industry, a stronger U.S. dollar and overall weakness in the industrial economy. Another company hurt by strong U.S dollar is Masco Corporation  .Fastenal's results were also hurt by an unfavorable product mix, which has shifted toward non-fastener products. Since, fasteners have a higher margin than non-fastener products, the overall product mix has become unfavorable. In particular, the rate of decline of Industrial fasteners sales has worsened owing to lower demand from the heavy machinery manufacturing customer base, mainly from those engaged in the oil & gas business. Weakness in fasteners is hurting revenues and margin. Going ahead, this situation is unlikely to improve any time soon. Some other companies hurt by scenario in the oil & gas industry includes Lennar Corporation  , and PulteGroup Inc.  .Nonetheless, vending trends improved in the year as efforts on improving the quality of signings/installs paid off. This trend is expected to continue in 2016 as well. In fact, the company intends to increase its investment in the vending program this year and expects it to deliver better results through 2016 and beyond. Management's cost control initiatives are also impressive and should provide bottom-line support over the near term. Moreover, on Jan 14, 2016, the company's board of directors approved a 7.1% hike in its quarterly dividend to 30 cents from 28 cents.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

mage source: Fastenal.The stock market posted modest gains on Thursday, sending the Dow to an 80-point gain and the S&P 500 to a small percentage rise. The day was more volatile than the quiet-looking final numbers would suggest, and stocks traded in a fairly wide range as investors tried to balance the impact of falling  against a sharply lower U.S. dollar to figure out the near-term direction of the market. Earnings season continued to have an impact on individual stocks, and  ,  , and  were winners in finishing with strong advances on the day. that missed expectations. The engine maker reported a 6% revenue decline, and substantial impairment and restructuring charges sent GAAP net income down by about two-thirds. Conditions continued to deteriorate across most of the company's global footprint, and currency impacts were only partially to blame for the poor results. Yet even though Cummins gave guidance that pointed to further sales declines in 2016, investors appear to have taken today's market action as indicative of a turnaround in the commodities market. Such a turnaround could help Cummins sell more engines, as long as end-users that have had to rein in their capital spending start to buy more equipment that includes Cummins' products. If global markets become weak again, then Cummins' gains today could be short-lived.Piper Jaffray soared 16% after posting its fourth-quarter results Thursday morning. Adjusted net income for the asset manager climbed by more than 40%, and the company produced record adjusted net revenues despite seeing a decline of greater than 20% in assets under management over the past year. Piper CEO Andrew Duff heralded the company's record revenues and pointed to expansion efforts as essential to the company's overall growth strategy. In particular, moves to boost hiring in Piper's financial institutions group and the acquisition of energy-focused investment bank Simmons & Company International should help the company take full advantage of opportunities as they arise, and that bodes well for Piper's long-term trajectory.Finally, Fastenal gained 10%. The distributor of industrial and construction supplies released January sales metrics that showed net sales falling 1.6% from year-ago levels during the month. Adjusted for a smaller number of business days, however, daily sales growth came in up 3.3%. Sales gains in manufacturing were relatively similar to those in non-residential construction, and Fastenal's sales of various fastener products lagged compared to its other product lines. Because of acquisitions and organic growth, Fastenal's personnel counts have risen more than 11% in the past year. Even with its earnings having been under pressure toward the end of 2015, the potential for a turnaround in the industrial sector could lift Fastenal further in the months to come.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Industrial and construction materials supplier simultaneously released its Q4 and full-year 2015 figures and declared an increase in its dividend.Industrial and construction materials supplier  simultaneously released its Q4 and full-year 2015 figures and declared an increase in its dividend.For the quarter, the company posted net sales of just under $923 million, an incremental decline from the Q4 2014 figure. Net profit came in at $112 million ($0.39 per share), or 3% lower on a year-over-year basis. Both line items were slightly below analyst expectations of $923 million in revenue and EPS of $0.40.The differences were more pronounced in the full year, with net sales rising 4% to $3.9 billion, and bottom line increasing 5% to $516 million ($1.77).Fastenal declared a new quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share, an increase of 7% over the preceding amount. This will be dispensed on Feb. 26 to stockholders of record as of Jan. 29.The new payout yields a robust 3.2% on the current share price, well exceeding the 2.3% average of stocks on the  index. It also eclipses the yields of peer suppliers  and  .None of these developments were particularly striking. The lower quarterly figures were entirely expected, particularly given the struggles of the oil and gas industry, which forms a big part of Fastenal's customer base. MSC Industrial Direct, which is also highly exposed to that business, also saw revenue and profitability drop in its most recently reported quarter.As for the dividend increase, that -- in conjunction with an ongoing share repurchase program -- seems to be more an attempt to support the stock than a strong mark of confidence in the business. In the press release detailing the results and heralding the distribution increase, Fastenal showed concern for the development of its share price -- which over the past year has declined by 16% -- and indicated it would continue to buy back stock, presumably to help it rise.A good-size dividend should play into that strategy, so we can expect the new level to at least be maintained for some time. This should help keep income investors attracted to the stock, particularly when those yield comparisons are made to MSC Industrial Direct and W.W.

This trend is expected to continue in the near term. However, weakness in sales of the industrial fasteners, lower sales to customers in the oil & gas industry, a stronger U.S. dollar, softness in the Canadian business and overall weakness in the industrial economy continues to act as headwinds.Investors should also note the recent earnings estimate revisions for FAST has been mostly stable. Moreover, FAST has a favorable history in earnings season. Fastenal has delivered three positive earnings surprises in the last four quarters, making an average positive surprise of 1.67%.Currently, FAST has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), but that could definitely change following Fastenal's earnings report which was just released. We have highlighted some of the key stats from this just-revealed announcement below: FAST missed earnings estimate. Our consensus earnings estimate called for EPS of $0.40/share, and the company reported EPS of $0.39. Investors should note that these figures take out stock option expenses. FAST reported revenues of $923 million, in line with our consensus estimate. Fastenal's daily sales declined 2%, much less than 15.7% increase in the prior-year quarter.

ooking at the universe of stocks we cover at  , in trading on Friday, shares of Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST) were yielding above the 3% mark based on its quarterly dividend (annualized to $1.12), with the stock changing hands as low as $35.10 on the day. Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return. To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) back on 12/31/1999 - you would have paid $146.88 per share. Fast forward to 12/31/2012 and each share was worth $142.41 on that date, a decrease of $4.67/share over all those years. But now consider that you collected a whopping $25.98 per share in dividends over the same period, for a positive total return of 23.36%. Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.6%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 3% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable. Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST) is an S&P 500 company, giving it special status as one of the large-cap companies making up the S&P 500 Index.In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Fastenal Co., looking at the history chart for FAST below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 3% annual yield.

 is set to report fourth-quarter and full-year 2015 results on Jan 15, before the market opens.Last quarter, Fastenal delivered a positive surprise of 2.17%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Although Fastenal's earnings per share and revenues increased year over year in the first three quarters of 2015, revenues were hurt significantly by weakness in sales of the industrial fasteners during the period. Revenues was also hurt by lower sales to customers in the oil & gas industry, a stronger U.S. dollar, softness in the Canadian business and overall weakness in the industrial economy. Some of these headwinds are expected to continue into the upcoming quarter as well.Moreover, the lack of price inflation, an unfavorable product mix, and pricing and competitive pressures are hurting Fastenal's gross margins. Nonetheless, vending trends improved during the first three quarters of 2015 as efforts on improving the quality of signings/installs paid off. This trend is expected to continue into the fourth quarter as well. Management's cost control initiatives are also impressive and should provide bottom-line support in the upcoming quarter.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Fastenal is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here, as you will see below. The Earnings ESP is 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 40 cents. Fastenal's Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.However, we caution against stocks with Zacks Rank #4 and #5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some companies in the construction sector, that, according to our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Toll Brothers Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +2.33% and a Zacks Rank #3.Summit Materials, Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +7.14% and a Zacks Rank #1.Potlatch Corporation  , with an Earnings ESP of +16.67% and a Zacks Rank #3.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

hile we don't believe in macroeconomic speculation at the Motley Fool, we admit that sometimes key insights into a company's prospects can be explained by looking closely at an industry or macro economic indicator. After all, it's hard for even the best company to fight against strong economic tides. With that in mind, the information in the following 5 charts give a rough idea of how the underlying industries of the 5 companies in question might fare in the year ahead. We'll start with the Institute for Supply Management, or ISM, purchasing managers index. It's one of the longest-running and most widely used U.S. manufacturing indicators. A reading above 50 indicates expansion. As you can see in the chart below, the manufacturing index has weakened in 2015, especially compared to the services index. data by  .This is bad news for industrial sector in general and particularly for industrial supply companies like  . Selling industrial fasteners to the manufacturing industry is tough when activity is contracting. For example, Fastenal's daily sales growth in the year to November is down 1.6% to manufacturing customers. Any further weakening in the index in 2016 and Fastenal will surely suffer. The ISM indicator is useful as a broad indicator, but it doesn't specifically capture the weakness in heavy machinery capital spending -- an area of exposure for Fastenal.One way to monitor oil capital spending, particularly in the upstream oil sector, is to look at  North American rotary rig count, a measure of the total active drilling rigs in North America, and the key indicator to follow for an oil services company like  . As you can see, it tends to correlate with the  . data by  .Halliburton is exposed to upstream oil activity, and generates the majority of its operating income from North America. Meanwhile, Baker Hughes, a company Halliburton is intending to merge with, also tends to generate around half its revenue from North America. However, it's not all doom and gloom in the industrial world, as the construction, automotive, and aerospace sectors have notably outperformed. The leading indicator to follow in U.S. construction is the Architectural Billings Index, or ABI, from the American Institute of Architects. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.As you can see below, all of its subcomponents grew in the fall of 2015, with institutional in positive territory for the last 17 months, residential recovering from a correction in the first half of 2015. Commercial/Industrial has been more varied, but still positive in nine of the last 12 months.IMAGE SOURCE: AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ARCHITECTS.All of which is good for a company like  which generates half its revenue from its Otis elevators and climate, controls, and security, (CCS) segments. Indeed, the company expects Otis' new equipment sales to be up 10% in the Americas in 2016, helping to offset high-single-digit declines in China. Total Otis sales are expected to be up low single-digits in 2016. Meanwhile, United Technologies expects its CCS sales to be up low single-digits, with global residential and commercial heating ventilation and air conditioning sales expected to rise mid single-digits. Automotive and aerospace were the standout areas in the industrial sector during the last year. However, there are uncertainties over China's contribution to growth in both industries going forward. China produces roughly a quarter of the world's vehicles -- a market share that has more than doubled since 2007, and its production growth is key to a company like  . The company intends to spinoff its automotive experience segment (car interiors and seating) in 2016 and conditions in China are key to a successful execution.As you can see in the following chart, China's passenger car sales growth has bounced back strongly in late 2015 following a tax break in October. Moreover, Johnson Controls expects Chinese automotive production to increase nearly 11% in 2016. Will China's auto sales bounce back be short-lived?DATA SOURCE: CHINA ASSOCIATION OF AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURERS.Finally, one sector of the industrial economy has seen upgrades to expectations from its leading body. The International Air Transport Association recently upgraded its forecast for worldwide airline profitability in 2015, which is usually good news for  investors. It now expects $33 billion compared to a previous estimate for $29.6 billion.Airline profits are expected to continue growing strongly in 2016, and that should by good news for Boeing's attempts to generate new commercial aircraft orders -- particularly at a time when low  are reducing demand for newer more energy efficient aircraft -- and for United Technologies' aerospace businesses.IMAGE SOURCE: INTERNATIONAL AIR TRAFFIC ASSOCIATION.All told, the industrial sector has seen mixed performance in 2015 and it looks likely to continue in 2016. It's hard to tell where energy prices are headed, or the sustainability of China's recent auto sales boost, but North American construction prospects look good, while global aerospace appears to be holding up well.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

t's no secret that growth in the industrial sector has slowed in the last year, and manufacturing has borne the brunt of it. Worse yet, 's competitors, and  . , have already reported weak sales numbers in December. It's going to be a difficult quarter for the industrial supply companies.That said, investors will want to keep a keen eye out for MSC Industrial's first-quarter results and commentary on Jan. 6 and hope for signs of future improvement. Here are three things to look for.MSC Industrial will do well to match the guidance given during the fourth quarter. First-quarter guidance:Since then, conditions have deteriorated, and the November sales figures from Grainger and Fastenal weren't encouraging, either. Fastenal reported a 1.1% decline in daily sales compared to November 2014. Moreover, it experienced a 1.6% decline in manufacturing daily sales, with even nonresidential construction daily sales declining 5.1%, a point I will come back to later.It's a similar story with Grainger. On an adjusted basis (non-recurring Ebola-related and seasonal products), Grainger's U.S. sales declined 2% in November compared to the same period last year. Organic sales are a better way to judge growth, but even here, its organic sales (excluding foreign exchange and acquisitions) declined 3% in November. Don't expect too much from MSC Industrial.With that said, the company's guidance will be important. The market knows the industrial sector is slowing, and investors will be looking for any signs of recovery -- and when it happens, the industrial supply companies usually hear about it first.On a stock-specific note, MSC Industrial is undergoing an expansion strategy whereby infrastructural investments have been made to increase stores and head count (75% more field associates in the fourth quarter compared to the same period in 2013) while going for growth with national accounts. All these activities tend to be dilutive to operating margin.Indeed, as you can see in the following chart, MSC Industrial's margin was falling before the industrial slowdown in 2015, and particularly relative to its competitors. data by  .The third thing to look out for is the detail in its trading statistics. I would watch three factors:First, average transaction-size growth was in positive territory throughout 2015. In the last two years, the company's average transaction has increased 1.6% from the fourth quarter to the first. If the same thing happens this year, then average transaction size could be around $420 compared to the fourth quarter's $414.DATA SOURCE: MSC INDUSTRIAL DIRECT CO. INC. PRESENTATIONS. YEAR-OVER-YEAR COMPARISON.Second, total e-commerce sales fell on a sequential basis in the fourth quarter, and considering its importance as a growth platform, investors will want to see an improvement in the first quarter.Third, as you can see below, the company's manufacturing (around 70% of total revenue) sales growth has slowed, but so has its non-manufacturing. Considering Fastenal's disappointing November sales growth figures for nonresidential construction sales (see above), MSC Industrial's non-manufacturing sales could come under pressure.DATA SOURCE: MSC INDUSTRIAL DIRECT CO. INC. PRESENTATIONS.All told, in terms of the broader market, the company's guidance is probably more important than its sales figures in the coming report. In truth, industrial supply companies tend to have short sales cycles so their forward visibility is limited, but any sign of improvement through the quarter would be warmly received.On a stock basis, MSC Industrial followers will want to keep a close eye on the operational metrics outlined in the third section in order to monitor developing trends in the business.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

We have found that the overall market indication is more helpful for those investing or trading individual stocks. The score ranges from 1 to 5, with 5 representing a high warning level. The 2-4 range is acceptable for stock trading, with various levels of caution.Oscar improves trading results by taking some profits during good times and getting out of the market when technical risk is high. This is not market timing as we normally think of it, since it is not an effort to pick tops and bottoms and it does not go short. Instead, Oscar identifies and limits risk.

Take that money you pulled out on December 31 and celebrate.For the other 99%, it's time to grin and bear it a bit.

It's this diversification that allows the company to avoid damaging slowdowns in any one economic sector or segment.Fastenal's stock is down over 15% in the last year, despite a 14% growth rate in the past five years, and three consecutive years of earnings and free cash flow growth.With its continued solid free cash flow position, Fastenal has increased its annual dividend over the past five consecutive years, with an annualized 14.8% growth in the last three, and 12% since 2012 according to  .With a dividend yield of just under 2.9% and a 60% payout yield, investors should expect continued growth in the annual payouts.If you're looking for another reason to believe in the value of Fastenal, consider that Sequoia Fund, an owner of  (  ,  ) shares, has a large position in Fastenal.The bottom line on Fastenal is that it looks like a great nuts-and-bolts stock to keep in mind on any weakness.Further up the chain is this long-term buy that's similar to Fastenal, but on an even bigger scale…I've been enamored with  (  ) for  and with great reason: it's one of the steadiest  around.Grainger is a major distributor of facilities maintenance, industrial, and commercial supplies. The lineup includes pumps, motors, safety products, power tools and transmission systems, test instruments, and welding equipment.In fact, Grainger has more than 4,500 manufactures that supply it with over 1.4 million products for over 2 million customers. Grainger's worldwide market opportunity is worth over $380 billion, and it attacks that market with both brick and mortar outlets and distribution centers, and a thriving online ecommerce business which it expects to continue growing.Grainger is well positioned for that growth, as more than 15% of its ecommerce business comes in through mobile devices (according to its 2015  ).Despite its growth in revenues, earnings, and free cash flow, GWW is down over 20% in the last year ,and trades at just under 17 times trailing earnings.The company has raised its dividend for 46 consecutive years (a  ), and with a 2.4% dividend yield, investors should consider GWW any time they see an opportunity to pounce on this long-standing building block stock.Finally, we get to another back-to-basics stock with an even larger cast of products…Yet another Dividend Aristocrat that's taken it on the chin with a 10% one-year drop is multi-disciplined manufacturer/distributor  (  ).From its roots as a small machine shop operation in Chicago founded in 1912, ITW is now a $30 billion market cap giant operating through  , including automotive original equipment maker parts, food equipment, welding, construction products, test and measurement and electronics, and polymers and fluids.ITW's diversity is critical; no one segment accounts for more than 20% of total income. That's a very  to  (  ) and, like JNJ, it's served the company, and investors, quite well.To keep things streamlined, ITW has undergone some  -streamlining operations by merging business lines, cutting down on redundant operations and, in some cases, selling non-core assets.The result has been some ups and downs on the top and bottom lines the past two fiscal (December 31) years, but free cash flow remained strong throughout.Indeed, with just over $2 billion in operating cash flow (not to mention $3 billion in cash), ITW has maintained its 52-year string of consecutive annual dividend increases, with annual growth since 2012 at just under 15% and a recent 13.4% increase  in August.With a 2.62% dividend yield, management focused on continued cost cutting to keep expenses in line, and trading at well under 20 times trailing earnings, ITW is the last of our back-to-basic stocks to set your sights on amid the pullbacks and turmoil.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Don’t Panic! 3 Back-to-Basics Stocks to Buy For the Rebound@2016-01-13@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/dont-panic-3-back-basics-stocks-buy-rebound-2016-01-13

 released its sales figures for the month of November.November net sales rose 4.1% year over year to $298.2 million. Daily sales declined 1.1% to $14.9 million. Unfavorable currency impacted sales by 1.4% in the month, worse than the impact of 1.2% last month.The November sales growth rate was softer than that of October. The daily sales decline of 1.1% in November was also worse than the 0.8% decline in Oct 2015.This industrial and construction supplies wholesale distributor serves customers in the manufacturing as well as non-residential construction markets. Notably, both the end markets witnessed decelerating growth in the month.Daily sales to manufacturing customers declined 1.6%, wider than the 0.7% decrease in October.Daily sales to non-residential construction customers (representing 20% to 25% of revenues) also decreased 5.1%, worse than the 4.7% decline recorded in October.Though Fastenal's earnings per share and revenues increased year over year in the first three quarters of 2015, revenues softened significantly during the period. This was primarily due to weakness in the industrial fasteners business. Revenues were also hurt by lower sales to customers in the oil & gas industry, a stronger U.S. dollar, softness in the Canadian business and overall weakness in the industrial economy.Fastenal carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader building sector include Tecnoglass Inc.  , Builders FirstSource, Inc.  and The Home Depot, Inc.  .

" (  ) reported earnings yesterday, and I love reading the press releases. They are more like investor letters than they are press releases. I didn't even see one ""Adjusted EBITDA"" reference in the entire release-which is written in layman's terms instead of corporate jargon. Management's candidness and depth of discussion regarding the company's operating results is a breath of fresh air.So I thought I'd jot down a few notes and put it into a post. This is not really an analysis of the company, but more or less just a clipping of portions of the letter I thought were worth commenting on. It's mostly a summary of the press release, but I'd definitely recommend getting in the habit of reading these once a quarter. If nothing else, it's a respite from the typical corporate-speak that permeates most of what I find in the company filings I read.To briefly summarize, the company has an outstanding history of growth, but that growth has been challenged lately-in small part due to Fastenal's increasing size, but much more likely due to the significant difficulties in the heavy manufacturing and commodity-based businesses (who represent a sizable portion of Fastenal's customer base).Fastenal has always been able to grow throughout the business cycle, but this cyclical downturn is proving to be one of the more difficult periods that they've had to navigate so far.That said, to this point they are still squeaking out some growth:They think that revenue has been hit because their customers have felt the effects of a strong dollar, and of course the slowdown in the oil and gas business.Interestingly, they have been aggressively adding employees during this downturn. Fastenal has always felt that their employees are one of the largest competitive advantages they have. A knowledgeable, well-trained sales force that understands how to effectively engage with the customer base is an advantage that often doesn't show up directly in the numbers, but like the left tackle that is diligently and thanklessly protecting the quarterback all game, it's an invaluable part of the team.Fastenal has ramped up hiring:In addition to expanding the headcount, they plan to open an additional 60-75 stores (around a 2-3% increase in store count) in the next year.Fastenal management describes the company as two businesses:This is the business Fastenal started with 50 years ago. Fastenal is a distributor. They supply their customers with a variety of basic fasteners such as nuts, bolts, screws, washers, etc. The company sources these products from many different suppliers, and then sells to their more than 100,000 customers at a healthy markup (Fastenal's gross margins generally are around 50%). Fastenal's customers are usually the manufacturers at the end of the supply chain (farm manufacturers, oil producers, truckers, railroads, miners, etc.). The company also sells to non-residential construction contractors (plumbers, electricians, general contractors, etc.).Roughly half of this business is production/construction and the other half is maintenance. The production portion of this business is very cyclical, with 75% of the customers engaged in some type of heavy manufacturing. This business is struggling right now. Fastenal mentioned that although they are steadily adding new national accounts (large customers), 44 of its largest 100 customers are reducing their spending on Fastenal products, many because they are seeing significant revenue declines in their respective businesses and thus tightening the spending belt is a necessary result. This hurts Fastenal in the near term, although the company expects this cyclical capital spending to work in their favor once the recessionary conditions in the energy and mining businesses subside.But the downturn in commodities and the heavy manufacturing sector has caused growth in Fastenal's industrial production business to go negative:Fortunately for Fastenal, the sale of fasteners is a sticky business because it's difficult for customers to change their supplier relationships. This stickiness has probably even improved as Fastenal grows its vending machine business which primarily focuses on distributing non-fastener products (instead of candy bars, Fastenal is popping out tools, equipment, and other non-fastener products through vending machines at their customers' own facilities):With a Fastenal vending machine onsite at the customer's location, along with knowledgeable Fastenal employees providing service and product replenishment, this creates a resilient line of business for the company. In fact, they now have around 53,000 machines onsite at their customers' facilities-all doing an average of around $1000 per month of business (that's a $600 million business that grew 17% in the last year).Strong results from the industrial vending business is helping the non-fastener segment of Fastenal's business, but the overall segment has seen growth slow from 18% in the last half of 2014 to 6% growth in Q3:This non-fastener business is still growing, albeit at a much slower rate. And management says that they are still taking market share.Fastenal believes growth is impacted generally by three categories:My take is Fastenal is executing very well, as best as they can in this environment. So the latter two are the culprits. Currency fluctuations only impacted Fastenal's growth by 1.1%, so not a significant decline due to the weak Canadian dollar. However, Fastenal's US customers represent 89% of sales, and many of those customers are impacted by the strong US dollar. Fastenal is probably impacted much more indirectly by the strong US dollar than they are directly as a result of their Canadian operations.Sales to customers engaged in heavy manufacturing are estimated to be about 20% of overall FAST net sales. These businesses include the mining, agrictultural, and construction end markets, and all of these sectors have been hit hard by the bear market in oil and other commodity prices and a slowdown in construction and weak Chinese demand for heavy equipment.The Institute for Supply Management conducts monthly surveys of private sector companies to gauge the health of the manufacturing sector. The oft-cited Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) oscillates between 0 and 100 (spending most of its time between 40 and 60) and basically measures manufacturing expansion when readings are over 50 and contraction when the index drops below 50. The PMI can be thought of as a general barometer of the current strength or weakness in the buying power of Fastenal's customers that do business in the heavy manufacturing sector (again, approximately 20% of Fastenal's revenue is impacted here). The PMI has spent most of its time since the recession in the mid-high 50's but dropped to 50.2 in September, the lowest reading in three years:Who knows what economic conditions will look like in a year. I certainly don't. But the slowdown in the manufacturing sector has, for the first time, really affected Fastenal's top line growth.Fastenal is an outstanding business with moderate growth potential over the long run. They operate in a large and fragmented business and their scale, employee expertise (these sales guys know their products well), the sticky nature of their customer relationships, the thriftiness that management has toward expenses, the small ticket price of most of their products, the vending machine program (getting a spot on the customer's location is huge)-these are all attractive features to me about Fastenal's business.By the way, any Harvard MBA who claims that expense management and frugality is not a competitive advantage should read this: The Cheapest CEO in America. They should also pull up a long term chart of Fastenal stock price, and see how a company that sells nuts and bolts and keeps costs low somehow has been able to eat their competitor's lunch for decades.By keeping operating costs very low, Fastenal is able to pay their employees incrementally higher wages and thus more effectively develop and retain talented salespeople. The quality of service and depth of knowledge that the employees have eventually brings in more revenue, which grows the business and allows it to further lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenue, thus allowing for more hiring of top quality employees, which brings in more revenue, etc. Maybe an overlooked virtuous circle of sorts.I think that the business will continue to grind out steady profits and steady growth for a while to come. It might struggle to grow in the near term given the horrendous state of affairs in certain portions of the commodity-based industries and heavy machinery businesses. But I think over time these are normal aspects of just about every business cycle, and this isn't Fastenal's first rodeo. It is a very well-managed firm and will no doubt see this through.What is it worth? The company produced $401 million of operating cash flow in the last nine months. I'm not sure that the stock is a bargain at 20 times cash flow since:Should I be wrong on the latter, the stock is probably cheap. I'm not worried about the capital investments because those seem to be producing solid returns. But I would be concerned about the future growth of the overall company. They claim to operate in a $160 billion market, which implies a long runway ahead, but the larger they grow the more bumps in the road there are. As  a friend said, Fastenal used to be a meaningless portion of many of its customers' expense budgets, but if Caterpillar or some other struggling large heavy manufacturer now sees that it's paying $30 million to Fastenal, they may become more motivated to spend the time renegotiating that contract.Eventually, the recessionary conditions many of its customers are facing will subside, and Fastenal will get the benefit of a cyclical upswing. And Fastenal will certainly continue to execute well and grow revenue over a long period of time. I'm just uncertain how fast that growth rate will be, and so at this valuation I'm not sure there is a big margin of safety.That said, Fastenal has always exceeded expectations to this point (as evidenced by the fact that throughout history the stock has been too ""cheap"" most of the time-compounding at 23% per year since 1987):Quite the wealth creator over time. Since the IPO in the mid-80's, the stock has done better than BRK, MKL, WFC, WMT, AAPL, MTB and just about every other long term compounder out there.If anyone has comments on the business, valuation, future prospects, or anything else, feel free to engage.Thanks for reading.Read More: About GuruFocus: GuruFocus.com tracks the stocks picks and portfolio holdings of the world's best investors.

 is a national wholesale distributor of industrial and construction supplies. It distributes its products through company-owned stores mostly located in North America. The company has gradually grown from a fastener distributor to a full-line industrial supplier.After struggling in 2013, Fastenal's top line turned around in 2014 as underlying markets improved, vending revamped, sales improvement efforts yielded results and comparisons eased. However, sales slowed down again in 2015 due to currency headwinds, lower sales from oil & gas industry, severe weather conditions and overall weakness in industrial economy. Moreover, Fastenal's gross margins are contracting as management's focus shifts toward top-line improvement.Investors should also note the recent earnings estimate revisions for FAST, as the consensus estimate has been moving downwards. Moreover, FAST has a mixed history in earnings season. Fastenal has delivered in line earnings results in two of the last four quarters, making for an average positive surprise of 1.13%.Currently, FAST has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), but that could definitely change following Fastenal's earnings report which was just released. We have highlighted some of the key stats from this just-revealed announcement below: FAST beat on earnings. Our consensus earnings estimate called for EPS of $0.46/share, and the company reported EPS of $0.47. Investors should note that these figures take out stock option expenses. FAST reported revenues of $995.3 million. This missed our consensus estimate of $1.005 billion. Fastenal's total average daily sales growth rate was 1.5%, much less than 14.3% in the prior-year quarter.

 reported adjusted earnings of 47 cents per share in the third quarter of 2015 and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 46 cents by 2.2%. Earnings grew 4.4% year over year as a weak sales performance was offset by better pre-tax margins.Net sales of $995.3 million increased 1.5% year over year, but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.005 billion by almost 1%.However, sales slowed down significantly in the first three quarters of 2015. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company's top line was hurt due to lower sales to its customers in the oil & gas industry, a stronger U.S dollar and overall weakness in the industrial economy. Quarterly performance was also hurt by softness in net sales at the Canadian business, which increased about 6% in local currency during the quarter, compared to a 10% increase in the previous quarter.Fastenal's total average daily sales growth rate was 1.5% in the third quarter, much lower than 14.3% in the prior-year quarter. Foreign exchange dragged third-quarter daily sales growth rate by 1.4%. A strong dollar significantly hurt the company's export-related activities. Daily sales were hurt by minimal price increase of non-fastener products and price deflation of fastener products.Daily sales declined 0.3% in September, while it grew 1.6% in August and 3.2% in July. In comparison, the company recorded daily sales growth of 12.9%, 15% and 14.7%, respectively, in the corresponding year-ago months.This industrial and construction supplies wholesale distributor serves customers in manufacturing and non-residential construction markets. Both these end-markets witnessed moderating growth due to a weak industrial environment.Daily sales to manufacturing customers (representing almost 50% of revenues) grew 1.1%, down from 13.7% growth in the prior-year quarter and 3.8% in the previous quarter. Daily sales growth rates to manufacturing customers softened due to subdued sales of both fasteners and non-fasteners.Daily sales growth rate of fastener products (used mainly for industrial production and accounting for nearly 40% of the company's business) declined 4.4% in the quarter, much weaker than the flat results recorded in the previous quarter and a 9.9% increase in the year-ago quarter.Lower demand from the heavy machinery manufacturing customer base - mainly from those engaged in oil and gas business - hurt fastener sales as production requirements from this group declined. The heavy manufacturing business represents approximately one-fifth of the company's business.Non-fastener product sales (used mainly for maintenance) increased 5.9%, down from 17.6% growth in the prior-year quarter and 9% in the last quarter. The non-fastener business also weakened over the last few months as improved vending trends were offset by overall weakness in the industrial environment.In the non-residential construction market, daily sales to non-residential construction customers (representing 20% to 25% of revenues) declined 1.7%, down from a 9.3% increase in the prior-year quarter and 1.6% in the previous quarter. Slowdown in the energy sector also hurt sales in this market.As of Sep 30, 2015, Fastenal operated 53,547 vending machines, up 17.4% year over year. During the quarter, the company signed 4,689 machine contracts, down almost 9% from the last quarter. Daily sales growth rate to customers using vending machines was 4.8%, down from 8.6% in the previous quarter. Vending machines now account for 42.1% of the company's sales, higher than 40.9% in the prior quarter.After remaining soft in 2013, vending trends improved through 2014 and the first three quarters of 2015, as management's recent efforts on enhancing the quality of signings/installs paid off. Even though daily sales growth to customers using vending declined sequentially, percentage of vending customers and signings improved.Gross margin of 50.5% in the third quarter of 2015 declined 30 basis points (bps) year over year but increased 20 bps sequentially.Strong emphasis on growing average store sales is also pulling down gross margins. Under its Pathway-to-Profit initiative, Fastenal focuses on increasing the average store size (measured in terms of monthly sales). As the average store size increases, gross margins will decline due to a higher mix of larger customers which generate lower margins. However, lower supplier incentives due to softer net sales and tighter inventory levels drove the sequential improvement.However, a larger store size leads to better earnings leverage by spreading operating costs by higher sales, thereby improving pre-tax margins. This resulted in an improvement of 30 bps in pre-tax margins to 22% in the reported quarter.Some better-ranked stocks in the construction sector include Builders FirstSource, Inc.  , The Home Depot, Inc.  and Tempur Sealy International Inc.  .

I had a question on Fastenal (  ) - your thoughts on its net margins as the company pushes into non-fastener products and larger customers. And then maybe a little bit on Fastenal versus Grainger.I will start with the margins. There has been a lot of discussion around gross margin because Fastenal's average customer size has been ... its large customers have been growing faster than the rest of the business; so the gross margins have been coming down a little bit. Fastenal has gross margins north of 50%, which is almost unheard of in industrial distribution. Fastenal's operating margins are north of 21%, which is also highly unusual. I expect the gross margins to come down over time. But I expect the operating margin to rise over time. That is because it is more efficient to serve these larger customers. Management makes that argument on a quarterly basis when it reports its result. Management always tries to talk about how its average revenue per store is growing.When we first bought it, Fastenal was growing the store base rapidly. In its early days, Fastenal was growing its store base by over 30% a year and it was still growing by 14% when I joined the firm in 2006. That growth rate is now zero. So the company does not have a lot of low volume new stores depressing its margins. As a result, as the existing store base grows in terms of the average sales per store, those stores become more efficient.The second part of the question was how do we think about Fastenal versus Grainger. We like both businesses. We follow Grainger closely. It is an excellent business with a wide moat. Jim Ryan at Grainger has done a very good job. It is tempting to say we could own both of them. So far, we just own Fastenal, though.Do you find it more difficult today to find good stocks? Because it is lucky if you find one good stock a year. A Picasso sold this week for something astronomical. Why is it that wealth cannot find a good home in a stock and instead goes into art? It is harder and harder, it seems, to find - absent technology stocks - a good investment today. Am I wrong?Yes, it is definitely harder to find good stocks today. The market has gone up, has compounded 14% a year for the last five years through April 30. I think we are up about 17% a year over that time. That is roughly a doubling in stock prices. You cannot say that it is probable that we are going to compound at 17% over the next five years. No one knows how we will perform. But we are in an environment where more modest returns going forward are more likely than what we have seen in those five years.From  .Read More: About GuruFocus: GuruFocus.com tracks the stocks picks and portfolio holdings of the world's best investors.

n a response to one of my recent articles, a reader sent me a note asking how I define great management in a potential or existing investment.There are currently three major buckets in how I measure management's capabilities, performance and ethics. These are strategic and operational outcomes, compensation and intellectual honesty. I will go into further detail in each of these later, but for now, let me say we evaluate each prospective and existing management team with the following questions:So, how do you go about and measure whether management is someone you want to partner with? At the Nintai Charitable Trust, we use the following criteria to answer the four questions above.In this category we want to see specific data that shows management are utilizing a smart strategy and have a great handle on operations. Several items fall under this.M&A Activity : Most of the data suggests that M&A activity is a long-term detriment to a corporation's intrinsic value. Any activity on this front I like to be supported by measured milestones and investment metrics. In my career, I've generally found great management is far more successful in bolt-on acquisitions than industry or corporate changing events. A holding in the Nintai Charitable Trust -  (  ) - has done a great job ignoring the demands of investment bankers and steering clear of large M&A deals and taking on large amounts of debt.Operational Measures : Here I look for long-term management performance with an emphasis on 10-year returns. These include return on equity, return on capital, and return on capital vs. return of capital. The latter represents management's view on whether capital can be allocated internally for projects that will generate excellent returns or return the capital to shareholders in the form of dividends or stock buybacks. As Science of Hitting pointed out earlier this week, he looks for buybacks to take place at a discount to intrinsic value. We concur. NCT's holding  (  ) has done a great job focusing on operational returns with an eagle eye. With a five-year ROE of 26% and five-year ROC of 25%, management has generated great long-term returns for its investors.Compensation : The last 10 years has proven how difficult it is to align management's needs with shareholder needs when it comes to compensation. Everything from the stock options backdating scandal [1] to the growth of CEO pay has created a rather dismal picture of corporate governance. I'm not locked into any specific policy related to compensation, but I do have several criteria I think are important. First, management should not be rewarded for failure. It seems nearly every failed CEO leaves these days with a shocking golden parachute that would make the golden calf itself blush. Second, success should be defined by long-term value creation. Whether it is book value or some other measure, one thing it shouldn't be is tied to the company's stock price. Long-time NCT holding  (  ) has utilized incentive pay as well as operational margins to give bonuses to all staff. From top to bottom, staff is incentivized to create long-term value for the company.Perhaps the hardest thing to measure is management's intellectual honesty. What I mean by this is the acknowledgement of intellectual and emotional learnings gleaned through successes and failures. I look for this in public disclosures such as 10-Qs, 10-Ks, Annual Report commentary and quarterly conference calls. Second, I look for clear explanations in plain English that lay out the issues faced, options presented, decisions made and outcomes generated. Third, unequivocal acknowledgements of failure go a long way to building confidence in our investments. Last, it's great to hear from management learnings they've gleaned and how it has affected their strategy and management. An example of this is NCT's Fastenal that addresses specific questions about financials in both its quarterly calls and investor meetings. The company is open about mistakes it has made and what its learned from them.When you purchase a piece of a company, you are going into business with a management team chosen by your duly elected representatives (the board of directors). We think it's vital that as an owner you fully understand their abilities, skills, ethics and goals. More importantly, it is vital you have set criteria on which you can measure their performance. While there is no perfect process that can protect investors against poor management decisions, as investors, we can at least choose who we do business with in our portfolio.As always I look forward to your thoughts and comments.??????????????Mr. Macpherson serves as CIO of the Nintai Charitable Trust and Director of Marketing with Dorfman Value Investments. Much of his writing will consist of thoughts on the Nintai Charitable Trust portfolio. Unless otherwise stated, views represented in his articles are based on his role as CIO of the trust that he personally manages.[1]  was a leader in coverage of this story. In the end nearly 340 publicly traded companies were investigated. An example was Jeffrey Rich of Affiliated Computer Services (ACS is now part of  [XRX]).

"nvestors in Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST) saw new options become available today, for the January 2018 expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 830 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the FAST options chain for the new January 2018 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $37.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.50. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $37.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $33.50 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of FAST, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $38.71/share today.Because the $37.00 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 58%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 9.46% return on the cash commitment, or 4.16% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Fastenal Co., and highlighting in green where the $37.00 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $40.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.40. If an investor was to purchase shares of FAST stock at the current price level of $38.71/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $40.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 9.53% if the stock gets called away at the January 2018 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if FAST shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Fastenal Co., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing FAST's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $40.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $40.00 strike represents an approximate 3% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 51%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.20% boost of extra return to the investor, or 2.73% annualized, which we refer to as the  .The implied volatility in the put contract example is 23%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 27%.

"he  formula at  ranks a coverage universe of thousands of  , according to a proprietary formula designed to identify those stocks that combine two important characteristics - strong fundamentals and a valuation that looks inexpensive. Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST) presently has an excellent rank, in the top 25% of the coverage universe, which suggests it is among the top most ""interesting"" ideas that merit further research by investors.But making Fastenal Co. an even more interesting and timely stock to look at, is the fact that in trading on Monday, shares of FAST entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $36.73 per share. We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30. In the case of Fastenal Co., the RSI reading has hit 29.3 - by comparison, the universe of dividend stocks covered by  currently has an average RSI of 31.9. A falling stock price - all else being equal - creates a better opportunity for dividend investors to capture a higher yield. Indeed, FAST's recent annualized dividend of 1.12/share (currently paid in quarterly installments) works out to an annual yield of 2.86% based upon the recent $39.18 share price. A bullish investor could look at FAST's 29.3 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. Among the fundamental datapoints dividend investors should investigate to decide if they are bullish on FAST is its dividend history. In general, dividends are not always predictable; but, looking at the history chart below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue.

"ait - what?Yes, that's right. It may sound improbable that the man considered the greatest investor of all time would actively hope that any of his firm's stocks would struggle. But when you consider what Buffett wrote to Berkshire investors in his 2011 year-end letter, and the fact that U.S. Bancorp approved a $3 billion share buyback plan earlier this year, the strange idea starts to make sense: ""The logic is simple,"" Buffett wrote in that letter. ""If you are going to be a net buyer of stocks in the future, either directly with your own money or indirectly (through your ownership of a company that is repurchasing shares), you are hurt when stocks rise. You benefit when stocks swoon.""As usual, Buffett's logic is sound, and exemplifies the sort of value-minded contrarian thinking that sets him and other highly successful investors apart from the rest. If you hold shares of USB for the long term, you should want the firm to get as good a deal as possible on its shares (so long as its underlying business remains strong). That way, it can buy as many shares as possible for that $3 billion. And the more shares it repurchases, the more valuable the remaining outstanding shares -- your shares -- become.Of course, rooting against a stock that you own is as hard as it for a Red Sox fan to root for the Yankees. Buffett acknowledges that. ""Emotions,"" he says, ""too often complicate the matter: Most people, including those who will be net buyers in the future, take comfort in seeing stock prices advance. These shareholders resemble a commuter who rejoices after the price of gas increases, simply because his tank contains a day's supply.""For more than a decade, I have been running a computer model that mimics Buffett's approach (as outlined in the book Buffettology, written by Buffett's former daughter-in-law and colleague Mary Buffett). I use the model to choose stocks for the ""Patient Investor"" portfolio I track on my website, and since its late-2003 inception, the 10-stock, monthly rebalanced portfolio has outpaced the broader market, returning 141% (7.8% annualized) vs. the S&P 500's return of 97% (6.0% annualized; all figures through August 14).My Buffett-inspired strategy looks at a number of fundamental and financial criteria, generally seeking solid balance sheets, reasonable valuations, and a long track record of consistent performance. In addition, it offers bonus points for firms that have been buying back their own shares. Given the boom in share buybacks we've seen in recent years, you don't have to look very far for companies that are buying back their own stock, and several stocks that my Buffett-inspired model is high are in the midst of share repurchase plans. Though the very idea probably makes you cringe, these are the types of stocks you might want to buy, and then hope the market sours on them for a while. This Connecticut-based global financial data and analytical applications provider ($7 billion market cap) has increased earnings in every year of the past decade, one reason it gets high marks from my Buffett model. Two more: It has just $35 million in long-term debt vs. $233 million in annual earnings and has averaged a 10-year return on equity of 29.6% -- a sign of the ""durable competitive advantage"" Buffett likes his investments to have. FactSet repurchased $70.2 million worth of its shares during the last quarter, and had $212.7 million still authorized for further repurchases. The Minnesota-based company makes off-road vehicles (including all-terrain and side-by-side vehicles and snowmobiles) and on-road vehicles (including motorcycles and small electric vehicles). The $9-billion-market-cap firm increased its share repurchase program by four million shares earlier this year. Its fundamentals are quite Buffett-like: Polaris has averaged a return on equity of 42.1% over the past decade, part of why it gets strong interest from my Buffett-based model. The approach also likes that it has increased earnings per share in all but two years of the past decade, and has less debt ($399 million) than annual earnings ($464 million). Another Minnesota-based firm, Fastenal ($12 billion market cap) sells an array of industrial products, operating approximately 2,700 stores located primarily in North America with additional locations in Asia, Europe, Central and South America, and Africa. Fastenal has spent approximately $295 million buying back its stock in the last twelve months, saying that the valuation of the shares made it worth using some of its cash that way rather than on paying more dividends.My Buffett-based model sees a lot to like about Fastenal. The firm's EPS have dipped in just one year of the past decade; it has more than twice as much in annual earnings as it does in debt; and it has generated a 22.8% return on equity and a 20.9% return on retained earnings over the past decade. Cognizant is a provider of custom information technology, consulting and business process outsourcing services. The firm ($41 billion market cap) last year increased its stock repurchase program from $1.5 billion to $2.0 billion, and extended the term of the program to December 31, 2015.Cognizant gets high marks from my Buffett-based model. Its EPS have risen in every year of the past decade; it could pay off its $913 million in debt in less than a year, if it wanted to, given its $1.5 billion in annual earnings; and its 10-year average ROE is an impressive 20.8%. This Houston-based firm is a leading manufacturer of highly engineered offshore drilling and production equipment, which is well suited for use in deepwater, harsh environment and severe service applications. Earlier this year, the company announced that it had authorized a $100 million stock repurchase program with no set expiration date.Oil-related stocks have been hit quite hard by the oil price plunge we have seen over the past year, and Dril-Quip is no exception. But the stock has a number of Buffett-type fundamentals, including its lack of any long-term debt, its 15.2% return on retained earnings over the past decade, and its 8.6% earnings yield.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@When You Should Root Against Your Own Stocks@2015-08-18@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/when-you-should-root-against-your-own-stocks-2015-08-18

 reported adjusted earnings of 48 cents per share in the second quarter of 2015, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 47 cents by 2.1%. Earnings grew 9.1% year over year as the weak sales performance was offset by better pre-tax margins.Net sales of $997.8 million increased 5% year over year, but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.017 billion by 1.1%.After struggling in 2013, Fastenal's top line turned around in 2014 as underlying markets improved, vending re-vamped, sales improvement efforts yielded results and comparisons eased. In order to accelerate sales growth, Fastenal took the strategic decision to increase sales personnel at its stores which largely boosted sales in 2014.However, sales slowed down significantly in the first half of 2015 due to lower sales from the oil & gas industry and overall weakness in the industrial economy. Fastenal garners approximately 10% to 12% of its sales from stores located in the oil producing regions (Texas, Western Pennsylvania, Western Canada, etc.) where sales are being hurt by a slowing economy due to lower  .Fastenal's total average daily sales growth rate was 5% in the second quarter, much less than 12.1% in the prior-year quarter. Foreign exchange dragged second-quarter daily sales growth rate by 1%. A strong dollar significantly hurt the company's export related activity.Daily sales growth was 3.7% in June, 5.3% in May and 6.1% in April lower than 12.7%, 13.5% and 10% improvement, respectively, in the corresponding year-ago months.The industrial and construction supplies wholesale distributor serves customers in the manufacturing and non-residential construction markets. Both of these end markets witnessed moderating growth due to weak industrial environment.Daily sales to manufacturing customers (representing almost 50% of revenues) grew 3.8%, down from 11.2% growth in the prior-year quarter and 6.9% in the previous quarter. Daily sales growth rates to manufacturing customers softened due to subdued sales of both fasteners and non-fasteners.Daily sales growth rate of fastener products (used mainly for industrial production and accounting for nearly 40% of the company's business) remained flat in the quarter, much weaker than 5.5% improvement each in the previous and the year-ago quarter.Lower demand from heavy machinery manufacturing customer base - mainly from those engaged in oil and gas business - hurt fastener sales as this customer base contracted their production requirements. The heavy manufacturing business represents approximately one-fifth of the company's business.Non-fastener product sales (used mainly for maintenance) increased 9%, down from 17.1% growth in the prior-year quarter and 11.7% in the last quarter. The non-fastener business also weakened over the last six months as improved vending trends were offset by overall weakness in the industrial environment.In the non-residential construction market, daily sales to non-residential construction customers (representing 20% to 25% of revenues) grew 1.6%, down from 7.5% in the prior-year quarter as well as 6.2% in the previous quarter. Slowdown in the energy sector also hurt sales in this market.As of Jun 30, 2015, Fastenal operated 50,620 vending machines, up 15.7% year over year. During the quarter, the company signed 5,144 machine contracts, up almost 30% from the last quarter. Daily sales growth to customers using vending machines was 8.6%, down from 12.3% in the previous quarter. The vending machines now account for 40.9% of the company's sales, higher than 40.5% in the prior quarter.Vending trends improved through 2014 and the first half of 2015 after remaining soft in 2013 as management's recent efforts to improve the quality of signings/installs paid off. Even though the daily sales growth to customers using vending declined sequentially, the percentage of vending customers and signings improved.Gross margin in the second quarter declined 50 basis points (bps) both year over year and sequentially to 50.3%. Lack of inflation, unfavourable product mix (less fasteners which generate higher margins) and pricing and competitive pressures are affecting gross margins.A strong emphasis on growing average store sales is also pulling down gross margins. Under its Pathway-to-Profit initiative, Fastenal focuses on increasing the average store size (measured in terms of monthly sales). As the average store size increases, gross margins will decline due to higher mix of larger customers which generate lower gross margins.However, larger store size leads to better earnings leverage by spreading operating costs over higher sales and thereby improves pre-tax margins. This resulted in an 80 bps improvement in pre-tax margins to 22.6% in the reported quarter.The company recorded operating and administrative expenses (SG&A) of $276.6 million in the quarter, almost flat year over year.Fastenal has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

ooking at the universe of stocks we cover at  , in trading on Monday, shares of Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST) were yielding above the 3% mark based on its quarterly dividend (annualized to $1.12), with the stock changing hands as low as $36.73 on the day. Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return. To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) back on 12/31/1999 - you would have paid $146.88 per share. Fast forward to 12/31/2012 and each share was worth $142.41 on that date, a decrease of $4.67/share over all those years. But now consider that you collected a whopping $25.98 per share in dividends over the same period, for a positive total return of 23.36%. Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.6%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 3% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable. Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST) is an S&P 500 company, giving it special status as one of the large-cap companies making up the S&P 500 Index.In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Fastenal Co., looking at the history chart for FAST below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 3% annual yield.

 is set to report second-quarter 2015 results on Jul 14, before the market opens. Last quarter, Fastenal delivered a positive surprise of 2.38%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Fastenal's strategic decision to increase the number of sales personnel at its stores as well as district and regional leaders supporting stores drove revenues in 2014. However, in the first quarter, revenues were unfavorably impacted by poor weather in North America, economic softness, currency headwinds and lower sales from the oil & gas industry. Some of these headwinds are expected to continue in the soon-to-be reported quarter.In fact, monthly sales data released for April and May (included in the second quarter) show that though the top line improved in April, it declined sequentially in May. Daily sales grew 6.1% in April which softened to 5.3% in May,. Fastenal serves customers in the manufacturing and non-residential construction markets. Both end-markets witnessed decelerating growth in May.In addition, currency had an unfavorable impact of 0.9% in May, compared with negative 0.5% in April.Moreover, an unfavorable product mix, strong emphasis on growing average store sales, pricing and competitive pressure have been hurting the company's gross margin. The company expects gross margin to continue to decline in the upcoming quarters but operating margins are expected to improve somewhat on the back of improving SG&A leverage.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Fastenal is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below. The Earnings ESP is 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 47 cents. Fastenal's Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.We caution against stocks with Zacks Rank #4 and #5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some companies in the construction sector, that, according to our model have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Owens Corning  with an Earnings ESP of +1.89% and a Zacks Rank #1.KBR, Inc.  with an Earnings ESP of +32.14% and a Zacks Rank #1.Ryland Group Inc.  with an Earnings ESP of +9.59% and a Zacks Rank #3.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

his week, earnings season will get into full flow. We have become accustomed to that being a good thing for the stock market. Around two thirds of S&P 500 companies typically beat analysts’ estimates and the market reacts accordingly. In financial markets, however, consistent patterns are dangerous. When good news is the norm any deviation from that norm, no matter how small, can create an oversized reaction; a few prominent misses early in the season could cause a significant selloff. The question, then, is how likely are earnings to disappoint?With JP Morgan Chase (), Wells Fargo (), Bank of America (), Citigroup () and Goldman Sachs () all reporting in the next couple of days it is only natural that a lot of people will be focused on bank earnings this week. There are several reasons to think that, as conventional wisdom suggests, bank earnings will fit the pattern of positive “surprises”.The Fed is still providing banks with cheap money, and there are signs that credit requirements in many areas are gradually beginning to ease. As the chart below (from the Federation of Independent Businesses: reproduced in a Harvard Business School paper “The State of Small Business Lending…” by Karen Gordon Mills and Brayden McCarthy) indicates, small business owners’ perception of credit availability was almost back to normal by this time last year.Increased lending to small businesses and the higher interest rates associated with them, of course, increases profit margins for banks, and should be positive for earnings. The volatility that was common in equity, currency and commodity markets in the first quarter will presumably lead to reasonable trading profits as well.On the other side of the coin, a slowing housing market will be a drag, particularly on the likes of Wells Fargo who are prominent mortgage lenders. On balance, however, financials are likely to deliver what is expected and lean toward beats of some kind. The problem is that that will give a false sense of confidence. Anybody who paid attention to the chaos of 2008/9 and the subsequent return of Wall Street to big bonuses is only too aware of one thing; the fortunes of the big banks have very little bearing on the broader economy.A better indicator of overall economic health will come from other sectors. We will get a measure of the aforementioned slowdown in housing this week, when building products suppliers Grainger () and Fastenal () report. The bad weather in the first quarter will no doubt be a valid excuse to some extent if either or both of these companies disappoint, but any weakness in guidance would be a red flag for investors. The recovery in the housing market has been an essential part of the overall recovery and a significant slowdown would have serious consequences.On the tech side, commentary will presumably be focused on Netflix ()’ earnings on Wednesday, but once again, the broader significance of those results is questionable. Netflix is a remarkable success story. As the video rental business that was their base has died the company has reinvented itself and thrived. That is an amazing achievement but tells us nothing about the state of the economy. Look to a company like Advanced Micro Devices (), who report on Thursday for a more reliable indicator of overall economic strength or weakness.In short, smart investors will be looking beyond the headlines this week. While attention is focused on the banks and Netflix, none of those results will have any broader significance. If, as I suspect, we are approaching a quite major correction in US stocks, it will be as a result of uncertain real world economic conditions, both within the U.S. and globally. How much money bank trading desks have made and how many people are watching Pretty Little Liars will not tell us how likely that is.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Investors Should Look Beyond the Headlines This Week@2015-04-13@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/investors-should-look-beyond-headlines-week-2015-04-13

astenal Company (  ) is a national wholesale distributor of industrial and construction supplies. It distributes its products through company-owned stores mostly located in North America. The company has gradually grown from a fastener distributor to a full-line industrial supplier.Fastenal took the strategic decision to increase sales personnel at its stores in order to increase sales. Also vending trends improved throughout the year and the construction business showed signs of improvement. However, sales in January and February were hurt by currency headwinds, lower sales from oil & gas industry and severe weather conditions. Moreover, Fastenal's margins have been soft as management's focus shifts away to top-line improvement.Investors should also note the recent earnings estimate revisions for FAST, as the consensus estimate has been moving downwards. Moreover, FAST has a mixed history in earnings season. Fastenal has delivered in line earnings results in three of the last four quarters, making for an average negative surprise of 0.68%.Currently, FAST has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), but that could definitely change following Fastenal's earnings report which was just released.

"he  formula at  ranks a coverage universe of thousands of  , according to a proprietary formula designed to identify those stocks that combine two important characteristics - strong fundamentals and a valuation that looks inexpensive. Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST) presently has an excellent rank, in the top 25% of the coverage universe, which suggests it is among the top most ""interesting"" ideas that merit further research by investors.But making Fastenal Co. an even more interesting and timely stock to look at, is the fact that in trading on Wednesday, shares of FAST entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $39.55 per share. We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30. In the case of Fastenal Co., the RSI reading has hit 28.4 - by comparison, the universe of dividend stocks covered by  currently has an average RSI of 53.4. A falling stock price - all else being equal - creates a better opportunity for dividend investors to capture a higher yield. Indeed, FAST's recent annualized dividend of 1.12/share (currently paid in quarterly installments) works out to an annual yield of 2.73% based upon the recent $41.10 share price.A bullish investor could look at FAST's 28.4 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. Among the fundamental datapoints dividend investors should investigate to decide if they are bullish on FAST is its dividend history. In general, dividends are not always predictable; but, looking at the history chart below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue.According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, FAST makes up 1.32% of the First Trust NASDAQ-100 Ex-Technology Sector Index Fund ETF (Symbol: QQXT) which is trading lower by about 0.9% on the day Wednesday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Fastenal Enters Oversold Territory@2015-03-04@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/fastenal-enters-oversold-territory-2015-03-04

hares of Fastenal Company  declined around 1% since it announced soft February sales numbers on Mar 4, mirroring similarly weak results in January. Fastenal's share price has dipped around 14% this year.February net sales rose 8.6% year over year to $298.2 million. Daily sales grew 8.6% to $14.91 million, softer than 12% rise in January.In fact, the daily sales increase recorded in February was the slowest since April last year.

"nvestors in Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST) saw new options begin trading this week, for the April 17th expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the FAST options chain for the new April 17th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $39.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.05. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $39.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $37.95 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of FAST, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $39.75/share today.Because the $39.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 59%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.69% return on the cash commitment, or 22.36% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Fastenal Co., and highlighting in green where the $39.00 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $40.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.30. If an investor was to purchase shares of FAST stock at the current price level of $39.75/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $40.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 3.90% if the stock gets called away at the April 17th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if FAST shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Fastenal Co., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing FAST's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $40.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $40.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

"n Feb 16, we issued an updated research report on  (  ).On Jan 15, Fastenal reported mixed fourth-quarter 2014 results wherein earnings of 40 cents per share came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, earnings grew 21.2% year over year as higher sales and expense control offset gross margin weakness. Though sales marginally missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, it grew 13.8% year over year as underlying markets bettered, vending and construction trends improved, and comparisons eased.After struggling for several quarters, Fastenal's top line turned around in 2014. End-market slowdown and broader economic uncertainty were lowering fastener sales which, in turn, weighed down Fastenal's top line in 2013. In order to accelerate sales growth, the company took the strategic decision to increase sales personnel at its stores which largely boosted sales in 2014.Importantly, easy comparisons from a relatively weaker 2013 also contributed to the sales growth rates in 2014. In fact, fasteners recovered slightly in 2014 after struggling in 2013. Moreover, vending trends improved in all the quarters of 2014 and the construction business showed signs of improvement.However, Fastenal's margins are contracting as management's focus shifts away to top-line improvement. Lack of inflation, unfavorable product mix (less fasteners which generate higher margins), pricing and competitive pressures are hurting gross margins despite gradual top-line improvement. Fastenal's 2014 gross margins dropped to 50.8% from 51.7% in 2013 and 51.5% in 2012.Increase in average store size is also pulling down gross margins as larger stores have greater business with larger customers generating lower gross margins. Gross margins at the largest stores are below the company average. However, operating margins at the largest stores are 450 basis points (bps) above the company average. This led to 110 bps improvement in pre-tax margins to 20.4% in the fourth quarter.A larger store size leads to better earnings leverage by spreading operating costs over higher sales, thereby improving pre-tax margins. Consistent with Fastenal's ""Pathway to Profit"" strategy, management strongly emphasizes on increasing the store size as they have higher operating/pre-tax margins.Management warned that gross margin could fall ""closer to 50%"" over time as the average monthly store size rises from $100,000 to $160,000 during the next few years. However, as the store size increases, operating/pre-tax margins should continue to improve.Also, during the fourth-quarter conference call, management warned that sales at stores located in the oil producing regions (Texas, Western Pennsylvania, Western Canada, etc.) are expected to be hurt in the near term by the slowing economy due to lower oil prices. Approximately 10% to 12% of Fastenal's sales were from stores located in these states. However, management is expecting to balance the lost sales with lower fuel costs resulting from the dip in oil prices.Overall, continued top-line momentum coupled with better operating margins under the Pathway to Profit strategy should offset the lower gross margins to drive EPS growth in 2015. However, pricing gains are likely to remain subdued in the current low-inflation environment.Fastenal carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the broader building sector are Lowe's Companies Inc. (  ), Masco Corp. (  ) and Headwaters Inc. (  ).

" 's (  ) adjusted earnings of 40 cents per share in the fourth quarter of 2014 were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Earnings grew 21.2% year over year driven by improved sales and higher pre-tax profits.Fastenal reported net sales of $926.3 million, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $938 million by 1.2%. Net sales, however, increased 13.8% year over year as underlying markets bettered, vending and construction trends improved, and comparisons eased.Despite improvement in sales and pre-tax margins, gross margins remained weak.Fastenal's total average daily sales growth rate was 15.7%, up from 7.5% in the prior-year quarter, owing to increase in sales volume. However, foreign exchange dragged third-quarter daily sales growth rate by 0.6%.Daily sales growth was 14.6% in October, 15.3% in November and 17.4% in December, much higher than a respective 7.7%, 8.2% and 6.7% in the corresponding prior-year months.Daily sales to manufacturing customers (representing almost 50% of revenues) grew 13.8%, higher than 7.2% in the prior-year quarter. Daily sales growth rates to manufacturing customers improved as fasteners as well as non-fastener sales increased during the quarter.The daily sales growth rates of fastener products (used mainly for industrial production and accounting for over 40% of the company's business) were 11.4%, better than 1.9% in the comparable year-ago quarter due to easier comparisons.Sales to customers engaged in light and medium-duty manufacturing are improving. The heavy manufacturing business (approximately one-fifth of the company's business) also improved in 2014 after suffering in 2013. A major portion of the heavy manufacturing business is fastener driven.Non-fastener product sales (used mainly for maintenance) increased 19%, up from 12% in the prior-year quarter and 17.6% in the last quarter. The non-fastener business picked up due to improvement in the industrial vending business.In the non-residential construction market, daily sales to non-residential construction customers (representing 20% to 25% of revenues) grew 12.6%, up from 2.8% in the prior-year quarter and 9.3% in the previous quarter due to improvement in construction trends.As of Dec 31, 2014, the company operated 46,855 vending machines (irrespective of the type of machine), up 2.8% sequentially and 14.9% year over year. During the quarter, the company signed 4,108 machine contracts, up 0.9% sequentially. Daily sales growth to customers using vending machines was 20%, down from 21.9% in the earlier quarter. The vending machines now account for 39.3% of the company's sales, higher than 37.8% last quarter.Vending trends have been improving through 2014 after remaining soft in 2013 as management's recent efforts to improve the quality of signings/installs seems to be yielding results. Even though number of customers using vending declined sequentially, percentage of vending customers and signings improved.In the fourth quarter, gross margin declined 10 basis points (bps) year over year and 30 bps sequentially to 50.5%.Fastenal's gross margins are contracting as management's focus shifts toward top-line improvement. Additionally, lack of inflation, an unfavorable product/customer mix, pricing and competitive pressures are hurting gross margins despite gradual improvement in the top line.Moreover, the fourth quarter is seasonally the softest as sales slow down during the holiday months of November and December. Construction activity also softens during this time. The softer sales result in lower utilization of Fastenal's trucking network which hurt gross margins.Increase in average store size is also pulling down gross margins as larger stores have greater business with larger customers generating lower gross margins. Gross margins at the largest stores are roughly 90 bps below the company average. However, operating margins at the largest stores are 350 bps above the company average.Accordingly, consistent with its ""Pathway to Profit"" strategy, management strongly emphasizes on increasing the store size as they have higher operating margins. This led to a 110 bps improvement in pre-tax margins to 20.4% in the quarter despite higher employee-related costs.Fastenal's earnings of $1.67 per share in fiscal 2014 increased 10.6% year over year and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.66 by a penny. The company reported net sales of $3.73 billion, up 12.2% year over year. The net sales slightly missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.74 billion.Fastenal's gross margins in 2014 dropped to 50.8% from 51.7% in 2013 and 51.5% in 2012.Fastenal carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

 is set to report first quarter 2015 results on Apr 14, before the market opens.Last quarter, Fastenal delivered in-line results as a strong top-line performance was offset by weaker margins. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Fastenal took the strategic decision to increase sales personnel at its stores in order to increase sales. This strategy largely boosted sales during 2014. Also vending trends improved throughout the year and the construction business showed signs of improvement.However, monthly sales data released for January and February (included in the first quarter) shows that the top-line improvement has weakened. Daily sales grew 8.6% in February and 12% in January much softer than 17.4% in December 2014. In fact, the daily sales increase recorded in February as the slowest since April last year.We believe that sales in these months were hurt by currency headwinds, lower sales from the oil & gas industry and severe weather conditions.During the fourth-quarter conference call held in January, management noted that approximately 10% to 12% of sales were from stores located in oil producing regions (Texas, Western Pennsylvania, Western Canada and others). Management warned that sales in these states are expected to be hurt by slowing economy due to lower  .These headwinds are expected to be reflected in the overall results of the first quarter of 2015.As it is, Fastenal's gross margins are contracting as management's focus shifts toward top-line improvement. Additionally, lack of inflation, an unfavorable product/customer mix, pricing and competitive pressures are hurting gross margins.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Fastenal is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below. The ESP for Fastenal is -2.38% as the Most Accurate estimate stands at 41 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is higher at 42 cents. Fastenal's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.We caution against stocks with Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some other companies in the construction sector for investors to consider, that, according to our model have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Plum Creek Timber Co. Inc.  with Earnings ESP of +4.55% and a Zacks Rank #3.Installed Building Products, Inc.  with Earnings ESP of +10.00% and a Zacks Rank #3.Watsco Inc.  with Earnings ESP of +3.39% and a Zacks Rank #3.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

astenal Company (  ) is a national wholesale distributor of industrial and construction supplies. It distributes its products through company-owned stores mostly located in North America. The company has gradually grown from a fastener distributor to a full-line industrial supplier.After struggling for several quarters, Fastenal's top line turned around in 2014 as underlying markets improved, vending re-vamped, sales improvement efforts showed results and comparisons eased. However, Fastenal's margins are contracting as management's focus shifts away to top-line improvement. An unfavorable product mix, pricing and competitive pressures are hurting gross margins.Investors should also note the recent earnings estimate revisions for FAST, as the consensus estimate has been moving higher. Moreover, FAST has a mixed history in earnings season. Fastenal has delivered in line earnings results in two of the last four quarters, making for an average negative surprise of 0.06%.Currently, FAST has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), but that could definitely change following Fastenal's earnings report which was just released.

 (  ) is set to report fourth-quarter and full year 2014 results on Jan 15, before the market opens.Last quarter, Fastenal delivered in-line results as a strong top-line performance was offset by weaker margins. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.After struggling for several quarters, Fastenal's top line turned around in the first quarter of 2014 and continued into the second and third quarters. End-market slowdown and broader economic uncertainty were lowering fastener sales which, in turn, weighed down Fastenal's top line. In order to accelerate sales growth, Fastenal took the strategic decision to increase sales personnel at its stores which largely boosted sales during the year. Importantly, easy comparisons from a relatively weaker 2013 also contributed to the sales growth rates in 2014. In fact, fasteners recovered slightly in 2014 after struggling in 2013. Moreover, vending trends improved in all the quarters of 2014 and the construction business is showing signs of improvement.The monthly sales data released for October and November (included in the fourth quarter) shows that the top-line improvement continues. Daily sales grew 14.6% in October and 15.3% in Nov. In fact, the industrial and construction supplies wholesale distributor has recorded eight consecutive months of double-digit growth in daily sales.However, Fastenal's margins are contracting as management's focus shifts away to top-line improvement. An unfavorable product mix, pricing and competitive pressures are hurting gross margins. In fact, management apprehends gross profit to be soft in the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter is seasonally the softest as sales slow down during the holiday months of November and December. Construction activity also softens during this time. The softer sales result in lower utilization of Fastenal's trucking network which can hurt gross margins.Moreover, management has been slowing down store growth to increase headcount to drive near-term sales. Such initiatives increase employee costs. Higher store headcount and field leadership as well as higher investments behind vending are increasing operating costs, thus dragging pre-tax margins. The accelerated hiring pace continued in the fourth quarter, which could further pressure margins.Despite the top-line improvement, the margin pressures keep us concerned.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Fastenal is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below. The Earnings ESP is 0.00%. Fastenal's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) when combined with a 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some other companies in the building sector for investors to consider, that, according to our model have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:PulteGroup, Inc.(  ), with Earnings ESP of +2.44% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Armstrong World Industries, Inc.

tocks were cautiously higher Monday with today's gains vulnerable to profit-taking pressure as investors cast a nervous eye on political instability in Greece and lingering pressure on the Russia economy after disappointing economic data from the world's ninth largest economy. After closing higher for seven straight days, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has turned slightly lower this afternoon, trailing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite index following declines for Dow components IBM (  ) and Microsoft (  ).Economic data was very light as the final few days of 2014 kicked off with the Dallas Fed manufacturing index falling to 4.1 in December from November's 10.5 reading, exceeding the 1.0-point slide market experts had expected. The production index improved to a 15.8 reading this month from 6.0 in November.European markets were on the defensive overnight ahead of Greek parliamentary elections that not only could threaten the country's nascent economic recovery but also the integrity of the European Union. After Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samara's choice for president was defeated, the government now faces a snap election against anti-austerity party Syriza, which currently leads in opinion polls against Samara's New Democracy Party. Syriza's platform includes abandoning austerity measures and wiping out a large part of its nation debt, both of which could threaten its EU membership.Meanwhile, the Russian economy continues to buckle under the pressure of economic sanctions and free-falling  . The Economy Ministry said Russian GDP contracted 0.5% last month for its first decline in five years and possibly a harbinger of an upcoming recession.

"n the latest look at the underlying components of the S&P 500 ordered by largest market capitalization, Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST) has taken over the #319 spot from Chesapeake Energy Corp. (Symbol: CHK), according to  .Market capitalization is an important data point for investors to keep an eye on, for various reasons. The most basic reason is that it gives a true comparison of the value attributed by the stock market to a given company's stock. Many beginning investors look at one stock trading at $10 and another trading at $20 and mistakenly think the latter company is worth twice as much - that of course is a completely meaningless comparison without knowing how many shares of each company exist. But comparing market capitalization (factoring in those share counts) creates a true ""apples-to-apples"" comparison of the value of two stocks. In the case of Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST), the market cap is now $13.30 billion, versus Chesapeake Energy Corp. (Symbol: CHK) at $13.20 billion.Below is a chart of Fastenal Co. versus Chesapeake Energy Corp. plotting their respective size rank within the S&P 500 over time (FAST plotted in blue; CHK plotted in green):    Below is a three month price history chart comparing the stock performance of FAST vs. CHK:Another reason market capitalization is important is where it places a company in terms of its size tier in relation to peers - much like the way a mid-size sedan is typically compared to other mid-size sedans (and not SUV's). This can have a direct impact on which mutual funds and ETFs are willing to own the stock. For instance, a mutual fund that is focused solely on Large Cap stocks may for example only be interested in those companies sized $10 billion or larger. Another illustrative example is the S&P MidCap index which essentially takes the S&P 500 index and ""tosses out"" the biggest 100 companies so as to focus solely on the 400 smaller ""up-and-comers"" (which in the right environment can outperform their larger rivals). So a company's market cap, especially in relation to other companies, carries great importance, and for this reason we at  find value to putting together these rankings daily.According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, FAST and CHK collectively make up 1.70% of the Guggenheim Insider Sentiment ETF (  ) which is higher by about 0.5% on the day Tuesday.At the closing bell, FAST is up about 1%, while CHK is off about 1.1% on the day Tuesday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Fastenal Takes Over #319 Spot From Chesapeake Energy@2014-12-02@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/fastenal-takes-over-319-spot-chesapeake-energy-2014-12-02
" (  ) hit a 52-week low on Oct 10, the day it reported the third-quarter 2014 results. Though the industrial and construction supplies wholesale distributor outperformed on the top line front, its margin weakness continued.Despite sales growing 14.3% year over year and beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the stock lost almost 5% on Oct 10 as it lowered the long-term gross margin expectations.In the third quarter, gross margin declined 90 basis points (bps) year over year to 50.8%. Pre-tax margins declined 30 bps to 21.7%. Gross margins remained flat sequentially but missed management's expectations. Management predicted near-term gross margins to remain at the lower end of its long-term guidance range 51-53%. In fact, management updated the long-term gross margin range to ""around 51% from 51%-53%"" at the third quarter conference call, which propelled the stock decline, in our view.Fastenal's margins are contracting as management's focus shifts toward top-line improvement. Additionally, an unfavorable product/customer mix, pricing and competitive pressures are hurting gross margins despite gradual improvement in the top line. Fastenal's gross margins in the first nine months of 2014 dropped just below 51%.Moreover, management has been slowing down store growth in order to increase headcount to drive near-term sales. Such initiatives increase employee costs. Higher store headcount and field leadership as well as higher investments behind vending are increasing operating costs, thus dragging pre-tax margins. Fastenal's employee-related costs shot up to 11% of sales in the first nine months of 2014 compared with 4.7% in the same period of 2013.The accelerated hiring pace will continue through the rest of the year, which could further pressure margins. At the conference call, management announced plans to increase labor at the stores at a rate of about 10% more hours which translates to about 5% or 6% higher labor cost plus commissions.Fastenal carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Other stocks in the building sector worth considering are Home Depot, Inc. (  ), Lowe's Companies Inc. (  ) and Vulcan Materials Company (  ). While Vulcan Materials sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Home Depot and Lowe's have the same Zacks Rank as Fastenal.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

n Nov 5, we issued an updated research report on  (  ).On Oct 10, Fastenal reported third-quarter 2014 results wherein earnings of 45 cents per share came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, earnings grew 12.5% year over year as a strong top-line performance was partially offset by weak margins. Sales beat the consensus mark and improved 14.3% year over year.After struggling for several quarters, Fastenal's top line turned around in the first quarter of 2014 and maintained the momentum into the second and third quarters. End-market slowdown and broader economic uncertainty were lowering fastener sales which, in turn, weighed down Fastenal's top line.In order to accelerate sales growth, Fastenal took the strategic decision to increase sales personnel at its stores which largely boosted sales during the year. Importantly, easy comparisons from a relatively weaker 2013 also contributed to the sales growth rates in 2014. In fact, fasteners recovered slightly in 2014 after struggling in 2013. Moreover, vending trends improved in all the quarters of 2014 and the construction business is showing signs of improvement.However, Fastenal's margins are contracting as management's focus shifts away to top-line improvement. An unfavorable product mix, pricing and competitive pressures are hurting gross margins. In fact, management lowered its long-term gross margin expectation following the third-quarter results.Moreover, management has been slowing down store growth to increase headcount to drive near-term sales. Such initiatives increase employee costs. Higher store headcount and field leadership as well as higher investments behind vending are increasing operating costs, thus dragging pre-tax margins. Fastenal's employee-related costs shot up to 11% of sales in the first nine months of 2014 compared with 4.7% in the comparable period last year.The accelerated hiring pace will continue through the rest of the year, which could further pressure margins. At the third-quarter conference call, management announced its plans to increase labor at the stores at a rate of about 10% more hours which translates to about 5% or 6% higher labor cost plus commissions.Despite the top-line improvement, the margin pressures keep us concerned.Fastenal carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

 (  ) adjusted earnings of 45 cents per share in the third quarter of 2014 were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Earnings grew 12.5% year over year as strong top-line performance was offset by weak gross margins.Based in Winona, MN, Fastenal reported net sales of $980.8 million in the third quarter, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $979 million by 0.2%. Net sales were up 14.3% year over year, owing to higher sales volume. Net sales were driven by higher prices of non-fastener products, partially offset by lower prices of fastener products.Fastenal's total average daily sales growth rate in the reported quarter was 14.3%, up from 5.3% in the prior-year quarter, owing to increase in sales volume. However, foreign exchange dragged third-quarter daily sales growth rate by 0.3%.Daily sales growth was 14.7% in July, 15.0% in August and 12.9% in September, much higher than a respective 2.9%, 7.2% and 5.7% in the corresponding prior-year months.After struggling for several quarters, Fastenal's top line turned around in the first quarter of 2014 and continued into the second and the third quarters. End-market slowdown and broader economic uncertainty were lowering fastener sales which, in turn, weighed down Fastenal's top line.In order to accelerate sales growth, Fastenal took the strategic decision to increase sales personnel at the stores which largely aided sales this year. Importantly, easy comparisons from a relatively weaker 2013 also boosted sales growth rates in 2014. Moreover, vending trends have improved in all the three quarters of 2014 and the construction business is showing signs of improvement.Daily sales to manufacturing customers (representing almost 50% of revenues) grew 13.7% in the third quarter, higher than 4.7% in the prior-year quarter. Daily sales growth rates to manufacturing customers improved as fasteners as well as non-fastener sales improved in the quarter.The daily sales growth rates of fastener products (used mainly for industrial production and accounting for over 40% of the company's business) were 9.9% in the quarter, better than 1.0% in the prior-year quarter due to easier comparisons.Sales to customers engaged in light and medium-duty manufacturing are improving. The heavy manufacturing business (approximately one-fifth of the company's business) which suffered in 2013, consistently improved through the past three quarters of 2014.Non-fastener product sales (used mainly for maintenance) increased 17.6% in the third quarter of 2014, up from 8.9% in the prior-year quarter and 17.1% in the last quarter. The non-fastener business picked up due to improvement in the industrial vending business.In the non-residential construction market, daily sales to non-residential construction customers (representing 20% to 25% of revenues) grew 9.3% in the third quarter of 2014, up from 3.9% in the prior-year quarter and 7.5% in the previous quarter due to improvement in construction trends.As of Sep 30, 2014, the company operated 45,596 vending machines (irrespective of the type of machine), up 4.2% sequentially and 16.4% year over year. During the quarter, the company signed 4,072 machine contracts, down 1.6% sequentially. Daily sales growth to customers using vending machines was 21.9% in the third quarter, up from 20.9% in the second quarter and 15.2% in the prior-year quarter. The vending machines now account for 37.8% of the company's sales, higher than 37.0% last quarter.Vending trends have been improving through 2014 after remaining soft in 2013 as management's recent effort to improve the quality of signings/installs seems to be working.In the third quarter, gross margin declined 90 basis points (bps) year over year to 50.8% due to an unfavorable product mix (lower sales in higher margin fastener products) and focus on improving average store sales. Gross margins remained flat sequentially and missed the company's long-term guidance range 51%-53% as its focus shifted toward improving revenues.Management warned that near-term gross margins could remain at the lower end of the long-term range or even below, due to the company's emphasis on improving sales.Fastenal expects to open 25-30 stores in total in 2014 at a rate of 1%, compared to the prior expectation of 30-40 stores at a rate of approximately 1-2%.The company apprehends gross profit to be soft in the upcoming forth quarter on expectations of lower sales owing to the upcoming holiday season and the prevailing weakness in the construction business.Fastenal carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Investors interested in the same and related sector could also consider stocks like Armstrong World Industries, Inc. (  ), The Home Depot, Inc. (  ) and Lowe's Companies Inc. (  ), all of which have a similar Zacks Rank #2.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

he share price of  (  ) has increased about 3% since the company announced its acquisition of assets of Av-Tech Industries on Oct 1. Av-Tech Industries is a wholesale distributor of aerospace fasteners, military, commercial and aerospace hardware, electronic components as well as miscellaneous aircraft partsThe latest acquisition will help Fastenal expand its fastener distribution business to the aerospace market, which will eventually drive its top-line growth in the long run.After struggling for several quarters, Fastenal's top line rebounded in the first half of 2014. End-market slowdown and the broader economic uncertainty were lowering fastener sales which, in turn, dragged the company's top line in 2013. In order to accelerate sales growth, Fastenal took the strategic decision to increase sales personnel at the stores, which largely boosted sales this year. Moreover, easy comparisons from a relatively weak 2013 contributed to the sales growth rates in 2014. In fact, revenues from fasteners also recovered slightly in the first half after being sluggish in 2013. Moreover, vending trends improved in both the quarters of 2014 and the construction business is showing signs of improvement as well.Currently, Fastenal carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Based in Winona, MN, Fastenal Company has gradually grown from a fastener distributor to a full-line industrial supplier. The company has widened its product offering to include an internal manufacturing division, government sales, Internet sales, metalworking and industrial vending. Fastenal has also built a national accounts team, which is dedicated to serving corporate customers. Its non-fasteners products now constitute close to 60% of its sales.Investors interested in the same sector could consider stocks like Gibraltar Industries, Inc. (  ), The Home Depot, Inc.

 (  ) is set to report third-quarter fiscal 2014 results on Oct 10, before the market opens.Last quarter, Fastenal reported in-line results as a strong top-line performance was offset by weaker margins. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.After struggling for several quarters, Fastenal's top line turned around in the first half of 2014. End-market slowdown and a broader economic uncertainty were lowering fastener sales that in turn, weighed on the company's revenues in 2013. In order to accelerate sales growth, Fastenal took the strategic decision to increase sales personnel at the stores, which largely boosted sales this year. Notably, easy comparisons from a relatively weaker 2013 also contributed to the sales growth rates in 2014. In fact, fasteners also recovered slightly in the first half after struggling in 2013. Moreover, vending trends improved in both the quarters of 2014 and the construction business is showing signs of improvement.The monthly sales data released for July and August (included in the third quarter) shows that the top-line improvement continues. Daily sales grew 15% in August and 14.7% in July. In fact, the industrial and construction supplies wholesale distributor has recorded six consecutive months of double-digit growth in daily sales.However, Fastenal's margins are contracting as management's focus shifts toward top-line improvement. Additionally, an unfavorable product mix, pricing and competitive pressures are hurting gross margins despite gradual improvement in the top line. Moreover, management has been slowing down store growth in order to increase headcount to drive near-term sales. Such initiatives increase employee costs. Higher store headcount and field leadership as well as higher investments behind vending are increasing operating costs, thus dragging pre-tax margins. The accelerated hiring pace is anticipated to continue through the rest of the year, which could further pressure margins.In fact, management has stated that near-term gross margins could remain at the lower-end of the long-term range or even below due to the company's emphasis on improving sales.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Fastenal is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below. The Earnings ESP is 0.00%. Fastenal's Zacks Rank #2 (Hold), when combined with a 0.00%, ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some other companies in the building sector for investors to consider, that, according to our model have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Home Depot, Inc.(  ), with Earnings ESP of +0.89% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Lowe's Companies Inc.

" (Revised)The 2014 Q3 earnings season takes center stage this week with  (  ) release after the close on Wednesday. Alcoa isn't the first to report quarterly results, though it is the first S&P 500 member with the calendar fiscal quarter to come out with results. Companies with fiscal quarters ending in August have been reporting since mid-September and the tally of such Q3 reports already totals 22 S&P 500 members. In fairness to Alcoa, however, investors start paying attention to the earnings season after their earnings announcement.It is way too early to draw even preliminary conclusions from the results thus far. But the results thus far aren't materially different from what we have seen from the same group of 22 companies in other recent quarters. The table below shows the scorecard for the 22 companies that have reported results already.The earnings calendar is on the light side, with only about 30 companies reporting quarter results, including 9 S&P 500 members. But as you can see in the updated weekly earnings calendar below, the reporting cycle ramps up in a big way the following week.This earnings season will give us a good sense of whether the profitability strength on display in the last reporting cycle was a one-off event or the start of something enduring. Please recall that part of the Q2 strength was a bounce back from the extremely low levels to which all activity levels had fallen in the weather-disrupted first quarter of the year. As such, one could argue that none of the last two earnings seasons represented truly normal conditions, which we will most likely see for the first time this year only in Q3.The table below shows a summary picture of current Q3 expectations compared to what was actually achieved in Q2. As you can see, total earnings are expected to be up +1.5% from the same period last year on +1.8% higher revenues and modest margin gains. Finance remains a big drag this quarter, with total earnings for the sector expected to be down -3.9% from the same period last year. Excluding Finance, total earnings for the S&P 500 would be up +2.8%.As has been the trend each quarter ahead of the start of the earnings season, estimates for Q3 have come down as well as the quarter unfolded. The recent leg down in estimates has mostly been due to  (  ), with the bank's settlement with the government causing its Q3 EPS estimates to drop from positive 32 cents to the current 8 cents loss. In dollar terms, that's a $4.2 billion negative swing in Bank of America's Q3 earnings estimates.The chart below shows estimates for 2014 Q3 have evolved over the last 10 or so weeks.The negative revisions trend has been broad based, with most sectors suffering downward adjustments in estimates. But the trend has been most pronounced for Oil/Energy, Retail, and Conglomerates. The chart below shows the sectors with the biggest revisions. The Finance sector swing is primarily due to Bank of America.Total earnings for the S&P 500 reached an all-time quarterly record in 2014 Q2 and current estimates for Q3 put the quarterly total as the second highest ever. But given the historical trend of roughly two-thirds of the companies beating earnings estimates, the final Q3 tally will likely be right in the preceding quarter's record vicinity. The chart below shows that current consensus estimates reflect record tallies in the following quarters.For these estimates to hold, we need an improvement on the guidance front, which has been persistently been weak for almost two years now. There was modest improvement in tone of management guidance on the Q2 earnings calls, but the majority of companies providing guidance still guided lower.Given the global growth worries, it is likely that the quality and quantity of guidance will deteriorate even further this earnings season. Importantly, continued negative guidance will effectively guarantee that we will see a repeat of negative estimate revisions, with estimates for Q4 coming down as earnings season unfolds.That said, continuation of even the modest improvement in guidance will be a net positive in the overall earnings picture. :  : For a complete analysis of 2014 Q3 estimates, please check out weekly  .*Disclaimer:

As you can see, total earnings are expected to be up +1.5% from the same period last year on +1.8% higher revenues and modest margin gains. Finance remains a big drag this quarter, with total earnings for the sector expected to be down -3.9% from the same period last year. Excluding Finance, total earnings for the S&P 500 would be up +2.8%.As has been the trend each quarter ahead of the start of the earnings season, estimates for Q3 have come down as well as the quarter unfolded. The recent leg down in estimates has mostly been due to  (  ), with the bank's settlement with the government causing its Q3 EPS estimates to drop from positive 32 cents to the current 8 cents loss. In dollar terms, that's a $4.2 billion negative swing in Bank of America's Q3 earnings estimates.The chart below shows estimates for 2014 Q3 have evolved over the last 10 or so weeks.The negative revisions trend has been broad based, with most sectors suffering downward adjustments in estimates. But the trend has been most pronounced for Oil/Energy, Retail, and Conglomerates. The chart below shows the sectors with the biggest revisions. The Finance sector swing is primarily due to Bank of America.Total earnings for the S&P 500 reached an all-time quarterly record in 2014 Q2 and current estimates for Q3 put the quarterly total as the second highest ever. But given the historical trend of roughly two-thirds of the companies beating earnings estimates, the final Q3 tally will likely be right in the preceding quarter's record vicinity. The chart below shows that current consensus estimates reflect record tallies in the following quarters.For these estimates to hold, we need an improvement on the guidance front, which has been persistently been weak for almost two years now. There was modest improvement in tone of management guidance on the Q2 earnings calls, but the majority of companies providing guidance still guided lower.Given the global growth worries, it is likely that the quality and quantity of guidance will deteriorate even further this earnings season. Importantly, continued negative guidance will effectively guarantee that we will see a repeat of negative estimate revisions, with estimates for Q4 coming down as earnings season unfolds.That said, continuation of even the modest improvement in guidance will be a net positive in the overall earnings picture. :  : For a complete analysis of 2014 Q3 estimates, please check out weekly  .*Disclaimer:

"The 2014 Q3 earnings season takes center stage this week with  (  ) release after the close on Wednesday. Alcoa isn't the first to report quarterly results, though it is the first S&P 500 member with the calendar fiscal quarter to come out with results. Companies with fiscal quarters ending in August have been reporting since mid-September and the tally of such Q3 reports already totals 22 S&P 500 members. In fairness to Alcoa, however, investors start paying attention to the earnings season after their earnings announcement.It is way too early to draw even preliminary conclusions from the results thus far. But the results thus far aren't materially different from what we have seen from the same group of 22 companies in other recent quarters. The table below shows the scorecard for the 22 companies that have reported results already.The earnings calendar is on the light side, with only about 30 companies reporting quarter results, including 9 S&P 500 members. But as you can see in the updated weekly earnings calendar below, the reporting cycle ramps up in a big way the following week.This earnings season will give us a good sense of whether the profitability strength on display in the last reporting cycle was a one-off event or the start of something enduring. Please recall that part of the Q2 strength was a bounce back from the extremely low levels to which all activity levels had fallen in the weather-disrupted first quarter of the year.

f you want to know where the economy is headed, keep a close eye on the industrial equipment wholesale industry. When the economy is growing, industrial companies increase production rates and start ordering more from equipment wholesalers such as  ,  ,  , and  . Conversely, when the industrial economy slows, the wholesalers will be the first companies to feel the pain of a slowdown from its industrial customers.The industry is also facing some significant changes in coming years. The larger wholesalers are seeking to gain market share by expanding store numbers, introducing initiatives such as vending machines, and using information technology and e-commerce to improve efficiency and generate new sales. It's an exciting industry to follow and deserves a close look. The industry supplies the manufacturing and construction sectors with everything they need to run their day-to-day businesses. In industry terms this is called maintenance, repair, and operations, or MRO. Products range from items as mundane as adhesives, faucets, and paper towels, toward more heavy-duty goods such as plumbing equipment, industrial fasteners, electrical products, power tools, and safety equipment.Source: FastenalThe plan is to use online expansion in order to increase their product offerings, and ultimately their customer base. In addition, Fastenal and MSC Industrial have aggressively expanded the rollouts of in-store vending machines -- an operation that has seen Fastenal increase profitability.All told, the industrial equipment wholesale sector is still a play on global growth. However, the industry is undergoing some significant changes that create secular growth opportunities for the larger wholesalers. As a consequence, potential investors should look at the sector as being capable of outpacing growth in the industrial economy overall.

 (  ) reported earnings per share of 54 cents in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 (ended Jun 30, 2014), a 2% year-over-year decline, on May 9. Earnings also fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 59 cents. Lower gross margins from reduced selling prices due to weak demand and a continued unfavorable shift in sales mix to lower margin direct shipment and commercial business resulted in the year-over-year decline in earnings. However, this marked a significant turnaround from the loss per share of 25 cents recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2014.Total revenue increased 6% year over year to a record $663 million but lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $665 million. Non-residential roofing product sales increased 9.7% followed by a 6.4% rise in complementary product sales while residential roofing products sales went up 2.7%.Cost of goods sold went up 7% year over year to $512 million. Gross profit was $151 million, compared with $147 million in the year-ago quarter. Gross margin contracted 80 basis points (bps) from the prior-year quarter to 22.7% primarily due to continued price pressure along with increased mix of commercial and direct ship business that typically carry lower margins.Operating expenses for the quarter increased 6% year over year to $105 million. However, as a percentage of sales, operating expenses remained flat at 15.8% due to continued cost controls and sales base growth despite the company investing $5 million in new stores to expand its footprint in the existing as well as new markets. The company posted an operating profit of $46 million, down 4% from $48 million in the prior-year quarter.As of Jun 30, 2014, Beacon Roofing had cash and cash equivalents of $26 million, flat compared with Jun 30, 2013. Total debt was $227 million as of Jun 30, 2014 against $225 million as of Jun 30, 2013. The debt-to-capitalization ratio was at 27% as of Jun 30, 2014, flat with Jun 30, 2013, figure.Cash used in operations was $47 million for the nine-month period ended Jun 30, 2014, compared with cash inflow of $49 million in the prior-year comparable period. This was due to seasonal increases in accounts receivable balances driven by increased sales during the third quarter of 2014, as well as increased inventory levels.The company expects strong demand to continue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, benefiting from its diverse product offering along with its greenfield strategy and lead to sales growth in the range of 7% to 10% for the fourth quarter compared with the 7.4% organic growth in the fourth quarter of 2013. With the pickup in residential demand, Beacon Roofing expects gross margins to improve sequentially in the fourth quarter.For the full year, Beacon Roofing expects organic sales growth in the range of 4% to 5%.Beacon Roofing will benefit from its consistent focus on cost control. Its investments in equipment and inventory, along with employee training and greenfield expansion will drive growth. For the last 4 to 5 quarters, Beacon Roofing has witnessed positive sales growth for all 3 product lines.The company opened 9 new branches in the quarter and is on track to open 25 new branches in 2014. These new branches should add 2% organic growth for the year. For 2015 and beyond, Beacon Roofing is planning to open at least 20 branches per year.The complementary product business will grow in the balance of fiscal 2014, driven by development in new construction and remodeling activity. Commercial business will also expand in the second half, given the number of projects and bids currently in process.Both residential and non-residential construction sectors are showing signs of improvement, which bodes well for the company. However, a difficult pricing environment will continue to weigh on gross margins.Peabody, MA-based Beacon Roofing is one of the major distributors of residential and non-residential roofing materials as well as complementary building products in the U.S. and Canada, with more than 90% of sales coming from the U.S.Beacon Roofing currently has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). However, a better-ranked stock in the same industry include Travis Perkins plc (  ) with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Among Beacon Roofing's peers, Fastenal Company's (  ) reported adjusted earnings of 44 cents per share in the second quarter of 2014, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Earnings grew 7.3% year over year as strong top-line performance was offset by weak margins.Lumber Liquidators Holdings, Inc.'s (  ) second-quarter 2014 earnings per share of 60 cents came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate, but fell 17.8% year over year.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"n the latest look at the underlying components of the S&P 500 ordered by largest market capitalization, Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST) has taken over the #307 spot from Whole Foods Market, Inc. (Symbol: WFM), according to  .Market capitalization is an important data point for investors to keep an eye on, for various reasons. The most basic reason is that it gives a true comparison of the value attributed by the stock market to a given company's stock. Many beginning investors look at one stock trading at $10 and another trading at $20 and mistakenly think the latter company is worth twice as much - that of course is a completely meaningless comparison without knowing how many shares of each company exist. But comparing market capitalization (factoring in those share counts) creates a true ""apples-to-apples"" comparison of the value of two stocks. In the case of Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST), the market cap is now $13.50 billion, versus Whole Foods Market, Inc. (Symbol: WFM) at $13.40 billion.Below is a chart of Fastenal Co. versus Whole Foods Market, Inc. plotting their respective size rank within the S&P 500 over time (FAST plotted in blue; WFM plotted in green):    Below is a three month price history chart comparing the stock performance of FAST vs. WFM:Another reason market capitalization is important is where it places a company in terms of its size tier in relation to peers - much like the way a mid-size sedan is typically compared to other mid-size sedans (and not SUV's). This can have a direct impact on which mutual funds and ETFs are willing to own the stock. For instance, a mutual fund that is focused solely on Large Cap stocks may for example only be interested in those companies sized $10 billion or larger. Another illustrative example is the S&P MidCap index which essentially takes the S&P 500 index and ""tosses out"" the biggest 100 companies so as to focus solely on the 400 smaller ""up-and-comers"" (which in the right environment can outperform their larger rivals). So a company's market cap, especially in relation to other companies, carries great importance, and for this reason we at  find value to putting together these rankings daily.According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, FAST and WFM collectively make up 3.00% of the First Trust NASDAQ-100 Ex-Technology Sector Index Fund ETF (  ) which is lower by about 0.1% on the day Wednesday.At the closing bell, FAST is up about 1.2%, while WFM is down about 1% on the day Wednesday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Fastenal Takes Over #307 Spot From Whole Foods Market@2014-07-16@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/fastenal-takes-over-307-spot-whole-foods-market-2014-07-16

n Jul 10, 2014, we issued an updated research report on  (  ). The roofing material distributor will continue to benefit from its greenfield investment strategy and balance sheet strength, while conservative outlook and pricing pressure remain areas of concern.Notably, Beacon Roofing opened 4 new greenfields in the second quarter of fiscal 2014, which brings the count to 8 for the year and 17 since last year. The company aims to open 25 additional branches through rest of the year. These new branches should add 2%-3% to organic growth for the year. For 2015 and beyond, Beacon Roofing is planning to open at least 20 branches per year. With growth in core industry trends, we expect the greenfield openings to continue at an accelerated pace in the near term.Beacon Roofing's growth strategy is also likely to benefit from its strong balance sheet position which is evident from its strong metrics. The company reported cash and cash equivalents of $34 million as of Mar 31, 2014, up from $16.7 million as of Mar 31, 2013. Total leverage ratio was at 1.59x at the end of second quarter compared with 1.62x at the year-ago comparable period. The debt-to-capitalization ratio remains low at 4.5% as of Mar 31, 2014. In addition, interest coverage ratio of Beacon Roofing was 16.2x at the end of second quarter compared with 15.07x at the end of last year.Despite these positives, Beacon Roofing expects earnings per share to be at the lower end of the current guidance range of $1.50 to $1.80. Beacon Roofing has expanded its business through strategic acquisitions and diversification of its product offering. However, over the last 18 months the company has been inactive on the acquisition front. This puts the company's strategy of growing though acquisitions at risk.Further, One of Beacon Roofing's suppliers, Owens Corning, recently announced that roofing volumes for the first half of 2014 will be 20%, lower than the year-ago level because of slow growth in the homebuilding sector.

 's (  ) adjusted earnings of 44 cents per share in the second quarter of 2014 were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Earnings grew 7.3% year over year as strong top-line performance was offset by weak margins.Fastenal reported net sales of $949.9 million in the second quarter, up 12.1% year over year as underlying markets improved, vending revamped, sales improvement efforts showed results and comparisons eased.Net sales, however, marginally missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $951 million, possibly due to a slight slowdown in daily sales growth rates in June.Fastenal's total average daily sales growth rate in the reported quarter was 12.1%, up from 5.3% in the prior-year quarter, owing to increase in sales volume. However, foreign exchange dragged down first-quarter daily sales growth rates by 0.4%.Daily sales growth was 10.0% in April, 13.5% in May and 12.7% in June, much higher than a respective 4.8%, 5.3% and 6.0% in the corresponding prior-year months. The sequential growth in daily sales for six months from January to June was also better than the historical average (1998-2013 period, excluding 2008 and 2009).After struggling for several quarters, Fastenal's top line turned around in the first quarter of 2014 and continued into the second. End-market slowdown and broader economic uncertainty were lowering fastener sales which is turn weighed down Fastenal's top line. In order to accelerate sales growth, Fastenal took the strategic decision to increase sales personnel at the stores.The added selling energy largely boosted sales this year. Importantly, easy comparisons from a relatively weaker 2013 also boosted sales growth rates in 2014. Moreover, vending trends have improved in both the quarters of 2014 and the construction business is showing signs of improvement.Daily sales to manufacturing customers (representing almost 50% of revenues) grew 11.2% in the second quarter, higher than 5.9% in the prior-year quarter. Daily sales growth rates to manufacturing customers improved as fasteners as well as non-fastener sales improved in the quarter.The daily sales growth rates of fastener products (used mainly for industrial production and accounting for over 40% of the company's business) were 5.5% in the quarter, better than 1.9% in the prior-year quarter due to easier comparisons.Non-fastener product sales (used mainly for maintenance) increased 17.1% in the second quarter of 2014, up from 8.5% in the prior-year quarter and 14.2% in the prior quarter. The non-fastener business improved due to the pick up in the industrial vending business.In the non-residential construction market, daily sales to non-residential construction customers (representing 20% to 25% of revenues) grew 7.5% in the second quarter of 2014, up from 0.7% in the prior-year quarter and also 2.9% in the previous quarter due to improvement in construction trends.As of Jun 30, 2014, the company operated 43,761 vending machines (irrespective of the type of machine), up 7.3% sequentially and 20.1% year over year. During the quarter, the company signed 4,137 machine contracts, up 2.8% sequentially. Daily sales growth to customers using vending machines was 20.9% in the second quarter, up from 19.7% in the first quarter and 18.9% in the prior-year quarter. The vending machines now account for 37.0% of the company's sales, lower than 37.8% last quarter.Vending trends have started improving after remaining soft in the past 2-3 quarters as management's recent effort to improve the quality of signings/installs seems to be working. Even though percentage of vending customers declined sequentially in the quarter, signings and the number of customers using vending improved.In the first quarter, gross margin declined 140 basis points (bps) year over year to 50.8% due to an unfavorable product mix (resulted from weakness in fastener products which generate higher margins) and changes in end market mix. Moreover, gross margins declined 40 bps sequentially and also fell short of the company's long-term guidance range of 51% to 53% as the company's focus shifted toward improving revenues.In fact, management warned that near term gross margins could remain at the lower end of the long-term range and maybe even below due to company's emphasis on improving sales.The company recorded operating and administrative expense of $276.0 million in the second quarter, up 10.1% year over year due to higher payroll, labor expenses and selling transportation costs. In order to accelerate sales growth, Fastenal took the strategic decision to increase sales personnel at its stores. Higher store headcount and field leadership as well as higher investments behind vending increased operating costs, thus pulling down margins.Pre-tax profit was 21.8% of revenues in the quarter, down 90 bps year over year, due to weak gross margin and higher operating costs.Fastenal had 2,684 stores at the end of the second quarter of 2014, compared with 2,683 stores at the end of the first quarter.Fastenal carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Other stocks in the building products/ construction materials sector include  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ). While Vulcan Materials sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), United Rentals and Martin Marietta have the same Zacks Rank as Fastenal.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The Federal Trade Commission has filed a law suit against Amazon.com (NASDAQ:  ), saying the company's app store allows children to make purchases without the consent of their parents. Amazon didn't require informed consent for in-app purchases until June, leaving many parents with a huge bill when their children made unsuspecting purchases. The FTC is looking for Amazon to refund affected families as well as reworking their system to require parental consent to make a purchase. On Friday, Imperial Tobacco announced that it was looking to acquire parts of Reynolds (NYSE:  ) and Lorillard (NYSE:  ), both of which are in talks to complete a merger. If Imperial is able to buy assets from the two cigarette makers, it could help the company gain market share in the tobacco market, which is dominated by Altria Group (NYSE:  ).

hares of  (  ) fell 18.7% in the after-market trading hours as the company announced mediocre preliminary second quarter 2014 results and lowered its guidance for the year.Weaker-than-anticipated traffic and macroeconomic headwinds pertaining to residential remodeling wreaked havoc on the company's quarterly performance. Traffic was low due to a dip in demand for wood flooring and the company's low inventory level as regard to many key merchandise categories. Moreover, the increase in footfall witnessed in March failed to sustain momentum in May and June.For the quarter, sales increased 2.3% to $263.1 million year over year but comparable store sales declined 7.1% as against an increase of 14.9% in the prior-year quarter. Further, gross margin is likely to contract, owing to unfavorable shift in sales mix and higher discounting activities.Given increases in advertising, legal, occupancy, and professional costs, the company expects a 9% rise in selling, general and administrative expenses. As a result, earnings per share for the quarter are now anticipated to be in the range of 59-61 cents from 73 cents reported in the prior year quarter.Management expects current trends to continue in the second half of the year as discretionary spending will be under pressure.Though the company is confident of improving its inventory levels, it has delivered a cautious outlook. For 2014, sales are expected to be in the range of $1.05 billion to $1.10 billion, from the earlier expectation of $1.15 billion to $1.20 billion.Comps will be in low single digits (positive or negative) as against earlier projection of increases in mid to high single digits. Consequently, earnings per share are now expected to be in the range of $2.65 to $3.00, down from the earlier projection of $3.25 to $3.60.The Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at 92 cents for the second quarter and $3.34 per share for the year and is likely to be revised downwards in the upcoming days.Moreover, the company has slowed down its expansion plans.

 (  ) is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2014 results on Jul 11, before the market opens.Last quarter, Fastenal posted a positive earnings surprise of 2.74% - turning around from the negative surprises in the previous two quarters. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.After struggling for several quarters, Fastenal's top line turned around in the first quarter of 2014. The company's total average daily sales growth rate in the first quarter was 8.7%, up from 4.9% in the prior-year quarter, owing to increase in sales volume.Moreover, the monthly sales data released for April and May (included in the current quarter) were encouraging. April daily sales grew 10%, slower than 11.6% increase in March due to the Easter headwind. The Easter holiday proved to be a headwind in April versus a benefit in March. Nevertheless, April results were significantly better than last year. Also, daily sales jumped 13.5% in May, better than both March and April and significantly better than May last year.Though management did not issue an official guidance, it stated during the first-quarter conference call that sales could grow close to 13% in the second quarter with sales initiatives gaining traction.If Fastenal can achieve this sales growth, management expects incremental margins to go back to the attractive 20% range. In the second half, as comparisons ease, incremental margins are expected to reach mid- to upper-20% range.Management seems optimistic for top-line and margin growth in the coming quarters as underlying markets improve, vending re-vamps, sales improvement efforts expand and comparisons remain easy throughout 2014.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Fastenal is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below. The Earnings ESP is 0.00%. Fastenal carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) which when combined with a 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some other companies for investors to consider, that, according to our model have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter: (  ), with Earnings ESP of +20.0% and a Zacks Rank #2 (  ), with Earnings ESP of +1.21% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) (  ), with Earnings ESP of +0.65% and a Zacks Rank #2.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Adjusted earnings of 38 cents per share grew almost 3% while sales went up 8.7% year over year.Fastenal's total average daily sales growth rate in the first quarter was 8.7%, up from 4.9% in the prior-year quarter, owing to increase in sales volume. Though the company witnessed softer sales in January and February due to harsh weather, sales improved in March. The double-digit growth in daily sales in March was driven by favorable timing of Easter and increased investments in stores that led to improvement in sales.Moreover, despite being slower than March, Fastenal's April sales were nevertheless significantly better than last year. The Easter holiday proved to be a headwind in April versus a benefit in March.Management also seems optimistic for top-line and incremental margin growth in future quarters as underlying markets improve, vending re-vamps, sales improvement efforts expand and comparisons remain easy throughout 2014.However, though sales improved in the first quarter, the company has struggled with the top line for several quarters due to lower sales of its fastener product line. The fastener business continues to be soft due to end-market weakness, especially heavy equipment manufacturers. Though the first-quarter top-line rebound is encouraging, a sustained top-line improvement is required to raise investors' confidence in the stock.Moreover, an unfavorable product mix (due to weakness in fastener products which generate higher margins), pricing and competitive pressures are hurting gross margins despite gradual top-line improvement. Further, management has been slowing down store growth in favor of increasing headcount to drive near-term sales growth.However, such initiatives increase employee costs and hurt margins. The accelerated hiring pace is anticipated to continue in 2014 which could further pressure margins.Fastenal carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the building products/ construction/materials sector include  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ). While Vulcan Materials and United Rentals sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Aegion has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

alifornia-based restaurateur  (  ) is set to report first-quarter 2014 results on May 1, after the market closes.Last quarter, the company reported earnings in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate, primarily due to increase in expenses. Will BJ's Restaurants be able to post a turnaround? Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.BJ's Restaurants has been reeling under pressure for quite some time now due to weak sales at its restaurants. The company's continuous comps decline in the past two quarters has been a concern.With inclement weather continuing in the months of January and February this year, the company's comps growth is expected to be sluggish in the upcoming quarter. Further, higher taxes in California and increased gasoline prices limit discretionary spending, which will have an adverse impact on the top line in the quarter.Although the company has undertaken a set of initiatives such as discounting and promotional offers to boost the brands, these are yet to pay off. Moreover, BJ's Restaurants' bottom line will be hurt by the costs associated with store openings in new markets. Additionally, the overall cost environment for food commodities are expected to remain under pressure in 2014 due to domestic and worldwide agricultural supply and demand imbalance.Our proven model does not conclusively show that BJ's Restaurants is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below. : The  for BJ's Restaurants is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 12 cents. : BJ's Restaurants' Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) which when combined with a 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Here are some other companies the broader consumer discretionary industry that can be considered, as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter: (  ), with Earnings ESP of +2.99% and a Zacks Rank #2.

 (  ) is set to report its first-quarter 2014 results on Apr 29 before the market opens. Last quarter, it reported 3.95% positive surprise. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.For first quarter 2014, Capella Education expects new enrollments to increase slightly year over year. However, total enrollment is expected to dip 1.5% to 2.5% in the quarter owing to weak student starts in the prior quarter and quarterly variations in re-registrations.The company has been witnessing fluctuating enrollment trends in the last few quarters, which in turn dampened total enrollments, revenues, cash flow and profitability. This trend is expected to continue in the upcoming quarter. In fact, revenues are expected to remain flat to down 1.0% year over year in the quarter. Operating margin is expected in the range of 14% to 15% for the first quarter, lower than 15.8% in fourth quarter 2013.However, owing to Capella's relationship and brand-driven marketing strategy and initiatives to improve learner success rates, total enrollment growth is expected to turn positive in the latter half of 2014. The company expects to achieve moderate new enrollment growth and operating margin improvement in 2014.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Capella Education is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below. Capella's Earnings ESP is 0.00%.

 (  ) is set to report first-quarter 2014 results on May 8. Last quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 5.56%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.American Public's fourth-quarter 2013 results were disappointing with both earnings and revenues declining year over year. The poor results were mostly due to worse-than-expected decline in total enrollment and new student enrollment levels. Enrollments in the fourth quarter were affected by decline in enrollments of students using Department of Defense Tuition Assistance or TA benefits. The temporary suspension of the TA due to the government shutdown in Oct 2013 and lowering of the benefits by the military greatly hurt enrollments of military students.Management expects military enrollment hurdles to continue in the first quarter of 2014. New enrollments by students using TA benefits are expected to decline once again in the to-be-reported quarter due to ongoing budgetary constraints and uncertainty.Accordingly, total enrollments are expected to decline in the range of 5% to 7% while student starts are expected to go down in the range of 7% to 9%. American Public expects revenues to remain in the range of flat to an increase of 3% while first-quarter 2014 earnings are projected to be between 43 cents and 48 cents - a significant decline from the prior-year level.Management also expects new student enrollments at Hondros College (acquired in Nov 2013) to increase 45% in first-quarter 2014.Our proven model does not conclusively show that American Public is likely to beat earnings this quarter.

"n Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin warned Europe that its gas supplies could be disrupted if Russia cuts off Ukraine's supply due to unpaid bills. Putin wrote a letter to eurozone leaders, stating his frustration with Kiev's $2.2 billion dollar debt, saying that supplies would be cut off if the problem is not resolved quickly.The letter drew US accusations that the Kremlin is using energy ""as a tool of coercion"". Since Ukraine ousted President Viktor Yanukovich, Russia has almost doubled the cost of gas for Ukraine despite the nation's economic crisis. An interruption to the gas flow in Ukraine would have a domino effect across Europe, as most European nations receive natural gas via a pipeline which passes through Ukraine.In other news around the markets:On Thursday, the White House announced that Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius has decided to resign. Sebelius oversaw the rollout of Obama's Affordable Care Act, which many have criticized for its many flaws.

However, producer prices fell 2.3 percent, the 25th consecutive month of decline.

Though the sale raised less than one percent of the total needed to pay off Greek debt, it marked the nation's return to stability after years of painful budget cuts. General Motors received more bad news on Thursday after estimates for the cost of the company's recall were raised to $1.3 billion. The new estimate is more than three times what GM originally estimated and out paces the company's first quarter profit in 2014.

"krainian officials have given pro-Russian separatists a strict deadline to disarm or face a ""full scale anti-terrorist operation.""Ahead of the Monday morning deadline, the United Nation's Security Council called an emergency meeting on Sunday night to discuss the rising tension between Moscow and Kiev.With between 35,000 and 40,000 Russian troops stationed at the Ukrainian border and a further 25,000 in recently annexed Crimea, markets have been jittery as the prospect of a military clash between the two nations becomes more and more likely.Most expect that the US and Europe will slap Moscow with further sanctions if the crisis continues to escalate.In other news around the markets:Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda have decided to hold regular meetings this month, something many have taken as a sign that Abe may be concerned about the yen's recent performance. Though Kuroda has been decidedly bullish about the nation's economy and expects that Japan will meet its two percent inflation target by April next year, the revival of regular meetings between the two has reignited speculation that the bank could provide additional stimulus.

 's (  ) adjusted earnings of 38 cents per share in the first quarter of 2014 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the year-ago earnings of 37 cents by a penny. The earnings beat was due to solid sales witnessed in the month of March.Fastenal reported net sales of $876.5 million in the first quarter of 2014, up 8.7% year over year. Net sales exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $870 million by a marginal 0.8%.Fastenal's total average daily sales growth rate in the first quarter of 2014 was 8.7%, up from 4.9% in prior year quarter, owing to increase in sales volume. However, foreign exchange dragged down first-quarter daily sales growth rates by 0.6%.Daily sales growth was 6.7% in January, 7.7% in February and 11.6% in March compared with a respective 6.7%, 8.2% and 5.1% in the corresponding prior-year months.Though the company witnessed softer sales in January and February due to harsh weather conditions, sales improved in March. The double digit growth in daily sales for March was driven by increased investments in stores to drive sales and favorable timing of Easter. This is the first double digit increase in monthly daily sales since September 2012.Fastenal was struggling with its top line for the past few quarters as end-market slowdown and broader economic uncertainty was lowering its fastener sales. In order to accelerate sales growth, Fastenal took the strategic decision to increase sales personnel at the stores. The added selling energy in stores largely boosted sales in March.Daily sales to manufacturing customers (representing almost 50% of revenues) grew 9.0% in the first quarter, higher than 7.0% growth in the prior-year quarter.Sales of products for industrial production dipped, owing to a decline in daily sales growth rates of fastener products (used mainly for industrial production), to 1.6% in the quarter from 1.7% in the prior-year quarter.Sales of non-fastener products (used mainly for maintenance) increased 14.2% in the first quarter of 2014, up from 10.8% in the prior-year quarter and 12.0% in the prior quarter.In the non-residential construction market, daily sales to non-residential construction customers (representing 20% to 25% of revenues) grew 2.9% in the first quarter of 2014, flat year over year but up from 2.8% in the previous quarter.As of Mar 30, 2013, the company operated 35,310 vending machines. During the quarter, the company signed 3,602 vending machine contracts, down approximately 6.4% sequentially. Daily sales growth to customers using vending machines was 19.7% in the first quarter, up from 18.7% in the prior-year quarter.Management has been slowing down store growth in favor of increasing headcount to drive near-term sales. Such initiatives increase employee costs and hurt margins.In the first quarter, gross margin declined 110 basis points (bps) year over year but improved 60 bps sequentially to 51.2%. Gross margin was within the company's long-term guidance range of 51% to 53%.The company recorded operating and administrative expense of $269.8 million in the first quarter, up 9.1% year over year. In order to accelerate sales growth, Fastenal took the strategic decision to increase sales personnel at its stores.

 (  ), an active player in the lumber supply industry, is expected to report its first-quarter 2014 results on Apr 17. The company's performances in the trailing four quarters were above expectations as evidenced by a positive average earnings surprise of 661.69%. Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement and whether Universal Forest Products will be able to keep its earnings beat streak alive.We believe Universal Forest Products has compelling top-line growth prospects. The company will reap benefits from addition of new customers and products to its portfolio. Also, the company's focus on expansion through development of industrial business, entry into markets without adding capacities and accretive acquisitions are expected to be a boon.Universal Forest Products' Retail building material unit will benefit from increase in home improvement spending while the Industrial packaging unit will gain from expansion of non-wood packaging materials business. The Construction business will be strengthened from addition of products and expansion of distribution capacities in the Manufactured Housing business, favorable national housing starts in the Residential Construction business and business expansion in the Commercial Construction and Concrete Forming business.In the past 5 years, Universal Forest Products' earnings grew 14.2%, while it is expected to grow 10.0% as against 6.4% for the industry in the next 5 years.Yet, bad weather conditions experienced at the onset of the quarter might impact top-line results. Also, any increases in costs of sales due to an unusual rise in cost of lumber products purchased from primary producers, will adversely impact first-quarter 2014 financial results.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Universal Forest Products is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Universal Forest Products has an ESP of -18.61% for first-quarter 2014, which indicates the difference between the Most Accurate estimate of 35 cents and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 43 cents. Universal Forest Products' Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) when combined with a nagative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Here are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter: (  ) with Earnings ESP of +4.76% and a Zacks Rank #3.

"n the latest look at the underlying components of the S&P 500 ordered by largest market capitalization, Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST) has taken over the #279 spot from Paychex Inc (Symbol: PAYX), according to  .Market capitalization is an important data point for investors to keep an eye on, for various reasons. The most basic reason is that it gives a true comparison of the value attributed by the stock market to a given company's stock. Many beginning investors look at one stock trading at $10 and another trading at $20 and mistakenly think the latter company is worth twice as much - that of course is a completely meaningless comparison without knowing how many shares of each company exist. But comparing market capitalization (factoring in those share counts) creates a true ""apples-to-apples"" comparison of the value of two stocks. In the case of Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST), the market cap is now $15.09 billion, versus Paychex Inc (Symbol: PAYX) at $15.02 billion.Below is a chart of Fastenal Co. versus Paychex Inc plotting their respective size rank within the S&P 500 over time (FAST plotted in blue; PAYX plotted in green):    Below is a three month price history chart comparing the stock performance of FAST vs. PAYX:Another reason market capitalization is important is where it places a company in terms of its size tier in relation to peers - much like the way a mid-size sedan is typically compared to other mid-size sedans (and not SUV's). This can have a direct impact on which mutual funds and ETFs are willing to own the stock. For instance, a mutual fund that is focused solely on Large Cap stocks may for example only be interested in those companies sized $10 billion or larger. Another illustrative example is the S&P MidCap index which essentially takes the S&P 500 index and ""tosses out"" the biggest 100 companies so as to focus solely on the 400 smaller ""up-and-comers"" (which in the right environment can outperform their larger rivals). So a company's market cap, especially in relation to other companies, carries great importance, and for this reason we at  find value to putting together these rankings daily.According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, FAST and PAYX collectively make up 3.49% of the First Trust NASDAQ-100 Ex-Technology Sector Index Fund ETF (  ) which is higher by about 0.6% on the day Tuesday.At the closing bell, FAST is up about 1%, while PAYX is off about 0.1% on the day Tuesday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Fastenal Takes Over #279 Spot From Paychex@2014-04-08@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/fastenal-takes-over-279-spot-paychex-2014-04-08
ooking at the universe of stocks we cover at  , in trading on Wednesday, shares of Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST) were yielding above the 2% mark based on its quarterly dividend (annualized to $1.00), with the stock changing hands as low as $49.70 on the day. Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return. To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) back on 12/31/1999 - you would have paid $146.88 per share. Fast forward to 12/31/2012 and each share was worth $142.41 on that date, a decrease of $4.67/share over all those years. But now consider that you collected a whopping $25.98 per share in dividends over the same period, for a positive total return of 23.36%. Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.6%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 2% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable. Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST) is an S&P 500 company, giving it special status as one of the large-cap companies making up the S&P 500 Index.In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Fastenal Co., looking at the history chart for FAST below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 2% annual yield.    According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, FAST makes up 1.69% of the First Trust NASDAQ-100 Ex-Technology Sector Index Fund ETF (Symbol: QQXT) which is trading lower by about 0.4% on the day Wednesday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Fastenal (FAST) Shares Cross 2% Yield Mark@2014-03-19@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/fastenal-fast-shares-cross-2-yield-mark-2014-03-19
 (  ) is set to report first-quarter fiscal 2014 results on Apr 11, before the market opens.Last quarter, Fastenal posted a negative earnings surprise of 2.94%. In fact, the company has missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both revenues and earnings for two consecutive quarters. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.The company has been struggling with the top line for the past few quarters due to lower sales of its fasteners product line caused by end-market slowdown and broader economic uncertainty. Moreover, the construction as well as vending businesses have been soft for the past three quarters. Ironically, overall sales have not improved despite regular growth programs.According to the data released by the company, severe weather conditions hurt sales further in the months of Jan and Feb 2014 - the first two months of the first quarter. Accordingly, we do not expect any significant top-line improvement in this quarter as well.Management has been slowing down store growth in favor of increasing headcount to drive near-term sales growth. However, these initiatives increase employee costs substantially and hurt margins. An unfavorable product mix (due to weakness in fastener products which generate higher margins), pricing and competitive pressures are also hurting gross margins. The accelerated hiring pace is anticipated to continue in 2014 which could further pressure margins.Management, however, expects gross margins to improve in the first quarter of 2014 from a significantly weak fourth-quarter 2013 as headwinds relating to lower trucking utilization and vendor incentives normalize.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Fastenal is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below. The Earnings ESP is 0.00%. Fastenal carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum. Estimates for Fastenal have been declining for the last 60 days.Here are some other companies for investors to consider, that according to our model have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter: (  ), with Earnings ESP of +100.0% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

 (  ) has been struggling with its top line for the past few quarters as end-market slowdown and broader economic uncertainty are lowering its fastener sales. Moreover, the construction as well as vending businesses have been soft for the past three quarters.However, the national wholesale distributor of industrial and construction supplies has something to smile about. The company's February sales results were better than January despite difficult weather conditions. Net sales rose 7.7% year over year in the month to $274.5 million, better than a 6.7% growth in January. Currency, however, was a 0.6% headwind.February daily sales grew 7.7% to $13.7 million, better than January but weaker than February last year.Fastenal serves customers in the manufacturing and non-residential construction markets.Daily sales to manufacturing customers (representing almost 50% of revenues) grew 8.8%, slightly better than 8.2% last year and 6.6% in Jan 2014.Daily sales to non-residential construction customers (representing 20% to 25% of revenues) grew 0.7%, slowing down from 4.3% in February last year. However, it was better than a 0.3% growth in January.Fastenal is trying to improve its top line. Stores are being encouraged to focus on improving near-term sales. In order to accelerate sales growth, Fastenal took the strategic decision to increase sales personnel at the stores. The added selling energy in stores is aimed to position the company well for future growth.However, such initiatives increase employee costs and hurt margins.

"The 2014 Q1 earnings season takes center stage this week with  (  ) release after the close on Tuesday. Alcoa isn't the overall first to report Q1 results, though it is the first S&P 500 member with the calendar fiscal quarter to come out with results. Companies with fiscal quarters ending in February have been reporting since mid-March and all 21 of those form part of the Q1 tally.In fairness to Alcoa, however, the market starts paying attention to the earnings season after their earnings announcement even though the list of companies that report before it includes such industry leaders like  (  ),  (  ) and others. In total, we have 33 companies reporting Q1 results this week, including 8 S&P 500 members. The reporting cycle really gets into high gear from next, as the chart below shows.Estimates for Q1 started coming down at an accelerated pace as companies predominantly guided lower on the 2013 Q4 earnings calls, consistent with the trend we have been seeing for more than a year now. Total Q1 earnings for companies in the S&P 500 are currently expected to be down -3.3% from the same period last year, a material decline from the +2.1% growth expected in early January 2014. Please note that the expected Q1 earnings decline has been exacerbated by Google's new class of stock. Excluding Google from the S&P 500, total S&P 500 earnings would be down (only) -2.7%.The negative revision trend is widespread, but is particularly notable for the Retail, Basic Materials, Autos, Consumer Staples, and the Energy sectors, as the chart below shows.With roughly two-thirds of S&P 500 companies beating earnings expectations in any reporting cycle, actual Q1 results will almost certainly be better than these pre-season expectations. But Q1 is unlikely to repeat the performance of the last few quarters where we would witness a new all-time earnings total record each quarter. Total earnings for the S&P 500 reached a new all-time record of $267.6 billion in 2013 Q4.Current estimates for 2014 Q1 aggregate to a quarterly total of $248.8 billion, but the expectation is that Q1 will be the low point for earnings this year, both in terms of earnings totals as well as the growth rate. Consensus expectations reflect a rebound in Q2, with the earnings totals in each of the following three quarters of the year setting new all-time records one after the other.The chart below shows the aggregate quarterly earnings for the S&P 500 as whole.Given the low Q1 expectations, it wouldn't take much for companies to come out ahead of them. Roughly two-thirds of the S&P 500 members beat earnings expectations every quarter any way. So, more results along those lines would be nothing new and wouldn't tell us much about the health of corporate earnings.What we haven't seen for a while instead is some evidence of strength on the revenue front and favorable comments from management teams about business outlook. Corporate guidance has been negative for almost two years now, causing estimates to keep coming down and the long hoped-for earnings growth turnaround getting pushed forward. Guidance is important in any earnings season, but it is particularly important this time around given the relatively elevated expectations for the second half of the year and beyond. (  )Total earnings for the 21 S&P 500 members were up +14.2% from the same period last year, with a 'beat ratio' of 57.1% and a median surprise of +1.9%. Total revenues were in the positive column as well, up +6.1%, with a revenue 'beat ratio' of 47.6% and a median surprise of +0.1%.It's premature to draw any conclusions from this small sample of results, but the growth rates and beat ratios for these 21 companies in Q1 are weaker than what we have seen from the same group of companies in other recent quarters. It has overall been a fairly uninspiring start to the Q1 earnings season.For a detailed look at the earnings picture, please check out our weekly  .

 (  ) saw a big move last session, as the company's shares fell by over 5% on the day. The move came on pretty good volume too with far more shares changing hands than in a normal session.

Fastenal's earnings of $0.40 per share in the fourth quarter of 2014 came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Earnings grew 21.2% year over year as higher sales and expense control offset gross margin weakness. Sales grew 13.8% year over year. After struggling in 2013, Fastenal's top line turned around in 2014 as underlying markets improved, vending re-vamped, sales improvement efforts showed results and comparisons eased. However, Fastenal's gross margins are contracting as management's focus shifts away to top-line improvement. An unfavorable product mix, strong emphasis on growing average store sales, pricing and competitive pressures are hurting gross margins. Lower gross margin thus remains the key concern for this company. Nevertheless, continued top-line momentum coupled with better operating margins under the Pathway to Profit strategy should offset the lower gross margins to drive EPS growth in 2015.Based in Winona, MN, Fastenal Company (FAST) is a national wholesale distributor of industrial and construction supplies. The company distributes its products through approximately 2,700 company-owned stores mostly located in North America.

The fastener product line comprises two kinds of products, threaded fasteners, and miscellaneous industrial and construction supplies and hardware.

 (  ) is set to report the fourth-quarter and fiscal 2013 results on Jan 15 before the market opens. Last quarter, it posted a negative earnings surprise of 2.44%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.In late Dec 2013, the company announced that it is likely to miss analyst expectations for the fourth quarter due to sluggish sales, higher employee cost and weak margins.The national distributor of industrial/construction supplies has been struggling with its top line due to lower sales of its fasteners product line due to end-market slowdown and broader economic uncertainty. Moreover, the non-residential construction and vending businesses have also been soft for the past two quarters.Management has been slowing down store growth in favor of increasing headcount to drive near-term sales growth. Moreover, focus on vending has temporarily been slowed down in order to improve near-term sales. Though these efforts have shown improving sales trends in the months of Oct and Nov 2013, they are below management's expectations.Moreover, such initiatives increase employee costs and hurt margins. In fact, gross margin is also below the company's expectation due to weakness in fastener products, a competitive marketplace, reduced supplier incentives and lower utilization of trucking networks.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Fastenal is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below. The Earnings ESP is -2.86%. That is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at 34 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is higher at 35 cents. That is a difference of -2.86%. : We caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum. Estimates for Fastenal have been declining over the past 30 days.Here are some other companies that you may consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter: (  ), with Earnings ESP of +21.4% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). (  ), with Earnings ESP of +28.57% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

n Nov 13, we maintained a Neutral recommendation on  (  ) following dismal third-quarter 2013 results as we have faith in the company's growth initiatives.This industrial and construction supplies company announced third-quarter 2013 results on Oct 10. Adjusted earnings of 40 cents per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny due to soft revenues and margins. Revenues grew 7.0% year over year, but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate owing to soft fastener sales and weakness in construction.Fastenal has been struggling with its top line over several quarters. Fastenal's daily sales growth rates have been weak since the last 5-6 quarters mainly due to a weakness in its fastener product line caused by end-market slowdown and broader economic uncertainty. From more than 15% growth in the first quarter of 2012, the fastener product line, which accounts for around 45% of the company sales, dropped to 1.0% growth in the third quarter of 2013.Industrial vending has also been soft for the past two quarters as management intentionally slowed down vending to focus more on the quality of signings/installs. Moreover, management is encouraging stores to focus more on immediate sales growth.Estimates have mostly shown a downward trend after the weak third-quarter results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2013 has gone down 1.3%, while that for 2014 has gone down 2.2% over the last 60 days.In order to improve sales, management is slowing down store growth in favor of increasing store headcount to drive near-term sales. However, such initiatives affect margins. We would also like to see substantial sales recovery before becoming more positive on the stock.Nonetheless, we believe that optimization of the vending machine program, easier comparisons and improved efficiencies from the recently launched vending-specific distribution center, T-HUB, should drive sales and productivity, going forward.Fastenal carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

 (  ) released decent sales results for the month of November wherein net sales rose 3.1% year over year to $621.3 million. Currency was a 0.4% headwind.November daily sales grew 8.2% to $13.1 million, showing an improving trend from growth rates of 2.9%, 7.2%, 5.7% and 7.7% in the months of July, August, September and October, respectively. The daily sales growth was flat from November last year.Fastenal serves customers in the manufacturing and non-residential construction markets.Daily sales to manufacturing customers (representing almost 50% of revenues) grew 8.7%, better than 7.6% in October. However, daily sales to non-residential construction customers (representing 20% to 25% of revenues) grew 4.4%, slowing down slightly from 5.4% in October; possibly due to the present slowdown in the housing recovery.The national distributor of industrial/construction supplies has been struggling with its top line due to lower sales of its fasteners product line which is being hurt by end-market slowdown and broader economic uncertainty. Moreover, the non-residential construction and vending businesses have also been soft for the past two quarters.In order to improve its top line, stores are being encouraged to focus on improving near-term sales. Fastenal took the strategic decision to increase sales personnel at its stores to boost sales. In the third quarter, the company recruited 400 sales employees; increasing the headcount by 4.6% sequentially. It plans to consistently add store-level employees per month for the rest of 2013.This strategy aims to free sales managers to focus more on selling which could drive near-term sales growth. Moreover, management temporarily slowed down focus on vending in order to improve near-term sales.These efforts seem to be paying off as the company saw improving daily sales trends in both October and November.Moreover, vending is expected to be ramped up again in 2014 once the desired store staffing level is reached. Under the vending program, Fastenal installs vending machines called FAST solutions at customer's location and keeps it filled with products they need.Moreover, under its new vending improvement program, management aims to improve the quality of vending signings/installs.In addition, Fastenal has plans to reinvigorate the high-margin fastener business and improve sales performance at under-performing stores. The company also plans to expand its store-based inventory for fasteners, construction and safety products.

"Shutterstock photoWhen HD Supply went public over the summer, the thinking was that its stock would get a lift from a recovering housing market.That has been true to a point, though the construction and industrial products supplier has run into more head winds than it likely banked on before its June initial public offering.HD Supply (  ), a former unit ofHome Depot (  ) that was sold to private equity firms in August 2007, bills itself as one of the largest industrial distributors in North America. It has around 500,000 customers and $9 billion in annual sales.The company provides a wide range of products and services -- everything from countertops, plumbing fixtures and hardware to electrical transformers, storm drain solutions, power tools, drywall accessories, interior finish products and pool supplies.HD Supply's business units include HD Supply Facilities Maintenance, HD Supply Waterworks, HD Supply Power Solutions and HD Supply White Cap.The breadth of HD Supply's products puts it into a number of construction and industrial markets, not just residential.Still, the company concedes in filings with the Securities & Exchange Commission that most of its business units ""are dependent to varying degrees upon the new residential construction market.""That market has seen a nice rebound over the last year amid rising home sales and prices. This is one of the reasons HD Supply went public over the summer. The company opened at a price of $18 on its first trading day June 27.While the stock has moved higher since then -- it currently trades near 24 -- there have been ups and downs along the way as the housing market recovery has been slowed by rising mortgage interest rates and some ongoing economic uncertainty.HD Supply CEO Joseph DeAngelo addressed some of the housing market concerns on a fiscal third-quarter conference call last month, saying that ""for the residential markets, the strength that we saw earlier in the year moderated.""He also said growth in single-family housing starts came in lower than expected during the quarter, which ended in October.Those issues aside, housing end markets were still strong enough in the quarter to help HD Supply put up decent numbers.Earnings came in at 38 cents a share, topping analyst consensus estimates for 35 cents. Sales rose 7% to $2.3 billion, matching views. The gross profit margin widened to 29.1% from 28.7% a year earlier.HD Supply posted top-line gains across all of its business units. Its Facilities Maintenance unit, which provides products and services to the multifamily housing market, logged 8% organic sales growth during the quarter.The Waterworks business, which supplies water and wastewater products, delivered 11% organic sales growth. The White Cap business, which provides specialty construction and safety supplies to professional contractors, also had 11% organic sales growth.Lagging those units was HD Supply's Power Solutions division, which provides services to power companies, utilities, construction firms and industrial clients. It had organic sales growth of just 1% during the quarter.The unit's slow growth reflects ""conservative practices among utility customers,"" Citigroup analyst Deane Dray noted.""This is one of the more growth-constrained businesses due to a concentration of both large customers and suppliers,"" he said, ""and is HD Supply's most direct overlap"" with rivalWesco International (  ).Among publicly traded firms, HD Supply's rivals also includeW.W. Grainger (  ) andFastenal (  ).For fiscal 2014, HD Supply guided midteens growth in residential end markets, modest growth in nonresidential markets, and a flat-to-down performance in the infrastructure businesses, largely due to sluggish municipal water and utility capital spending.""In a worst case, slower end markets drive fewer profit dollars for growth reinvestment, which itself drives slower revenue growth,"" JPMorgan analyst Stephen Tusa noted in a Q3 earnings report.""Because of this compounding dynamic, we continue to view HD Supply as more of a revenue story than a margin story,"" he added.Most analysts reckon that HD Supply will post mid- to high-single-digit revenue growth in coming years. Over the near term, it should get a leg up from residential construction as growing demand for homes outweighs the rise in mortgage rates.In a report last month, the Commerce Department said housing starts in November rose 22.7% from October to an annualized rate of 1.09 million. That topped economist forecasts and represented the highest level since February 2008.Permits for future projects were near a five-year high, indicating that the momentum will continue this year. December data are due out on Jan. 17.The prognosis for nonresidential markets is less optimistic, though some analysts figure that HD Supply can still find growth in these sectors by beating rivals for new business.""Despite some uncertain end markets and recovery timing issues in nonresidential construction, utilities and power markets, we remain positive on HD Supply's ability to gain market share in its highly fragmented industrial distribution end markets,"" Citigroup's Dray said.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect HD Supply to post earnings of 54 cents a share for fiscal 2013 . The company's annual profit is seen rising to $1.35 a share in fiscal 2014 and $2.16 in 2015.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Housing Market Bolsters Home Depot Spinoff HD Supply@2014-01-09@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/housing-market-bolsters-home-depot-spinoff-hd-supply-2014-01-09
 (  ) recently announced that it is likely to miss fourth quarter 2013 average analyst earnings estimate of 36 cents, due to sluggish sales, higher employee cost and weak margins. However, earnings are expected to surpass the year-ago figure of 33 cents.The national distributor of industrial/construction supplies has been struggling with its top line due to lower sales of its fasteners product line which is being hurt by end-market slowdown and broader economic uncertainty. Daily sales growth was 5.7% in September, 7.7% in October, and 8.2% in November, compared to a respective 12.9%, 6.8% and 8.2% in the corresponding prior year months. Weak sales were due to sluggishness in the heavy manufacturing business.Management has been slowing down store growth in favor of increasing headcount to drive near-term sales growth. However, such initiatives increase employee costs and hurt margins. In fact, gross margin is also below company's expectation due to weakness in fastener products, a competitive marketplace, reduced supplier incentives and lower utilization of trucking networks.In addition, the company's focus on increasing store headcount and field leadership adversely impacted gross profit.However, the company is positive about the upcoming quarters and expects increased headcount in stores to generate solid sales. In fact, the company is trading off short term earnings for better selling component.Fastenal carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

 (  ) is set to report its third-quarter fiscal 2013 results on Oct 9 before the market opens. Last quarter, it posted in-line results. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Fastenal's top line has been soft since the past 4-5 quarters as the sales of its fasteners product line were being hurt by end-market slowdown and broader economic uncertainty. Moreover, the construction business has been soft for the past two quarters. Vending was also soft in the second quarter.However, in early September, Fastenal announced encouraging sales results for the month of August which were a relief from the recent sluggish sales of the company. Management's strategy of slowing down vending pace and instead focusing on improving near-term sales seems to be paying off as the August sales recovered from a slower July.Moreover, the strategic decision to slow down store growth and instead increase headcount is also driving near-term sales growth.In addition, Fastenal has plans to reinvigorate the high-margin fastener business and also improve sales performance at underperforming stores. Moreover, Fastenal hopes to gain from a new pricing system for stores and improved operational efficiency across its distribution network (by adding significant automation). Management expects these strategies to drive sales growth back to the historical high-teens range by the first quarter of 2014.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Fastenal is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP (Read:  ) and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below. The Earnings ESP is 0.0%. Fastenal carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) which lowers the predictive power of ESP because a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) when combined with a 0.0% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult. We caution against stocks with Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some other building products/construction companies you may want to consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter: (  ), Earnings ESP of +1.52% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). (  ), Earnings ESP of +57.14% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The elevation of Janet Yellen to replace Ben Bernanke as Fed Chair should help remove one source of uncertainty from the market, though the development was largely expected after Larry Summers was no longer in contention. The bigger source of uncertainty for the market is the budget fight in Washington that now appears on track to morph into debt ceiling fight. Investors are still hanging onto hopes that we will move past this issue before next week's debt ceiling deadline, but each passing day brings unhappy reminders of how destabilizing the 2011 fight had turned out to be.Janet Yellen is a known commodity for the markets, a strong advocate of Bernanke's easy-money and transparent communications policies. The Bernanke Fed wasn't very successful on the communications front, particularly with respect to the Taper question. They were unsuccessful in convincing the bond market that Tapering and tightening were two different things.Perhaps the confirmation hearings will give us some clues as to how different she will be in communicating with the markets, but those hearings will have to wait for the current budget battles to end. Another development on the Fed front today will be the release of minutes of the last FOMC meeting when the central bank surprised the markets with the no-Taper decision.Beyond the Fed and the Congressional fight, the 2013 Q3 earnings season has gotten underway. This morning's reports from  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ) were broadly on the weak side, as was the report from  (  ) after the close on Tuesday. But  (  ) was broadly positive in its release, reiterating their favorable demand outlook for aluminum.Including this morning's earnings releases, we now have Q3 results from 26 S&P 500 companies. Total earnings for these 26 companies are up +7.9%, with 53% beating earnings expectations with a median surprise of +0.9%. Total revenues for these companies are up +5.1%, with 46.2% beating top-line expectations with a median surprise of +0.1%.The earnings and revenue growth rates at this admittedly very early stage is tracking a bit better than what we saw from these same companies in Q2 and the 4-quarter average, while the beat ratios are roughly in-line with recent history.A lot will be riding on guidance for Q4 given the elevated expectations for that quarter, when total earnings for the S&P 500 are expected to be up almost +10%. The overwhelming trend in recent quarters has been for companies to guide lower, prompting analysts to cut estimates.It is still early in the Q3 reporting cycle, but that same trend appears to be at play this time around as well. If this trend remains in place in the coming days as well, we should brace ourselves for major estimate cuts. This could become a material headwind for the market beyond the current Washington fight.Sheraz MianDirector of ResearchThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Will Yellen's Ascension Help, Near-Term? - Ahead of Wall Street@2013-10-09@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/will-yellens-ascension-help-near-term-ahead-wall-street-2013-10-09

Daily sales growth rates came in at 7.2% for the month, significantly higher than 2.9% in July and 6% in June.Fastenal serves customers in the manufacturing and non-residential construction markets. Both the markets reported improving August sales.Daily sales to manufacturing customers (representing almost 50% of revenues) grew 6.1%, much higher than 2.1% reported in July and also above 5.9% reported in the second quarter.Daily sales to non-residential construction customers (representing 20% to 25% of revenues) jumped 7.3%, a significant improvement from a decline of 0.1% seen in July and a growth of 0.7% in the second quarter. Easy prior-year comparisons played a role in driving the improvement.The company has been witnessing a consistent decline in daily sales growth rates for the past few quarters. The declining daily sales rates are due to lower sales of its fasteners product line which were being hurt by end-market slowdown and broader economic uncertainty. Moreover, the construction business has also been soft since the past two quarters.In order to improve its top line, management announced some interesting strategies during the second-quarter conference call, held in early July. Management is deliberately slowing down focus on vending.Management has eased pressure on stores to sign up vending machines as a vending contract takes about 5-6 months to generate revenues. Instead, stores are being encouraged to focus on improving near-term sales.In order to accelerate sales growth, Fastenal also took the strategic decision to increase sales personnel at its stores. It plans to add 100-150 employees per month for the next six months. This strategy aims to free sales managers to focus more on selling which could drive near-term sales growth. We believe these initiatives to drive near-term sales have started to pay off as reflected in improving sales trends for the month of August.In addition, Fastenal has plans to reinvigorate the high-margin fastener business and also improve sales performance at under-performing stores.

 (  ) announced dismal third-quarter 2013 results, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both earnings and revenues as its struggle with the top line continues.Fastenal's adjusted earnings of 40 cents per share in the third quarter of 2013, increased 8.1% year over year. Earnings of this national distributor of industrial/construction supplies, however, missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 41 cents by a penny. We believe that weak sales and soft margins led to the lackluster performance in the quarter.Fastenal reported net sales of $858.4 million, up 7.0% year over year. Net sales once again lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $865 million as the company continues to see softness in fasteners and non-residential construction growth.Fastenal serves customers in the manufacturing and non-residential construction markets. Sales were slow in both the markets.The company has been witnessing a consistent decline in daily sales growth rates for the past few quarters. The declining daily sales rates are due to lower sales of its fasteners product line which were being hurt by end-market slowdown and broader economic uncertainty. Moreover, the construction as well as vending businesses have also been soft since the past two quarters.Fastenal's total average daily sales growth rate remained flat with the second quarter at 5.3%. Foreign exchange dragged down third-quarter daily sales growth rates by 0.3%.Fastenal's daily sales growth rates came in at 2.9%, 7.2% and 5.7% for the months of July, August and September, respectively, significantly down from the daily growth rates of 12.1%, 12.0% and 12.9% in the corresponding prior-year months. Though August sales recovered from a slower July, the sequential improvement was not repeated in September. The sequential change in daily sales for nine months from January to September also fell short of the historical averages.Daily sales to manufacturing customers (representing almost 50% of revenues) grew 4.7% in the third quarter, much lower than the 14.0% growth in the prior-year quarter and 5.9% in the preceding quarter. Daily sales growth rates to manufacturing customers declined sharply due to lower sales of its fasteners product line, hurt by end-market slowdown and broader economic uncertainty.The company supplies two types of products to manufacturing customers, one for industrial production and the other for maintenance of the manufacturing business.Sales of products for industrial production dipped significantly, owing to a continuous decline in daily sales growth rates of fastener products (used mainly for industrial production) to 1.0% in the quarter from 6.0% in the prior-year quarter.Sales of non-fastener products (used mainly for maintenance) increased 8.9% in the third quarter of 2013, down from 18.0% in the prior-year quarter. However, sales of these products improved slightly from the 8.5% growth seen in the sequentially-preceding quarter.In the non-residential construction market, daily sales to non-residential construction customers (representing 20% to 25% of revenues) grew 3.9% in the third quarter of 2013, down from 8.2% in the third quarter of 2012. Management blamed the government policy uncertainty and sequestration in the U.S. for the decline. Poor weather conditions also hurt construction sales. However, third-quarter sales improved from 0.7% growth recorded in the second quarter of 2013, maybe due to some recovery being seen in the non-residential construction market.The company has adopted FAST Solutions, an industrial vending process that has the potential to revolutionize the industrial distribution system and increase profitability. The company installs vending machines that aid in controlling inventory and administrative costs while reducing product consumption.In the third quarter, the company installed 2,699 new machines, down 34.0% sequentially. As of Sep 30, 2013, the company operated 32,248 FAST Solutions vending machines. The vending machines now account for over 33% of the company's sales. During the quarter, the company signed 4,372 vending machine contracts, down 18.4% sequentially. The daily sales growth to customers using vending machines was 15.2% in the third quarter, down from 32.9% in the prior-year quarter and 18.9% in the second quarter of 2013.The overall vending trends have been softer since the past two quarters due to management's new initiative to deliberately slow down focus on vending. Management has eased pressure on stores to sign up vending machines as a vending contract takes about 5-6 months to generate revenues. Instead, stores are being encouraged to focus on improving near-term sales.In third-quarter 2013, gross margin improved only 10 basis points (bps) from the prior-year quarter to 51.1% and declined 110 bps sequentially. An unfavorable product mix (due to weakness in fastener products which generate higher margins) hurt gross margins in the quarter. Moreover, a higher headcount boosted the operating costs for the company, thus pulling down margins.Fastenal has taken a strategic decision to increase sales personnel at its stores. It is adding 100-150 store personnel per month in order to free sales managers to focus more on selling which could drive near-term sales growth.The company recorded operating and administrative expense of $254.9 million, up 6.8% year over year. Operating expense ratio stood at 29.7%, almost flat year over year, largely due to slowing sales growth.Tre-tax profit was 22.0% of revenues in the quarter, up only 10 bps year over year, due to gross margin softness and higher operating expenses.Fastenal carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some other building products/retail companies that are currently doing well include  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ). While Liquidators Holdings carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), The Home Depot and Lowe's carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Fastenal Misses Q3 Earnings, Sales - Analyst Blog@2013-10-09@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/fastenal-misses-q3-earnings-sales-analyst-blog-2013-10-09
eading national distributor of industrial and construction supplies,  (  ), released its sales information for the month of July. The company once again reported year-over-year decline in daily sales.Fastenal's daily sales growth rates came in at 2.9% for the month of July, much lower than the 6% reported in June. The sequential improvement seen in the month of June could not be repeated in July. The daily sales growth rate was also significantly down from the daily growth rate of 12.1% in the corresponding prior-year month. One less selling day in the quarter due to the Jul 4 th holiday led to the decline. Moreover, weak sales on the day following the national holiday also took a toll on top-line growth. Foreign exchange further dragged the July daily sales by 0.2%.The company has been witnessing a consistent decline in daily sales growth rates for the past few quarters. The declining daily sales rates are due to lower sales of its fasteners product line which are being hurt by end-market slowdown and broader economic uncertainty.Fastenal serves customers in the manufacturing and non-residential construction markets. Both the markets reported disappointing July sales. Daily sales to manufacturing customers (representing almost 50% of revenues) grew only 2.1%, but that to non-residential construction customers (representing 20% to 25% of revenues) declined 0.1%. While soft fastener sales were responsible for the meager increase in the former case, weakness in the non-residential construction market and the government policy uncertainty and sequestration in the U.S. contributed to the drop in sales in the latter.Fastenal carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Other companies in the sector that are doing well include  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ). While Lumber carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), The Home Depot and Builders FirstSource carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Fastenal Reports Slow July Sales - Analyst Blog@2013-08-07@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/fastenal-reports-slow-july-sales-analyst-blog-2013-08-07
n Aug 7, we maintained a Neutral recommendation on  (  ) following mixed second-quarter 2013 results. However, continuous weakness in its top line is disturbing.This industrial and construction supplies company announced second-quarter 2013 results on Jul 10. Adjusted earnings of 41 cents per share were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimates but grew 7.9% year over year on the back of decent gross-margin growth. Revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate despite a 5.3% growth. The company continues to struggle with sales growth. Top-line growth was slow due to soft fastener sales and weakness in construction.Fastenal's daily sales growth rates have been weak since the last 3 - 4 quarters mainly due to a weakness in its fastener product line caused by end-market slowdown and broader economic uncertainty. From more than 15% growth in the first quarter of 2012, the fastener product line, which accounts for more than 40% of company sales, dropped to 1.9% growth in the second quarter of 2013. Industrial vending was also soft in the second quarter. Estimates have mostly shown a downward trend after the weak second-quarter results.Though management is consciously slowing down the vending signing pace to focus instead on quality of vending contracts, industrial vending still remains one of Fastenal's primary growth drivers. It has the potential to significantly increase the company's sales and profits. Interestingly, management is deliberately slowing down focus on vending and instead encouraging stores to improve near-term sales. We believe this is a prudent strategy to improve its top line. Further, the strategic decision to slow down store growth and instead increase headcount will drive near-term sales growth.We are also encouraged by Fastenal's other growth drivers like government business and metalworking, which are gaining traction and could help achieve profitability in 2013 and beyond. We, thus, remain on the sidelines on solid long-term fundamentals.Fastenal carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Other companies in the sector that are doing well include  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ). While Lumber carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), The Home Depot and Builders FirstSource carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Fastenal Maintained at Neutral - Analyst Blog@2013-08-08@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/fastenal-maintained-at-neutral-analyst-blog-2013-08-08
"We didn't get the September jobs report thanks to the government shutdown and the impasse promises to steal the limelight from the 2013 Q3 earnings season. With the October 17th debt-ceiling deadline fast approaching, we can only hope that we move past these hurdles without further damage.The Q3 reports have been trickling in, with results from 21 S&P 500 companies out already. All of the reports thus far are from companies with fiscal quarters ending in August, which we count as part of the Q3 reporting cycle. Most of the companies reporting going forward, including Alcoa (  ) that reports October 8th after the close, are on the calendar quarter. In total, we have 33 companies reporting results this week, including 10 S&P 500 members. J.P. Morgan (  ), Wells Fargo (  ), Costco (  ), and Yum Brands (  ) are some of the notable companies reporting results this week.We have had a few strong earnings reports already, particularly from Nike (  ), FedEx (  ), and AutoZone (  ), but the overall trend at this admittedly very early stage is mixed. The earnings and revenue growth rates for the 21 companies are tracking better than what these same companies in Q2 and the 4-quarter average, though the beat ratios (percentage of companies coming ahead of expectations) are a bit weaker.This week's results will provide better color on underlying trends, with results from companies like Costco (  ), Yum Brands (  ), Family Dollar (  ) and Safeway (  ) giving us a sense of the consumer economy. Results from the big banks aren't arriving till Friday, but they will set the stage for the rest of the group the following week. Finance was instrumental in keeping last quarter's aggregate earnings growth in the positive column and is playing a similar, though less pronounced, role this quarter as well.J.P. Morgan has been in the news lately for all the wrong reasons, though the company has an impressive track record of positive earnings surprises, having beat expectations in the last 6 quarters. This report could have noisy parts related to the company's recent litigation and regulatory troubles, but core earnings should still remain best in class. The mortgage business will likely be less of a contributor this time around, both for JPM as well Wells Fargo.As has been the case at the start of recent quarterly earnings cycles, expectations for the Q3 earnings season have fallen sharply over the last three months. Total earnings for companies in the S&P 500 are now expected to be up only +1.1% from the same period last year, down from +5.1% at the start of the quarter in early July, as the chart below shows.This negative revisions behavior is hardly unusual as we have been repeatedly seeing this pattern play out in recent quarters. Companies have been overwhelmingly guiding lower, prompting analysts to cut estimates for the following quarter. The revisions behavior ahead of the Q2 earnings season was no different, as the chart below shows.Most of the same sectors have experienced negative revisions this time around as was the case in Q2. The 'regulars' on the negative estimate revisions front include Technology, Basic Materials, and Industrials. But in addition to those sectors, Retail and Consumer Staples have played some roles in bringing down expectations for Q3 as well.The chart below compares the Q3 total earnings growth expected for these five sectors at the start of the quarter and where those expectations stand at presentEstimates for other sectors have come down as well, with even the Finance sector earnings expected to be up +5.9% today, vs. +6.2% last week and +8.1% in early July. Energy, Utilities, Conglomerates and even Construction have suffered negative revisions in varying degrees.While estimates for Q3 have come down, the same for Q4 and the following quarters have held up fairly well, as the chart below shows.Part of the strong Q4 growth is a function of easier comparisons, as 2012 Q4 represents the lowest quarterly earnings total for the S&P 500 in the last six quarters, with the comps particularly easy for the Finance sector. But it's not all due to easy comparisons, as the expected earnings totals for Q4 represent a new all-time quarterly record. Total earnings for the S&P 500 reached a new record at $258.6 billion in Q2, surpassing Q1's $253.6 billion record. But they are expected to reach $265.7 billion in 2013 Q4, with total earnings growth outside of Finance expected at +5.3%.The evolving outlook for Q4 is perhaps the most important aspect of the Q3 earnings season, more so than Q3 earnings/revenue growth rates and beat ratios. While the overall level of aggregate earnings is in record territory, there isn't much growth. The longstanding hope in the market has been for earnings growth to eventually ramp up. But the starting point of this expected growth ramp-up keeps getting delayed quarter after quarter. The hope currently is that Q4 will be the starting point of such growth.Guidance has overwhelmingly been negative over the last few quarters. But if current Q4 expectations have to hold, then we will need to see a change on the guidance front; we need to see more companies either guide higher or reaffirm current consensus expectations.Anything short of that will result in a replay of the by-now familiar negative estimate revisions trend that we have been seeing in recent quarters. The market didn't care much as estimates came down in the last few quarters, hoping for better times ahead. Will it do the same this time as well, pushing its hopes of earnings ramp up into 2014? We will find out the answer to that question over the next two months.For a more detailed look at the overall earnings picture, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report  .Here is a list of the 33 companies reporting this week, including 10 S&P 500 members:

"utures Higher On Dovish BernankeU.S. equity futures rose sharply as a speech from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke after the close Wednesday was much more dovish than expected. The comments show that the Fed is not looking to end its easy money policies any time soon.In other news around the markets:Bernanke said in the Q&A after his speech that both sides of the Fed's dual mandate, full employment and stable inflation, argue for more easing and that interest rate hikes are no where near the horizon even if the tapering of purchases were to begin soon. However, he did close with slightly hawkish statements by saying that inflation is low due to transitory factors and should moderate back towards the medium-term target. The Bank of Japan raised its forecast for the Japanese economy overnight citing a moderate recovery and inflation that is likely to turn positive. The BoJ raised its 2013 Real GDP forecast to +2.5-3.0 percent from +2.4-3.0 percent in April and raised the median CPI forecast to +0.7 percent from +0.6 percent. Australia's employment report once again showed strength in June as the Australian economy added 10.3 thousand jobs vs. an expected flat reading and the unemployment rate ticked up unexpectedly to 5.7 percent from 5.6 percent due to an increase in the labor force. Part-time jobs drove jobs gains in June, a similar theme to those jobs added in the U.S. in June. The Shanghai Composite Index closed 3.2 percent higher, its best gain of 2013, building on the more than 2 percent gain from Wednesday. The Financial Times is attributing the strength in Chinese markets to a speech by Premier Li Keqiang which suggested the government will focus on restructuring the economy and focus on reforms.

hares of  (  ) recently witnessed a 6.32% decline to $47.70 on Jun 05, 2013, following the release of its sales information for the month of May. The company reported drastic year-over-year decline in daily sales for May 2013.Fastenal's daily sales growth rates came in at 5.3% for the month of May, significantly down from the daily growth rate of 13.1% in the corresponding prior-year month. Foreign exchange dragged May daily sales by 0.1%. A decline in non-residential construction customers also adversely impacted sales.The company has been witnessing consistent decline in daily sales growth rates for the past few quarters. The sequential change in daily sales for 12 months from January to December also fell short of historical averages. The declining daily sales rates are due to lower sales of its fasteners product line, overall weak non-residential construction market and the uncertainty in U.S economic policy.In fact, the company reported weak daily sales growth in the first quarter of 2013, despite year-over-year growth in earnings and revenues. Following the release of its first quarter 2013 earnings, Fastenal witnessed downward movement of estimates in the past 60 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2013 declined 2.4% to $1.60 over the last 60 days whereas the same for fiscal 2014 declined 2.6% to $1.86 over the last 60 days.Fastenal carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).However, with the overall housing market improving steadily, other companies in the sector are also performing well. These include  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ). While Lumber carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), The Home Depot and Builders FirstSource carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Fastenal Company Shares Slip - Analyst Blog@2013-06-06@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/fastenal-company-shares-slip-analyst-blog-2013-06-06

"fter excessive debt caused the collapse of Lehman Brothers at the start of the US financial crisis, US companies shied away from taking new loans and focused on lowering their debt.However, five years later, it seems more and more companies are using corporate bonds to grow. The Federal Reserve reported that corporate bond debt has risen 59 percent since 2007, and companies from Apple to Verizon are funding growth spurts and acquisitions by issuing record high numbers of corporate bonds.In other news around the markets:Moody's Investors Service has changed their outlook for the German banking system from ""negative"" to ""stable"". The German banking system had been rated ""negative"" since April 2008. As the US decided whether or not to launch a military attack in Syria, Iran prepared for retaliation at the US Embassy and other American interests in Baghdad. The Wall Street Journal reported that US intelligence intercepted communication from Iran to Shiite military groups in Iraq calling for the attacks in the event of a military strike in Syria. The Bank for International Settlements most recent report on foreign exchange trade showed that the Chinese yuan jumped to ninth and joined the top ten most traded international currencies for the first time. As the Chinese government loosens banking regulations, most are expecting to see the yuan's popularity increase. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's term expires at the end of January, but discussions about his replacement are likely to be put off until the situation in Syria is resolved. US President Barack Obama will likely wait to announce his candidate until a decision has been made about military action in Syria.Asian markets mostly ended the week on a positive note, the Shanghai composite was up 0.83 percent, the KOSPI gained 0.19 percent and the Hang Seng index was up 0.10 percent.

 (  ) is set to report second quarter 2013 results before the opening bell on Jul 10. Last quarter it posted in-line results. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Fastenal's daily sales growth rates have declined sharply in the last 3 - 4 quarters due to end market slowdown. Also, daily sales growth rates in the first quarter of 2013 were hurt by unfavorable weather conditions in January and February and an extended holiday shutdown in January. Daily sales growth of 4.8% in April was also disappointing.Moreover, on June 5, Fastenal reported drastic year-over-year decline in daily sales for May 2013. Fastenal's daily sales growth rates came in at 5.3% for the month of May, significantly down from 13.1% in the corresponding prior-year month.The declining daily sales rates have been due to lower sales of its fasteners product line, overall weak non-residential construction market and the uncertainty in U.S economic policy.Following the release of its disappointing May sales information, Fastenal witnessed downward movement of estimates in the past 30 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2013 declined 0.6% to $1.59 over the last 30 days whereas the same for fiscal 2014 declined 0.5% to $1.85 over the same time frame.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Fastenal is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP (Read:  ) and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. The stock has a negative ESP of -2.44%. Fastenal's Zacks Rank #4 when combined with a negative ESP makes positive surprise prediction difficult. We caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 and #5 (Sell rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.With the overall housing market improving steadily, there are many companies that are likely to beat earnings this quarter. Here are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter: (  ), Earnings ESP of + 4.69% and Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). (  ), Earnings ESP of + 8.57% and Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). (  ) , Earnings ESP of +1.68% and Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Earnings Preview: Fastenal Company - Analyst Blog@2013-07-08@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/earnings-preview%3A-fastenal-company-analyst-blog-2013-07-08
n May 17, we maintained a Neutral recommendation on  (  ) following mixed first-quarter 2013 results. However, continuous weakness in its top line is disturbing.This industrial and construction supplies company announced first-quarter 2013 results on Apr 10. Adjusted earnings of 37 cents per share were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate but grew 8.8% year over year, attributable to significant margin growth. Revenues however, grew only 4.9% and also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company continues to struggle with sales growth. Top-line growth was slower than company expectations in the quarter, hurt by one less selling day, soft fastener sales and global economic policy uncertainty.Fastenal's daily sales growth rates have been weak since the last 3 - 4 quarters mainly due to weakness in its fastener product line, which are being hurt by end-market slowdown and broader economic uncertainty. From more than 15% growth in the first quarter of 2012, the fastener product line, which accounts for more than 40% of company sales, dropped to 1.7% growth in the first quarter of 2013.Estimates have mostly shown a downward trend after the announcement of first-quarter results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2013 has gone down by 1.8% to $1.61 per share while that for 2014 has gone down by 2.1% to $1.87 over the last 60 days.However, the strong gross margin improvement and easing comparisons ahead keep us optimistic. Despite an overall weak sales pattern, the company is seeing some progress around its vending program and is fast accelerating its vending contract signings and installations. We are also encouraged by Fastenal's other growth drivers like government business and metalworking, which are gaining traction and could help achieve profitability in 2013 and beyond. We thus, remain on the sidelines on solid long-term fundamentals.Fastenal carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Some building product maker stocks that are worth a look include  (  ), carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and  (  and  (  ), both carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Fastenal Maintained at Neutral - Analyst Blog@2013-05-22@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/fastenal-maintained-at-neutral-analyst-blog-2013-05-22
ine stocks will reach their ex-dividend date next Tuesday, which is significant for investors as the seller of the stock on that date, not the buyer, receives the most recent dividend.A  stock must be bought one day before the ex-dividend date to claim any dividends that have been announced but not yet paid. The company determines on the record date, which usually occurs two days after the ex-dividend date, which shareholders qualify for the dividend. Shareholders listed as holders of record after the record date then receive their dividend on the date of payment established by the company. Those purchasing right before the record date forfeit the dividend and normally get the stock for a reduced amount.It may seem an anachronism in this era of high frequency trading, but the dividend rate rules are in force since it can still take up to three business days for transactions to be credited to and settled in an investor's account.Below are five stocks that schedule April 30 as their ex-dividend date.

he housing market has steadily made a comeback from the lows witnessed in mid-2006 from the severe and widespread downturn. The stability in the home buying market, combined with low interest rates and increased rentals, has increased the affordability of homes.Moderate job growth and slowly increasing consumer confidence are also contributing to a rise in demand for new homes. Inventory of foreclosed homes and short-sale homes are declining, thus stabilizing prices of new homes. Home prices have started moving up with market demand gathering momentum.As the housing market returns to its pre-downturn level, it will drive employment upward and build consumer confidence, thus providing stimulus to the overall economy. In fact, the health of the housing market is often an indicator of the health of an economy at large.Homebuilders are thus witnessing increasing traffic levels due to heightened consumer demand. Most homebuilding companies are witnessing significant growth in both volumes and average selling prices (ASP). New home orders, backlogs (number of homes under sales contracts at the end of the year) and homes delivered are climbing year over year.Moreover, improving homebuilding revenues combined with tight cost control and better overhead leverage (as volumes improve) are boosting margins for most homebuilders. The large discounts and incentives offered in response to declining demand during the housing downturn have mostly been called back.Overall, the U.S. housing market has seen significant upside in new home sales volume for 2012 with industry-wide sales increasing roughly 25% from prior-year levels. New home construction activity improved 25% in 2012. Faced with the fiscal cliff at 2012 end, and the threat of sequestration and a mounting national debt, the recovery of the housing market was one bright spot on the U.S. economic horizon.With sales and profitability improving, most housing companies have strategically focused on acquiring new home sites in high demand areas, which will further improve revenues and profits. In addition to purchasing finished home sites, companies like  (LEN),  (  ) and  (  ) also acquire early stage raw lands in A-plus locations, on which finished home sites can be built faster at a relatively lower cost.D.R. Horton has indeed stepped up investments in homes under construction, land development and finished lots on the strength of its improved liquidity position from solid sales growth in 2012. The company's land and lot position is now the strongest in its 35-year history. (  ) spent $925 million on land and land development in 2012 and plans to spend another $1.2 billion on land and related development in fiscal 2013 and 2014. While the company is disciplined in adding land positions, it is also divesting lower-margin projects and exiting underperforming communities and lower-margin land lots which no longer fit into their operating strategy. This would free up cash to invest in other potential opportunities, generating higher returns.KB Home has also exited underperforming markets like South Carolina, downsized operations in Arizona and Charlotte, disposed of unnecessary land and reduced exposure to risky joint ventures.Most homebuilders are shifting their focus on high-end communities. The average selling prices (ASPs) are improving for most large-cap homebuilders due to changes in the community/product mix. ASPs have gained from increased sales in high-end communities of California, Arizona, Colorado and Florida, where home prices are generally higher.Given the scenario, large builders are eating into the share of other undercapitalized/small/medium-sized private builders on the back of overall housing demand, stronger capital and better land positions.Lennar strategically focuses on acquiring new home sites that would boost margins and percolate down to the bottom line. The company focuses on high-margin, well-positioned communities and avoids fringe or tertiary markets where price is the only driver. The company's focus on quality instead of quantity is benefiting margins and boosting new sales orders.Pulte is also shifting its focus towards high-priced Pulte-branded move-up homes, which improve the overall ASP. A better mix of sales, particularly Pulte-branded move-up homes, as well as addition of new higher margin communities, is consistently boosting the company's margins.Small homebuilders like KB Home has started rolling out communities in highly desirable submarkets primarily in the Central and West Coast regions, which allow it to sell larger, higher-priced homes, driving up the ASP. KB Home in the fourth quarter 2012 has been able to drive up ASPs for 10 consecutive quarters. KB Home is also targeting higher income, first-time and move-up buyers -- all of whom are more inclined toward buying a new home rather than buying a foreclosed one.Another small homebuilder,  (  ) is also seeing improving selling prices from a mix shift towards move-up homes in higher-priced communities and states. Luxury home-builder Toll Brothers (  ) is focused on raising the quality and the luxury quotient of its homes, thus giving it a competitive advantage.Construction material companies,  (  ) and  (  ), and building product makers  (  ) and  (  ) are also slowly gaining momentum from improving new home demand. These companies are also seeing a concomitant rise in demand and volume.With both residential housing starts as well as non-residential contract awards showing a steady improvement, Vulcan is seeing some improvement in demand for its aggregates as well as non-aggregates businesses. Its aggregates business, which was sluggish in 2012, is expected to see solid demand growth in 2013 as private construction demand rises.Masco is seeing improving North American sales on the back of increasing new home construction activity, which is driving demand for its home improvement products.Most housing companies are striving to improve their operating and financial performance. The initiatives taken include steps to expand margins, improve overhead leverage, manage inventory tightly and implement new pricing strategies.As part of its cost reduction program, Pulte has made significant workforce reductions and is also aggressively working to reduce overhead costs. In addition, the company had effectively managed its business during the downturn that led to positive cash flows, which in turn could be used to pay back outstanding debt. The company is also adjusting contents of its homes and building smaller floor plans to curtail construction costs.Masco's strategic initiatives include improvement of underperforming businesses like Installation and Cabinet, solidifying its market position and leveraging its brands, new product introductions and product innovation, reducing costs, paying off debt and strengthening its balance sheet. The company's cost-saving initiatives included business consolidations, system implementations, plant closures, branch closures, improvement in the global supply chain and headcount reductions.Over the last 4-5 years, Masco has reduced its gross fixed costs by approximately $600 million by closing around 33 facilities and reducing headcount by more than 30,000.Construction aggregates maker Vulcan's aggressive cost saving actions resulted in improved per-ton margins in 2012. In addition, the company re-organized its structure (consolidated eight divisions into four regions) in 2012, which lowered its selling, general & administration costs by 11% in 2012.The company also has two other ongoing initiatives -- a Profit Enhancement Plan and planned asset sales -- in order to improve earnings and cash flows, pay off debts and thereby strengthen its overall credit profile.The Profit Enhancement Plan is designed to reduce costs as well as enhance profitability by streamlining the management structure. Under the planned asset sale, Vulcan plans to divest its non-core assets in order to focus on the higher-growth Aggregates business. These sales will improve the company's liquidity position and earnings.KB Home is improving and refining its products, activating communities (which were held for future development) in stabilizing markets, increasing revenues per community with intense focus on sales performance, and strengthening management teams with additional resources to improve its operating performance while carefully managing costs.Most homebuilders expect these cost reduction and operating efficiency improvement plans combined with reinvigorated housing demand to boost profitability in 2013.A look at the Earnings ESP (  - Zacks' proprietary methodology for determining which stocks have the best chance to surprise with their next earnings announcement) in the table below shows that Louisiana-Pacific could beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in its first quarter 2013. The company is expected to outperform on the back of solid performance in its Oriental Strand Board (OSB) and Sliding segments driven by the housing market recovery. Masco is also expected to beat earnings this quarter driven by continued improving trends in the North American and the company's turnaround efforts and profit improvement initiatives.Among those which have already reported their results for this quarter, Lennar beat the Zacks Consensus Estimates for both revenue and earnings; KB Home beat on revenues and incurred a narrower loss; and  (  ) delivered in line earnings and missed on revenues. While Lennar and KB Home gained from improving housing fundamentals, Fastenal continues to see sluggish sales of its fasteners product line (hurt by end-market slowdown and a broader economic uncertainty). Fastenal is a national distributor of industrial and construction supplies.In terms of composite growth expectations (combining the reports that have come out with those still to come), total earnings for companies in the construction sector are expected to increase 80.5% (year over year) in the first quarter after the +90.3% gain in the fourth quarter of 2012, thus continuing its positive momentum. This reflects 10.9% increase in revenue and a modest margin contraction.Notwithstanding the improving trend, the U.S. new home demand remains at historically low levels due to the currently weak U.S. economic conditions and tight mortgage lending standards. Sustainable increases in housing and housing demand for the long term will require the overall economy to strengthen, including further job growth.Consumers will remain cautious until the employment scenario improves, home prices appreciate further and access to the credit markets ease. A sustainable housing recovery in the long term can be achieved only through a broad-based recovery in the overall economy, which we believe will take time.Rising input costs are also a concern due to increasing costs of building material and labor. As housing starts accelerate, both labor and construction material costs would continue to experience upward pricing pressure, impeding margins in the future.The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index (HMI), known as the homebuilder sentiment index, dropped by 2 points to 45 in April due to rising building materials costs and shortage of developed lots and labor supply. Moreover, difficulty in obtaining construction loans and tightened lending standards are making it tough for homebuilders, especially the smaller ones to effectively respond to increasing demand.That said, the earnings momentum for homebuilders has remained positive for the near term, resulting in a Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) for D.R. Horton, Louisiana-Pacific and  (  ), and a Zacks #2 Rank (Buy) for Pulte, Masco, Lennar, KB Home and  (  ).D.R. Horton has beaten Zacks earnings estimates in all the quarters of fiscal 2012 (ended Sep 2012) as well as in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 driven by growth in net sales orders, homes closed and sales order backlog. The company is expected to see continuous improvement in profitability on the back of geographic diversity, solid cost discipline, sound balance sheet, improved liquidity position, better pricing power, and rising home inventories and land position.Lennar has witnessed solid year-over-year growth in new home orders, average selling prices and home closings in all quarters of 2012. Margins have also been above average, despite rising costs, driven by strong operating leverage. The company expects to continue to achieve further profitability in fiscal 2013 on the back of rising home prices, strong liquidity positions, solid backlog, strategic land acquisitions and new community openings.Pulte has beaten Zacks earnings estimates in the last three quarters of 2012. Improving homebuilding revenues combined with the company's cost control initiatives and solid operating leverage to boost margins. We believe that homebuilders like Pulte, who have significant land positions, broad geographic and product diversity, and better capital positions, are expected to benefit the most as market conditions recover.Masco's had a solid fourth quarter as both top and bottom line results surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The strong quarterly results were driven by strong performance in North America and Masco's profit improvement initiatives. We are encouraged by Masco's continued focus on product innovation and cost improvements. In general, management expects improved profitability in 2013 as both the new home construction and repair and remodel activities continue to recover.With the housing market on a recovery path, we are not generally bearish on any housing company. However, we advise investors to avoid Fastenal. Fastenal's daily sales growth rates in the last three quarters of 2012 were lower than the first quarter as well as the year-ago comparable periods. Daily sales growth rates to manufacturing customers have declined sharply due to lower sales of fasteners. We believe that the shift of resources to vending may also be hurting fastener sales.

 's (  ) adjusted earnings of 41 cents per share in the second quarter of 2013 were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The earnings rose 7.9% year over year, on the back of year over year growth in revenue and margin.Fastenal's net sales of $847.6 million, lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $857 million by 1.1%. Net sales grew 5.3% year over year, due to an increase in unit sales and favorable impact of the FAST solution initiative, which offset the decline in fastener sales.Fastenal serves customers in the manufacturing and non-residential construction markets. Sales were slow in both the markets.Fastenal's daily sales growth rates came in at 4.8%, 5.3% and 6.0% for the months of April, May and June, respectively, significantly down from the daily growth rates of 17.3%, 13.1% and 14.0% in the corresponding prior-year months. The sequential change in daily sales for 6 months from January to June also fell short of historical averages. Foreign exchange dragged second quarter daily sales growth rates by 0.1%.Daily sales to manufacturing customers (representing almost 50% of revenues) grew 5.9% in the second quarter compared with 15.8% growth in the prior-year quarter and 7.0% in the preceding quarter. Daily sales growth rates to manufacturing customers declined sharply due to lower sales of its fasteners product line, hurt by end market slowdown and broader economic uncertainty.The company supplies two types of products to manufacturing customers, one for industrial production and the other for maintenance of the manufacturing business.Sales of products for industrial production dipped significantly, owing to a continuous decline in daily sales growth rates of fastener products (used mainly for industrial production) to 1.9% in the quarter from 8.0% in the prior-year quarter. However, sales improved sequentially from 1.7% growth recorded in the previous quarter.Sales of non-fastener products (used mainly for maintenance) increased 8.5% in the second quarter of 2013, down from 10.8% in the preceding quarter. The decline was less dramatic than fasteners due to strength in FAST Solutions, which was partially offset by a weak industrial environment.In the non-residential construction market, daily sales to non-residential construction customers (representing 20% to 25% of revenues) grew 0.7% in the second quarter of 2013, down from 12.7% in the second quarter of 2012 and 2.9% recorded in the first quarter of 2013. Management blamed the weakness in the overall non-residential construction market and the uncertainty in U.S economic policy for the decline in this business.The company has adopted FAST Solutions, an industrial vending process that has the potential to revolutionize the industrial distribution system and increase profitability. The company installs vending machines that aid in controlling inventory and administrative costs while reducing product consumption. Despite overall weak sales, the company is seeing some progress around its vending program.In the second quarter, the company installed 4,102 new machines, down 5.7% sequentially. As of Jun 30, 2013, the company operated 29,549 FAST Solutions vending machines. The vending machines now account for over 30% of the company's sales. During the quarter, the company signed 5,272 vending machine contracts, down 8.0% sequentially.In second quarter 2013, gross margin improved 60 basis points from the prior-year quarter to 52.2% attributable to improved transactional margins. The company believes that its normal gross margin range is 51% to 53%. However, the company witnessed 10 basis points sequential decline in gross margin due to weakness in faster products and construction business.Fastenal had 2,677 stores at the end of second quarter of 2013, up from 2,660 stores in the sequentially preceding quarter. During the second quarter of 2013, the company opened 22 new stores, up 100% sequentially.Fastenal carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).With the overall housing market improving steadily, other companies in the broader housing sector are also performing well. These include  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ). All the companies carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Fastenal's 2Q EPS In Line, Revs Lag - Analyst Blog@2013-07-10@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/fastenals-2q-eps-in-line-revs-lag-analyst-blog-2013-07-10
he housing market has steadily made a comeback from the lows witnessed in mid-2006 from the severe and widespread downturn. The stability in the home buying market, combined with low interest rates and increased rentals, has increased the affordability of homes.Moderate job growth and slowly increasing consumer confidence are also contributing to a rise in demand for new homes. Inventory of foreclosed homes and short-sale homes are declining, thus stabilizing prices of new homes. Home prices have started moving up with market demand gathering momentum.As the housing market returns to its pre-downturn level, it will drive employment upward and build consumer confidence, thus providing stimulus to the overall economy. In fact, the health of the housing market is often an indicator of the health of an economy at large.Homebuilders are thus witnessing increasing traffic levels due to heightened consumer demand. Most homebuilding companies are witnessing significant growth in both volumes and average selling prices (ASP). New home orders, backlogs (number of homes under sales contracts at the end of the year) and homes delivered are climbing year over year.Moreover, improving homebuilding revenues combined with tight cost control and better overhead leverage (as volumes improve) are boosting margins for most homebuilders. The large discounts and incentives offered in response to declining demand during the housing downturn have mostly been called back.Overall, the U.S. housing market has seen significant upside in new home sales volume for 2012 with industry-wide sales increasing roughly 25% from prior-year levels. New home construction activity improved 25% in 2012. Faced with the fiscal cliff at 2012 end, and the threat of sequestration and a mounting national debt, the recovery of the housing market was one bright spot on the U.S. economic horizon.With sales and profitability improving, most housing companies have strategically focused on acquiring new home sites in high demand areas, which will further improve revenues and profits. In addition to purchasing finished home sites, companies like  (LEN),  (  ) and  (  ) also acquire early stage raw lands in A-plus locations, on which finished home sites can be built faster at a relatively lower cost.D.R. Horton has indeed stepped up investments in homes under construction, land development and finished lots on the strength of its improved liquidity position from solid sales growth in 2012. The company's land and lot position is now the strongest in its 35-year history. (  ) spent $925 million on land and land development in 2012 and plans to spend another $1.2 billion on land and related development in fiscal 2013 and 2014. While the company is disciplined in adding land positions, it is also divesting lower-margin projects and exiting underperforming communities and lower-margin land lots which no longer fit into their operating strategy. This would free up cash to invest in other potential opportunities, generating higher returns.KB Home has also exited underperforming markets like South Carolina, downsized operations in Arizona and Charlotte, disposed of unnecessary land and reduced exposure to risky joint ventures.Most homebuilders are shifting their focus on high-end communities. The average selling prices (ASPs) are improving for most large-cap homebuilders due to changes in the community/product mix. ASPs have gained from increased sales in high-end communities of California, Arizona, Colorado and Florida, where home prices are generally higher.Given the scenario, large builders are eating into the share of other undercapitalized/small/medium-sized private builders on the back of overall housing demand, stronger capital and better land positions.Lennar strategically focuses on acquiring new home sites that would boost margins and percolate down to the bottom line. The company focuses on high-margin, well-positioned communities and avoids fringe or tertiary markets where price is the only driver. The company's focus on quality instead of quantity is benefiting margins and boosting new sales orders.Pulte is also shifting its focus towards high-priced Pulte-branded move-up homes, which improve the overall ASP. A better mix of sales, particularly Pulte-branded move-up homes, as well as addition of new higher margin communities, is consistently boosting the company's margins.Small homebuilders like KB Home has started rolling out communities in highly desirable submarkets primarily in the Central and West Coast regions, which allow it to sell larger, higher-priced homes, driving up the ASP. KB Home in the fourth quarter 2012 has been able to drive up ASPs for 10 consecutive quarters. KB Home is also targeting higher income, first-time and move-up buyers -- all of whom are more inclined toward buying a new home rather than buying a foreclosed one.Another small homebuilder,  (  ) is also seeing improving selling prices from a mix shift towards move-up homes in higher-priced communities and states. Luxury home-builder Toll Brothers (  ) is focused on raising the quality and the luxury quotient of its homes, thus giving it a competitive advantage.Construction material companies,  (  ) and  (  ), and building product makers  (  ) and  (  ) are also slowly gaining momentum from improving new home demand. These companies are also seeing a concomitant rise in demand and volume.With both residential housing starts as well as non-residential contract awards showing a steady improvement, Vulcan is seeing some improvement in demand for its aggregates as well as non-aggregates businesses. Its aggregates business, which was sluggish in 2012, is expected to see solid demand growth in 2013 as private construction demand rises.Masco is seeing improving North American sales on the back of increasing new home construction activity, which is driving demand for its home improvement products.Most housing companies are striving to improve their operating and financial performance. The initiatives taken include steps to expand margins, improve overhead leverage, manage inventory tightly and implement new pricing strategies.As part of its cost reduction program, Pulte has made significant workforce reductions and is also aggressively working to reduce overhead costs. In addition, the company had effectively managed its business during the downturn that led to positive cash flows, which in turn could be used to pay back outstanding debt. The company is also adjusting contents of its homes and building smaller floor plans to curtail construction costs.Masco's strategic initiatives include improvement of underperforming businesses like Installation and Cabinet, solidifying its market position and leveraging its brands, new product introductions and product innovation, reducing costs, paying off debt and strengthening its balance sheet. The company's cost-saving initiatives included business consolidations, system implementations, plant closures, branch closures, improvement in the global supply chain and headcount reductions.Over the last 4-5 years, Masco has reduced its gross fixed costs by approximately $600 million by closing around 33 facilities and reducing headcount by more than 30,000.Construction aggregates maker Vulcan's aggressive cost saving actions resulted in improved per-ton margins in 2012. In addition, the company re-organized its structure (consolidated eight divisions into four regions) in 2012, which lowered its selling, general & administration costs by 11% in 2012.The company also has two other ongoing initiatives -- a Profit Enhancement Plan and planned asset sales -- in order to improve earnings and cash flows, pay off debts and thereby strengthen its overall credit profile.The Profit Enhancement Plan is designed to reduce costs as well as enhance profitability by streamlining the management structure. Under the planned asset sale, Vulcan plans to divest its non-core assets in order to focus on the higher-growth Aggregates business. These sales will improve the company's liquidity position and earnings.KB Home is improving and refining its products, activating communities (which were held for future development) in stabilizing markets, increasing revenues per community with intense focus on sales performance, and strengthening management teams with additional resources to improve its operating performance while carefully managing costs.Most homebuilders expect these cost reduction and operating efficiency improvement plans combined with reinvigorated housing demand to boost profitability in 2013.A look at the Earnings ESP (  - Zacks' proprietary methodology for determining which stocks have the best chance to surprise with their next earnings announcement) in the table below shows that Louisiana-Pacific could beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in its first quarter 2013. The company is expected to outperform on the back of solid performance in its Oriental Strand Board (OSB) and Sliding segments driven by the housing market recovery. Masco is also expected to beat earnings this quarter driven by continued improving trends in the North American and the company's turnaround efforts and profit improvement initiatives.Among those which have already reported their results for this quarter, Lennar beat the Zacks Consensus Estimates for both revenue and earnings; KB Home beat on revenues and incurred a narrower loss; and  (  ) delivered in line earnings and missed on revenues. While Lennar and KB Home gained from improving housing fundamentals, Fastenal continues to see sluggish sales of its fasteners product line (hurt by end-market slowdown and a broader economic uncertainty). Fastenal is a national distributor of industrial and construction supplies.In terms of composite growth expectations (combining the reports that have come out with those still to come), total earnings for companies in the construction sector are expected to increase 80.5% (year over year) in the first quarter after the +90.3% gain in the fourth quarter of 2012, thus continuing its positive momentum. This reflects 10.9% increase in revenue and a modest margin contraction.Notwithstanding the improving trend, the U.S. new home demand remains at historically low levels due to the currently weak U.S. economic conditions and tight mortgage lending standards. Sustainable increases in housing and housing demand for the long term will require the overall economy to strengthen, including further job growth.Consumers will remain cautious until the employment scenario improves, home prices appreciate further and access to the credit markets ease. A sustainable housing recovery in the long term can be achieved only through a broad-based recovery in the overall economy, which we believe will take time.Rising input costs are also a concern due to increasing costs of building material and labor. As housing starts accelerate, both labor and construction material costs would continue to experience upward pricing pressure, impeding margins in the future.The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index (HMI), known as the homebuilder sentiment index, dropped by 2 points to 45 in April due to rising building materials costs and shortage of developed lots and labor supply. Moreover, difficulty in obtaining construction loans and tightened lending standards are making it tough for homebuilders, especially the smaller ones to effectively respond to increasing demand.That said, the earnings momentum for homebuilders has remained positive for the near term, resulting in a Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) for D.R. Horton, Louisiana-Pacific and  (  ), and a Zacks #2 Rank (Buy) for Pulte, Masco, Lennar, KB Home and  (  ).D.R. Horton has beaten Zacks earnings estimates in all the quarters of fiscal 2012 (ended Sep 2012) as well as in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 driven by growth in net sales orders, homes closed and sales order backlog. The company is expected to see continuous improvement in profitability on the back of geographic diversity, solid cost discipline, sound balance sheet, improved liquidity position, better pricing power, and rising home inventories and land position.Lennar has witnessed solid year-over-year growth in new home orders, average selling prices and home closings in all quarters of 2012. Margins have also been above average, despite rising costs, driven by strong operating leverage. The company expects to continue to achieve further profitability in fiscal 2013 on the back of rising home prices, strong liquidity positions, solid backlog, strategic land acquisitions and new community openings.Pulte has beaten Zacks earnings estimates in the last three quarters of 2012. Improving homebuilding revenues combined with the company's cost control initiatives and solid operating leverage to boost margins. We believe that homebuilders like Pulte, who have significant land positions, broad geographic and product diversity, and better capital positions, are expected to benefit the most as market conditions recover.Masco's had a solid fourth quarter as both top and bottom line results surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The strong quarterly results were driven by strong performance in North America and Masco's profit improvement initiatives. We are encouraged by Masco's continued focus on product innovation and cost improvements. In general, management expects improved profitability in 2013 as both the new home construction and repair and remodel activities continue to recover.With the housing market on a recovery path, we are not generally bearish on any housing company. However, we advise investors to avoid Fastenal. Fastenal's daily sales growth rates in the last three quarters of 2012 were lower than the first quarter as well as the year-ago comparable periods. Daily sales growth rates to manufacturing customers have declined sharply due to lower sales of fasteners. We believe that the shift of resources to vending may also be hurting fastener sales.

 (  ) reported adjusted earnings of 37 cents per share in the first quarter of 2013, up 8.8% year over year on the back of top-line growth. The company's earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Fastenal reported net sales of $806.3 million, up 4.9% year over year, driven by increase in unit sales and favorable impact from FAST solution initiative, which offset the decline in fastener sales. However, net sales lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $823 million.Fastenal serves customers in the manufacturing and non-residential construction markets. Sales were slow in both the markets.Fastenal's daily sales growth rates came in at 6.7%, 8.2% and 5.1% for the months of January, February and March, respectively, significantly down from the daily growth rates of 21.3%, 20.0% and 19.3% in the corresponding prior-year months.

Toward this end, each day we search our database for a ""top stock"" (a top rated company in terms of earnings strength as well as company and industry performance) that presents a strong technical ""set up"" and a good entry point.In short, when our equity team is looking to add a stock to one of , the ""bull's eye"" stock shown below is generally their first choice.Company Symbol Industry StockRating YTD% Gain StopLoss Fastenal Co () is our most compelling buy today due to the fact that it is a top rated stock (in terms of earnings strength and company/industry performance) that has recently signaled ""Heavy Insider Buying."" An Insider Buying signal is very positive for a stock as that indicates that management is buying its own stock. Usually, this is for good reason, such as positive outlook on future business, an upcoming news announcement, etc. So, when we see a stock signal a ""Heavy Insider Buying"" signal, we take a good look at it. It helps that FAST is in a hot sub-industry and features a positive technical set-up. Along with its competitors W.W. Grainger Inc (), United Rentals Inc (), MSC Industrial Direct Co (), and WESCO Intl (), FAST has been trending higher this year. Since mid-December, the stock has kept above its 50-day moving average, which is a sign of a healthy uptrend. Currently, FAST has pulled back off of its recent February highs around , making for a good entry point. The stock also just crossed above its 5- and 10-day moving averages, which is bullish in the short-term. We like FAST at current prices due to its nice technical set-up and Heavy Insider Buying signal.At the current price (~.00), or on a pullback to the 50-day moving average (.08).Fastenal Company is engaged in selling industrial and construction supplies in a wholesale and retail fashion.

n Feb 21, we maintained a Neutral recommendation on  (  ) following appraisal of its fourth-quarter 2012 results. The company also carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).This industrial and construction supplies distributor's fourth quarter 2012 earnings of 33 cents per share grew 10.0% year over year, attributable to decent margin growth. However, though revenue grew 8.5% year over year, it declined sequentially. Fastenal's daily sales growth rates in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2012 have been lower than that of the first quarter as well as year-ago comparable periods mainly due to weakness in its fastener product line. Its fasteners product line is being hurt by end market slowdown and broader economic uncertainty. From 15% growth in the first quarter of 2012, the fastener product line, which accounted for 44% of sales in 2012, dropped to 2.5% growth in the fourth quarter of 2012.Estimates have mostly shown a downward trend after announcement of the fourth quarter results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2013 has gone down by 1.2% to $1.66 while that for 2014 has gone down by 1.6% to $1.90 over the last 60 days.Despite weak sales on the whole, the company is seeing some progress around its vending program, FAST Solutions, and is fast accelerating its vending contract signings and installations. Industrial vending remains one of the primary growth drivers for Fastenal. We are also encouraged by Fastenal's other growth drivers like government business and metalworking, which are gaining traction and could help achieve profitability in 2013 and beyond. We thus remain on the sidelines on solid long-term fundamentals.Some building product maker stocks worth a look are  ,  (  ) and  (  ).

The company reported 8.2% increase in daily sales to $12.7 million.As Fastenal serves customers in the manufacturing and non-residential construction markets, the company's net sales benefited from an 8.2% increase in manufacturing customers and a 4.3% rise in non-residential construction customers. However, foreign exchange dragged daily sales growth by 0.1% during Feb 2013.Fastenal, which competes with  (  ), has been witnessing some progress around its vending program, FAST Solutions, and is fast accelerating its vending contract signings and installations. Industrial vending remains one of the primary growth drivers for Fastenal. The company's other growth drivers like government business and metalworking are also gaining traction and could help achieve profitability in 2013 and beyond.However, Fastenal's daily sales growth rates have been declining year over year for the past three quarters of 2012. Daily sales growth rates dropped to 2.5% in the fourth quarter from 15% growth in the first quarter 2012.

 (  ) reported first-quarter 2013 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 37 cents, down 5% from 39 cents earned in the year-ago quarter and below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 41 cents.Total revenue increased 5% year over year to $513.7 million but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $531 million. Organic sales declined 4.6% in the quarter. In existing markets, complementary product sales increased 2.9% but both residential and non-residential roofing product sales decreased 5.4% and 6.1%, respectively.The current quarter benefited from the positive impact of several acquisitions completed since the start of last year, offset by lower average residential roofing selling prices. The quarter was pitted against a strong year-ago quarter, which saw a very high level of re-roofing activity, including the beneficial impact from mild weather in Dec 2011 and strong business in several markets that experienced significant storms in 2011.Cost of goods sold increased 4% to $387 million in the quarter. Gross profit rose 8% to $127 million. Gross margin expanded 70 basis points to 25% from the year-ago quarter. Operating income in the reported quarter decreased 6% to $32 million with operating margin contracting 70 basis points to 6.3%.Cash and cash equivalents declined to $34 million as of Dec 30, 2012 from 155 million as of Dec 31, 2011, mainly due to debt repayments this year and acquisitions. Total debt amounted to $62.8 million as of Dec 30, 2012, compared with $15 million as of Dec 30, 2011. Debt-to-capitalization ratio increased to 22.1% as of Dec 31, 2012 from 4.7% as of Dec 31, 2011.Cash flow from operating activities improved to $47.3 million during the quarter from $59 million in the prior-year quarter due to less favorable changes in working capital, including additional inventory purchases made in 2013 ahead of announced price increases.Beacon Roofing's acquisition pipeline remains active and we expect the acquisitions to continue at an accelerated pace in the near term. Moreover, both residential and non-residential construction sectors are showing signs of improvement, which bodes well for the company.The company has recently acquired Structural Materials Company in Southern California, Contractors Roofing & Supply Co. in St. Louis and Pennsylvania-based McClure-Johnston Company. Its main acquisition strategy is to target market leaders in geographic areas that it does not have a presence. Beacon Roofing also acquires companies to supplement branch openings within existing markets.Furthermore, over 70% of expenditures in the roofing market are for re-roofing projects, with the balance being for new construction. Re-roofing projects are generally considered maintenance and repair expenditures and are less likely to be postponed during periods of recession or slow economic growth. As a result, demand for roofing products is less volatile than overall demand for construction products. Demand for re-roofing is also on the rise providing ample scope for Beacon to expand in this market.Beacon is one of the three largest roofing material distributors in the United States and Canada, with more than 90% of sales coming from the U.S. Beacon competes with privately-held American Builders & Contractors Supply Co Inc., Guardian Building Products Distribution Inc. and Stock Building Supply Inc. Beacon Roofing currently maintains a short term Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Material supplies rival  (  ) reported diluted earnings of 33 cents per share in the fourth quarter of 2012, up 10.0% on the back of decent margin growth, and in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

 (  ) is set to report first quarter 2013 results before the opening bell on Apr 10. Last quarter it posted in-line results. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Fastenal reported a 10% year-over-year increase in earnings per share on the back of decent margin growth. The company witnessed 8% year-over-year rise in revenues in the fourth quarter 2012. However, both revenue and earnings declined sequentially.Fastenal's daily sales growth rates in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2012 were lower than that of the first quarter as well as year-ago comparable periods mainly due to weakness in its fastener product line. Its fasteners product line has suffered due to end market slowdown and broader economic uncertainty.Daily sales to manufacturing customers (representing almost 50% of revenues) grew 9.7% in the fourth quarter, much below growth rates of 21.0% in the prior-year quarter and 14.0% in the preceding quarter.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Fastenal is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP (Read:  ) and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. The stock has a negative ESP of -5.41%. Fastenal's Zacks Rank #3 lowers the predictive power of ESP because the Zacks #3 Rank when combined with a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult. We caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 and #5 (Sell rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum. With the overall housing market improving steadily, there are many companies that are likely to beat earnings this quarter. Here are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter: (  ), Earnings ESP of + 10.00% and Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) (  ) , Earnings ESP of +7.90% and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) (  ), Earnings ESP of + 36.36% and Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Earnings Preview: Fastenal - Analyst Blog@2013-04-08@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/earnings-preview%3A-fastenal-analyst-blog-2013-04-08
he labor market is not doing well and the unemployment rate is hovering around 7.8%. In such a scenario, the recovery in the housing market could, to some extent, calm the jittery economy by improving job prospects, primarily in the construction industry.When the housing market crashed it left many jobless, but now with new construction activities and home prices showing signs of improvement, optimism prevails.The housing market is gradually making its way out of its dormant state, thus raising hopes for a better job market. According to the data released by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the construction industry created 30,000 jobs in Dec 2012, including 13,000 related to construction of buildings, and 12,000 for residential specialty trade contractors.The slump in the housing market did not spare home-improvement retailers, such as  (  ) and  (  ), which faced the brunt as homeowners refrained from spending on big remodeling projects. However, a rebound in the housing market would play a key role to instill confidence in these stocks. Other stocks to benefit include  (  ), provider of industrial and construction supplies, and  (  ), a retailer of hardwood flooring.The sign of confidence is clearly reflected in the current hiring plans of Lowe's. The company plans to employ 45,000 seasonal workforce and 9,000 permanent part-time staff in the wake of the resurging housing market that could trigger demand for remodeling works. The metric, 'Leading Indicator of Remodeling Activity' released by Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University, indicates that the spending on home improvement activities could surge in 2013.The data suggests that spending on home improvement-related projects will witness an increase of 10.6% in the first quarter of 2013, resulting in an annualized value of $127 billion, 16.8% in the second quarter, reaching an annualized value of $134.4 billion and 19.7% in the third quarter to reach $145.5 billion. Consequently, we can expect increased hiring from home-improvement retailers to better meet the rising demand.The elevation in home prices and the lowest mortgage rates is triggering construction activities. If the resurrection in the construction industry sustains, it will usher in good news for many job seekers.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Will Housing Recovery Spur Job Growth? - Analyst Blog@2013-01-24@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/will-housing-recovery-spur-job-growth-analyst-blog-2013-01-24

 (  ) is set to report fourth quarter 2012 results before the opening bell on January 17. Last quarter it posted in-line results. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Fastenal's daily sales growth rates in the second and third quarters of 2012 were lower than the first quarter as well as year-ago comparable periods. Daily sales growth rates of manufacturing customers (representing almost 50% of revenues) have declined sharply due to lower sales of its fasteners product line (used mainly for industrial production), which are being hurt by slowdown in end market and broader economic uncertainty. We believe that the shift of resources to Fastenal's vending program (FAST Solutions) may also be hurting fastener sales and eventually affect margins.The second quarter was very weak for Fastenal in terms of sales growth. However, the company did see signs of some improvement in demand in the third quarter. The construction market has somewhat bounced back while the manufacturing market has remained almost consistent. The company is also seeing some progress around its vending program.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter stands at 33 cents, while that for fiscal 2012 stands at $1.42.Fastenal has beaten estimates only once in the last four quarters while meeting estimates the other three.

e recently upgraded our recommendation on  (  ) to Neutral following decent third quarter results, an improvement from the weak second quarter performance.In line with expectations, Fastenal Company's third quarter 2012 earnings of 37 cents per share grew 12.1% year over year, attributable to 12.2% year-over-year revenue growth. The second quarter was very weak for Fastenal in terms of sales growth. However, the company is now seeing some improvement in demand. The construction market has somewhat bounced back while the manufacturing market has remained almost consistent. The company is also seeing some progress around its vending program (FAST Solutions). The daily sales growth rates declined in the second and third quarters due to uncertainty in the growth outlook of Fastenal's end markets. However, daily sales re-accelerated in September, which is an encouraging sign. Further, though fastener sales have been weak since the past few quarters, management has plans to re-invigorate fastener sales in 2013.Fastenal has adopted FAST Solutions, an industrial vending process that has the potential to revolutionize the industrial distribution system and to increase profitability. The company installs vending machines at a customer's location and keeps it filled with products they need. These vending machines inform the customer what and how they are using these products, which subsequently results in controlling the customer's inventory and administrative cost while reducing product consumption. Fastenal is fast accelerating its vending contract signings and installations.We are also encouraged by Fastenal's numerous growth drivers like government business and metalworking. Fastenal has increased focus on metal working products, which has begun to show progress. In fact, the company is looking forward to offer its metal work supplies to other companies. Fastenal's service business, Fastenal Manufacturing, reworks on fasteners as well as makes many specialized part from exotic materials for specific purposes. Fastenal intends to be more involved in government business and currently has 31 government contracts in hand. Its metalworking and government business are growing 10% faster than company averages. The company's internet business is also improving. The company has also built a national accounts team, which is dedicated to servicing corporate customers and signed 186 new national account customers in 2011. These initiatives are gaining traction and will help to achieve future profitability.Other than that, the company's strategy of new store openings will pave the way for future growth.

The company paid a dividend of 74 cents per share for fiscal 2012 compared with 65 cents for fiscal 2011.

As a result, daily sales grew 6.8% in the month of October 2012, which is an encouraging sign.Moreover, Fastenal is accelerating its vending contract signings and installations. We are also encouraged by Fastenal's numerous growth drivers like government business and metalworking, which are gaining traction and will help to achieve future profitability.

"espite continued turbulence in the global news flow (S&P downgrading Spain's debt once again, Greece's unemployment rate jumping over 25% for first time ever), traders have been viewing the recent stock tape action as nothing more than the usual pullback. With the amount of bailouts or rumored bailouts, it has paid to be a buyer on any pullbacks. Will this trend be changing? We're certainly keeping an eye on this potential shift.Tobacco plays like Reynolds American (  ) and Altria Group (  ) continue to lag the action as some market watchers fear the as-of-yet undetermined potential dividend tax rate hike as a possible overhang. Some long-term holders of these stocks could be positioning themselves to avoid the possible dividend tax hike for next year. As I've said numerous times, we at Dividend.com will withhold judgement on a potential dividend tax change until it's actually decided. As of now, any tax changes are just political footballs being passed around in attempts to sway voters this election season. We'll be sure to keep readers abreast of the exact change, if and when it's finally decided. One final note on the potential for higher dividend taxes: just remember that we've seen much higher dividend taxes in the past, yet dividend stocks still outperformed non-dividend stocks over the long term by a wide margin. With interest rates are all-time low levels, people looking for for solid yield will still find it in dividend payers, regardless of the potential tax hike.Looking at earnings-related moves today, Fastenal (  ) jumped higher following its earnings results. The company also announced a 10% boost to its dividend payout. Meanwhile, supermarket giant Safeway (  ) headed lower following its earnings numbers released before the bell. Despite the late-day pullback, credit card names like Mastercard (  ) and Visa (  ) remained resilient as momentum traders pushed those key plays higher.You have probably heard me use the phrase ""hustle"" when I describe the work ethic many successful individuals tend to display. In order to achieve a regular dose of accomplishments, however, you must consider how to pace your mind. You need to be able to focus on the key tasks that need to be completed throughout each day. I tend to take copious notes in a daily notebook I keep, so I have constant reminders of my headline tasks that need to be addressed.Whether you are an entrepreneur like myself or you work for a corporation or small business, you should consider formulating a daily plan to highlight the biggest moments of each day. When it comes to investing, the same idea makes a ton of sense as well. Plan to regularly review the earnings results of stocks you own (or are considering owning), and take note of how the stocks react following earnings results or analyst commentary. Also, building long-term wealth involves a methodical approach of committing capital to investments on a regular basis. I tend to recommend investors consider making monthly deposits in their brokerage accounts, and using those funds to purchase the best high-quality dividend stocks possible. This process will help you avoid the mistake of trying to time the markets, which is almost impossible (even for the most experienced and sophisticated investors out there). Remember, no one can pick an exact market top or market bottom!All the things you plan well for will eventually lead to piling up wins, both in your career and in your investing. There are only so many hours in each day, however, so try and budget your time as wisely as possible. Identify the most important tasks you absolutely need to accomplish each day, and make sure you get those done. Challenge yourself to get as much done as you can, but if you try to do way too much, you'll likely burn out. Plus, you may eventually lose the ability to discern between a legitimate opportunity and one that's just a waste of time.We recently updated our list of dividend stocks that have been paying out dividends for 25 years or more. Be sure to check out  .Financial blog DailyReckoning.com recently took a look at the difference dividend payouts made in the overall return investors saw throughout the prior decades. Here are some of the highlights:- The Nasdaq is down 28% since the end of 1999. Even the ""blue chip"" S&P 500 stocks are down 15% during that time frame…until you add back those ""boring"" dividends. With dividends included, the S&P 500′s 15% loss flips to a 6% gain.- Without dividends, the S&P 500 index would have produced a loss for the 25 long years from August 1929 to August 1954. Then again, without dividends, the S&P 500 produced a 5% loss during the 13 years from September 1961 to September 1974. But with dividends included, the S&P's loss became a 46% gain.- Over the course of the last half-century, dividends have contributed more than half of the stock market's total return - 56%, to be exact.Of course, you can't discuss the potency of dividend investing without making mention of how awesome compound returns are. I can't stress enough the power of compound interest: you take a small amount of money and turn it into a large amount over time.

 (  ) reported diluted earnings of 33 cents per share in the fourth quarter of 2012, up 10.0% on the back of decent margin growth. The company's earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Fastenal reported net sales of $757.2 million, up 8.5% year over year. Revenues were also in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Both earnings and revenues declined sequentially.We believe that the fourth quarter was the weakest for the company in terms of sales growth. Fastenal serves customers in the manufacturing and non-residential construction markets. It performed poorly in both the markets.Fastenal's daily sales growth rates in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2012 have been lower than that of the first quarter as well as year-ago comparable periods.Daily sales growth rates declined sharply in the fourth quarter due to end market slowdown, the negative impact from Hurricane Sandy and foreign currency headwinds. Daily sales growth rates stood at 6.8%, 8.2% and 9.7% for the months of October, November and December, respectively, significantly down from the daily growth rates of 21.4%, 22.2% and 21.2% in the corresponding prior-year months.The sequential change in daily sales for 10 months from January to October also fell short of historical averages. Foreign exchange negatively impacted the fourth quarter daily sales growth rates by 0.1%.Daily sales to manufacturing customers (representing almost 50% of revenues) grew 9.7% in the fourth quarter, much below the growth of 21.0% in the prior-year quarter and 14.0% in the preceding quarter. Daily sales growth rates to manufacturing customers have declined sharply due to lower sales of its fasteners product line, which are being hurt by end market slowdown and broader economic uncertainty.In the non-residential construction market, daily sales to the non-residential construction customers (representing 20% to 25% of revenues) grew 4.2% in fourth quarter of 2012, down from 17.4% recorded in the fourth quarter of 2011 and 8.2% in the third quarter of 2012. Management blamed the weakness in the overall non-residential construction market and the political instability in U.S for the decline in this business.The company has adopted FAST Solutions, an industrial vending process that has the potential to revolutionize the industrial distribution system and increase profitability. The company installs vending machines that aid in controlling inventory and administrative costs while reducing product consumption. Despite all overall weak sales, the company is seeing some progress around its vending program.In the fourth quarter, the company installed 4,082 machines with the cumulative machines installed standing at 21,095 at the end of the year. The vending machines now account for over 25% of the company's sales. During the quarter, the company signed 5,591 vending machine contracts, up 4.8% sequentially. The daily sales growth to customers using vending machines was 28.6% in the fourth quarter, down from 40.7% in the prior-year quarter and 32.9% in the prior quarter.In 2013, the company aims to sign 2,500 machines per month or 30,000 per year, much more than its earlier expectation of signing 2,500 machines per quarter or 10,000 per year.In fourth quarter of 2012, gross margin improved 40 basis points from the prior-year quarter to 51.6% due to lower freight utilization, which in turn was due to low business volume. The company believes that its normal gross margin range is 51% to 53%.In fiscal 2012, the company witnessed a 13.3% increase in revenue to $3.13 billion, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Adjusted earnings were $1.42 per share, which were also in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Earnings increased 17.4% from prior year.Fastenal carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). However, we cannot rule out a rating downgrade with yet another weak quarter being reported.With the overall housing market improving steadily, there are many housing companies that are currently performing well, have a bright outlook and are worth considering. These include  (  ) - Zacks Rank #2 (Buy),  (  ) - Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and  (  ) - Zacks Rank #2.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Another Weak Quarter for Fastenal - Analyst Blog@2013-01-17@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/another-weak-quarter-fastenal-analyst-blog-2013-01-17
 (  ) reported diluted earnings of 37 cents per share in the third quarter of 2012, up 12.1% year over year, attributable to double digit top-line growth. The company's earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.The company reported net sales (adjusted according to the number of working days) of $802.6 million in the third quarter of 2012, up 12.2% year over year. Total revenue, however, marginally missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $804 million.Daily sales growth rates stood at 12.1%, 12.0% and 12.9%, respectively, for the months of July, August and September, significantly down from the daily growth rates of 22.4%, 20.0% and 18.8% in the corresponding prior-year months.The decline in daily sales growth rates was due to continued slowdown in the construction market and unfavorable currency translations. Unfavorable currency impact resulted in a 0.2% decline in daily sales in the quarter.Fastenal operates in the manufacturing and non-residential construction markets. The company supplies two types of products to manufacturing customers, one for industrial production and the other for maintenance of the manufacturing business.The products for industrial production become part of the finished goods manufactured by the customers. During third quarter 2012, the performance of industrial production goods was weaker than maintenance goods. Daily sales growth rate of manufacturing customers (representing almost 50% of revenues) declined to 14.0% in third quarter of 2012 from 18.3% in the prior-year quarter.Sales growth of goods for industrial production dipped significantly, owing to a 940 basis point drop in daily sales growth rates of the fastener products to 6.0% in the quarter. This segment was affected by the downward movements of the Purchasing Manufacturers Index ('PMI') of 49.8, 49.6 and 51.5 for the months of July, August and September, respectively in 2012, from 51.4, 52.5 and 52.5 for the months of July, August and September, respectively in 2011.The products for maintenance of the manufacturing business are used for maintaining the facility or the equipments used by the customers. Segment sales growth rate was 18.0% in the third quarter 2012, down 710 basis points sequentially.In the non-residential construction market, daily sales to the non-residential construction customers (representing 20% to 25% of revenues) grew 8.2% in third quarter of 2012, down from 15.8% recorded in the year-ago period.The company's cost of sales for the quarter was $388.2 million, up 11% year over year. Gross profit for third quarter of 2012 was $414.4 million, up 10% from the prior year quarter. In third quarter of 2012, gross margin declined 30 basis points from prior year quarter to 51.6% due to unfavorable currency translations. The company believes its normal gross margin range is 51% to 53%.On October 10, 2012, Fastenal declared a quarterly cash dividend of 21 cents per share on the company's common stock. The dividend is payable on November 26, 2012 to stockholders of record as of October 29, 2012.Fastenal had 2,650 stores at the end of third quarter of 2012, up from 2635 stores in the year-ago comparable quarter. Of the 2,650 stores, 20 new stores were opened and 6 stores were closed in the third quarter of 2012.The sequential change in daily sales for the first half of 2012 was also below historical averages, highlighting the rising uncertainty in the growth outlook of Fastenal's end markets. Moreover, Fastenal's 'pathway to profit' strategy has failed to achieve its desired results. Other than that, the company's strategy of new store openings significantly hurt near-term profitability due to the start-up costs involved in opening a new store.We currently have an Underperform recommendation on Fastenal over the long term. The stock carries a Zacks #4 Rank that translates into a short-term Sell rating. On the other hand,  (  ), one of the largest home improvement retailers, carries a Zacks #2 Rank (a short-term Buy rating). We have a long-term Neutral recommendation on the stock.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Fastenal Meets EPS Est, Sales Lag - Analyst Blog@2012-10-11@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/fastenal-meets-eps-est-sales-lag-analyst-blog-2012-10-11

 (  ), one of the leading distributors/retailers of industrial and construction supplies, is set to unveil its third quarter 2012 results on October 11, 2012, before the market opens. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third quarter earnings is 37 cents a share on revenues of $804 million.Fastenal Company reported diluted earnings of 38 cents a share in the second quarter of 2012, up 18.8% year over year on the back of top-line growth, offset by margin declines. The company's earnings barely beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.The company reported net sales of $805 million in the second quarter of 2012, up 14.7% over the prior-year quarter. Total revenue, however, fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $806 million, mainly due to a slowdown in sales to manufacturing customers. Daily sales growth rates declined sharply in the quarter due to end market slowdown as well as foreign currency headwinds. Daily sales growth rates stood at 17.3%, 13.1% and 14.0%, respectively, for the months of April, May and June, significantly down from the daily growth rates in the corresponding prior-year months.None of the 9 estimates for the third quarter of 2012 were revised in the last 7 days. However, over the last 30 days, 2 out of the 9 estimates were lowered.Similarly, in the last 7 days, none of the 10 estimates for the full year 2012 were revised. However, over the last 30 days, 3 out of the 10 estimates were revised downward for the full year 2012.The non residential construction market is sluggish, with a single-digit growth rate. The company is already under a lot of pressure and the lack of significant activity in the construction market will further impact its performance. This might have pushed some of the estimates downward as well.Given the limited estimate revisions, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter of fiscal 2012 has remained static over the last 7 days at earnings of 37 cents a share. However, the estimate has declined by a penny from 38 cents over the last 30 days.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2012 has remained static over the last 7 and 30 days at earnings of $1.44 per share.Fastenal's results have been in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the four preceding quarters, beating the estimate once in the second quarter of 2012. On an average, the earnings surprise was 2.70% in the trailing four quarters.The extremely sluggish economy is taking a toll on the company's business and we do not see the situation improving in the next few months. Moreover, Fastenal's 'pathway to profit' strategy has failed to achieve its desired results Other than that, the company's strategy of new store openings significantly hurt near-term profitability due to the start-up costs involved.We currently have 'Underperform' recommendation on Fastenal in the long term.

his morning's dramatically positive Jobless Claims data will likely do little to cheer the market, as investors will likely see it lowering the odds of further monetary stimulus from the Fed in the coming days. The overall backdrop for the market has been steadily weakening in recent weeks, be it the domestic economic outlook, the corporate earnings scene or the international growth environment. And many have been looking towards the Fed to come back to the market's rescue.The market didn't seem to be sufficiently impressed with Wednesday's Fed minutes, but the overall tone coming through the minutes is of a Central Bank ready to take more action. While the committee did not announce a new round of bond purchases and decided instead to extend Operation Twist, 'several members' did acknowledge the need for more policy stimulus should the recovery lose momentum.Notwithstanding this morning's surprisingly positive Jobless Claims reading, the overall trend line of economic reports has lately been on the weaker side. And by the time the FOMC meets again in August, we will have the July non-farm payroll report and the second quarter GDP reading available. The GDP report will most likely show quarterly growth less than the first quarter's 1.9% pace.I would think that the possibility of a QE announcement in the August meeting will increase significantly if the July jobs report is along the same lines as the last few readings. But this morning's initial Jobless Claims reading runs to counter to the economy-is-losing-momentum narrative, and could change the tone of market discourse if sustained over the next few weeks.The initial Jobless Claims report is very positive as it reverses the stalling trend of the last few weeks. Initial Claims dropped 26K last week to 350K, the lowest level in more than three years. The four-week average, which smooths out the week-to-week volatility, dropped by 9.8 to 376K.Jobless Claims at this level would be consistent with monthly job gains much better than what we have been seeing in the last few months. The key would be whether today's report is a one-off reading or the start of something more enduring.On the earnings front, industrial supplier  (  ) beat EPS by a penny, though it came modestly short of revenue expectations. Shares of  (  ) will be in the spotlight today as the grocery-store operator not only reported weaker than expected results, but also announced suspension of its dividend and withdrawal of its full-year guidance.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Jobless Claims Lowest in Years.

e have downgraded our rating on  (  ) from Neutral to Underperform following unimpressive second quarter results.Though the company's second quarter 2012 earnings of 38 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny, total revenue of $805 million was below Zacks Consensus Estimate of $806 million mainly due to a slowdown in sales to manufacturing customers. Daily sales growth rates declined sharply in the quarter due to a sluggish market as well as foreign currency headwinds. Daily sales growth rates stood at 17.3%, 13.1% and 14.0%, respectively, for the months of April, May and June, significantly down from the daily growth rates in the corresponding prior-year months.

In the second quarter, sales growth of fastener products used mainly for industrial production was significantly less than the first quarter and even less than 2011 and 2010. The sequential change in daily sales for the first half of 2012 was also below historical averages highlighting the rising uncertainty in the growth outlook of Fastenal's end markets.Fastenal's current business strategy involves the opening of new stores at a very fast pace. Though this builds the infrastructure for future growth, it significantly hurts near-term profitability due to the start-up costs involved in opening a new store. Moreover, a new store takes time to build a customer base and typically requires 10 to 12 months to achieve its first profitable month. Moreover, opening stores in new locations also pose challenges.The company had introduced its 'pathway to profit' strategy, in 2007, which called for a slowdown in the pace of store openings and instead use the resultant savings to increase the headcount in stores. This plan aimed to increase average annual per store sales, capturing earnings leverage, and increasing pre-tax earnings. The company aimed to grow its average store sales to $125 thousand per month in order to achieve pre-tax earnings growth as a percent of net sales of 23% (up from 18%) by 2012. However, the company failed to achieve its goal as the new store opening plan was reduced to a range of 2%-5% and headcount additions were almost stopped during the economic setback in 2008-2009. Now, with the economy slightly improving, the company hopes to meet its pre-tax earnings percentage goal with less than the $125 thousand per month figure. Fastenal believes the pre-tax earnings percent goal of 23% might be accomplished with average store sales as low as $100 to $110 thousand per month through cost control in 2013. We are skeptical of the company's ability to achieve the set targets.All these factors combined with the margin pressures due to rising cost of fuel has forced us to downgrade our recommendation on shares of Fastenal.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Fastenal Down to Underperform - Analyst Blog@2012-07-20@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/fastenal-down-to-underperform-analyst-blog-2012-07-20

hursday, July 12, 2012This morning's dramatically positive Jobless Claims data will likely do little to cheer the market, as investors will likely see it lowering the odds of further monetary stimulus from the Fed in the coming days. The overall backdrop for the market has been steadily weakening in recent weeks, be it the domestic economic outlook, the corporate earnings scene or the international growth environment. And many have been looking towards the Fed to come back to the market's rescue.The market didn't seem to be sufficiently impressed with Wednesday's Fed minutes, but the overall tone coming through the minutes is of a central bank ready to take more action. While the committee did not announce a new round of bond purchases and decided instead to extend Operation Twist, 'several members' did acknowledge the need for more policy stimulus should the recovery lose momentum.Notwithstanding this morning's surprisingly positive Jobless Claims reading, the overall trend line of economic reports has lately been on the weaker side. And by the time the FOMC meets again in August, we will have the July non-farm payroll report and the second quarter GDP reading available. The GDP report will most likely show quarterly growth less than the first quarter's 1.9% pace. I would think that the possibility of a QE announcement in the August meeting will increase significantly if the July jobs reports is along the same lines as the last few readings. But this morning's initial Jobless Claims reading runs to counter to the economy-is-losing-momentum narrative and could change the tone of market discourse if sustained over the next few weeks.The initial Jobless Claims report is very positive as it reverses the stalling trend of the last few weeks. Initial Claims dropped 26K last week to 350K, the lowest level in more than three years. The four-week average, which smoothes out the week-to-week volatility, dropped by 9.8 to 376K. Jobless Claims at this level would be consistent with monthly job gains much better than what we have been seeing in the last few months. The key would be whether today's report is a one-off reading or the start of something more enduring.On the earnings front, industrial supplier  ) beat EPS by a penny, though it came modestly short of revenue expectations. Shares of  ) will be in the spotlight today as the grocery-store operator not only reported weaker than expected results, but also announced suspension of its dividend and withdrawal of its full year guidance.Sheraz MianDirector of ResearchThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Ahead of Wall Street - July 12, 2012 - Ahead of Wall Street@2012-07-12@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ahead-wall-street-july-12-2012-ahead-wall-street-2012-07-12
"he recent selling trend continued today, as investors weigh the possibility of global economic stimulus failing to lift many boats.From an earnings standpoint, we saw a bit of a divergence in today's results. On the upside, SAP (  ) made some bullish comments and Fastenal (  ) is seeing a bit of a bounce after finally releasing their results, which they had previously warned would fall short. On the flip side, investors were not too enamored with results from Infosys Ltd. (  ) and Marriott International (  ).Elsewhere, cautious Wall Street analyst commentary had stocks like Family Dollar Stores (  ), Hormel Foods (  ), Texas Instruments (  ), and Las Vegas Sands (  ) moving lower. Lastly, shares of Procter & Gamble (  ) bucking the selling, with the shares rallying on the news Bill Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management has taken a stake in the consumer goods giant.Earlier this morning I saw this headline come across the wires:  I needed to look at the number several times to believe it. We at Dividend.com are located in South Jersey, just a stone's throw from Atlantic City, so this news cannot bode well for the local market here (Las Vegas is typically a much stronger casino market than Atlantic City).I've been closely tracking the drop in luxury brand shares like Coach (  ), Tiffany (  ), and Ralph Lauren (  ), as well as dividend-paying casino giants Wynn Resorts (  ) and Las Vegas Sands (  ). These moves give me pause about the health of the overall economy.Putting the odd diversions of daily economic data aside (one day things look great and the next it's back to ""what can the Federal Reserve do to stimulate things?""), the proof our concerns are valid are coming across the stock tape on a daily basis. As a pricing mechanism, the stock market tends to do a fairly good job pricing forward news pretty well (granted the bubbles we see on occasion are the result of manic traders which eventually do get resolved for better or worse - usually worse for traders that can not balance themselves properly between fear and greed).The repercussions of the high end of the market slowing down can have a substantial impact on the whole economy. If you think about it, the spending power of those in the higher income brackets tends to get stronger as economic/investing situations show signs of stress. Hence the importance of trying to stay ahead of the curve when it comes to your earning power. When I refer to the term ""hustling,"" it's not just about making enough money to keep the lights on, or buying a minimal amount of quality dividend stocks each month. Rather, hustling involves going above and beyond the ""normal"" expectations for monthly income. I can tell you this: the government will not stop hiking taxes, whether it's on your spending, what you earn, or your investment income.It is paramount today, more than ever, to get as far ahead as soon as you can. Once you reach the higher tax brackets, you too can take advantage of lower-priced investments (stocks, real estate) during economic lulls. I have known many great investors who made their best moves in times of crisis. Why can't we all do the same? We can and we will - if we are able to make the extra sacrifices that puts us in a position of financial strength. That way, when opportunities present themselves, we'll be ready to act. Of course, you'll also need to actively seek those opportunities. Most good deals don't just fall into your lap!We recently updated our list of dividend stocks that have been paying out dividends for 25 years or more. Be sure to check out  .Financial blog DailyReckoning.com recently took a look at the difference dividend payouts made in the overall return investors saw throughout the prior decades. Here are some of the highlights:- The Nasdaq is down 28% since the end of 1999. Even the ""blue chip"" S&P 500 stocks are down 15% during that time frame…until you add back those ""boring"" dividends. With dividends included, the S&P 500′s 15% loss flips to a 6% gain.- Without dividends, the S&P 500 index would have produced a loss for the 25 long years from August 1929 to August 1954. Then again, without dividends, the S&P 500 produced a 5% loss during the 13 years from September 1961 to September 1974. But with dividends included, the S&P's loss became a 46% gain.- Over the course of the last half-century, dividends have contributed more than half of the stock market's total return - 56%, to be exact.Of course, you can't discuss the potency of dividend investing without making mention of how awesome compound returns are. I can't stress enough the power of compound interest: you take a small amount of money and turn it into a large amount over time.

"he bailout news over the weekend regarding Spain had a big open for the markets written all over it, but the early pop quickly fizzled. Looking at the financial sector, we noticed the first signs of investor concerns creeping in late morning as market watchers began to chime in with thoughts that Spain will not be the last major country bailout.W.W. Grainger (  ) ended lower following  GWW's weakness follows the lead of competitor Fastenal (  ), which was cautious in its own sales update last week. McDonald's (  ) shares fell as  following the company's second consecutive  . Main competitor Yum Brands (  ) was also down in unison. Apple (  ) shares gave up much of its intraday spike following the company's updates during its worldwide developer's conference. Finally, oil (  ) prices reversed early gains to close nearly $4 off its morning highs.I'm not sure how many of our readers are boxing fans, but I've followed the sport for many years. Over that time, I've grown used to seeing bad judging decisions, so when I read that Manny Pacquiao lost a controversial split decision Saturday night to new WBO welterweight champion Timothy Bradley, I just shrugged my shoulders. One of the best analysts in the boxing game, HBO's Harold Lederman, scored the fight 11 rounds to 1 for Pacquaio. That scorecard gives you an idea of how much Pacquiao dominated the fight - yet he still somehow emerged the ""loser.""I remember back in the 80′s, my friends and I used to pay to see ""closed-circuit"" boxing events at a local theater. We normally enjoyed these events, until we saw Mike Tyson annihilate Michael Spinks back in 1988. Tyson knocked Spinks out in the very first round, and I really felt like I wasted my money on that fight. From that point on, my friends and I lost a lot of our taste for the big events.Obviously, the sports media has jumped all over the latest boxing controversy. Discussions have arisen about how boxing fans were burned on Pacquiao's controversial loss. A large amount of commentators will mention that ""fans don't have to buy the Pacquiao-Bradley rematch (coming to pay-per-view in November) if they don't want to.""The business media reacts similarly to big controversies. Just look at Facebook's (  ) IPO debacle, and how the media has stepped up to console the poor investors who who've lost money as a result of buying FB shares. How long does this commentary last, though? Just as the sports media will soon move on to promoting the next big boxing match, so too will the financial media begin touting the next great tech IPO.We all have the ability to decide what we spend our hard-earned money on. We can also pick and choose our own sources of information. Back in the 90′s, I remember watching CNBC/Bloomberg all the time, as I was going through my initial education of life as a trader. I quickly learned the more I tuned in, the less success and confidence I had that I was making the right investing decisions. Remember, the objective of the media is to keep viewers coming back day after day. They accomplish this aim by providing various one-sided (and sometimes controversial) opinions on investing topics. It's just a chase for ratings.I hope that as an investor, you've learned your lessons early on about who to trust for your information. Just as I no longer waste my money on much-hyped boxing events, I also steer clear of the latest flavor-of-the-day investing ideas. I trust you can do the same.We're sometimes asked by subscribers why our recommended stocks don't have higher ratings. It's pretty simple. When you are in the type of economic environment we have now, where $125 billion bailouts (i.e. Spain this past weekend) take on a celebratory tone, we have to ask ourselves if what we are putting our money into is more ""smoke and mirrors"" than solid investment ideas. For the most part, the markets have been super-volatile since the birth of Dividend.com (back in early 2008), and we feel we have ridden out the ups and downs as well as anyone has when it comes to  and opinion.Determining our position in the economic/investing cycle is our biggest focus, and the answers to that situation are never clear. That said, we also know investors are struggling to find income sources they can rely on. With record-low interest rates continuing to deplete many savers' holdings, people sometimes get desperate in the pursuit of yield. We understand the frustration and it is never our intent to sour investors on income-producing ideas. We simply must maintain a strict  criteria regardless of investor sentiment.We just debuted our brand new 275-page eBook, exclusively on Dividend.com!

hursday, April 12, 2012This morning's economic data provides no comfort to those looking for evidence that last Friday's jobs miss was a one-off event. We have a big negative jump in Initial Jobless Claims, which could be interpreted as confirmatory of the March payroll miss. But it may be premature to reach that conclusion given the impact that the Easter holiday had on these numbers. The inflation data this morning - benign on the 'headline', but somewhat hot on the 'core' - is not consistent with it needs to show to pave the way for further QE from the Fed. All in all, this morning's basket of data provides no clarity about the underlying economic picture.The initial Jobless Claims data came in weaker than expected, the second soft labor market reading after Friday's surprise non-farm payroll miss for March. When you add in the 10K upward revision to the previous week's tally, we saw a 23K jump in initial claims to 380K. The four-week average, which tends to smooth out the inherent week-to-week jumpiness of this series, increased by 4.2K to 368.5K last week.The increase in claims was not altogether unexpected given the earlier Easter holiday in the survey week, but the extent of the jump is nevertheless disappointing. This is particularly so as many in the market were looking this report to confirm that the payroll miss last Friday was a surprise one-off event. Optimists, like myself, will continue to assign the blame for today's claims miss on the inherent difficulties and complications of seasonal adjustments. But this argument will become weaker if this negative trend fails to reverse in the coming weeks.In other economic news this morning, the March Producer Price Index (PPI) came in weaker than expected on the 'headline' at 'unchanged' vs. up 0.4% in February. The 'core' reading, which strips out the food and energy components, came in hotter than expected at up 0.3% vs. up 0.2% in February. We will get the March CPI report tomorrow, but this PPI reading is not benign enough from a QE perspective. Meaning that those looking for further Fed action will see it as a negative read. Overall though, the PPI reading appears to show some pricing pressures building in the supply chain, but there is no reason to doubt the Fed's view that these pressures will prove to be temporary.On the earnings front, we a better than expected showing from  (  ) this morning, while earnings from  l (  ), the nuts and bolts distributor, came in-line with expectations.

"s far as the markets went for much of morning, I think one word would sum things up perfectly: ""trendless."" However as the afternoon went on, we did see a bit of buying from investors.Looking at some of the day's big movers, we saw a bit of bounce for recently beaten-up commodity and financial plays, including CF Industries (  ), Joy Global (  ), JP Morgan (  ), Capital One Financial (  ), and Prudential (  ). Starbucks (  ) shares fell following news of the company's $100 million bakery acquisition. Also selling off were shares of Fastenal (  ) following the company's May sales guidance. Their news also hurt shares of competitor W.W. Grainger (  ).We removed a dividend stock from our  this morning. We still like the name, but would wait to add new money to the shares for now. Check out the name we downgraded  .Despite the recent pullback in the public stock markets, the private markets, where start-ups are growing and disrupting current industries, are still running strong. Companies in the private space are still being acquired for significant multiples of revenue. Many companies are also able to raise tens and even hundreds of millions of dollars in financing.I like to follow this development because it relates to the public markets. Public companies are clearly still confident paying a premium for much smaller entities. Granted, some acquisitions may be out of fear that upstart companies could disrupt the acquirer's current business. When the spigot is finally shut off to these private acquisition targets, it could then be a sign that valuations (both public and private) may have some downside. We haven't seen anything to indicate a slowdown yet, however.It's been quite an eventful year helping coach my son's baseball team. One player in particular has had the misfortune of being hit by opposing pitchers multiple times, mostly early in the season. As a result, this young man stopped swinging the bat altogether. Instead, he simply jumps out of the batters' box each time a pitch is thrown.The other coaches and I have worked on getting him to avoid this ""bailing out"" behavior. The process hasn't been easy, of course. As time went on, however, the young man began developing some confidence and actually swung the bat again. Even though he's struck out a couple of times, it's clear he's been making strides. Toward the end of one recent game, he drew a walk from the pitcher. Later in the inning, he came flying around the bases and scored a big run for us. He got to the bench and his teammates met him with high fives and praise. All he had to do was get back in the box and start swinging again!For investors, the recent market pullback is similar to being hit by a pitch in baseball. It stings to see shares of companies you own fall. Just remember, with dividend stocks, the gial isn't to see instant profits following a purchase. Instead, dividend investing is about buying income-producing assets as part of your long-term wealth-building plan.So if you've become gun-shy following the recent market downturn, I suggest you try getting back into the box. Don't be afraid to swing the bat again just because you've been hit a few times.As the markets continue to gyrate, we're dedicate to making any and all ratings changes necessary to ensure investors that are committing new capital only to the best possible dividend stocks. If we think a stock needs to be removed and profits be taken, we'll make the call. If we think a recent recommendation needs to come off sooner than one would expect, but is still a name worth holding, we'll make the ""hold"" call. We are closely tracking the indices, fundamentals, economic data, and other factors that can affect the markets - you can be assured of that.At Dividend.com, we maintain our focus on the best income-producing investments the markets have to offer during time of heightened volatility. We want to make sure we have only the most pullback-resistant names on our  . Also, if we see the market putting in what looks like a decent bottom, we will be prepared to scale up the list of stocks we like. Stay tuned and be sure to look for  member alerts along the way.

 . (  ), one of the leading distributors/retailers of industrial and construction supplies, is set to unveil its second quarter 2012 results on July 12, 2012, before the market opens. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter earnings is 37 cents on revenues of $806 million.Fastenal reported diluted earnings of $0.34 per share in the first quarter of 2012, up 25.9% year over year as top-line growth offset weak margins. The company's results were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Fastenal reported strong net sales of $768.9 million in the first quarter of 2012, up 20.2% year over year. Top-line growth was driven by a gradual recovery in global economic conditions and aggressive store openings.None of the eight estimates for the second quarter of 2012 were lowered in the last 7 days. Over the last 30 days, two out of the eight estimates were lowered.Similarly, in the last 7 days, none of the eight estimates were revised downward for the full year 2012. Over the last 30 days, two out of eight estimates were revised downward for the full year 2012.During the first quarter of 2012, Fastenal had focused more on its growth strategies than gross margin discipline. The gross margin may remain weak in the next quarter as pricing can take time and product and customer mix remain headwinds. This might have pushed some of the estimates downward.Given the limited estimate revisions, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter of fiscal 2012 has remained static over the last 7 as well as 30 days at earnings of 37 cents. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2012 declined by 2 cents to earnings of $1.42 per share in the last 30 days, although there was no movement during the past 7 days.Fastenal's results have been in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the past three quarters. However, the company surpassed the estimate for the second quarter of 2011. On average, the surprise was a 6.67% in the trailing four quarters.The extremely sluggish economy is taking a toll on the company's business and we do not expect the situation to improve in the coming few months.

irst quarter earnings begin to trickle in as Alcoa kicks off the new earnings season this week. It will be followed in short order by results from Google, JP Morgan, Wells Fargo and others. Investors looking for signs indicating how first-quarter earnings will shake out may be pleased with the anticipated earnings growth from Google and Wells Fargo, but not so much by the expected earnings decline from JP Morgan and the net loss from Alcoa. That assumes that the analysts' forecasts are correct, of course. Here is a look at what analysts are looking for in this week's most prominent reports.The consensus forecast for leading global producer of aluminum  (NYSE:  ) calls for a net loss of $0.04 per share and revenues of $5.8 billion. That compares to earnings of $0.28 per share and sales of $5.9 billion in the first quarter of last year. That EPS forecast is the same as it was 60 days ago. Alcoa has not offered a positive surprise in the past three quarters, but before that beat estimates for five quarters in a row. The company is scheduled to announce its results Tuesday afternoon.In its Thursday report, earnings from  (NASDAQ:  ) are estimated to be $9.64 per share for the first quarter. That would be a year-over-year increase of 16.2%. And note that 60 days ago the consensus EPS estimate was $9.57. Revenues are expected to total $8.1 billion, which would be 24.4% higher. And both EPS and sales also are expected to be sequentially and year-over-year higher in the current quarter. But note that Google fell short of analysts' estimates in two of the past six quarters, including a miss of almost a dollar per share in the fourth quarter.First-quarter 2012 earnings from  (NYSE:  ), one of the largest banks in the U.S., are estimated to total $1.15 per share on revenues of $24.6 billion in Friday's report. In the same quarter of last year, the New York-based company posted $1.28 per share and $25.8 billion. But sixty days ago, the consensus forecast called for EPS of just $1.10. Analysts also anticipate a year-over-year slump of both EPS and revenue in the current quarter. JP Morgan has not fallen short of consensus EPS estimates in more than eight quarters.Also on Friday, San Francisco-based  (NYSE:  ) is expected to announce that its first-quarter 2012 earnings came to $0.72 per share on revenues of $20.4 billion. That would be up from $0.67 per share and $20.3 billion in the same period of last year. That EPS estimate is unchanged from 60 days ago, and the consensus estimate for the current quarter has EPS sequentially and year-over-year higher. Note that analysts' estimates have come within a penny or two of EPS results in the past five quarters.Supermarket operator  's (NYSE:  ) fourth-quarter fiscal 2012 earnings are forecast to have fallen nine cents per share from a year ago to $0.35. Full-year EPS are expected to have fallen 11.5% to $1.23. Both EPS estimates are two cents lower than 90 days ago. And analysts anticipate revenues for the quarter will have fallen 4.0% to $8.3 billion, and for the full year they will be down 4.8% to $35.7 billion. The company is on tap to share results Tuesday morning.Analysts expect nuts and bolts maker  's (NASDAQ:  ) first-quarter earnings in Thursday's report to be 22.9% higher than a year ago to $0.35 per share. The company has not fallen short of consensus EPS estimates in the past eight quarters. Revenues are expected to be up 19.8% from a year ago to $767.6 million. Also, both EPS and sales for the current quarter are expected to be higher sequentially as well as year over year.Here is a peek at what analysts expect from some other companies reporting this week:The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Earnings Expectations for the Week of April 9 (AA, GOOG, JPM)@2012-04-08@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/earnings-expectations-week-april-9-aa-goog-jpm-2012-04-08

"he early optimism regarding strong monthly sales data from major auto makers Ford (  ) and Chrysler faded in the afternoon following the release of minutes from the Fed's latest Federal Open Market Committee meeting. The concern for some traders is that fewer Fed officials see the need for further stimulus, posing a potential setback if the economy continues to start and stop.As for stocks,shares of Molson Coors (  ) edged lower following news of the company's $2.65 Billion EUR acquisition of StarBev. Ford (  ) did see gains slip following its  . Meanwhile, Wall Street analyst downgrades pushed stocks like Newmont Mining (  ), Phillip Morris International (  ), and Fastenal (  ), and Coca-Cola (  ). Financials also fell as the afternoon lingered, led by Deutsche Bank (  ), Morgan Stanley (  ), and Goldman Sachs (  ).The New York Times ran a great story this past weekend about a 60-year old woman named Kathy Martin who now owns the best 3000 meter (1.86 miles) time for a female runner 60 years old and older. She just broke the record with a time of 11 minutes, 16.5 seconds. I do some running myself and let me tell you, that is a spectacular pace for anyone at any age.The thing about Kathy Martin is that she didn't start running until her late 40′s. Still, she's now become a world-class runner in a relatively short amount of time. Believe it or not, the same concept applies to investing.Let's say you just turned, and haven't invested a dime yet for retirement. You still have plenty of time to build a solid nest egg. Here's how: you can start maxing out a Roth IRA contribution ($5K/year currently, but in addition to the ""standard"" contribution limits, taxpayers age 50 and over are eligible to make a Roth IRA catch-up contribution of an additional $1K/year). If you were to invest just $5K per year for every year in your 50s, each $5K you invest would turn into more than $40K after 20 years (using the 11% historical return average for dividend stocks of price appreciation + dividends reinvested). So you see, it's never too late to get started!Now if you have kids, you may want to give them a quick lesson on how well they can do if they get started putting money to work early on in life. If your child invests just $5,000 by the time they turn 19 years of age, and does nothing else but buy dividend stocks and re-invest the dividends, he or she could end up with a $325k nest egg - again based on those historical 11% returns for dividend-paying stocks.Anyone trying to improve their life in some fashion (financial, health, etc.) has numerous options to consider. There are free options that can provide value if used correctly, and there are paid options that may or may not work as advertised.Often, I find that people focus too much on price. This tendency can be a real disadvantage, particularly when someone really needs to change their lot in life. When it comes to investing in yourself, a college education is often pointed to as a common step to adding value to one's yet-to-be-determined earning ability. In the financial world that I am a part of, you have different niches that you can subscribe to, including trading options, ETF research, mutual funds, growth stocks, dividend stocks, and so on.Some of these services will be fairly affordable, but others will be quite pricey. Like trying to determine the difference between an expensive bottle of wine and a cheap one, you'll be surprised at the value to be found in some services that may be a bit cheaper than others (our  service is considered lower-to-middle of the pack).If you are serious about taking the next step from a knowledge standpoint and have the budget to do so, I would consider several sources as fixtures of your financial investment foundation. Just because you are done paying for college does not mean you should never spend another dime for a ""continuing"" education.

“A lot of people get upset that I’m very bullish for 2012″ says . “A lot of people, both citizens and the warlords in our own government, want America, capitalism, the Internet, the economy, all of our established institutions, to go down in flames. I don’t know why they want this.”Indeed, the country’s economy could greatly benefit from good news. Fortunately, positive economic indicators have been pouring in. Slowly but surely things are starting to look up.Altucher is feeling bullish about 2012. Sure, he says, “housing prices stink,” but inventory levels are dropping to the lowest levels since 2006. Home sales have even been up in the past few months.Corporate profits are at an all-time high, and yes, that makes some people very upset considering the state of everything else, but there’s a silver lining. Consider that higher corporate profits put more cash in the bank. “Do you know what happens when cash is sitting around doing nothing?”Answer: Buybacks. “Announced buybacks for 2012 has hit over $1.1 trillion, the first time this number has breached a trillion. Oh, and guess what, the number of shares outstanding has now gone down for three years in a row, for the first time since 1990.” Demand goes up, and so do prices.Unemployment is 1.2% lower than it was a year ago, and consumer spending is rising. “Personal incomes are actually UP 4% over the past year,” so are the number of temp jobs and the average hourly workweek. “Which means full time employment is going to continue to grow, as it has been all year.”Better yet: “Household debt obligations are the lowest since 1993. Mortgages, rents, car loans/leases and other debt services added together divided by income after taxes is the lowest since 1993.”Each of the positive indicators mentioned by Altucher have had their impact on the markets. As a point of fact, many have speculated negative news was so heavily priced into the market that any good headlines will have a more significant upside than further negativity. This means good news can lead to some quick rallies.So if you’re bullish on the 2012 outlook for stocks, you’re probably looking for momentum ideas…To help you get started, we created a list of about 160 stocks that are in rally mode–trading above their 20-day, 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages (SMA).In addition, all of these companies are more profitable than their competitors, based on gross and net profit margins.These rallying momentum stocks have a track record of being more profitable than their competitors–does that make their upward momentum more sustainable?1.  of all companies mentioned2.  mentioned below3.  mentionedList sorted by distance from the 200-day SMA.

astenal has been going straight up, and one investor wants to hedge against a pullback.optionMONSTER's Depth Charge tracking system detected the purchase of about 1,100 March 50 puts for $1.10. Roughly 3,300 March 45 puts were also sold for $0.20, resulting in a net cost of about $0.50.The trade will earn a maximum profit of 900 percent if FAST closes at $45 on expiration. Below that level, the investor will be forced to buy stock. The strategy is often used by shareholders who want to against a pullback, and wouldn't mind buying more in the event of push lower.It's known as a ratio spread because 3 times more puts were sold than were bought. See our Education Section for more.FAST slipped 0.18 percent to $50.73 on Friday but is up 59 percent in the last year. The industrial-supply company, which sells items such as bolts, machinery and paints, has increased profitability by slowing growth and focusing on better same-store sales. It has also avoided hiring new workers and is relying more on vending machines to sell products.Given how much the shares are up, some investors may think that they're due for a pullback, which appears to be the rationale behind Friday's spread.The trade accounted for almost all the volume in the session, with puts outnumbering calls by 8 to 1, according to the Depth Charge.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Fastenal attracts hedging strategy@2012-02-21@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/fastenal-attracts-hedging-strategy-2012-02-21
()The Federal Reserve’s Tuesday afternoon announcement highlighted the US economy’s exposure to financial troubles abroad while citing signs of moderate growth within the US.“Federal Reserve policy makers said the U.S. economy is maintaining its expansion even as the global economy slows, while refraining from taking new actions to lower borrowing costs,” reports .According to the Fed, issues pertaining to the unemployment rate “remain elevated” and debate exists on how to approach it. Similarly, interest rates, inflation and bond purchases bear addressing.But don’t hold your breath, members of the Fed are at ends of how to address these issues. More importantly, “any additional stimulus is greatly going to depend on what happens in Europe or any changes in the U.S. outlook,” said John Silvia, chief economist at Wells Fargo Securities LLC. “They will wait for a longer meeting, maybe in January, to come up with anything regarding communications.”The Fed said it expects inflation to settle at levels at or below those consistent with its price stability mandate. The Fed also noted it would keep its Fed funds target rate at low levels “at least through mid-2013.”Stocks dipped after the Fed’s statement, and the dollar rose against the Euro.In short, the Fed has taken no action, nor indicated strong intentions to make decisions in the future.The key takeaway was that the US’ greatest risk comes from troubles in Europe. Investors are sure to keep their eyes on the headline.Think things might improve?If so, you may be curious what companies could benefit most from increased growth in the US.

Moreover, the company has undertaken several steps that will simultaneously upgrade its services and reduce costs.Its hub and spoke model and aggressive store expansion strategy supported by an improving cash flow will also increase customer satisfaction and benefit its business going forward. The company's profits in the most recent quarter were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.33 per share.Therefore, we have upgraded our recommendation on the shares of Fastenal from Neutral to Outperform. Our $55 target price, 39.6x our 2012 EPS estimate, reflects this view. :We are downgrading our recommendation on  (  ) to Underperform based on the continuous deterioration in the premium revenue of its Bankers Life segment, coupled with the significant underwriting and pricing risks. The company's third-quarter earnings results were driven by poor top-line performance in most business segments.The current interest rate environment, which is generating spread compression, will continue to put pressure on the bottom line. We do not expect any significant improvement on that front in the forthcoming quarters as the pricing pressure is expected to persist for awhile.Our six-month target price of $5.75 equates to 7.9x our earnings estimate for 2011. This price target implies an expected negative total return of 10.9% over that period. This is consistent with our Underperform recommendation on the shares.Latest Posts on the Zacks  :Personal computer (  ) shipments continue to struggle as research firms Gartner and IDC reported a decline in PC shipments for the fourth quarter of 2011. Gartner and IDC estimate 1.4% and 0.2% declines in worldwide PC shipments, respectively in the fourth quarter.Worldwide PC shipments for the fourth quarter were in the range of 92 million and 93 million, as per Gartner and IDC. The adjusted figures could be gathered from the PC makers, as the companies release their quarterly reports in the coming weeks.This decline in PC shipments is attributable to various factors, the most important of them being the growing popularity of the mobile devices that are more convenient, less expensive and almost as powerful as PCs. The massive popularity of smartphones was primarily responsible for the decline in PC sales.In this regard, the iPhone needs a special mention as  (  ) iconic device has garnered a massive fan following since its launch in 2007.  (  ) Android operating system (used in more than 200 million smartphones across the world) has also contributed to the popularity of smartphones, which in turn has affected PC sales. This apart, with the advent of tablets, which are becoming increasingly popular, PC sales have further deteriorated. Global PC major  (  ) leads the pack with 16.0% of the total market share.The problems for the PC manufacturers were aggravated by the recent flood in Thailand, which disrupted the hard disk manufacturing process for some time, leading to hard-disk drive shortages, and thereby leading to a price increase, with a corresponding pressure on margins. The increase in costs is somewhat absorbed by the PC manufacturers, while the other part is passed on to the consumers through price increases.The greatest decline in PC shipments was reported in the US. Both Gartner and IDC calculated a fourth-quarter PC shipment decline of 5.0% to 6.0% in the US, which is the biggest fall in PC shipments in the last decade.Get the full analysis of all these stocks by going to  .Every day, the analysts at Zacks Equity Research select two stocks that are likely to outperform (Bull) or underperform (Bear) the markets over the next 3-6 months.Updated throughout every trading day, the  provides analysis from Zacks Equity Research about the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets.Zacks Equity Research provides the best of quantitative and qualitative analysis to help investors know what stocks to buy and which to sell for the long-term.Continuous analyst coverage is provided for a universe of 1,150 publicly traded stocks.

"hatter that the Federal Reserve is willing to continue its accommodation strategy (the proverbial ""punchbowl"" as some economists call it) had the markets regaining more of what they'd lost in the recent losing streak.The commodity sector reaped some of the biggest gains, as traders look to that volatile area as a beneficiary of the monetary printing press. Gains were seen in names like Freeport McMoran (  ), Cliffs Natural Resources (  ), as well as equipment play Caterpillar (  ). Despite having a bit more attractive dividend yields of late, commodity-related stocks have been making lower highs, so sustained upside could be hard to come by unless the recent trends reverse.Wall Street analyst upgrades helped boost stocks like Qualcomm (  ), American Express (  ), and AT&T (  ). Shares of Fastenal (  ) did not participate in the rally after  McDonald's (  ) was also down as the company continues to trade in a tight range. Investors are gearing up for a pending change at the top of the company, as MCD's highly-regarded I was pretty disgusted at the recent news surrounding former New Orleans Saints defensive coordinator Greg Williams. According to audio and other evidence, the coach ordered his players to intentionally harm opposing players, blatantly disregarding the very rules the NFL set in place to protect its participants. Is winning a football game worth potentially ending someones career - or worse?I'm sure a number of Saints players in the room sat in utter shock as they were told to go after one player's knees, another player's head (since he had a couple of concussions and could easily be knocked out once again), and to try and give the quarterback a few extra shots whenever there is a pile-up (the phrase ""attack the head"" was used multiple times). I understand that football is an intensely physical game, but offering monetary rewards for taking cheap shots at opposing players is a totally different story.In our own lives, we sometimes run into people - co-workers, bosses, etc. - who are willing to step on other people to get ahead. Our job is to make sure we are not influenced by these people, and remind ourselves that life isn't about winning at any cost. Rather, life is about succeeding in a fair and honest fashion. You will never truly win the respect of your peers or subordinates if you take the low road to the top.Believe in yourself and understand that success comes in all forms - not just by being on the winning team.Excuse #13 - ""You have to leverage debt to become rich!""My Response: This is a dangerous play for many that try and speed up the road to wealth. We have all heard the amazing stories of real estate tycoons that pulled off incredible wins, only to get caught off-guard when markets turned. The financial road is littered with failed money gambles that were based on leverage. The banks have always been guilty of encouraging investors to roll the dice a bit too much when times were good. We have seen the fallout from that the last couple of years.Excuse #14 - ""I need to invest in a car.""My Response: The words ""invest"" and ""car"" almost never belong in the same sentence unless you are extremely knowledgeable about the collectible car market.Excuse #15 - ""If everybody got out of debt, the economy would collapse!""My Response: Worrying about the economy's collapse should never be the consumer's concern. Living debt-free should be an ultimate goal of yours, but giving yourself a license to spend recklessly is just plain dumb.Excuse #16 - ""Just put it on the card and we will worry about it when it comes in.""My Response: I understand the convenience factor of carrying plastic over cash. The danger comes when you allow credit cards to take control of your spending vices. If you are a ""spur of the moment"" buyer, learn to take a pause before making any big purchases you don't actually need.Excuse #17 - ""I must be able to afford this (car, house, etc.)since I was approved for the loan.""My Response: This one is a real trap for those ignorant about the ways credit card companies and lenders operate. What is amazing is that you can see someone get burned once by signing on the dotted line for a deal they couldn't afford, but then they will repeat the mistake not too long after it. Reviewing mistakes in spending and investing is a necessary tool to make one's path to wealth a much smoother one.One of the best long-term retirement strategies an investor can use is investing in dividend-paying stocks within their Roth IRAs. Roth IRA Distributions, including capital gains, interest, and DIVIDENDS are tax-free if you are at least age 59 1/2 years old, and the account has been established for longer than five tax years. Dividends paid into a Roth account are never taxed, even when withdrawn. This special treatment differs from dividends accumulated in a Traditional IRA, which would be taxed during withdrawals. The best part of a Traditional IRA is the tax credit is counted the year you do it. Some accountants prefer clients to take this road, knowing it can ease one's tax burden for the particular year a traditional IRA is funded. Do remember, though, that withdrawals taken from an IRA account before age 59 1/2, including income from dividends, is subject to a 10 percent penalty tax in addition to ordinary income taxation. Always consult with a tax specialist before making any moves that may incur tax consequences. Of course, there's nothing wrong with purchasing dividend stocks within a Traditional IRA either, but Roth IRAs are particularly attractive to dividend investors looking to maximize their future retirement withdrawals.For those of you who are self-employed, you have the benefit of building a retirement nest egg very quickly with a SEP-IRA. If you're self-employed, you can contribute 25% of your earned income or $50,000, whichever is less, to a SEP plan for 2012. Think of all the high-quality dividend stocks you can be putting to work for yourself - that's the true essence of making your money work for you! Again, talk to your tax professional and see how you can take advantage of this type of account.In  , we outline the do's and don'ts of investing in high-yield Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs). Our exclusive new MLP report outlines everything you need to know about these popular high-yield investments, including:- Understanding their unique company structure- What you absolutely need to know about their special tax treatment- Why MLPs may not be suitable for retirement accounts- How to find the best high-yield partnerships- …and much more!Head to the  page to download this brand new report today!We recently updated our list of dividend stocks that have been paying out dividends for 25 years or more. Be sure to check out  .Financial blog DailyReckoning.com recently took a look at the difference dividend payouts made in the overall return investors saw throughout the prior decades. Here are some of the highlights:- The Nasdaq is down 28% since the end of 1999. Even the ""blue chip"" S&P 500 stocks are down 15% during that time frame…until you add back those ""boring"" dividends. With dividends included, the S&P 500′s 15% loss flips to a 6% gain.- Without dividends, the S&P 500 index would have produced a loss for the 25 long years from August 1929 to August 1954. Then again, without dividends, the S&P 500 produced a 5% loss during the 13 years from September 1961 to September 1974. But with dividends included, the S&P's loss became a 46% gain.- Over the course of the last half-century, dividends have contributed more than half of the stock market's total return - 56%, to be exact.Of course, you can't discuss the potency of dividend investing without making mention of how awesome compound returns are. I can't stress enough the power of compound interest: you take a small amount of money and turn it into a large amount over time.

"ne of the most often heard comments in investing: ""I sure hope my stock comes back."" This is not a winning position to take. In fact, it almost guarantees losses. I hate to say it, but there is no hope in investing, only facts. And the facts at times can be very hard to take.Facts like several quarters of losses in a row. Companies that continually lose money, no matter what the reasons, have a hard time getting investors' attention. There are too many other, profitable companies, either competing with the one in which you have a position or in other industries, that are much more attractive. A stock's price is, theoretically, the present value of future earnings. If there are no earnings, there is no future.Some companie survive several quarters of losses, especially ones that have been profitable in the past and need a few quarters to cut costs and offer new products or services. It's the ones that keep doing the same thing, such as research on a cure for a disease, and not showing any progress that have to be carefully scrutinized. Successful companies will only throw a limited amount of money at a project before going in another direction, to preserve precious capital. To continually do the same thing over and over with the same results is the definition of insanity.Another fact: accounting misdeeds, executed with pre-meditation are killers. In other words, if management is cooking the books, look out below. Two outstanding examples: Enron and MCI. While it's very difficult for investors to determine deceit in accounting, once it is known, getting out is the best strategy. Usually accounting problems are like cockroaches: what you see is only the beginning of a much deeper issue.No or slow growth is a recipe for a lower stock price. If a company is standing still, i.e., revenues are flat for several quarters, it usually means a product or service the company offers has reached its audience and future growth depends on new ideas. It also means management should have a dedicated Research and Development department that is very busy. Look for how much is spent for R&D in a company. If it's very little or none, where will new products come from? This is especially vital for drug and technology companies where change happens quickly. A company not growing is dying. Dying companies don't have stock prices that go up.Another fact: Leadership counts. If the CEO of a company is suspect, don't invest. You can learn about a CEO's background in the SEC filings. It will give the resume of top management. If there's any scandal associated with the CEO, be very careful. He/She sets the tone for the whole company, hires people in his/her likeness, and makes most of the critical decisions.A great CEO always puts the company first. One way to tell: look at the salary and stock awards. Are they well above the normal for the industry? Are they disproportionately high given the sales and profits of the company? I once invested in a biotech where the CEO was making over $ 1 million a year and the company had lost money every year since going public. I asked how he could justify that enormous pay. He said it was to reward him for all the years when he struggled to get where he was. Not a good answer.Two great examples of leadership are the heads of Fastenal and Apple, Bob Kierlin and Steve Jobs. Mr. Kierlin makes $120,000 a year (and has for more than 10 years even though the board has authorized increases) but runs a company that generates $2.26 billion in sales. He owns 12% of the company, worth about $250 million. His reward comes from the stock's appreciation. Mr. Jobs does him one better: he takes only $1 a year in cash, the rest in stock. He's done that for the last 10 years. His wealth comes from the same place as investors' in Apple stock.Here's the great thing about facing facts: they allow you to move on. Every time I've finally pulled the trigger, taken a loss on a stock, I've immediately looked for the next one. As soon as I've re-invested, I forget about the old loser and focus my attention on the new, promising stock. I always feel better, knowing that I've given up hope and started again with facts.There are many good investing strategies: high return on equity, sound dividends, low valuations in P/E (price to earnings ratio) and PSR (price to sales ratio), top down, bottom up, fundamental, technical, to name only a few of the more well known ones. Hope is not among them.- Ted AllrichApril 13, 2011The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Hope Is Not An Investing Strategy@2011-04-12@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/hope-not-investing-strategy-2011-04-12
"Shutterstock photoU.S. stocks are pointed lower today, as Wall Street digests the latest earnings results from blue-chip banking behemoth JPMorgan Chase (  ). While the firm's per-share profit topped expectations, its credit-loss provisions jumped by one-third from the second quarter, reflecting a cautious outlook. Elsewhere, the latest data from China has also set a gloomy tone ahead of the bell, after the country's trade surplus narrowed for a second straight month in September. Against this backdrop, the major market indexes are hovering south of breakeven, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) bracing for a 79-point drop out of the gate.In earnings news, JPMorgan Chase (JPM - 33.20) said third-quarter earnings fell 3.5% to $4.26 billion, or $1.02 per share, while revenue edged 0.1% higher to $24.37 billion. The results surpassed Wall Street's expectations, with analysts calling for a per-share profit of 91 cents on sales of $23.4 billion. Meanwhile, the bank's third-quarter credit-loss provisions rose 33% from the second quarter, which reflects its ""more cautious credit outlook,"" CEO Jamie Dimon told shareholders. Ahead of the bell, JPM is pointed 0.8% lower.Elsewhere, XL Group (XL - 19.80) last night predicted it will swallow a third-quarter loss, pre-tax and net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums, of $90 million to $120 million. XL's insurance business generated the bulk of the losses, due to a string of catastrophes during the three-month period -- including Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee, as well as the Texas wildfires. The Dublin-based insurer is scheduled to report its full third-quarter results in early November.Finally, Universal Forest Products (UFPI - 25.94) said its third-quarter profit jumped 117% to $5.6 million, or 29 cents per share, from last year's earnings of $2.6 million, or 13 cents per share. Revenue decreased 2.4% to $468.9 million, from $480.6 million. UFPI's results failed to meet analysts' expectations for a profit of 32 cents per share on $471.5 million in revenue. ""Our cost-cutting efforts and a more stable lumber market helped us generate a stronger profit in the quarter,"" claimed CEO Matthew J. Missad. However, he predicted the economy to ""remain weak for the near term,"" and said that uncertainties in the housing market will limit the company's ability to provide meaningful guidance.Today's earnings docket will also feature reports from Google (  ), Fastenal (  ), Lindsay Corp. (  ), and Valmont Industries (  ). Keep your browser at  for more news as it breaks.The August trade balance, the holiday-delayed crude inventories report, and the weekly report on initial jobless claims are slated for release today. Meanwhile, Friday winds down with September retail sales data, the Reuters/UMich consumer sentiment index, business inventories, and import/export prices.Equity option activity on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) saw 1,070,265 call contracts traded on Wednesday, compared to 678,094 put contracts. The resultant single-session put/call ratio arrived at 0.63, while the 21-day moving average was 0.71.Stocks in Asia ended higher today, as signs of progress in Europe whetted the collective appetite for riskier assets. However, China's trade surplus eased by more than expected in September, marking the second straight monthly decline. Furthermore, exports and imports grew by less than expected last month. Nevertheless, exporters -- along with property developers and resource-related equities -- paced the advance in China and Japan. By the close, Japan's Nikkei added 1%, China's Shanghai Composite tacked on 0.8%, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng gained 2.3%.On the other hand, European markets are mostly lower at midday, with bank stocks leading the retreat ahead of a highly anticipated Italian debt auction. In France, retailer Carrefour SA has given up more than 5% after cutting its outlook, while Alcatel-Lucent is leading the elite advancers after the  reported that the firm has agreed to sell its call-center services business. At last check, London's FTSE 100 has given up 0.9%, while both France's CAC 40 and Germany's DAX have shed 1.1%.The greenback is on the rebound this morning, with the U.S. dollar index up 0.4% at last look. Elsewhere, crude futures have continued their retreat ahead of the government's holiday-delayed inventory report, with the front-month contract down $1.52, or 1.8%, to trade near $84.26 per barrel. Finally, gold futures have pared some of their recent gains, with the precious metal last seen $13, or 0.8%, lower at $1,669.60 an ounce.Unusual Put and Call Activity:For an explanation of how to use this information, check out our  topics on  and  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Opening View: DJIA Pointed Lower as Wall Street Weighs JPMorgan Earnings, Chinese Data@2011-10-13@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/opening-view-djia-pointed-lower-wall-street-weighs-jpmorgan-earnings-chinese-data-2011-10
"Yes. Absolutely. The stock market could go much lower as fear becomes the overriding emotion controlling investors' decisions. There are basically two drivers for the stock market: fear and greed. Greed is gone. No one thinks greedy. There's no reason for it. Everywhere investors look, they see reasons to sell, not buy, stocks. When fear comes in the room, reason goes out the window.How bad can it get? Well, taking it to the absurd level, the Dow Jones Industrial Average could go to zero. Before it does that, there will be riots in the streets, buildings will burn, politicians will be gone. So taking it all the way to its natural conclusion doesn't make any sense. No one can put a number on it, as reflected in the DJIA. But it could go lower, much lower, than 10,000. How?By investors giving up all hope. Not seeing any reason to buy anything. After all, only gold went higher in the last several years. Traditional havens like real estate, conservative stocks, even CD's at the bank, all became torture chambers as they went down, some slowly, others extremely fast. Is it any wonder investors now look out from under their bomb sheltered perspectives and don't feel like there's a reason for hope?And they're being perfectly logical. The housing market looks to be even worse than thought a year ago. More new problems like ill-performed foreclosures and bad mortgage documentation and lawsuits from loans made years ago continue to plague lenders and buyers of lenders (think Countrywide by Bank of America). Houses aren't selling quickly enough to eliminate the ""shadow"" inventory, houses that are held by banks through foreclosures, that continues to hold down prices. Borrowers can't qualify under new, tough lending rules.Jobs seem to be evaporating rather than created. While some industries, such as auto, are doing very well, based on September numbers, if more people don't get back to work soon, there won't be customers for all the new cars being built.Interest rates are low, but borrowing is tougher. Whether it's for a business or a home or a personal loan, banks have had their hands (and arms and legs and head) slapped enough to know that any more bad loans won't fly with regulators. So they're sitting on lots of cash, willing to lend, but only to borrowers who don't really need the money.Earnings have been decent in some industries, thanks to cost cutting, and some strong end demand. But that's industry specific, not generally. Technology continues to see upgrades from companies looking to be more efficient, using machines for people whenever possible. As mentioned, autos are rolling off assembly lines, and car manufacturers should show another positive growth quarter. Medical devices are still needed, as is most health care. But beyond these, it's hard to find growth in the current economy. Earnings will be important but investors have a hard time believing they'll keep improving if unemployment stays high.And the other overhanging cloud: Europe, in particular Greece, then Italy, Spain, Portugal. Only Germany seems to be strong. If Greece defaults and sends banks that own its debt into bankruptcy, expect the dominos to fall worldwide. Solving the Greek problem is only a small step investors need to see in order to feel bullish again. It's not enough to make up for all the other concerns.So is there any hope? There's always hope, but the market doesn't reward hope. It wants facts. Investors need to see lower unemployment, higher home sales, more retailers reporting better numbers (consumers make up about 2/3 of the U.S. GDP...the more they spend, the faster this economy gets back on track). In the meantime, what to do with any money available to invest?Nibble the bullet, don't bite it. Buy small amounts of stocks. Gold has had its run. Don't venture into that particular mine. Research REIT's (real estate investment trusts) and mutual funds or ETFs (exchange traded funds) that specialize in them. Buy market leaders, like IBM (IBM), Apple (AAPL), Wells Fargo (WFC) and Google (GOOG). Discover companies that have increased revenues and profits in this tough economy (like Fastenal (FAST)). For more ideas, look at the Aggressive and Conservative columns on The Online Investor (www.theonlineinvestor.com). Buy stocks with good dividends (AT&T (T) gives better than 6% now). Get paid to be depressed and patient as the market gyrates. Dividends will help salve some wounds.Just don't expect any great rallies. They aren't coming, at least not sustained ones. Each of the negative elements is too entrenched to be solved quickly. And each will have to be rectified for investors to believe once again that greed is ok, not necessarily good, but at least ok. Right now there is no greed to be found, and that's not a good thing, if you're an investor patiently waiting for this market to get better, afraid it will only get worse.- Ted AllrichOctober 4, 2011The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Can It Get Worse?@2011-10-04@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/can-it-get-worse-2011-10-04
"Shutterstock photoThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) could be headed for a rough session, as anxiety is sweeping Wall Street ahead of the release of minutes from the Federal Reserve's September policy meeting. Uncertainty ahead of technology bellwether Intel Corp.'s (  ) quarterly earnings report is also weighing on traders in premarket trading. As such, futures on the DJIA and the S&P 500 Index (SPX) are trading roughly 43 points and 3.7 points below fair value, respectively. If these losses carry over into the open, we could see the Dow battling for support at 11,000. In fact, the blue chip barometer could even test support at the 10,900 or 10,800 levels if the market's reaction to the Fed minutes is harsh enough. As for the SPX, the broad-market index should find a floor near 1,160, or at 1,150 if selling pressure gains momentum.In equity news, Johnson Controls Inc. (  ) said that it expects to post fiscal 2011 earnings of $2.30 to $2.45 per share - an increase of between 17% and 25% on a year-over-year basis. Revenue is seen growing approximately 9% to $37 billion, Johnson Controls added. ""We are substantially increasing our investments to drive organic growth,"" said CEO Stephen Roell. ""Higher capital expenditures in 2011 will support the significant growth opportunities in our power solutions business and further expansion in all of our businesses in the fast-growing geographic market,"" he added. Analysts are forecasting fiscal 2011 earnings of $2.39 per share on sales of $36.33 billion.Elsewhere, Barclays Capital affirmed its ""overweight"" rating on Apple Inc. (  ). Barclays analyst Ben A. Reitzes also lifted his target price to $385 per share from $340 per share. ""Even at this market cap Apple is the best growth play in the IT-hardware segment, with prospects for significant double-digit organic revenue growth for several more years,"" the analyst wrote.Finally, Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. (  ) proposed a merger with MGM in a deal that would give the latter company 55% of the combined entity, the  reported. In a statement this morning, investor Carl Icahn, who is offering to buy all of Lions Gate for $7.50 per share, said he supported the proposed merger.On the earnings front, Fastenal Company (  ), CSX Corp.

Friday will be busy once again, with September the consumer price index, retail sales, the New York Fed's Empire State manufacturing index, and the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index for October.Equity option activity on the CBOE saw 1,222,569 call contracts traded on Monday, compared to 728,197 put contracts. The resultant single-session put/call ratio arrived at 0.60, while the 21-day moving average held at 0.59.Overseas trading is in poor shape this morning, as only one of the 10 foreign indexes that we track is in positive territory. The cumulative average return on the collective stands at a loss of 0.69%. While mainland China bucked the trend, the rest of Asia finished solidly in the red. Japan led the way, with exporters selling off sharply due to the continued rise in the yen. Across the pond in Europe, a sell-off in commodities has pressured miners, which are leading a broad retreat across the region. On the economic front, British consumer price inflation came in at 3.1% in September, unchanged from August, according to the Office for National Statistics. The core rate was also unchanged at 2.7%.Strength in the U.S. dollar is sapping the commodities market this morning. Rallying against pretty much every benchmark currency, except the Japanese yen, the dollar is weighing heavily on gold and crude futures. At last check, the U.S. Dollar Index was up 0.39% at 77.75. Meanwhile, gold futures have fallen $9.10 to $1,345.30 an ounce in London. Finally, even the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' (OPEC) upwardly revised outlook for world oil consumption has failed to buoy crude prices. In electronic trading, the front-month crude contract has fallen 82 cents to $82.19 per barrel.Unusual Put and Call Activity:For an explanation of how to use this information, check out our  topics on  and  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Opening View: DJIA Futures Dip Ahead of Fed Minutes@2010-10-12@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/opening-view-djia-futures-dip-ahead-fed-minutes-2010-10-12

astenal exploded higher last week, and one investor wants to keep riding it higher.optionMONSTER's tracking programs detected the sale of about 3,600 January 42.50 calls for $0.55. Some 3,000 November 37.50 calls were bought at the same time for $1.99 to $2.08, but volume was below existing open interest in that strike.The activity is probably the work of an investor who owns shares in the industrial-supply company and has been using the options as part of a covered-call strategy. He or she had previously sold the November 37.50s to earn income, but now that FAST is above the strike price, they're buying them back and rolling to the January 42.50s.The move cost them about $415,000, but gives them the the right to collect an additional $5 of upside on about 300,000 shares. That translates into about $1.5 million of potential gains.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) may have gained only about 18 points on Monday, but the rally pushed the venerable average past resistance at the 10,200 level and marked the fifth straight gain for the Dow. The DJIA is also trading above its 10-week moving average, and given the historical upside bias of expiration weeks, it has a good chance of closing the week above this trendline for the first time since late April. The S&P 500 Index (SPX) wasn't as lucky as the Dow, closing below resistance in the 1,080-1,085 region and its 10-week moving average.

(  ).

Analysts estimate earnings of 33 cents a share. Options action during afternoon trading suggests investors anticipate a long-term slide in the stock, but the sentiment might not be exceedingly bearish.At 3:17 p.m. EST, a block of 8,850 out-of-the-money January 2012 50 puts changed hands for the ask price of $8.10 per contract. These LEAPS puts are home to current open interest of just 139 contracts, indicating investors most likely bought these puts to open. These options are currently down 90 cents on the day and have an implied volatility of 31% compared to the stock's 30-day historical volatility of 17%. Investors who bought these puts will make money if FAST shares drop at least 18% throughout the longer term and trade below $41.90 prior to January 2012 options expiration. If the stock declines significantly prior to expiry and the puts rally, investors could choose to sell these options back and take profits instead of unnecessarily holding on to them.Put buying such as this is a bearish play, but not necessarily a reason for investors to short FAST stock. Keep in mind that the investor could have used the options position as a hedge against a long stock position.

"Shutterstock photoU.S. stocks are trading lower this morning, as anxieties over a European debt contagion continue to cast a shadow over the Street. Rumors that Italy's debt rating is likely to be downgraded are causing tensions in Italian bond markets, fueling fears that the Greek debt dilemma is spreading across Europe -- and the global economy. Back in the U.S., investors have their own problems, with worries about a stalled economic recovery -- and the infamous ""debt ceiling"" -- continuing to weigh on sentiment. In fact, a mixed earnings report from Dow bigwig Alcoa Inc. (AA - 15.91) seems to have simply provided more fuel for the bearish fire -- and futures on the blue-chip barometer are nearly 40 points lower in pre-market activity. Looking ahead, data on the May trade balance will be released at 8:30 a.m. Eastern, and the minutes from the last meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will hit the Street later this afternoon.AA banked a second-quarter profit of $322 million, or 28 cents per share, more than doubling its year-ago earnings of $136 million, or 13 cents per share. On an adjusted basis, AA raked in a profit of 32 cents per share, while revenue increased 27% to $6.59 billion. Analysts, on average, were looking for a profit of 32 cents per share on $6.31 billion in revenue. ""Although the economic recovery is uneven, the overall outlook for Alcoa -- and for aluminum -- remains positive,"" said Chairman and CEO Klaus Kleinfeld in a statement. ""Demand for aluminum continues to rise and so does growth in our major markets. These factors support our projection that aluminum demand will grow 12 percent this year and will double by 2020."" AA is down 0.4% ahead of the open.Novellus Systems (NVLS - 35.77) announced that its second-quarter profit rose just 2.3% to $64.7 million, or 79 cents per share, while revenue edged up 9% to $350.2 million. The company's bottom line was pressured by rising costs; research and development expenses climbed 16% for the quarter, with overhead jumping 10%. Wall Street was looking for a slimmer profit of 76 cents per share, but revenue was expected to weigh in at a more substantial $352.3 million.Infosys Technologies Ltd. (INFY - 65.10) reported that its fiscal second-quarter profit increased 16% -- but the tech stock is down over 5.5% this morning on a disappointing outlook. For the quarter, the company posted a profit of INR17.22 billion on revenue of INR74.85 billion. Analysts, on average, were expecting a profit of INR17.26 billion on revenue of INR74.96 billion. The tech firm reiterated its outlook, but warned that spending by U.S. and European clients on technology contracts may remain weak. ""This is an environment in which you have to be cautious,"" said Chief Operating Officer S.D. Shibulal ""We are seeing instability in the environment,"" the COO added.Finally, shares of ReneSola Ltd. (SOL - 4.68) are down 11.3% this morning as a result of a downwardly revised outlook. More specifically, the alternative energy firm said it now expects second-quarter revenue of $235 million to $245 million on shipments of 290 megawatts to 300 megawatts -- dramatically lower than its April view for sales of $280 million to $300 million and shipments of 330 megawatts to 350 megawatts. Chief Executive Xianshou Li said the company expects that its continued efforts to reduce costs will help ease margin pressures; nevertheless, ReneSola now predicts gross margins of 17% to 19% -- down 8 percentage points from its earlier view.Today's earnings docket will feature reports from Fastenal (  ) and Wolverine World Wide (  ). Keep your browser at  for more news as it breaks.The May trade balance hits the Street today.

A round of inflation data kicks off on Thursday, with the producer price index (PPI) and core PPI for June. The weekly update on jobless claims will also be released, along with retail sales for June and May's business inventories.

The resultant single-session put/call ratio docked at 0.73, while the 21-day moving average was perched at 0.71.Sovereign debt remains the key focus this morning, with stocks in Asia taking a hit amid ongoing uncertainty regarding the scope of the European crisis. Rising risk aversion provided a boost of safe-haven support for the yen, which pressured major Japanese exporters like Toyota. Meanwhile, Chinese equities were battered by a Moody's report detailing various red flags at dozens of corporations, including such concerns as high-risk business models and auditing missteps. By the close, Hong Kong's Hang Seng shed 3.1%, South Korea's Kospi fell 2.2%, China's Shanghai Composite declined 1.7%, and Japan's Nikkei dipped 1.4%.Contagion fears are also sinking stocks in Europe, after Dutch Finance Minister Jan Kees de Jager said a selective Greek debt default ""is not excluded anymore"" from the list of options being considered by top euro-zone officials. Italy also remains a point of concern today, with regulators unveiling new restrictions on short selling in an attempt to rein in market volatility. Against this backdrop, a gloomy note from B of A-Merrill Lynch isn't helping matters. ""As the third largest bond market in the world, after Japan and the U.S., Italy could be systemic... the latest trend in the Italian bond market could potentially snowball into a major crisis for the global economy,"" warned analyst Athanasios Vamvakidis in a research note. At last check, the French CAC 40 is off 1.1%, the German DAX has dropped 1.3%, and London's FTSE 100 is down 1%.Crude futures have continued their retreat this morning, despite positive news from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). The organization said in its monthly report today that its oil production increased to 29.6 million barrels a day in June -- 0.5 million barrels a day higher than May, as Saudi Arabia and other Arab members in the Gulf region raised their output. Nevertheless, crude futures are down 1 point, or 1.1%, in pre-market trading. Conversely, the dollar has edged higher this morning, with the U.S. dollar index trading 0.3 point, of 0.4%, higher.
