Overview
Fastenal Company (together with our subsidiaries, hereinafter referred to as
'Fastenal' or the company or by terms such as we, our, or us) began as a
partnership in 1967, and was incorporated under the laws of Minnesota in
1968. We opened our first branch in 1967 in Winona, Minnesota, a city with a
population today of approximately 27,000. We began with a marketing strategy of
supplying threaded fasteners to customers in small, medium-sized, and, in
subsequent years, large cities. Over time, that mandate has expanded to a
broader range of industrial and construction supplies spanning more than nine
major product lines (described later in this document). The large majority of
our transactions are business-to-business, though we also have some walk-in
retail business.&nbsp;&nbsp;... <a href=""http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/edgar_conv_html%2f2020%2f02%2f06%2f0000815556-20-000011.html#FIS_BUSINESS"" target=""_blank"">More</a> ...&nbsp;&nbsp;
