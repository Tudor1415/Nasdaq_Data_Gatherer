Pura\r\nVida results are consolidated within the Company's financial statements\r\nbeginning on July 17, 2019, the first full day following the acquisition. Prior\r\nperiod results have not been recast and are therefore not comparable with the\r\nfiscal 2020 period.\r\nBeginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company has included an\r\nadditional segment for Pura Vida due to its acquisition. As a result, the\r\nCompany now has three reportable segments: Vera Bradley Direct (\"VB Direct\"),\r\nVera Bradley Indirect (\"VB Indirect\"), and Pura Vida. For financial information\r\nabout our reportable segments, refer to Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated\r\nFinancial Statements set forth in Part II, \"Item 8.
