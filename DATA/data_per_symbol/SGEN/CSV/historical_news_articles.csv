Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''.  These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand.  Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).  Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

"Investors in Seattle Genetics Inc (Symbol: SGEN) saw new options begin trading this week, for the July 17th expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the SGEN options chain for the new July 17th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $160.00 strike price has a current bid of $10.20.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $160.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $149.80 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of SGEN, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $161.86/share today.

Because the $160.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 56%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.38% return on the cash commitment, or 36.93% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.


Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Seattle Genetics Inc, and highlighting in green where the $160.00 strike is located relative to that history:


   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $170.00 strike price has a current bid of $8.40.  If an investor was to purchase shares of SGEN stock at the current price level of $161.86/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $170.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 10.22% if the stock gets called away at the July 17th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if SGEN shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Seattle Genetics Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing SGEN's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $170.00 strike highlighted in red:



   
Considering the fact that the $170.00 strike represents an approximate 5% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 56%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.19% boost of extra return to the investor, or 30.07% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.


The implied volatility in the put contract example, as well as the call contract example, are both approximately 53%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $161.86) to be 48%.

"Investors in Seattle Genetics Inc (Symbol: SGEN) saw new options become available this week, for the December 18th expiration.  One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 239 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.

And we have a winner. After a long and arduous development process, only a few biotech names will emerge having attained the ultimate prize, an FDA approval. To get to this point, a company will need to successfully progress through several clinical phases of testing to ensure the product is both effective and safe.Given that only a few key factors indicate its trajectory during the development stage, shares can be sent soaring rapidly in either direction on account of news regarding study results or regulatory approvals. This is because if a candidate ultimately receives approval, it often signals that sustainable revenues are on the horizon.However, that’s not to say healthcare companies tap out on gains once they reach the finish line. Even after the FDA gives the all-clear, there’s still plenty of work to be done.Taking all of this into consideration, we used  to pinpoint two compelling biotech stocks whose products have just won FDA approval. Here's what the analyst community has to say about these Buy-rated tickers.Urogen is developing chemoablative agents for urological cancers using its cutting edge RTGel platform, which enables drug delivery to hard-to-reach anatomy as well as increases medication dwell time. With its recently-approved Jelmyto (UGN-101) therapy standing to change the treatment of low-grade upper tract urothelial carcinoma for the better, it’s no wonder the Street is excited.Oppenheimer’s  points out that URGN “has infrastructure in place for a June 1 launch that will incorporate marketing strategies designed to accommodate COVID-19 restrictions.” This includes 48 sales reps which will cover curology practices that see 90% of the LG UTUC patient population. In addition, the company is deploying virtual-based detailing strategies, with a premixing service agreement already in place for point-of-care delivery of ready-to-use product.Even though the company still hasn’t published the final durability data as some patients haven’t hit the twelve-month mark, Gershell sees a large re-treatment opportunity. “Given Jelmyto's kidney-sparing profile, we view the prospect of re-treatment following tumor recurrence to be favorable to the alternative option of kidney removal. While retreatment data are currently lacking, URGN intends to begin a post-marketing study in this setting in the coming months,” he noted. To this end, the analyst estimates Jelmyto 2024E revenue in low-grade UTUC will hit $400 million.On top of this, early clinical data for its other candidate, UGN-102, is promising. “We remain enthusiastic for UGN-102's opportunity in low-grade non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) following encouraging Phase 2b interim efficacy reveal, with Phase 3 on track to begin around year end,” Gershell commented.Bearing this in mind, Gershell decided to stay with the bulls. Along with his Outperform call, the five-star analyst gave the price target a lift, from $45 to $47. This conveys his confidence in URGN’s ability to soar 100% in the next year. (To watch Gershell’s track record, )Turning now to the rest of the Street, other analysts are on the same page. With 4 Buys and a single Hold, the word on the Street is that URGN is a Strong Buy. At $47.50, the average price target puts the upside potential at 107%. ()Using advanced antibody-drug conjugate technology, Seattle Genetics was able to develop a better way to deliver cancer-killing therapies to tumor cells. On the heels of its third commercial product approval from the FDA, one analyst tells investors not to miss out on this exciting biotech play.Way before its August 20 PDUFA date, the regulatory agency gave SGEN’s TUKYSA (tucatinib) drug a thumbs up only four months after filing through the Real-Time Oncology Review (RTOR) program, which was the company’s second approval of this kind. TUKYSA was designed for use in metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer patients, including patients with brain Mets. It will be used along with trastuzumab (Herceptin) and capecitabine in patients who have already gone through at least one HER2 targeting therapy.Writing for Needham, five-star analyst  noted, “We find the rapid approval impressive, particularly with the challenges of the ongoing COVID pandemic, and is testament to the unmet need in this patient population.”Messer goes so far as to say TUKYSA could become the standard of care in metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer as it was given a strong label for metastatic breast cancer (mBC), HER2 positive patients following progression on at least one anti-HER2 therapy. The label specifically states the therapy should be considered for brain Mets treatment, which differentiates it from other treatment options.Expounding on the label’s implications, Messer said, “The approved label is broader than the patient population evaluated in HER2CLIMB, which included mostly 3rd-line patients.” He added, “The commercial organization to launch TUKYSA is already in place.” Additionally, the candidate could be approved for use in Europe, and is undergoing further testing that could potentially enable it to be used in earlier lines of therapy in mBC.Based on all of the above, Messer left a Buy rating on the stock and bumped up the price target from $144 to $157. Should this new target be met, a twelve-month gain of 10% could be in store. (To watch Messer’s track record, )Looking at the consensus breakdown, 10 Buys and 4 Holds add up to a Moderate Buy consensus rating. However, the $138.33 average price target implies a slight downside potential from current levels.

We broadened our commercial portfolio, which now includes three first-in-class or best-in-class medicines for cancer patients. ADCETRIS is an important global brand for lymphoma, and we are investing in future growth opportunities.PADCEV was approved in late December for metastatic urothelial cancer. And today, we are pleased to announce a strong first full quarter of sales. And earlier this month, we received approval of TUKYSA for metastatic breast cancer four months ahead of the PDUFA date. These are significant milestones and we remain excited with the expansion opportunities across these three programs as well as our emerging earlier-stage pipeline.I'll begin today with some comments on each of our approved programs, starting with ADCETRIS. We're pleased to report ADCETRIS net sales of $164 million in the first quarter of 2020, up 22% over the first quarter of 2019. We are maintaining our guidance of full year 2020 ADCETRIS net sales in the range of $675 million to $700 million. Our ADCETRIS partner, Takeda, continues to make global regulatory progress. Most recently, CHMP adopted a positive opinion, recommending extension of the marketing authorization for ADCETRIS plus chemotherapy for frontline systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma based on results from the ECHELON-2 trial. We look forward to additional frontline Hodgkin and PTCL approvals in Takeda's territory over time.We believe there are several additional opportunities for ADCETRIS and are advancing ongoing and planned clinical trials in a range of settings. These include retreatment used in patients who are unfit for combination chemotherapy, novel frontline Hodgkin lymphoma combinations and relapsed/refractory diffused large B-cell lymphoma. We also expect to report five-year progression-free survival results later this year from both the ECHELON-1 and ECHELON-2 trials. These data could further establish the positive long-term benefit of the approved ADCETRIS plus chemotherapy regimen in frontline Stage III and IV Hodgkin lymphoma and in frontline CD30 expressing PTCL.I'll move on now to PADCEV, which we're developing and commercialization in collaboration with Astellas. PADCEV was approved in late December 2019, three months ahead of the PDUFA date. In its first full quarter on the market, PADCEV net sales in the US were $34 million. We're pleased by the initial physician and patient reception to PADCEV as well as our commercial team's ability to shift mid quarter to a virtual engagement. There are additional opportunities for PADCEV in earlier lines and stages of bladder cancer.A primary focus of this work is evaluating PADCEV in combination with KEYTRUDA. In the past months, we've made important progress with both first-line metastatic urothelial cancer and muscle invasive bladder cancer that Roger will describe in more detail. Looking beyond bladder cancer, the first patient was recently dosed in the EV-202 basket trial, evaluating single agent PADCEV in a range of solid tumors.Our third and newest commercial product is TUKYSA, the brand name for tucatinib. We're very pleased with the strong label granted by FDA. TUKYSA is approved for use in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine for patients with metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer, including patients with brain metastasis who have received one or more prior anti-HER2 based regimens in the metastatic setting. This positions the regimen as an option for second-line treatment.We're almost two weeks into the launch of TUKYSA, which we're conducting through virtual communication channels. We've been pleased by the reception from the breast cancer community to this new treatment option for patients. To maximize the potential of TUKYSA, we're investing in a broad development program across HER2 positive cancers. In addition, we're preparing for European commercial operations and have hired general managers in major European markets ahead of potential ex-US approvals of TUKYSA.Turning now to our pipeline. On the horizon with a clinical trial readout is tisotumab vedotin, or TV, which we are developing in collaboration with Genmab. We're conducting a pivotal Phase II single-arm, single agent trial in women with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer where there is no standard of care and outcomes are poor. We expect to report top line results late this quarter or into the third quarter. Our early stage clinical pipeline is robust. It includes ADCs such as ladiratuzumab vedotin, SGN-CD228 and SGN-B6A, for which an IND had just been submitted. These three ADCs are all targeted to receptors that are widely expressed in solid tumors.To expand upon our deep knowledge of CD30 expressing malignancies and our expertise with CD30 directed ADCs, we're advancing another IND candidate this year called, SGN-CD30C. This is a novel anti-CD30 ADC that has the potential for enhanced activity and improved tolerability compared to ADCETRIS. Preclinical data on SGN-CD30C will be presented along with several other abstracts on our research at the AACR virtual annual meeting in June. In addition to ADCs, we've made progress with novel immunotherapy agents in our early stage clinical pipeline. These include SEA-CD40 and SGN-TGT.Lastly, I wanted to provide an update on our dispute with Daiichi Sankyo regarding ownership of certain technology used in the breast cancer drug and HER2 and other product candidates. According to our agreement, this type of dispute should be resolved through arbitration. Daiichi Sankyo has been trying to prevent our dispute from going to arbitration through actions in federal court.On April 27, it was ruled that the dispute should be resolved in arbitration and that the arbitration process should move forward. We view this as a positive development. With our diverse commercial portfolio, growing revenues and multiple programs that provide significant opportunities in a range of cancer types, we are well-positioned for the future.At this point, I'll turn the call over to Chip to discuss our commercial activities. Then, Todd will comment on our financial results. After that, Roger will discuss our clinical development activities. Chip? -- Thanks, Clay. I'm excited to update you on our commercial activities. ADCETRIS net sales growth in the US and Canada in the first quarter was driven by our frontline indications in Hodgkin lymphoma and PTCL. As Clay mentioned, we look forward to the five-year PFS data later this year from the ECHELON-1 trial. Five-year data are an established standard that we believe will resonate with some physicians who've been slow to adopt ADCETRIS plus AVD in the frontline setting. In PTCL, ADCETRIS has become the standard of care for patients with ALCL. One of our areas for focus in 2020 is to increase use in additional CD30 expressing subtypes.Now I'd like to transition to PADCEV. In the first full quarter since launch, net sales were $34 million. We are very pleased with these early results and with the strong uptake, particularly in the community setting. We are still early into the launch, and our goal with PADCEV is to maintain our strong momentum. Along with our Astellas colleagues, we are working hard to support our customers and to drive awareness and understanding of this important new treatment option for metastatic urothelial patients, seeking treatment after platinum and PD-1 or PD-L1 therapy.And finally, our third product is TUKYSA. The commercial team was ready for the rapid approval, marketing materials were complete, physician and patient websites were up the day of approval and the dedicated TUKYSA sales force, comprised of breast cancer specialists, was trained and ready. Interest in the product is very high and our field sales teams are reporting good virtual access to customers. TUKYSA is available in our distribution networks and accounts are beginning to order. I look forward to updating you on our progress in future calls.Now I'll turn the call over to Todd. -- Thanks, Chip, and thanks to everyone for joining us on the call this afternoon. Our financial results for the first quarter reflect significant progress across the business, including a strong first quarter of PADCEV sales. Today, I'll summarize our results for the first quarter and then comment on our outlook for the remainder of 2020. Total revenues were $235 million in the first quarter of 2020. This included ADCETRIS net sales of $164 million and PADCEV net sales of $34 million. As a reminder, we record 100% of PADCEV sales in the US under our co-promote with Astellas.Royalty revenues in the first quarter of 2020 increased to $20 million compared to $16 million in the first quarter of 2019. This growth primarily reflects sales of ADCETRIS by Takeda and, to a lesser degree, now royalties on sales of Polivy by Roche. Collaboration revenues were $16 million in the first quarter of 2020 compared to $45 million in the first quarter of last year. The decrease in collaboration revenues is the result of a $30 million milestone from Takeda earned last year that was triggered by the approval of ADCETRIS in the EU for frontline Hodgkin lymphoma.Cost of sales for the first quarter of 2020 increased to $29 million and now reflects both ADCETRIS and PADCEV, including the PADCEV profit share to Astellas that was $16 million in the first quarter. Beginning in the second quarter, cost of sales will also reflect to TUKYSA and will also include the non-cash amortization of acquired in-process R&D that was part of the Cascadian acquisition. We plan to provide further guidance on cost of sales on future calls. R&D expenses were $195 million in the first quarter of 2020, growth over 2019 reflects higher investment across our pipeline.SG&A expenses were $122 million in the first quarter of 2020. The increase over 2019 reflects commercialization efforts related to the launches of PADCEV and TUKYSA. We ended the first quarter with $800 million in cash and investments in addition, we held approximately $104 million in Immunomedics common stock at the end of the quarter. These shares are mark-to-market, which resulted in a non-cash loss that contributed to an overall investment loss of $56 million for the first quarter. We monetized the remaining portion of our investment in April, which generated cash of $175 million. We acquired this investment back in 2017, and our total gain, when also including prior year sales, was $210 million.Regarding our financial outlook for 2020, product sales will now include all three brands. At this point, we're not providing guidance for PADCEV or TUKYSA, and our ADCETRIS guidance is unchanged from our expectations provided in February. We expect R&D expenses to increase as trials of PADCEV and TUKYSA ramp up. SG&A expense growth in 2020 is primarily driven by the US launches of both PADCEV and TUKYSA. Our guidance for R&D and SG&A expenses remains unchanged.Lastly, we continue to closely monitor the impact of COVID-19 on our business. We have implemented a number of measures to protect the health and safety of our employees, patients and healthcare professionals while also taking steps to advance our operations. These include efforts to mitigate disruptions to our supply chain and continue clinical trial and commercial activities. To-date, we're pleased with the continuity of our business and in our ability to support the critical need of cancer patients for treatment. However, COVID-19 has created a dynamic environment that may impact the company over time. We will keep investors updated as appropriate going forward.And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Roger. -- Thanks, Todd and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to update you today on our clinical development and regulatory activities and the work we're undertaking to maximize the therapeutic potential of our programs. I'll start with PADCEV, our ADC directed against Nectin-4, which is ubiquitously expressed in bladder cancer. As you know, data from the first cohort of the EV-201 trial supported approval of PADCEV in metastatic urothelial cancer patients following treatment with a platinum-containing regimen and a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor.Earlier this month, we completed enrollment in the second cohort, which is evaluating patients who received the PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor, but who were not eligible for treatment for cisplatin. We believe data from the second cohort of EV-201 could potentially support a second indication for PADCEV. Our other key activity with PADCEV monotherapy is the ongoing randomized Phase III EV-301 trial in advanced urothelial cancer. Enrollment of 608 patients was completed early this year, and we are following patients for the primary end point of overall survival. EV-301 is intended to serve as a confirmatory study for EV-201 and support global regulatory applications for approval.PADCEV in combination with Keytruda in first-line metastatic urothelial cancer is another key effort. At the ASCO GU meeting in February, we reported updated results from the EV-103 trial of 45 metastatic urothelial cancer patients who were previously untreated and ineligible for cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The objective response rate was 73% and median duration response had not been reached. Median progression free survival was 12 months, and median overall survival was not reached. The safety profile appeared consistent with individual components of the combination including rash, hyperglycemia, peripheral neuropathy and immune-mediated events. These data supported breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA for PADCEV in combination with KEYTRUDA in this setting. This is our second PADCEV BTD.Based on discussion with the FDA, we are pleased that EV-1 or EV-3 now has the potential to support an accelerated approval for PADCEV in first-line cisplatin-ineligible metastatic disease. In January, we added cohort K to the trial, which will enroll 150 patients randomized to receive either PADCEV plus KEYTRUDA or PADCEV alone. The primary end point is objective response rate supported by duration of response. This accelerated pathway would be complementary to the randomized Phase III EV-302 trial that is intended to support global registrations and now also serves as a potential confirmatory trial.Today, we are announcing that we have treated the first patient in EV-302. In this trial, together with Astellas and Merck, we are evaluating the PADCEV and KEYTRUDA combination with or without chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone. Target enrollment is 1,095 patients and, importantly, includes all patients, whether they are cisplatin eligible or ineligible and irrespective of PD-L1 expression. The trial is evaluating dual primary end points of progression free and overall survival. In early bladder cancer, Seattle Genetics, Astellas and Merck recently completed a clinical trial agreement under which we will evaluate PADCEV and Keytruda in muscle-invasive bladder cancer by adding an arm to an ongoing Merck Phase III registrational trial. Under this agreement, we are providing PADCEV, and Merck will continue to fund and operationalize the study. This expedites the development of the PADCEV-KEYTRUDA combination in this setting.I'll now move on to TUKYSA, our recently approved oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets HER2. We are very pleased by the FDA label and the speed at which we received approval under the FDA's Real-Time Oncology Review. We believe that the activity seen in the HER2CLIMB trial establishes TUKYSA as a best-in-class HER2 TKI. At the ASCO virtual scientific program in late May, we will present analyses on patients with brain metastases in HER2CLIMB to further demonstrate the treatment effects of TUKYSA observed in the brand. The data which was selected for an oral presentation will provide more insight into this aspect of the trial. Our ongoing regulatory efforts with HER2CLIMB include marketing applications that are currently under review in Switzerland, Singapore, Australia and Canada as part of Project Orbis and also in the EU.We are also evaluating TUKYSA in a randomized Phase III trial, called HER2CLIMB-02, in combination with T-DM1 and versus T-DM1 alone in metastatic breast cancer, including patients with brain metastases. In this trial, patients must have previously received a taxane and trastuzumab in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant or metastatic setting and thus represent a population receiving first or second-line treatment. HER2CLIMB-02 remains a key part of our TUKYSA development program. Both TUKYSA and T-DM1 are important drugs for the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer. And if HER2CLIMB-02 is successful, it will support use of the combination in the first-line metastatic setting, thus expanding beyond the current label.In addition, given the demonstrated activity of TUKYSA in patients with brain met, the combination may also improve outcomes for these patients. Enrollment in HER2CLIMB-02 is ongoing with a target of 460 patients. The primary end point is progression-free survival, and key secondary end points are overall survival and PFS in patients with brain met. Lastly, on TUKYSA, we previously outlined our plans in neoadjuvant breast cancer and metastatic colorectal cancer, and those efforts are continuing. Trials in adjuvant breast cancer, gastric cancer and HER2-mutant or amplified cancers are in the planning phase.Next, I'll turn to ADCETRIS. We recently expanded our clinical collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb to further evaluate the combination of ADCETRIS and Opdivo in an ongoing clinical trial. The focus of this new effort will be to assess the combination plus chemotherapy in Stage 1 and 2 Hodgkin lymphoma. This approach brings together two of the most active agents in early stage Hodgkin lymphoma. Our goal is to improve efficacy while reducing toxicity by limiting the chemotherapy components of the regimen.Now I'll turn the call back over to Clay. -- Thanks, Roger. Before we open the line for questions, I want to recap key upcoming activities across our oncology portfolio. They include: first, continue to establish ADCETRIS as standard of care in frontline Hodgkin lymphoma and frontline PTCL and initiate additional clinical trials; second, continue our strong PADCEV launch in the US with Astellas and advance broad development program, including trials in first-line metastatic and muscle-invasive bladder cancer; third, continue to launch TUKYSA following the recent FDA approval and advance its robust clinical development program; and fourth, report top line results from the TV pivotal trial in cervical cancer. We look forward to continuing our momentum into the remainder of the year.At this point, we'll open the line for Q&A. Operator, please open the call for questions.Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. -- Thank you and congratulations on the PADCEV launch. What has been the key drivers for the rapid uptake here for PADCEV and how should we think about the launch trajectory looking forward? And maybe you can just comment on that part as to whether there was a bolus of patients in 1Q. Thank you. -- Yes. Salveen, thank you very much for the question. We're delighted with our first full quarter of PADCEV sales of $34 million. And as I previously had mentioned on other calls that along the way, that was exceeding our expectations early on. We mentioned that the uptake was good, including in the community setting. But at this point, it's really -- it's hard to really look and see whether sites -- and we can't really see that sites are accumulating inventory or that there was pent-up demand or things like that. So it's very hard to see that right now. This is an important drug for a disease that didn't really have a lot of good therapy. And so I think we're there and helping patients in a big way.Chip, do you want to add anything to PADCEV that I didn't mention? -- Sure, Clay. Yes. We generally don't see sites include significant inventory or accumulated significant inventory. This is kind of a just-in-time delivery model. So generally when they're ordering, they have a patient. I think you're right in saying that this just represents an advancement, I think, for bladder cancer and that there wasn't a good treatment alternatives out in the marketplace. -- Thank you.We'll take our next question from Kennen MacKay with RBC Capital Markets. -- Hey. Thanks so much for taking the question. Let me offer my congrats on the really incredible PADCEV launch as well, even a very bullish estimate despite a global pandemic ongoing, so huge, huge congrats there. So PADCEV has been discussed a little bit. So I was going to ask elsewhere. I was wondering what you're seeing around the impact of ADCETRIS use due to the COVID pandemic. It seems like it might have been a little bit impacted in Q1 or maybe in March. And then also it seems like the tisotumab vedotin readout maybe got pushed back a little bit. Given this trial was fully enrolled, I'm wondering if we should be thinking that maybe that's suggesting a longer progression-free survival responses of ongoing scan collection from some of these patients that are in that trial. Thanks so much and congrats again. -- Thank you. So with ADCETRIS, we're really excited about ADCETRIS. It's a great drug. It's helped tens of thousands of patients and continues to. The first time that this drug ever hit $1 billion in sales globally was last year. Sales have doubled over the past two years. And quarter-over-quarter [Phonetic] from 2019, it was 22% up. And the first quarter is always a little bit light with ADCETRIS, and it has been year in and year out, so I look at the quarter over this year's first quarter.Now having said that, you did bring up COVID-19. And certainly, that is a -- it's something to look at. Whether there's a small number of patients that are unable to come in and get therapy for lymphoma is something that very well could be happening. It's really hard to know exactly. But we're really excited about our five-year data coming out later this year. And it's something that we haven't changed our guidance for the year. So I think that that's really something important to look at.Now you briefly snuck in a second question on TV about timing. The most important thing with our data with TV is that this is potentially registerable. And we need to follow the data and follow the duration of the data and work with a third-party that puts these type of blinded data together and before we can present this and reveal the data. So that's something that's ongoing. We're working hard at. If they may very well come this quarter, OK? And we're working toward trying to make that happen. We just put out that it may slip a little bit into the third quarter, just in case it does, but we're working hard to get this done in the soonest time frame possible. So I wouldn't read too much into it. And you'll hear about it soon. -- Thank you, again and stay safe.We'll take our next question from Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. -- This is Turner on for Cory. On TUKYSA, we've heard from a few docs that pharmacy copays could be a barrier to access for some patients just based on experience from other orally administered products. What are your thoughts on this and can you comment on some of the programs you're undertaking right now on this front? And then also on EV, I'm curious when we could expect data from the EV-103 study for patients that are platinum-eligible. Thanks. -- Okay. You asked a question on the EV-103 trial. It was a little hard for me to hear it. Roger, did you capture the question? -- Yes, I did. I did. And thanks for the question. -- Can you do that first? And then we'll go back to the TUKYSA question with Chip. -- Sure. I can do that. So the question was when would we expect data from the 103 trial that would lead to a potential approval in cisplatin eligible frontline metastatic bladder cancer. And the answer is, we started the cohort in January, the total number enrolled is 150. It's a randomization versus PADCEV monotherapy to PADCEV plus KEYTRUDA. The enrollment is going as we expect. We are not -- we can't reveal the timing of that. But just to point out, the response rate and duration of response are the two end points that we need. So we understand once we fully enrolled what that timing will look like, but we just can't reveal that at this point. -- Okay. And Chip, can you comment on what Turner had heard about TUKYSA and copay and any potential barrier. We work very hard to make that not happen. So Chip, can you talk about our systems for doing that? -- Sure, Clay. Through our already established SeaGen Secure program, we will provide copay assistance for eligible commercially insured patients to help with -- in order to minimize out-of-pocket costs associated with the product. -- Great. Thanks.We'll take our next question from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. -- Hi, all. This is Connor Meehan on for Matthew. Thanks for taking the question. So just on PADCEV, can you elaborate a bit on your discussions with the FDA and the accelerated approval in the frontline and I guess how those conversations have been going and how they may impact the time line there? And then just quickly on COVID and on the launch, what sort of penetration have you guys been seeing thus far? Thank you. -- Matthew, I am so sorry to ask you, and I apologize for this multimedia way of doing this. Can you -- my phone cut out just for a second. Can you go through your two questions one more time briefly? -- Sure. Yeah, sorry. It might be my end as well. So could you just elaborate briefly on your discussions with the FDA regarding frontline accelerated approval for PADCEV and I guess, just how those have been going and potentially time lines, if available? And then could you just provide some comments around COVID and the impact that it's had to the PADCEV launch and then what sort of penetration that you guys have seen during the first quarter? -- Okay. So first of all, Roger just gave an update on the frontline work we're doing in 150 patients for the accelerated PADCEV approach. And so he explained the two arms in his prepared remarks, 75 patients each. It's 150 patients. We started the enrollment in January. It's going well. We have not provided set time lines at this point. But our interaction with the FDA was strong, and we put out a press release on it. We -- I think at the end of the day, we've done this a lot with different drugs. We had eight different approvals with drugs and labels. And I think we're pretty good at this, and we know what we need to bring to the FDA. But at the end of the day, it's always a review decision. The FDA looks at your data and makes a decision based on the data. So we will work forward fast. We'll be prepared, and we'll bring it to the FDA. And as we get further into the trial, we usually provide time lines, but not yet.As far as COVID-19 and PADCEV, we can't rule out that there wasn't an impact on COVID-19. It's impossible to rule that out. We had two months in the field, and then COVID-19 hit. And our salespeople switched to a virtual sales force, which actually helped train us to be fully ready for TUKYSA. We had two drugs getting approval four months apart, so -- but the second drug, TUKYSA, is purely virtual as far as communications with doctors, etc., and caregivers. But with PADCEV, while we can't rule it out that it had an impact, we're very pleased with the $34 million in net sales.It means, we've gone out there, and we've really got to a lot of patients. Doctors are using the drug. We hear really good things about it. We're certainly bullish on PADCEV going forward, not only in the relapsed setting like we have but also in first line and other settings. And we have not provided a market penetration number on this as of yet. These are things that we would decide in the future whether or not we would provide this type of guidance. -- Understood. Thank you.We'll take our next question from Michael Schmidt with Guggenheim. -- Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the terrific launch here as well of PADCEV. Maybe just a couple for Roger on additional labeling opportunities. The EV-201 cohort 2, can you just help us understand how big that incremental additional opportunity might be in bladder cancer? And then you mentioned the Merck collaboration for muscle invasive bladder cancer patients. Can you just help us here what the potential path to market could look like? -- Sure. Roger, go on ahead. -- Sure. So thanks for the question. So as we've indicated, we've enrolled cohort 2. Cohort 2 is this group of patients on the EV-201 trial who are not cisplatin-eligible but have seen a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor. That's a smaller population than the broader population, which are platinum eligible and have seen a PD-1. Nevertheless, it's a meaningful -- it's a high unmet need. It's a meaningful population. So we're hopeful as the data matures and we're able to give you a little bit more guidance around timing. We've completed enrollment. This is, as is cohort 1 -- as was cohort 1, it's an overall response followed by duration of response evaluation. So we're hoping we'll get the results potentially later this year. But I think as we get more clarity on the timing, we'll give you more guidance.With regard to muscle invasive bladder cancer, we're very pleased. As you know, we have two cohorts running in EV-103: one looking at PADCEV monotherapy and the other looking at PADCEV together with KEYTRUDA in cisplatin ineligible patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer. And essentially, by being able to join the Merck registrational trial, we sort of leapfrogged our potential to get an approval in this very important group of patients.The end points, as defined by original negotiations between Merck and the FDA, focused on things like pathologic complete response and event-free survival. I think the details of how that trial has been altered to accommodate PADCEV and KEYTRUDA will become available through ct.gov or some other means. And once they are available publicly, I think we'll go into more detail for you. But that is an ongoing trial, which we are joining. -- Great. Thanks for the information, really appreciate it and congrats again.We'll take our next question from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. -- This is Greg Harrison on for Geoff. Thanks for taking our question. Just to dig into the guidance a little more. The fact that you maintained it across the board, definitely showed some confidence. So just wondering, what impact from COVID-19 is implied in your decision to maintain the guidance? And what sort of factors are in play, negative or positive, that give you confidence in that outlook, both in terms of ADCETRIS as well as expenses and your other guidance items? -- Sure. Well, I'll address the ADCETRIS, and I'll let Todd address the expenses. So ADCETRIS is a great product. It's been out there approved since 2011. We have six labels, and it helps patients in many different ways. So doctors rely on it, depend on it, and patients benefit from it. And I think that when COVID first comes out and came out on to the scene, it was really hard, I think, for some docs and patients to really know exactly what to do. We were all a little bit stunned by the changes that happened so rapidly.And so I think that initially, it was not as clear. But it is really important for these patients to continue getting therapy and when they need therapy for cancer, getting therapy. It is really, really important. So I think that, over time, we've learned a little bit more and learned how to stay safe and wear masks and do other things. And so I think that right now, cancer patients are getting therapy and -- which is really important for cancer patients with life-threatening disease. And we see that strengthening and improving through the year. So I think staying with our guidance makes a lot of sense for us because there are patients that need therapy, and we think that largely, they're going to be getting their therapy.Todd, do you want to talk about expenses? -- Yes. I'll first maybe start by saying that we have really, as a management team, tried to focus on this and keep business interruption to an absolute minimum. Clay is right, when you look at what we're doing commercially, what we're looking at from a clinical trial perspective, our trials to cancer patients are important, and we have really done the best we can to keep the level of disruption on our trials down.Now when you look at our R&D expenses in the first quarter, if you annualize that, we're a little bit below our annual guidance. But I would point out that we've got a whole bunch of trials that are sort of in ramp-up mode now. And we're trying to keep that going as best we can. This includes the 301, the 302 and the 103 trials for EV, the TUKYSA combination trial with T-DM1, the MOUNTAINEER trial, the TV pivotal study. We've got a lot of potentially registration studies under way, and we've really done the best we can to keep moving forward as fast as we can and still doing it responsibly. -- That's very helpful. Thank you.Our next question comes from Chad Messer with Needham & Company. -- Great. Thanks for taking my question nd let me add my congratulations on really strong first full quarter for PADCEV. I don't think we expected you to get to this run rate for another few quarters at least. My question is on Nectin-4 expression. So in urothelial cancer, you're not enrolling any of these studies based on that, presumably because it's so ubiquitous. But are you collecting information on Nectin-4 expression and looking to see how it correlates to response in any of the studies? And sort of where I'm going is maybe that becomes more important as you look outside of urothelial cancer, just some other indications where it's not quite so ubiquitous and kind of wondering how you're handling that in your basket trial. Thanks. -- Yeah. I'll make a quick comment and turn it over to Roger to talk about a lot of other factors. But very early on, we were looking -- when this product started years ago in Phase I, we'd looked at H-scores, which tells you how much Nectin-4 there is, and response rate. Now keep in mind that H-scores are -- is kind of a crude way to determine level of Nectin-4. It's not 100% precise, but it's pretty good, and it's quick and it's readily available. And it is ubiquitous in bladder cancer. And so we found pretty early on that it was very hard to see a correlation between the H-score from the histology to the response. So in that regard, we do not need a diagnostic tool for it in the metastatic setting.And I'll let Roger speak from there about any other thing in the basket trial, etc. -- Yeah. It's a great question. So really for all of our ADCs, we look, obviously, for the highest expressing tumors. And so the basket trial, EV-202, has a group of cancers, breast, lung, head and neck, gastric cancer and so on, which has high Nectin-4 expression. But we are always prepared. So Nectin-4 expression is always measured. And if it turned out that actually a biomarker was relevant potentially in selecting patients who would respond, I think we would be ready for that. Our supposition is that, that will not be the case. There are components. For example, vedotin ADCs have bystander effect, so the drug can get -- can leak into a cell next door that isn't -- doesn't mark with a particular biomarker. But -- so our going-in premise is we will not need it, but we will be prepared if we do. -- Great. Thanks.We'll take our next question from Gena Wang with Barclays. -- Thank you for taking my questions. Maybe two parts of the question, first one is, regarding the PADCEV. Just wondering the strong revenue for the first quarter, was the script mainly driven by academic doctors or was that by the community doctors? And my second question is regarding the IP arbitration process. Just wondering how long it will usually take and would there be multiple rounds of the process? -- So first of all, concerning PADCEV, we are not, at this point, planning to outline what percentage is in academic settings and what percentage is in community settings. I think in the prepared remarks, Chip mentioned that a fair amount of the use is coming from community settings, which we're delighted with. So right now, we see script coming out of both academic and community settings. And we're very pleased with the uptake, and we look forward to having a great year of providing PADCEV to patients in need and to the doctors and supporting the doctors as they use PADCEV in patients that can really benefit from this exciting drug.So that's something we're going to continue. Maybe in the future, we'll be in a position to discuss the academic and community settings, but it's entirely too soon to really speculate and think about that. As far as the litigation, you -- I believe you asked a question about what we meant -- what we discussed with Daiichi Sankyo. Is that correct, Gena? Did you ask that? -- Yes. So the arbitration process, just wondering how long usually would that take. And also, would there be multiple rounds? I know it's not a court process, but just wondering would that be -- is there like a certain time frame? Should we expect that final results will be read out? -- Okay. So we are not guiding to any specific time frame for that. I appreciate the question very much. We're pleased that the ruling was to go forward in arbitration, keeping in mind that the deal we did basically said that if there was an issue like what has come up, that the correct approach and the right legal pathway forward based on the deal that we had with Daiichi Sankyo was to go through arbitration. And we believe that our case is very strong. We've mentioned this publicly before.We believe that they used our technology, and they made improvements, which was completely spelled out in the agreement to the products they have. And we believe we are correct in bringing this case forward and protecting our IP as appropriate. So we feel very strong about that. Going forward, arbitration is -- it's a more efficient and rapid path forward to a resolution rather than bringing it to a court case. And so we're very pleased that it is going through arbitration, and that's now started. And -- but other than that, it's a pending legal matter, and we really can't make comments. -- Okay. Thank you.We'll take our next question from Joe Catanzaro with Piper Sandler. -- Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on this nice PADCEV quarter. Just one question around it and maybe just to try and give us a sense of the trajectory moving forward. One thing we had heard even prior to COVID is that with PADCEV in the real-world setting, some physicians felt they had flexibility in how they dosed it given it's dosed every three weeks out of four to balance efficacy with the tolerability. Just wondering if you're sort of seeing that and whether you expect that to maybe pick up in light of the current environment to sort of maybe minimize patient visits. Thanks. And any sense around duration of treatment but realize it's early here. -- So Joe, we haven't really seen what you're talking about. I could turn it over to Roger to comment on this, but we haven't seen doctors flexing to some other schedule. I mean we've done our -- we have our schedules, three weeks on and one week of holiday drug holiday, and that's our schedule. The duration also, we presented that with all of our data. And so we have some firm data on duration that we're very proud of, and it's an exciting and a great drug. I mean Roger, is there anything you want to add to that? -- Yeah. Sure. So I think when you get into cancer medicine and a disease like bladder cancer, which can be -- is devastating, patients are very symptomatic, so the demand to get the treatment for the plan is high. With the initial sort of onslaught of COVID, it may have taken some time for oncology clinics to work out how to manage through what a new schedule could look like and how to get patients' treatment. So most of the focus that I think we're aware of is that the clinics focus on giving treatment. They may struggle with off-treatment visits and so on, but getting the treatment is paramount. -- Okay. Thanks for taking my question.We'll take our next question from Andrew Berens with SVB. -- Thanks. And let me add my congrats on the strong launch. You guys beat the Enhertu number, and we thought that was a great launch yesterday. Just wanted to get some more color on PADCEV uses, and it's really, I guess, one question with three parts. Should we think of the beat as being driven by more advanced patients that -- than you'll eventually get? I mean we've seen other launches that kind of roared out of the gate and then the duration of usage for the early patients drops off because they're more advanced. Just trying to see if that could be the case here. And then can you guys give us any color, are you seeing usage of PADCEV with KEYTRUDA? And then the last part is, are you getting patients that have the FGFR biomarker? -- Okay. So thank you for your questions. And congratulations to you on putting three questions into one. It's very innovative. So as far as the advanced patients go, your comment on whether we've seen a lot of advanced patients, and we'll see a falloff and all that stuff, that is not where we feel we are. We feel this is being used broadly and will continue to be used broadly. We have a lot -- there's a lot of excitement for this drug going forward. And I think for anybody that has metastatic bladder cancer, according to the label, this treats anybody, whether you're advanced, more advanced or less advanced.Keep in mind that most patients with bladder cancer, to some extent, are advanced. It's a bad disease. And -- but whether they're earlier in that cycle or later in the cycle, all of them could benefit. And I don't -- I really can't make comments that we're just seeing one type of patient, I don't think that's happening. As far as the combination with KEYTRUDA, we're -- we loved our data. Our data was spectacular with that, which is why we started a global trial to do -- to look for frontline, which is also why we went to FDA early to say is there an expedited pathway to get to first-line in combination with KEYTRUDA.So we're doing both the full global trial as well as doing the expedited trial and -- with PADCEV. And as far as whether anybody is using PADCEV in combination with KEYTRUDA, we can't make any comments on that. That's not -- certainly not something that we're out there promoting for. We have clinical trials opened right now. I think that we're encouraging people to sign up for trials to do that.And as far as the last question on FGF biomarker, we're very aware of that. It's not something that we're focused on, though. I mean that's a small subsection of bladder cancer. We basically have no -- there's no diagnostic tool. We can use everybody. So -- or we could treat everyone, I should say. And we're -- so we're looking at really just helping out as many patients as we possibly can and working with the doctors that make their therapy decisions. -- Great. Thank you very much, Clay.We'll take our next question from Stephen Willey with Stifel. -- Yeah. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the PADCEV launch. Just a couple of quick ones. I was wondering maybe if you can just talk a little bit about CD30C in terms of what's being used there to drive the improved tolerability that was referenced in the opening remarks. Is that a more stable linker? Is that a different payload? And then just curious regarding your publication plans, if there's any in the works for the EV-103 data in terms of the preliminary results that we've seen thus far. Thanks. -- Sure. I'll answer the CD30C question, and then Roger can opine on the EV-103 plans for publications, presentations, whatever. With CD30C, we decided that it was important to try to continue to innovate and continue to make as best a drug as we can for cancer patients, and CD30 is a target we know a heck of a lot about. This is something that we have studied for years. I think we're one of the top companies, if not the top company, in the world thinking about CD30 or CD30 therapy. And so I think that it's really important to think about continuing to get better and treat patients better.ADCETRIS is a phenomenal drug, but to try to improve outcomes for patients with CD30 malignancies is important for us. So we set out a few years ago to try to say how can we make a drug that can even give patients even better outcomes than what's already a really good drug in ADCETRIS. And it was hard. I mean we made a lot of different versions and just couldn't get any better than ADCETRIS for years and which tells you a lot about ADCETRIS and how good of a drug it is.So with CD30C, what I would say is it's different. It has different linkers, different payloads, different ways it's going to work, different ways it could combine with things. So in the laboratory setting and in animal models of cancer, we're really excited with it in the clinic. Whether this will prove to be better than ADCETRIS or different than ADCETRIS with different characteristics, we don't know yet, but we're excited to bring this forward and see how much we can work toward helping patients. So that's really what that's about. Roger, do you want to talk about EV-103 and plans? -- Sure. Yeah. So it's a great question, and it's under consideration because, as you know, the results were really quite remarkable. And we think that it could potentially be worthy of a publication, but I don't think this final decision has been made, but obviously, we'll update you if we make that call. -- All right. Thanks for taking the question.We'll take our next question from George Farmer with BMO Capital Markets. -- Hi. Good afternoon, and congratulations on PADCEV. It's fantastic to see. I actually have a question about ADCETRIS. And Clay, you mentioned that there's going to be some five-year follow-up data coming. Do you expect that's going to move the needle with practitioners? And if so, how do you see that? -- Thank you for the question, George. It's a good question. When we started and got our first approval in frontline Hodgkin lymphoma, a lot of docs saw the data, and they saw it was two years' worth of data, and the data were strong. But they said this is a disease we know how to treat for decades. They were using ABVD, and they had a lot of data. And the docs remarked to us that the five-year data was gold standard for this. And they really want to see the five-year data and really know what's the durable, long-term, and they call it, cure rate.Now cure, I mean, we all die someday of something. But if you're five years' out, and you have no evidence of disease, doctors will talk to their patients, and they say, you are disease-free, you are technically cured of your cancer because we have no evidence five years' out. So there's a defined cure for sure. But they've always said to us that the five-year number was the gold standard. And I think that for anybody that is still on the fence or not considering it, I think the five-year data absolutely could be interesting. Whether it will be a mad rush or something, we're not guiding to that, George, but I think it certainly could be important.The other thing is especially during the COVID era we're living in, having five-year data with a regimen without bleomycin is important. Bleomycin causes lung scarring and gives you respiratory distress. And for somebody to have Hodgkin lymphoma, which is, in many circumstances, a curable disease by the definition I said, but to give them some pretty severe lung toxicity, I would not want a patient to have that and then be exposed to COVID because you could be much, much worse because of their lung scarring that you get and respiratory distress you get with bleomycin.So having this alternative that not only is better, you have a higher rate of -- we presented the four-year data, in the four-year data so far, a higher rate of disease-free survival by around 6% to 7% over ABVD and without the lung scarring of bleomycin. I think it's an important thing to think about in this COVID era that are working through and having the five-year data would even be better. -- Yeah. That makes sense. And then finally, can you talk a little bit about what the TUKYSA presentation will be discussing at ASCO in more detail? -- Well, we can't tell you the whole presentation because that's for the ASCO virtual meeting. But Roger, can you give a little foreshadowing? -- Sure. As HER2CLIMB was designed and as it was presented, we focused on the main end points, which were progression-free survival in the overall population, overall survival and then progression-free survival in patients with brain metastases. But important questions -- and that's the framework under which you understand the value and the benefit to patients. But important questions can still be answered by interrogating the data and focusing really on the outcome in the brain itself. And so we've done those analyses, and we've put together what we think is a coherent story to explain more clearly what the brain-specific outcomes will look like, and that's what we hope will be of value to everyone when it gets presented at ASCO. -- Okay. Thanks very much.We'll take our next question from Andy Hsieh with William Blair. -- Great. Thanks for taking my question. I hope everybody is staying safe and healthy, and congratulations on a spectacular quarter. So my question has to do with kind of the concurrent enrollment of the EV-103 cohort K and the pivotal EV-302, very similar patient population. Do you see kind of the enrollment tilt toward the cohort K just given that you have both options, which are chemotherapy-free versus EV-302 and, therefore, we should expect a really rapid enrollment time frame. -- So thanks for the question on the cohort K and the pivotal trial. Roger, can you explain what we're thinking of and looking there in the geographies, etc.? -- Sure. And Andy, it's a great question. And so to some degree, yes, cohort K would overlap with EV-302. But bear in mind, EV-302 is a very large trial, that is, we'll have a global footprint. EV-103 is more focused in places like the United States. And there are more than enough patients to enroll both of those trials. So we'll -- it's what we do all day, which is to manage trial recruitment and to make sure that trials are adequately supported for both of them. So I don't have any concerns that we'll be able to enroll both trials expeditiously, and that's what we plan to do. -- Got it. Okay. And then so it goes without saying that the company has executed to perfection in the past two years. And so it's welcoming to see in the presentation, you have some early stage assets highlighted. Just curious, Clay, any assets heading into ASCO that you're particularly excited and just curious on your thoughts on the progress made in the SEA sugar-engineered platform and the CD40 asset that could be immune potentiating? -- Sure. So thank you very much for your remarks on how well the company has done over the last few years. We're focused on cancer patients. And we've been working really hard to help cancer patients get drugs approved. Even during the COVID time, we have kind of rearranged the company for efficiency and people that can work from home are working from home, and we have even started to reopen under very strict guidelines our laboratories where we have social distancing and people with mask and gloves, but they're back in the laboratories and working. And our goal is to really work hard and execute well to make a difference in cancer patients' lives. And so we're making -- trying to make the right decisions and focusing on that.Now to your question on the early stage assets, you bring up the SEA-40 program. That is a very exciting drug that we are developing. And you'll hear more data about that in the future. Right now, I don't want to disclose any data. It's not ready to be disclosed. We'll disclose it at the right time. But it's an exciting program. It's a non-ADC. We are doing more and more with non-ADCs, plus adding more ADCs. I think we mentioned that in the prepared remarks that there's both ADCs and non-ADCs.And certainly, our last approval in TUKYSA is a non-ADC, it's our first non-ADC approved. And so we're excited to make a difference in cancer patients in any way when we work on targeted therapies, whether they're targeted to the cell surface or inside the cell. I think that our early stage assets are very exciting. We have quite a lot of assets, and we don't talk about them too much until we have some real data to show. But I think over the next year or two, you're going to hear a lot about our early assets, and I'm excited about them. -- Great. Thank you very much for all the question.We will take our next question from Silvan Tuerkcan with Oppenheimer. -- Thanks. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the quarter. I have a question on the PADCEV development in muscle-invasive setting. Since your clinical development moves so fast, I just want to make sure that I don't look track here. So first, would EV-103 and the amended Phase III now be enough to file? And second of all, I think it's a pretty big deal that Merck mans an ongoing Phase III to include PADCEV even prior to seeing the 103 data. Could you give a little bit more color on how did this happen? And does it mean that Merck will use the combo as potential new standard of care in this setting here? That's it. -- Well, first of all, thank you for your very insightful questions about this. And we really can't comment on Merck and what their thoughts are and whatever. We can tell you what the trial is and what we're doing and what we're attempting to do and why we're going after this. And Roger, maybe you could give a little color on muscle-invasive bladder cancer and why this is important. But I'm sorry, I just can't comment and we can't comment on what Merck or any company is thinking at this time. -- Yeah. Sure. So it's -- again, it's a great question. And I think the excitement around combining an ADC with a vedotin warhead, which has been shown to not only kill cancer cells and kill them well in bladder cancer but also set up an immunogenic cell death environment that is potentially -- that could help a PD-1 inhibitor with an improved immune response, so combining those two and the data that we generated out of EV-103 with the cis-ineligible frontline, I think, gives us conviction that we should take this combination forward as appropriate. And of course, we are still executing a small cohort in EV-103, but the opportunity to join an already established registrational trial and taking this combination together into a muscle-invasive setting, we think, is really opportune for us.And Nectin-4 expression is consistent across all of the stages of bladder cancer, all the way from advanced metastatic disease back into the nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer and in muscle-invasive bladder cancer. So there's no reason to believe that somehow PADCEV will behave differently in this disease setting. Merck has already generated data with pembrolizumab, which -- with KEYTRUDA, which is pretty exciting. So taking these two active agents and combining them in this population, for which really there is no therapy apart from cystectomy, we think is an important potential step forward. -- Great. Thanks a lot for taking my question.It appears there are no further questions at this time. Ms. Pinkston, I'd like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks. -- Okay. Thank you, operator, and thanks, everybody, for joining us this afternoon. Be well.[Operator Closing Remarks] --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --

As the overall market declined amid the coronavirus outbreak,   shares resisted, climbing 22% since the start of this year. The reason is simple: It's all about products. Seattle Genetics started the year with a newly approved drug -- Padcev, for the most common form of bladder cancer -- and investors were hopeful the U.S. Food and Drug Administration would soon approve the company's breast cancer drug, tucatinib, to be commercialized as Tukysa. Last week, that approval came -- four months earlier than expected.Now the question is: Can Seattle Genetics move higher, or is the good news priced into the shares at this point? A look at approved treatments and market sizes can offer us some clues.Image source: Getty Images.Just a year ago, Seattle Genetics was a one-product company. That product -- Adcetris, for Hodgkin lymphoma -- had a particularly strong 2019 thanks to label expansions, posting a 32% increase in net sales to $627.7 million in the U.S. and Canada. Now, Seattle Genetics forecasts a slowdown in Adcetris' sales for 2020, with an increase in the range of 8% to 12%. Still, long-term growth isn't necessarily over for Adcetris as the company works to establish the treatment as the standard of care in Hodgkin lymphoma and expand its uses.A slowdown in growth for Adcetris is also less of a concern given the approvals of Padcev in December and Tukysa more recently, though it will take several quarters before these drugs can truly contribute to revenue. My eyes will be on Seattle Genetics' earnings report April 30 to see how Padcev fared during its first full quarter on the market.Padcev is a treatment for locally advanced or metastatic urothelial (bladder) cancer. The approval pertains to adult patients who have previously been treated with both platinum-based chemotherapy and inhibitors of proteins that help cancer cells survive. The FDA recently granted a breakthrough therapy designation for an additional use, and after discussions with the regulatory body, Seattle Genetics is optimistic about a potential accelerated approval registration. That would be for the use of Padcev along with an immune therapy called pembrolizumab as a first-line treatment for patients with advanced forms of urothelial cancer who can't receive chemotherapy treatments that use a common treatment called cisplatin.If sales predictions are correct, Padcev may be poised to be a blockbuster. Analysts from SVB Leerink Research predict peak sales of more than $5 billion, according to press reports. And according to Grand View Research, the global urothelial cancer drug market will reach $3.6 billion by 2023, with a compounded annual growth rate of 23%.Tukysa might be another blockbuster opportunity. SVB Leerink expects that drug to generate peak sales of $1.2 billion by 2030. Tukysa is approved in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine for advanced or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer. In HER2-positive breast cancer, high levels of the HER2 protein within tumors lead to the spread of cancer cells. Tukysa inhibits enzymes that activate this type of protein. A GlobalData report shows the market for HER2-positive breast cancer is set to increase 54% to $9.89 billion by 2025 from 2015.Seattle Genetics also has about 15 programs in phase 1 or phase 2 trials among its pipeline, adding to future revenue prospects.Seattle Genetics has steadily grown its revenue since 2011, when Adcetris was first approved. The company's  narrowed last year to $158.7 million from $222.7 million in 2018, and after five consecutive quarterly losses, Seattle Genetics posted a profit in the last quarter of 2019. The company also reported an increase in cash levels, starting this year with $868.3 million in cash and investments compared with $459.9 million a year earlier. The financial picture is brightening for Seattle Genetics, and the additions of Padcev and Tukysa should give it a further boost.So, is it too late to buy Seattle Genetics stock? No. Though the shares only have to rise 5.5% to reach Wall Street's average price estimate, for the long-term , there is more to gain as the newly approved drugs begin adding to the company's revenue.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

(RTTNews) - Shares of Seattle Genetics Inc. (SGEN), which touched an all-time high of $128 on April 7, 2020, have since lost 6 percent of their value and trade around $120.The Company, which until the end of 2019 was a one-trick pony, marketing Adcetris, has now become a multi-product oncology company, following the rapid FDA approval of Padcev, and another drug candidate Tucatinib waiting at the FDA altar. Adcetris, which is indicated for lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, and mycosis fungoides, brought in annual sales of $628 million for Seattle Genetics in 2019 compared to $476.9 million in 2018. The drug received its initial approval in August 2011, and its sales have increased over the years. For 2020, Seattle Genetics expects to report Adcetris sales in the range of $675 to $700 million.Seattle Genetics has U.S. and Canadian commercialization rights and Takeda has rights to commercialize Adcetris in the rest of the world. The global sales of the drug exceeded $1 billion in 2019.The Company's Padcev received accelerated FDA approval as a monotherapy for urothelial carcinoma as recently as last December. Going by the number of ordering accounts received for the drug in January, Padcev seems to be gaining wide acceptance. Padcev is also being evaluated in combination with Merck's Keytruda in advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer. In addition, Padcev as a monotherapy is also under a phase II clinical trial in a range of solid tumors, including non-small cell lung, head and neck, gastric/esophageal and breast cancers. Padcev is being co-developed and jointly commercialized with Astellas Pharma Inc.Waiting at the FDA altar is Tucatinib, proposed for the treatment of patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, with a decision date set for August 20, 2020. The drug candidate is also under review in Europe, Australia, Singapore, Canada, and Switzerland.Also in the pipeline is Tisotumab vedotin for the treatment of metastatic/recurrent cervical cancer, being developed in collaboration with Genmab A/S. A pivotal trial of Tisotumab vedotin in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic cervical cancer who have relapsed or progressed after standard-of-care treatment, dubbed innovaTV 204, is underway, with topline data expected in the first half of this year.Seattle Genetics ended the year 2019 with $868.3 million in cash and investments.SGEN has traded in a range of $62.90 to $128.00 in the last 1 year.

There are 12 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Seattle Genetics Inc, but the average is just that — a mathematical average.  There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $95.00.  And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $150.00.  The standard deviation is $15.9.


But the whole reason to look at the average SGEN price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes.  And so with SGEN crossing above that average target price of $119.08/share, investors in SGEN have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $119.08 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?  Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Seattle Genetics Inc:

If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $70.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $68.80 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of SGEN, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $113.27/share today.

Because the $70.00 strike represents an approximate 38% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 100%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.71% return on the cash commitment, or 12.77% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.


Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Seattle Genetics Inc, and highlighting in green where the $70.00 strike is located relative to that history:


   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $120.00 strike price has a current bid of $8.10.  If an investor was to purchase shares of SGEN stock at the current price level of $113.27/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $120.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 13.09% if the stock gets called away at the May 15th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if SGEN shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Seattle Genetics Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing SGEN's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $120.00 strike highlighted in red:



   
Considering the fact that the $120.00 strike represents an approximate 6% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 60%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 7.15% boost of extra return to the investor, or 53.27% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.


The implied volatility in the put contract example is 138%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 90%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $113.27) to be 46%.

"Legendary investor Warren Buffett advises to be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful.  One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100.  A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.

In trading on Friday, shares of Seattle Genetics Inc (Symbol: SGEN) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 29.4, after changing hands as low as $91.28 per share.  By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) is 30.0.  A bullish investor could look at SGEN's 29.4 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.    The chart below shows the one year performance of SGEN shares:
   
   

Looking at the chart above, SGEN's low point in its 52 week range is $62.90 per share, with $124.32 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $91.86.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''.  These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand.  Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).  Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

Importantly, Acadia plans to file for Food and Drug Administration approval of Nuplazid for dementia-related psychosis, a condition that the company claims is a ten-times-larger patient population. To prepare, Acadia is expanding its sales force from 200 to roughly 500 people. The company expects 2020 Nuplazid sales to reach between $440 million to $470 million, a 34% increase year-over-year at the midpoint of the range.

Vascepa demonstrated that it can help reduce cardiovascular events in patients with high risk for cardiovascular issues.

While appearing to fire on all cylinders, the stock lost about 15% of its value.What makes Exelixis more attractive than most? Well, it's profitable, a rarity among most small and mid-cap biotechs.

Despite this, the company's value sits at 2.8 times sales. That gives it a market cap of $6.5 billion.Adjusted net income rose to $934 million in 2019, an increase of 11% from the prior year.

(RTTNews) - Today's Daily Dose brings you news about Adamis Pharma's upcoming regulatory catalyst, the delay in FDA decision related to Eton Pharma's drug candidate, the global license agreement between Five Prime and Seattle Genetics, and Karyopharm's date with FDA.Read on…Adamis Pharmaceuticals Corp. (ADMP) expects to resubmit ZIMHI New Drug Application early in the second quarter of 2020.ZIMHI is a high-dose naloxone injection product candidate intended for the treatment of opioid overdose. The Company was issued a Complete Response Letter by the FDA for ZIMHI last November.ADMP closed Wednesday's trading at $0.69, down 9.47%.The FDA decision on Eton Pharmaceuticals Inc.'s (ETON) New Drug Application for ET-105 is likely to be delayed as the Company has been asked to conduct a human factors validation study with the revised labeling to demonstrate that the intended users can prepare and administer the oral suspension safely and effectively.ET-105 is proposed as an adjunct therapy for partial seizures, primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and generalized seizures of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in patients two years of age and older.The decision date on ET-105 is due on March 17, 2020.

Heron resubmitted an NDA to the FDA for HTX-011 in September 2019 and was initially assigned a decision date of March 26, 2020.

"A new study released this month in the  has found that women who drink milk every day may be at an elevated risk of developing breast cancer. The observational study followed 52,795 women in North America over a period of 7.9 years, and one of the key findings, according to the study's author, Dr. Gary Fraser, was that ""by drinking up to one cup per day, the associated risk went up to 50 percent, and for those drinking two to three cups per day, the risk increased further to 70 percent to 80 percent.""Researchers found that soy products, however, weren't associated with a higher risk of breast cancer.By the end of the study, there were 1,057 women diagnosed with breast cancer, or about 2% of the total women in the study. Currently, there's about a 13% risk that an American woman will develop breast cancer at some point during her life.  The American Cancer Society (ACS) estimates that 42,170 women will die from breast cancer in 2020.  It's the second leading cause of cancer death in women behind lung cancer, to which the ACS estimates 63,220 American women will succumb this year. Image source: Getty Images. is working on bringing a new breast cancer drug to market, tucatinib.

That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. Less than two months ago, Chris Hill joined me for what is looking like an increasingly iconic and unintentionally predictive  podcast. It was called ""The Day the Market Crashed."" We simulated for you, our dear listener, what it sounds like when the market has dropped dramatically. There's fear, maybe even a little blood in the streets.Well, this week the market has been doing all of that, and in some cases, some more. The market isn't exactly down 25%, as we had it in that podcast, but my portfolio is down about 20% from its high two weeks ago -- I don't know about yours -- so it seems close.And in terms of the fear of a global pandemic, something we hadn't worked into our narrative, that's something we must all stare straight in the eye, confront, and, I trust, win, as we surely will. But not before pain and the inevitable ups and downs -- not just of the market but of humanity, all of life.Let's talk about this week, shall we? Will you join me? Pull up a chair and stay a while, only on this week's .Welcome back to  You know, at the very start of The Motley Fool, before we had done our first print issue, we would only print 12 of them before we went online, back when America Online was the thing, pre-Web even, but we were just, we started by printing newsletters. Our very first one, we thought, ""How are we going to make a splash with this one?"" We thought, ""What if we write a letter to a famous novelist and ask him to make a comment that we could print in the very first issue of The Motley Fool? Wouldn't that be special?"" I said to my brother Tom and his friend Eric.And so, Eric intrepidly wrote the British novelist Julian Barnes, who had recently read a book at that time called . And we appealed to him to write something inspirational to speak to our readers, this modest family newsletter, for our first issue. Mr. Barnes, probably to his credit, declined to do so, but he declined to do so by writing us a letter, which we, of course, photographed and printed right in the first issue of The Motley Fool.Now, why am I telling that story? Well, as I think about where we are right now in the world and our markets, I was thinking for some reason ""10 1/2 Chapters,"" because I have a number of things I want to say this week. And so I thought, why not organize my thoughts, it's thoughts about our world, in 10 1/2 chapters, an allusion to the original copy of The Motley Fool newsletter with Julian Barnes' seal of approval on it. So, welcome.And before we start our 10 1/2 chapters, just a few things to get out of the way up front. I don't exactly know who runs the @TheMotleyFool account on . I think my brother Tom has put a lot of effort in there. I know people like Morgan Housel have contributed over the years. We have a social media team today. Somebody on our Motley Fool account on Twitter, Sunday night, posted a brilliant tweet. Here it was: ""Health plus : Wash your hands, then tomorrow, sit on them."" That was so apt, so well put. So, credit out to that might be Tom, Morgan on a team. So well put and so true.Now, I had planned, originally, to do the market cap game show this week. I had mentioned that last week. But given how the world has turned, I thought it might look like whistling Dixie, if we're playing the market cap game show in the face of such market turmoil. All that said, I'm kind of a stiff-upper-lip person. Let's keep on doing the right thing. That's not always the best medical advice out there, but I decided, let's go ahead and do the market cap games show next week. We were going to do dividend investing with Buck Hartzell; we'll be doing that in April instead of this month given the events.But we're going to be playing our game next week no matter what, and you know what, look out, Aaron Bush and/or anyone else I invite on, because the market caps have changed. Also, if you're hearing this within the first 24 hours or so, when we publish this podcast -- this typically comes out Wednesdays on the East Coast of the United States of America late afternoon -- within 24 hours I will be on YouTube Live. That's Thursday, 3:30 p.m. Eastern, with Chris Hill. So, YouTube Live, that's our YouTube channel, The Motley Fool, and we'll be taking your questions. So if that would be of interest to you, and you're hearing this quickly enough, you download it and listen to it right away, then you know you can join with Chris and me tomorrow.And finally, one thing I want to get out of the way before we start Chapter 1. I want to say something about the hypochondriacs out there, the warriors. I know some of them. And while I'm generally preternaturally opposite that, I'm kind of the optimist you can't stamp down, I do want to say, the warriors can have their day, and they should. I don't root for those who obsessively focus on worries and health, but they're going to have their day in the sun from time to time, and God bless them. Everyone deserves some sun.You know, one of the best CEOs of our time, the dearly departed Andy Grove, former CEO of , wrote a famous book, I bet many of you've read -- it's called . That's not, again, the mental space that I come from, as I approach work and life, but some really, really successful people have. And in highly unusual circumstances like this, as we find ourselves globally in March of 2020, this might be one where being paranoid about your health is a darn good idea. Wash your hands, then tomorrow, and then sit on them.All right, Chapter 1. Chapter 1 is entitled ""Nothing."" As in doing nothing. People are saying to me, and I understand why they would, ""Hey, Dave, what are you doing with your money?"" And I say, ""Nothing."" They say, ""Do you have any money saved up on the side?"" You know, ""Is it time to deploy that cash that you've been holding back?"" I'm saying, ""What cash?"" ""No, I remain fully invested."" That's pretty much what I've always done as an investor and what I've talked about for years now in this podcast. And of course, for decades on our website before that.I certainly respect people who like to keep a cash cushion, so-called. The thinking is that they can dive in at the right moment and invest that and do even better, but in my experience, given that the market typically rises 9% to 10% a year and we don't really know when it's going to drop or come back, if you look at the math and most studies, you'll see that staying near or fully invested is the best way to approach maximizing your returns over the long term as an investor, which is the only term, the only game that we are playing. So what am I doing? Chapter 1, I'm doing nothing. What about you?Now, I hope that doesn't sound irresponsible. As humans, we're fairly conditioned, and most of the time this works. We're fairly conditioned to think more effort, more reward. Ironically, though, I think part of the approach to investing that's worked so well for us here at The Motley Fool is that not working so hard does better.On  on Monday, a really wonderful effort by Jason Moser and Chris Hill, they took a mailbag item from somebody who said, ""Hey, guys, I've held my cash back, so should I plunge in now?"" And the way that I hear that question is guesswork -- has the market fallen far enough or will it fall farther? I really don't think there's any way to authoritatively answer that question. I don't think Chris and Jason really tried to do that, but if I had been on the other side of that question, I would have said, if you have a cash lump, either one you saved or maybe you just got a lump sum from somebody else, one of the best ways to do it is to deploy it systematically.And so, even though I'm saying, nothing, earlier, Chapter 1, nothing, the truth is that I'm saving every two weeks -- I hope you are too if you're a wage earner -- and I'm investing. And so it's a constant mechanical process that involves absolutely no guesswork. So I do congratulate anybody sitting on a cash cushion, because this 20%-off sale in March has been a much better deal than people were getting in January when we recorded ""The Day the Market Crashed."" So, congratulations, but I nevertheless think that you should be deploying that money on a regular basis. And if you have a lump, buy in thirds, divide it up into pieces, and systematically put that money into the market. I bet you'll be happy five, 10-plus years from now, which is after all why we're doing what we're doing, right?And as we close down Chapter 1, let me just repeat something I said on the podcast just a couple of weeks ago. In fact, it was our February mailbag, and I felt a compulsion at the time to just try to speak to coronavirus, since it was becoming a bigger story and the markets were starting to rock. I'm just literally going to reread what I said from two weeks ago, because, I think, I hope, it still feels just as imperative and just as relevant.And here it was: ""From an investment standpoint, I just want to say, these events don't change my approach. I personally have made a lifetime commitment to our stock market as an investor. So I really am, I'm playing the long game, and I hope you are too. So how the stock market does this week, this quarter, this year, is not going to change how I do, I hope how we do, what we do. Certainly, if you're right near retirement or you need the money that you're investing to live on, you should already be making, have been making plans to transition into some more income investing, these other ways to secure your financial future if you're near the end of your tether. But for those of us in the middle of our tether or earlier on in life, you shouldn't allow even scary things, like human tragedies, to shake you or your money out of the market. You're going to do far better if you patiently keep adding money. The biggest question isn't should I sell or should I get out before a downdraft in the market because of coronavirus? The biggest question most of us should be asking is, am I saving enough on my next salary check, and where am I going to put that money now maybe at a discount?You should be thinking that every two weeks. And that's the approach we've always promoted here at The Motley Fool. That's what we live by. We're all in different circumstances. We're in different countries around the world with different risk tolerances at different points in our lives. So your mileage may vary, and if it does, make sure it's appropriate to you and who you are.But for the most part, our Foolish way of investing in what we do here at , really, I try not to allow even bigger stories that dominate the headlines for a month or a year to change where my money is invested or how I'm doing it, and I hope that's true of you too.On a side note, I was listening back to the day the market crashed from a couple of months ago, and one thing we had right, we had  down 30% that day, and as I record here, on Tuesday afternoon, March 10, even though the stock market is incredibly volatile, back up 3% at the moment, Stitch Fix down about 30% today.All right, Chapter 2. I felt like Chapter 1 may have sounded a little preachy; I hope it didn't come across too strong, but I feel that strongly, so put it out there. But Chapter 2 is that ""The Tide Heads Out Sometimes."" And I think the tide is headed out.And when the tide heads out, we see who is prepared for it and who is not. Who wasn't wearing a bathing suit? I remember in the financial -- do you remember in 2008-2009, the Great Recession? -- the number of Ponzi schemes that were being exposed, people who were money managers, who were supposedly making a lot of money by taking your money in and giving you great returns, 2005, '06, '07, all of a sudden remember Marcus Schrenker. I certainly don't remember the name, but I looked this one up. Marcus Schrenker is a former American financial advisor.In 2009, he attempted to fake his own death due to personal financial and legal troubles. He was a pilot. He got up in a plane. Do you remember the story? He made a distress call near Birmingham, Alabama, telling air traffic controllers his windshield had imploded and he was bleeding profusely. He put the plane on autopilot, he parachuted out, he parachuted to safety. That was an over-the-top effort, real-life effort by somebody to avoid the financial consequences that he was causing in other people's lives. It took 2008-2009 to trigger that. It took losses to expose who wasn't prepared, who was fragile, who was antifragile. Marcus Schrenker is an incredibly iconic story for us, as I think about this, but of course there are many more sympathetic ones.You know, some businesses do need to exist on debt, in part, in order to run their operations smoothly and effectively. And when we have financial catastrophes, those businesses and the people who are part of them can get really hurt. Slightly less sympathetic to me are people who are on margin, people who are taking crazy risks with their money. I hope that's not you. Certainly, I preach about that week-in and week-out over five years now, so I trust most of my fellow Fools are not in such a situation. But think about the people who were taking silly risks. The businesses that were borrowing too much money. There's a natural process by which, when the tide goes out, these things get exposed and get knocked down. They either have to reform or go away. And thus, the world moves forward.So even though I'm the guy who every year says, ""I think the market is going up this year."" You remember that's my market prediction I make each year, and boy, have I been right a lot of the last several years. Maybe I'll get it wrong this year. But I'm fully prepared to get it wrong financially and mentally; I hope that you are too. I hope that part of being a Rule Breaker has strengthened you against the downside, whether it's podcasts like ""The Day the Market Crashed"" which gets you to psychologically process that ahead of time or just the good habits that I hope you built through The Motley Fool, either through this podcast over the last five years or how about our business side over the last 25-plus years.I know a lot of you are more than equal to the test when the tide is headed out. And in fact, those who are, are even stronger as a consequence and emerge more successfully as inevitably the tide comes back.Chapter No. 3. Chapter No. 3 is entitled ""You Don't Need to Hear From Me, Do You?"" Which I think I kind of spoke to, but sometimes I've whined in the past in this podcast that I don't feel any great personal urgency to come in and reassure everyone to be patient and hold or buy more during downtimes. In fact, I remember having to do that with my brother Tom. We'd go on to network television or CNBC, on a fairly regular basis the first 10 years of our business. We would be the guys who were called in when everything is going badly. They'd have us on  -- ""Guys, the market is down."" And I felt like the most important messages that we're being asked to give was whenever the market was dropping, but that's not a natural state. Natural state is the market rising. People don't want to have us on  to talk about when the market is rising. They wanted us to speak to the pain, and I understand that and I'm trying to do that myself to up to a point.But Chapter 3 is entitled ""You Don't Need to Hear From Me, Do You?"" Because I don't take a lot of enjoyment in that kind of reassurance. It feels like Pablum to me sometimes. ""Oh, it's OK. Just keep buying. It'll all come back."" I mean, I do do that myself, but it doesn't sound that satisfying to me either to say or to hear it. It's kind of stereotypical to me, maybe a cliche, but maybe that's because I'm a Fool.But while you don't need to hear from me, I hope, do you, I am going to sound four of my favorite lines to you right now. Just resound them to many of you. The first is, stocks always go down faster than they go up, but they always go up more than they go down. I don't want that line on my gravestone because there are many more interesting things to talk about, but I think that's a truism, and I've always loved that line ever since I first conceived of it.I was thinking about F. Scott Fitzgerald, that whole thing about holding two opposed thoughts in the mind at once and that's a sign of brilliance. I want to make you brilliant; I want to make sure you understand. And you're seeing it right now -- once again, stocks always go down faster than they go up, but they always go up more than they go down.Line No. 2. In direct contrast to the threadbare disclaimers, you should know that past performance may very well be our single best indicator of future results. I think we've all seen those financial ads -- often they have to end ""Past performance is no guarantee of future results."" I've often looked at that, of course, that's the conventional wisdom, so as fellow Fools I look at that and I wanted to take a shot at it, because it's such horrible advice. Indeed, as I just said, probably our single best indicator of future results is the past. ""#WinnersWin.""So, let's briefly think about the past when it comes to the stock market. Take a look at the line of the stock market's graph performance over the last 100, 50, 30 years, take your favorite long-term slice, whatever your favorite era is you want to look at. You're going to see it starts in the lower left and goes to the upper right -- past performance.Now, in any meaningful era, 30, 50, 100 years, if you zoom in to a two- or three-year period, you might see, since you're zoomed in, what looks like a scary drop. And it didn't feel great at the time and a lot of us have lived through multiple ones. And I know a lot of you are older than I am. So you've seen more than I have. But I've certainly seen the 1987 market crash, I've seen the 2001 market crash, 2008-2009 market crash. And if this ends up being a really bad market year, we can notch our belt one more and have lived through it together.But the whole point, my fellow Fools, is let's zoom out again and take a look at what happens for the people who are playing the only game that counts, the long game, past performance, probably the single best indicator of future results. Please don't forget that.No. 3. is ""Optimism Is Not Just a State of Mind; It's a Creative Force."" Henry Ford famously said, ""Whether you think you can or whether you think you cannot, you're right."" So, yeah, I'm saying to you, my listener, ""I think you can,"" and I think, you should think so too. So, this one isn't so much about the market, it's about the state of the world right now.Let's divide the world up into two types of people. We do this all the time. There are the people who believe we can and the people who believe we cannot. And I'm pretty sure I know which group is going to take us successfully into the future, and it's the former. And I know I'm speaking to a lot of you today, because most people, in my experience, who love investing, who believe in the stock market, who believe in our society, our culture, in our fellow humans, despite all of our flaws, most of you are optimists. And whether you think you can or whether you think you cannot, you're right.And finally, No. 4, the two keys to my investment approach, ""Stock-by-Stock, In Before the Vast Majority of Others and Out After the Vast Majority of Others."" We were into  at $3.21; we still hold the stock today. That means we were in way before most of humanity. You could have been in 15 years later and still been early on Amazon. We watched the stock go from $3 up to $95 in 2000, down to $7 by 2002, kept holding. The market is so volatile this week, I'm not even going to attempt to quote Amazon stock, but when you do, think about that $3.21 cost basis that we gave to all our members, all the people who are following The Motley Fool, back in 1997. In before the vast majority of others, but then, of course, the secret, the latter half of that line, out after the vast majority of others. So, many people have traded in and out of Amazon, , , , ,  were the stocks we've held for 20 years or five years. Most people have traded in and out of them once at least already. I hope it's not true of you and I. The way to maximize your returns -- in before the vast majority of others and out after the vast majority of others. Which, of course, given the times where we are, where many people are thinking about selling or are in fact selling, I hope you'll remember that winning formula for winning the real game that counts the long-term game of investing.All right, Chapter 4. Chapter 4 is entitled ""You Don't Need to Hear From Me, Right, But You Will Hear From Me."" I just want to point out a couple of the basics of the life that I and others, here at The Motley Fool, lead. Every single month, I pick a new stock for Motley Fool; every single month I pick two stocks for Motley Fool. We have more than a dozen services these days, where lots of other Fools, including my brother Tom and so many talented stock-pickers, do the same thing. We're always there for you.And what you will notice that I don't do is I don't start saying I'm not going to put any new stock in for this quarter or this month, I'm scared, or I'm going to put three in at once because I'm particularly optimistic or elated. Nope. It's mechanical. It's two stocks in : one from Tom, one from me, for our members every month; two stocks for  members every month. We've bought them in good times and in bad. And we only really know looking backward, when it was really good or when it was really bad.Some of our best stock picks, some of my personal best picks were made feeling the pain, feeling like, ""But I'm about to email this off to all of our members, and they're going to buy it, and it's going to probably drop another 20%."" And yet five, 10, 15 years later, we look back and say, ""Boy, am I glad for the discipline that that service instilled on me, the discipline forcing me to pick a stock when I didn't want to.""So, Chapter 4, ""You Don't Need to Hear From Me, Right, But You Will Hear From Me."" And you hear from me in this podcast every single week. And my talented producer, Rick Engdahl, and I try to bring you, every 10 weeks or so, a new Five-Stock Sampler. I was looking over my list of Five-Stock Samplers. We've done 23 in this series. I was checking to see how our Five-Stock Samplers are doing here. It's really such a remarkable, untold story in my opinion, but if you've been with me, you've seen we've done this 23 times now, every 10 weeks, 23 times, pick five stocks, 115 total stock picks on the podcast. Eighteen of those Five-Stock Samplers are beating the market. Only five are losing to the market. A 78% accuracy rate. The average performance of the stock in those samplers is 34.5%; the market is 11.8%. We're up 22% per pick across 115 picks. That's all for free on this podcast every 10 weeks. So you don't need to hear from me, but you are and you will.Chapter 5, ""And You'll Hear From Me Beyond Just Stock Picks."" Because while I just focus on individual selections and what our services do, I want to make sure I restate the six traits that make you a investor. This is about you now; this is not about the next stock that you're about to buy.Rule No. 1: Let your winners run high. No. 2: Add up; don't double down.I want to speak to those two briefly. We live in a time right now where most stocks are down, some of them 20% to 50% just in the last few weeks. So what is a winner, and what does it mean to let your winners run high or add up? Well, first of all, I'll remind you that your winners, even if they've had a bad few weeks, are probably still pretty great. Take a look over the last one, three, five years of returns and ask yourself, which are the companies that are really thriving, which companies has the stock market validated as big-time performers, the success of their business as translated into their stock price?That's a pretty good indicator for you to know what are the winners and know that some of them are down. In fact, most stocks are down right now. But that doesn't mean they're not still winners, and yet at the same time, if you have extra dollars, I would consider buying a new stock or two. After all, most of us have successful winners where our portfolio can end up concentrated in those winners. So instead, why not have some fun, add a new company name to your portfolio, add a few new stocks, probably at a much cheaper price than you were going to get a few weeks ago. So, instead of doubling down on an existing holding or re-adding to something you already may have a lot of, maybe this is an opportunity to spread a few new seeds and get to know the world even better, take some risks and have some fun.Again, it may not feel fun this week, but let's look back in a few years, shall we?OK, traits No. 3 and No. 4, of you, the Investor. No. 3, invest for at least three years, and No. 4, remember the four tenets of conscious capitalism. Speaking to those briefly. Yeah, the word ""Invest,"" I've talked about it a lot. I love etymologies, it means to wear the clothes off, to put on the vestments, like, ""priestly vestment"" is the same root, invest. It's like wearing that home team jersey, which is what I do when I go to a sports game. I bet you do too. You cheer on your home team. You're not going to change your jersey, throw it away, if your team loses that day or has a bad quarter, bad week on the market, are you? Or a bad year? Nope. You're going to stay invested for at least three years.Now, each of my six Investor traits here is a mnemonic. You'll remember, the number is implicit in each one. Rule No. 1: Let your winners run high. No. 2: Add up; don't double -- that's the word -- down. No. 3: Invest for at least three years. And No. 4: Remember the four tenets of conscious capitalism.I'm not going to go over them here. Google ""conscious capitalism"" if you're not already familiar with this idea that your money should be invested in the things that you think will thrive and make our world better. And as those companies do good, you will do well.Finally, traits No. 5 and No. 6. Max 5% allocation -- that's the in trait No. 5. That means, for any new position that you would take, never put more than 1/20 of your money. And keep your money invested in a wonderful diverse set of companies; don't overload on any one at the start. Now, if a company does really well for you and becomes more than 5% for you, more than 10% even, sometimes larger numbers, depending on who you are and how comfortable you are with that, that's when you can allow your allocations to go, but that initial allocation, max 5%.Finally, No. 6, aim for 60% accuracy -- there's the number. And by that, I'm reminding you, when you buy new stock, when you enter a new position, have confidence that it's going to beat the market, don't be silly or be too speculative, bring more than a coin flip's confidence that this investment is going to beat the market. I'm not just saying go up; I hope every investment goes up. What we're about at  and The Motley Fool is we're about beating the market, beating the index fund. And so, aim for 60% accuracy.Chapter 6: ""Be Selective With Your Media."" How much time do I spend watching financial TV most of the year? Zero. How much time did I spend watching financial TV this week? Zero. I prefer print, personally. I don't know about you. We all have our different tastes, but I'll tell you, I think Bloomberg does an awfully good job covering things. I appreciate their free services.In fact, as the week started, I got an email from Bloomberg saying, ""Hey, would you like to subscribe to our coronavirus daily, our prognosis section that we have a daily little newsletter?"" And I said, ""Sure."" It's free and I could sign up for it. Those are the kinds of media that I select into. I think I've talked about in the past. Now, I appreciate their coverage; their Espresso app is good for waking up in the morning and knowing what's happening. But I wouldn't spend a lot of time preoccupied with the news. I mean, I say that most of the time anyway, as generally a non-traditional news consumer, but I especially feel that's true if you're thinking about your investment dollars.The more you watch some crazy man talk about the market moving up and down and what you should be doing, the more likely it is that you, yourself may go crazy.Chapter 7 is entitled ""Leadership."" I'm probably verging on another cliche when I say, ""In hard and troubled times, leadership emerges; leadership is tested."" But I have a little bit of a different approach to thinking about this than I think most people around me. Maybe you're sympathetic to me, you think the same way I do maybe. If not, you'll hear a different viewpoint from me here.So, one of my favorite bumper stickers I'm seeing these days, I bet you've seen it too. ""Any Functioning Adult 2020."" Love that bumper sticker, because in a lot of ways it describes [laughs] my own thoughts, at least here in the United States of America, about political leadership. And this isn't about either party. In fact, for a variety of different reasons, I would say, both diverse reasons and manifold reasons, I wouldn't actually put any of the three 2020 candidates in the CEO seat of any important company whose stock I hold. Now, I'm quite sure some of my listeners love one of these three, and don't like another or maybe love two of them; I'm not sure. And while I certainly respect the importance of leadership. I can't look at our present-day leadership or our coming potential leadership in the public sector, in the government, and say that I'm impressed by the achievements of any of those people. [laughs] And I've met at least one of them.Sometimes I wonder, ""Am I watching professional wrestling here with these debates, or am I watching the future of our country?"" I don't want this to sound like a rant. I sure hope it doesn't, because what I want you to know is there is tremendous leadership across the United States of America and the world. Most of the best leaders that I know work in business where they are forced, especially as conscious capitalists, to think through pleasing all of their stakeholders, not pitting one set of stakeholders against another or trying to create win/lose situations. Most of the best businesses that you and I are invested in have deep experience in caring and working for the success of all of their stakeholders, certainly their customers, that's why businesses exist, certainly their employees, great companies to work for, their partners and suppliers, the best ones admire the businesses that they supply, and certainly, shareholders, you and me, can look at the best stocks and be pleased by the outcomes they gave us.So, I hope if you're frustrated with political leadership in our country, you won't obsess about that or forget that the more dysfunctional political leadership becomes, the more influence it loses, the more likelihood that the private sector and the leadership from the businesses that are delivering us the products and services and solutions every day that we need to survive in this world that they will thrive and that they will lift us higher. So there's a thought about leadership.Chapter 8, ""Science."" You know, I wasn't an effective science student. I always tried to duck. I never even took physics. Somehow, I got out of it. A lot of us do biology here in the U.S. in ninth grade and I took chemistry in tenth. I was like, ""Can I possibly opt out of physics?"" I'm not good at science, but I still have [laughs] an admiration for it.So, Chapter 8, I just wanted to say a few things about science and hope. For my book club, months ago I was reading a book called  by Dr. Jeremy Brown, who works as a virologist at NIH. And one of the things Jeremy talks about is the state of the world in 1918, when the so-called Spanish Flu, the big epidemic -- I think it started in Kansas -- it came through the military, spread around the world. World War I didn't help. Fifty million or so humans died. It was a century ago, and it was still practiced at that day -- venesection. Do you know what venesection is? I had to look to remind myself what the term meant. It's the medical term for bloodletting. And that was a common practice a century ago, when trying to figure out how to heal people.It turns out it didn't help, didn't help the epidemic at all. Fortunately, a century later we know venesection is hopelessly backward in its thinking. It wasn't until 1939, there was a watershed moment in the history of virology, Dr. Brown writes in his book , the newly invented electron microscope took a picture of a virus. In 1939 we first finally saw the enemy.The first coronavirus was not found until the 1960s. The name, by the way, since I love language and etymology, coronavirus -- the corona, of course, means crown, coming from Latin. And it's so called, because the visual, if you're looking at a coronavirus, it has, kind of, a fringy crown around it, in contrast to some other viruses, hence the name coronavirus. So it's only been in the last 50 years that these have even emerged in a way that we can understand them today.Here's a shocking thing I often forget but I want to say here. Seven years before that, 1953, Crick and Watson discovered DNA. We haven't even known about DNA in the last 75 years. A lot of my listeners were born into a world where we didn't even know what DNA was yet.So here's the good news. What incredible progress we have made over the last century at combating all kinds of bad stuff and creating new solutions for our bodies. And certainly, we're invested in so many healthcare companies,  and  and  and , and the list goes on of companies aligned technologies that are doing something better for our bodies today.So, pinch yourself -- not only are you living at the best time in human history to be helped by others, to be helped by medical technology, but you as a fellow , you and I can be invested together in these companies and prosper as they heal the world. So I just want to remind us of the power of science. And while we can't get a vaccine this March to fix the coronavirus, it's being worked on, and you can only imagine the amount of innovation and collaboration by the smartest minds to ride in on a white horse at some point and start fixing things. So I have a profound optimism in where science is going to continue to take us.And while the human tragedy, we talked about it a few weeks ago, a few thousand people had already died in China back then. It's a lot more now. The human tragedy is very real. And I hope for you it's not personal; I hope it won't get personal. But we're all connected. And so, talking out both sides of my mouth, we have to acknowledge how really hard 2020 is going to be, and at the same time we have to remember that whether you think you can or whether you think you cannot, you're right.And I really believe our scientists and our doctors and the whole systems that are around them, even though they're in danger of being overwhelmed at different places in the world, I believe they're more resilient than we think. And I hope that proves out here in the weeks and months ahead.All right, Chapter 9. This one came through Twitter, @ScottJack. Scott, I really appreciate this point. So, earlier this week, when the market went down 8% or so in a single day, we sent out a message to all of our members. It was well written. It was written by Seth Jayson, I believe, a longtime analyst here at The Motley Fool, a longtime Fool. ""It was great, but one minor change."" And I thought this was really good. Scott said, ""Instead of 'don't panic,' use 'stay calm.'""So, Seth or our headline had used ""don't panic,"" which always makes me think of . Of course, perhaps you, too. But, no, Scott says, ""Instead of 'don't panic,' use 'stay calm.'"" Scott says, ""The brain only sees the word 'panic,' not the word 'don't.' It's something I learned from a smart marketer."" @ScottJack goes on, ""This is similar from Mother Teresa. 'I was once asked, why I don't participate in anti-war demonstrations. I said that I will never do that, but as soon as you have a pro-peace rally. I'll be there.'"" Thank you, @ScottJack, for that reflection.Stay calm. I'm not going to say don't panic. Stay calm. It reminds me of Roy Spence, one of my favorite people in business, did a wonderful interview with Roy on this podcast a couple of years ago. You can Google it and listen to it again. One of Roy's great lines is ""I'm a  person."" Lot of people are against this, against that; they define themselves by what they are not or what they're fighting. Roy says, ""I'm a  person."" Well, I am too. Stay calm.Chapter 10. I'm just going to give you my favorite word of the week. It's a quick chapter and I've got a half-chapter after this one. My favorite word of the week goes back to the Romans. I was thinking about, the other day, ""vale,"" V-A-L-E. Do you know this one? This was a common greeting used in the Roman Empire. Vale. What does it mean? It means, be strong, be well. So, I wish for you, I wish for your family, for your business, for our world at large, vale. And I'm going to be rocking that greeting throughout March. Friends and family, vale!And finally, now, chapter 10 1/2. Chapter 10 1/2, Julian Barnes, thank you.I've made a point in the past of saying I don't use bad language. I'm from the school of thought that it pollutes the world. It pollutes oratory. It debases not just the air about us, but the people who use it. A friend once suggested to me that people who use bad language were basically telling others how cool they think they are, which, when I listened for it in the future, was often right.I've taken pride that on iTunes on my podcast page, well, at least the one I used before the OS change, I had a ""clean lyrics"" icon. Well, I never had intended to be lyrical, per se. At least Apple thought I was clean and your kids could listen in as well and through 50-plus mailbags, I've heard from you that you do feel comfortable letting your kids listen to , which is so great. And in part because we have clean lyrics.So, I'm simply going to warn you, as we conclude, that I'm about to use what I believe is my only bad language in  history, and I hope not to do it again. It'll just be there in my final four words. Why am I doing it? Because when you use a potentially powerful tool -- here, bad language -- infrequently, incredibly sparingly, you give it its true force when conveyed properly with the right timing. And so, feel free to cut off the podcast right about now before I close with my final four words, kind of ending these 10 1/2 chapters in the same way I began them.My advice to you. Here we go. Wash your damn hands!The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@How to Invest for Every Scenario@2020-03-22@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/how-to-invest-for-every-scenario-2020-03-23
  started last year with one product on the market -- Adcetris for Hodgkin lymphoma -- but it is quickly transforming into a multi-product oncology company. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a second drug, Padcev for locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer, in December, and days later, Seattle Genetics submitted breast cancer drug tucatinib for regulatory approval.This week brought another reason for optimism: The company said the FDA accepted tucatinib for priority review and set an action date for Aug. 20.Image source: Getty Images.Though the stock doubled last year, shares are only up about 5% so far this year. And the stock fell as much as 6.4% in the trading session following Seattle Genetics' recent earnings report.Fourth-quarter earnings of $0.14 a share surged past analysts' expectations for a $0.45 loss per share. For the full year, Adcetris' net sales in the U.S. and Canada climbed 32% to $627.7 million, but the company predicted a slower rate of growth in 2020, with expectations for an 8% to 12% increase.A potential slowdown in Adcetris' sales may have damped the market's sentiment, but Seattle Genetics is counting on ongoing trials to expand the drug's uses and win over doctors and patients. The company will report five-year data later this year from a trial combining Adcetris and chemotherapy as it works to establish the treatment as the standard of care for Hodgkin lymphoma.As we wait to see how far Adcetris can go, the approval of Padcev should offer a boost to Seattle Genetics' revenue this year. As mentioned above, Padcev is approved for locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer, which is the most common kind of bladder cancer. The approval pertains to adult patients who have previously been treated with platinum-based chemotherapy and inhibitors of proteins that help cancer cells survive. What is significant is Padcev is the only FDA-approved drug for this patient set.In the latest , the company estimates that, from a sales perspective, there are 3,200 U.S. accounts that may order Padcev for patients. The company wouldn't offer sales guidance but said it was optimistic after the drug's first full month (January) in the marketplace.And product No. 3 may be on the horizon: Seattle Genetics and its investors are now awaiting the FDA's decision on tucatinib, its investigational treatment for locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer. In HER2-positive breast cancer, high levels of the HER2 protein within tumors lead to the spread of cancer cells. Tucatinib inhibits enzymes that activate this type of protein. The FDA had already granted tucatinib breakthrough status, meant to expedite review and approval for drugs addressing life-threatening illnesses, and this week's  of priority review is more good news for Seattle Genetics because it means the FDA aims to issue a decision on the drug within six months instead of 10.Seattle Genetics' drugs each address significant markets, giving investors reason to believe in future revenue as long as the company is able to bring physicians and patients on board. A Technavio report shows the Hodgkin lymphoma drug market is expected to grow by $1.24 billion during the period from last year through 2023. According to Grand View Research, the global urothelial cancer drug market will reach $3.6 billion by 2023, with a compound annual growth rate of 23%. And finally, the market for HER2-positive breast cancer is set to increase 54% to $9.89 billion by 2025 from 2015, according to GlobalData.In addition to these markets, Seattle Genetics is also testing molecules to treat cancers including cervical, colorectal, and metastatic solid tumors. Those particular indications are in phase 2 studies.Considering Seattle Genetics' share gain last year, and the fact that the stock is now trading near a record high, investors may be worried about buying the stock right now. It's worth bearing in mind that the company produced those sorts of gains with only one product on the market. Now with two -- and possibly soon a third -- the potential for revenue and earnings is much stronger. And that should lead to further share gains in the long term. Upcoming catalysts will be the next quarterly earnings report, which will show Padcev's first quarter on the market and the FDA decision on tucatinib, so investors might want to hop on board ahead of time. Days of weakness as we've seen recently offer a  opportunity.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

 ,  , and   have good news for new bladder cancer patients who aren't eligible for standard chemotherapy. Followup data from an ongoing clinical trial suggests that a combination of Padcev and Keytruda could become a new first-line treatment for this underserved group. Keytruda from Merck is a protein that makes it hard for tumor cells to shut down the immune system when it attacks them. Padcev, from collaboration partners Astellas and Seattle Genetics, is a protein that delivers a dose of chemotherapy directly to tumor cells that present a telltale sign of malignancy on their surface called nectin-4.Image source: Getty Images.Padcev earned approval in December as a treatment for bladder cancer patients whose tumors kept growing after treatment with Keytruda and similar drugs. Seattle Genetics had suggested getting Padcev into the mix with Keytruda at the same time would lead to better outcomes for patients, and Tuesday's data drop suggests this is the case.Seattle Genetics previously released preliminary results that suggested the combination of Padcev and Keytruda was shrinking tumors. On Tuesday, Seattle Genetics and Astellas announced confirmed tumor responses from 33 of 45 patients treated with the combination, seven of whom achieved complete remission.Getting tumors to respond doesn't always lead to better outcomes. That's why the long-term commercial success of this potential combination therapy will depend on overall survival results. This study hasn't been underway for long enough to produce data on that score yet.So far, we know that an impressive 82% of patients given the combination therapy were still alive 12-months after beginning treatment. If this number holds up for another year, Padcev plus Keytruda could become the new standard of care.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

There probably aren't too many companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange with an operating history going back over 230 years that are virtually unknown to U.S. investors.But that's true of  , Japan's largest pharmaceutical company, which was founded in 1781 and listed its  on the New York Stock Exchange just over a year ago.Takeda has partnerships with a number of U.S. pharmaceutical companies, and made headlines in 2018 when it announced plans for a massive acquisition of Shire that was completed about a year ago. Is Takeda an overlooked gem that investors should wake up to, or should they avoid it?Image source: Getty Images.Takeda operates in five therapeutic areas that it considers its core businesses. The company's largest segment  is gastrointestinal medicines, at 21% of sales in the first three quarters of fiscal 2019, and is delivering healthy sales growth, up 10%.The big winner in the segment is Entyvio for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (UC). Entyvio sales are growing at 35%, and beat 's mega-blockbuster Humira in a head-to-head trial in UC last year.Unfortunately, Takeda's second largest business hasn't been faring so well recently.The company's rare disease portfolio, 20% of total sales, has declined 11% in fiscal 2019. Takhzyro for hereditary angioedema is growing well, but not enough to overcome losses by older drugs for the same condition. Competition is hurting its drugs for blood diseases, and a recall of Natpara for hypoparathyroidism has the company assuming zero U.S. sales for that drug in 2020.Takeda is getting about 5% sales growth from its immunoglobulin products and neuroscience portfolios, but one area that has the potential for accelerating growth is oncology, which is growing 7% year-over-year and makes up 13% of sales.Ninlaro, an oral medication for multiple myeloma, is still in its early days, and is growing sales at 29% this year. A partnership with   to co-develop and commercialize that company's lead drug, Adcetris, should be a potent growth driver for years.Put those segments together, along with a large part of the company's business (21% of sales) that the company says is outside of its focus areas and is shrinking at a double-digit rate, and the growth picture at the moment looks anemic. Excluding the effect of the Shire acquisition, revenue year-to-date has declined 1.2% and operating profit is down 43%.Takeda is banking on a reshaping of the company as it integrates Shire to get it on track for long term growth. It plans to take out $2 billion in costs, divest $10 billion in non-core assets that are pulling down its growth rate, and pay off much of the debt it took on to buy Shire.That effort seems to be progressing faster than the company had expected. The plan has been for the Shire integration to complete by March 2024, but the company  this month when it said in its third quarter report that it expected to make a small operating profit for the full year after earlier forecasting a $1 billion operating loss.A successful execution of its plan would help Takeda invest in research and development in its focus areas, where it already has a significant number of drug candidates in the clinic.The company has six new drugs in trials that it expects to get approved in the next two years, and another eight that could win approvals in fiscal 2023 and 2024. Together, Takeda thinks these drugs have the potential to deliver more than $10 billion in aggregate peak sales, compared with the $30 billion in revenue the company expects to generate this year .Takeda has a long and illustrious past, but it's the company's future that investors need to be wary of. Whereas it has the potential to get on the path for long term growth, most  investors should take a pass for now and wait for the dust to settle.The integration of Shire is a massive undertaking, and it's not clear what the growth picture will be when the effort completes four years from now. In the meantime, sales growth is flat, and any profit growth will be coming from cost cutting.Takeda does pay a generous 4.3% dividend yield, but  can find nice payouts from companies that have more certain growth in their future.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

SiegallThanks, Peg, and good afternoon, everyone.Seattle Genetics has entered a new decade as a multi-product oncology company. In December, we expanded our commercial portfolio with FDA approval of PADCEV for metastatic urothelial cancer. Tucatinib for metastatic breast cancer is on the horizon in 2020 as a potential third drug approval and ADCETRIS remains an important brand globally that has been used in the treatment of more than 60,000 lymphoma patients worldwide.Behind these three products is a robust pipeline of novel programs that we believe have the potential to help more than -- more people with cancer. 2019 was a banner year and our progress has positively impacted future potential of Seattle Genetics.Starting in 2020, our revenues from product sales will be more diverse as we have PADCEV, and if approved, tucatinib to a strong ADCETRIS base. PADCEV was approved in late December, roughly three months ahead of its PDUFA date. Joint sales team with our partner, Astellas, is actively engaged with oncologists in both the academic and community settings.We're very pleased by the positive reception to this important drug and by the number of accounts and increasing number of vials recorded in the first full month of sales. We are early in the launch phase of PADCEV and have decided not to give sales guidance until we gain more experience in the marketplace.In parallel with our PADCEV launch activities, we are investing in a broad clinical development program with a focus in urothelial cancer. Today, we are announcing the recent completion of enrollment of our randomized Phase 3 trial called EV-301. This trial is intended to confirm the accelerated approval of PADCEV and support global applications for approval. Importantly, we have initiated a Phase 3 trial in first-line metastatic disease, which is key to our global development strategy.This trial is being conducted under a collaboration between Seattle Genetics, Astellas and Merck, with each party providing significant funding. In addition to these registrational trials, we are evaluating PADCEV in earlier-stage bladder cancer and believe there is also potential in other Nectin-4 expressing solid tumors.Next is tucatinib, which is in line to become the third drug in our commercial portfolio. This program has advanced significantly in just the past couple of months, based on outstanding data from the HER2 client pivotal trial in metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, including patients with brain metastasis.Full results from the trial were featured in an oral presentation at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in December and simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine. HER2CLIMB, which supported FDA breakthrough therapy designation, positions tucatinib as the potential best-in-class HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Based on HER2CLIMB results, in December, we completed submission of the NDA, which is being reviewed under the FDA's Real-Time Oncology Review program.Another significant regulatory accomplishment with tucatinib was the January submission at recent EMA validation of the MAA in Europe. We're also participating in Project Orbis, an FDA-sponsored program that provides a framework for concurrent submission and review of oncology drugs among the United States, Canada, Switzerland, Singapore and Australia.We have now submitted tucatinib in each of these countries, positioning the drug for global approvals beginning later this year. Our goal is to bring tucatinib to patients in need around the world. With that in mind, we're in the process of expanding our European capabilities.Through our teams in the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United States, we are prosecuting our MAA submission and we're adding leadership in key countries. As with PADCEV, we are conducting a broad global development program with tucatinib. Roger will provide additional details on the clinical development activities and Tom will speak to the investment we are making in these important programs.Moving on now to ADCETRIS. We're pleased to report record 2019 revenues in the US and Canada of $628 million, up 32% over 2018. This follows a 55% growth rate in 2018, driven by adoption in front-line Hodgkin lymphoma and peripheral T-cell lymphomas. Taken together with sales of ADCETRIS by Takeda in its territory, global sales in 2019 exceeded $1 billion, underscoring its importance to physicians and patients around the world.We expect 2020 ADCETRIS net sales in the US and Canada to be in the range of $675 million to $700 million. While this reflects more modest growth, we believe that our ongoing and planned clinical trials with ADCETRIS will provide opportunities for additional expansion of the brand. We also expect to report five-year progression-free survival results late this year from the ECHELON-1 trial in front-line Hodgkin lymphoma. This is an important milestone for lymphoma patients and could further establish a positive long-term benefit of ADCETRIS plus AVD.Our clinical stage pipeline is robust, and we are conducting trials across a spectrum of both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. Most advance of these programs is tucatinib vedotin or TV, which we are developing in collaboration with Genmab. Our initial focus is in recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer. We expect to report topline data from a potentially pivotal Phase 2 trial in the first half of 2020. We are also evaluating TV and other solid tumors, including ovarian and head and neck cancer, with activities under way to optimize dose and schedule.In 2019, we initiated trials with several novel agents. We intend to continue our investment in innovative new product candidates, including ADCs and other targeted therapies with four INDs planned in 2020 and another four in 2021. These early stage programs are based on efficient clinical trial design that are intended to form and form clear rapid development decisions.We're also pleased with the progress of ADC collaborative programs, namely the US and recent EU approval of Roche's Polivy and the ongoing priority review by FDA and recent MAA validation of GSK, belantamab mafodotin. Both of these ADCs employs Seattle Genetics' proprietary technology. There are more than 10 ADCs using our technology in clinical development by us and our collaboration partners.Lastly, in the fourth quarter of 2019, we completed a license agreement with BeiGene, our first collaboration with a company in China, an increasingly important market for anti-cancer therapies. This included an upfront payment of $20 million and we are eligible for progress-dependent milestones. This program recently entered in Phase 1 clinical trial.I'm proud of our exceptional progress in 2019. We're diversifying our commercial portfolio and revenue drivers, addressing meaningful unmet medical needs and investing across our portfolio to fuel future growth. We are well positioned to continue transforming Seattle Genetics into an important biotechnology company focused on helping cancer patients around the world.At this point, I'll turn the call over to Robin to discuss our commercial activities. Then Todd will comment on our financial results and 2020 guidance. After that, Roger will discuss our clinical development activities.Robin? -- Thanks, Clay. We're excited to provide an update on our commercial activities. ADCETRIS net sales in the US and Canada were $166 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 26% compared to the same quarter in 2018. Full-year sales were $628 million, an increase of 32% over 2018. Growth was driven by our front-line indications in Hodgkin lymphoma and PTCL.Full-year follow-up data from the ECHELON-1 trial that were presented at ASH, complements the value proposition that ADCETRIS offers patients. Claimed clinical benefit of A plus AVD over ABVD, enables meaningful discussions with physicians who have been slow to adopt the A plus AVD regimen. We also look forward to the five-year data later this year.For 2020, we are focused on continuing to promote ADCETRIS under its broad label that now includes six indications. You're describing the clear and durable advantage of A plus ABD in the front-line setting for patients with Stage 3 and 4 Hodgkin lymphoma.In front-line PTCL, A plus CHP is the standard of care for patients with ALCL, and we are working hard to drive use in additional CD30 expressing subtypes, while engaging with pathology labs to improve the reporting of CD30. With these efforts, we intend to continue growing the ADCETRIS franchise.Now, I'd like to transition to PADCEV, which was approved late in 2019. Seattle Genetics and Astellas sales forces are active in the field. Reaction from physicians is very positive. And the number of accounts that have ordered PADCEV from both academic and community sites has exceeded our expectations in January, our first full month of launch.We estimate that there were approximately 3,200 accounts in the United States that treat metastatic bladder cancer patients and may order PADCEV. In the short period of time that we've been in the market, our representatives have already called on 1,500 of these accounts. We're also pleased with the rapid inclusion of PADCEV in the NCCN treatment guidelines. There is significant unmet need in metastatic urothelial cancer post platinum chemotherapy and PD-1 or PD-L1 therapy. The team is focused on driving awareness and understanding about this important new treatment option. I look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year.Moving on to tucatinib. The commercial team is excited by the clinical data from HER2CLIMB and the positive reaction to our presentation at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in December. Our sales leadership team is in place and we are hiring the US sales force. We're attracting top sales talents with significant oncology experience. Metastatic HER2 positive patients, especially those with brain metastases, needs new treatment options and our team eagerly awaits the approval.In summary, the growing commercial team at Seattle Genetics is well positioned for a transformative year as we bring meaningful products to patients in areas of unmet need.Now, I will turn over the call to Todd. -- Great. Thanks, Robin. And thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call this afternoon. Today, I'll summarize our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2019. And then I'll provide our financial outlook for 2020.Total revenues were $290 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 and $917 million for the full year. This included ADCETRIS net sales of $166 million in the fourth quarter and $628 million for the year. PADCEV was launched during the holiday period at the end of the year and therefore only provided a modest contribution to sales.Royalty revenues in the fourth quarter of 2019 increased to $72 million compared to $25 million in the fourth quarter 2018. This included a one-time $40 million milestone from Takeda that was triggered by annual sales of ADCETRIS, exceeding $400 million in its territory in 2019.For the full-year in 2019, royalty revenues were $138 million compared to $83 million a year ago. This growth reflects sales milestone, higher sales by Takeda in 2019 and the royalty rate on sales above $400 million, increasing to mid 20%. Royalties from Roche on Polivy also contributed to 2019 results.Collaboration revenues were $51 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 and $150 million for the full year. These revenues included $55 million in milestones from Takeda related to international approvals of ADCETRIS in front-line Hodgkin lymphoma, FDA approval of Roche's Polivy and the initiation of GSK's Phase 3 trial with our ADC utilizing our technology.Additionally, we recognized $20 million in upfront payments from BeiGene upon entering into a product licensing agreement in the fourth quarter. R&D expenses were $201 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 and $719 million for the year. Growth over 2018 reflected higher investment across our late-stage pipeline, most notably from PADCEV and tucatinib, which included the pivotal trials that led to the PADCEV approval and the tucatinib submissions.SG&A expenses were $115 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 and $374 million for the full year. These are both increases over 2018 and reflect commercialization efforts related to the ADCETRIS front-line indications and preparations for the launches of PADCEV and tucatinib. We ended 2019 with $868 million in cash and investments. In addition, we held approximately $163 million in Immunomedics common stock.These shares are mark-to-market, which resulted in a non-cash gain that contributed to investment income of $64 million for the fourth quarter, and that led us to reporting net income as you saw in our press release this afternoon.Regarding our financial outlook for 2020, I'll begin with revenue guidance. There are three main components. First, we expect ADCETRIS net sales in the US and Canada to be in the range of $675 million to $700 million. At this time, we're not providing PADCEV guidance.Second, we expect royalty revenues to be in the range of $105 million to $115 million, based primarily on anticipated sales growth of ADCETRIS by Takeda. And third, we expect revenues from collaboration and license agreements to be in the range of $30 million to $50 million.Turning now to expenses. We expect R&D expenses to be in the range of $860 million to $950 million. This primarily reflects planned investments in PADCEV and tucatinib, including several registrational trials, as well as investment across our earlier-stage portfolio. Similarly, SG&A expenses are expected to increase to a range of $475 million to $525 million. This includes full-year cost of the PADCEV commercial infrastructure, building our tucatinib commercial team and expanding our European capabilities.We expect ADCETRIS cost of sales to be in the range of 5% to 6% of sales. As a reminder, Seattle Genetics booked sales of PADCEV in the US and we will record Astellas' 50% share of gross profit as a component of cost of sales. Marketing and development expenses are also shared equally. These are netted out in our SG&A and R&D expenses and have been reflected in our guidance.So to wrap up, we have bold plans in 2020 and an opportunity to significantly expand the potential of our drugs to help patients.And with that, I'll turn the call over to Roger, who will provide some of the specifics. -- Thanks, Todd. And good afternoon, everyone. As Clay described, 2019 was an exceptional year for Seattle Genetics in achieving our goal of bringing important new medicines for people with cancer. Today, I will mostly focus my remarks on PADCEV and tucatinib, as we have ambitious development plans for each of these exciting drugs.I'll begin with PADCEV, where our first priority is evaluating this product across the continuum of urothelial cancer. There are three main components to our strategy. First, under the FDA's accelerated approval program, a confirmatory trial is required and we and Astellas are conducting the global randomized Phase 3 trial called EV-301 in metastatic urothelial cancer patients who've received the platinum containing regimen and a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor.Today, we announced the study has completed enrollment of 608 patients. Primary endpoint of EV-301 is overall survival and in addition to firming of the confirmatory trial, it is intended to support global applications for approval. Second, our next goal is to move PADCEV into first-line metastatic urothelial cancer.Based on encouraging data from the combination of PADCEV and KEYTRUDA, which will be updated next week at ASCO GU, we recently initiated a Phase 3 trial together with Astellas and Merck, evaluating this combination with or without chemotherapy. Target enrollment is approximately 1,100 patients and importantly, includes first-line patients regardless of platinum eligibility, PD-L1 expression or Nectin-4 expression. Trial will evaluate dual primary endpoints of progression-free survival and overall survival.And third, our goal is to evaluate PADCEV in earlier stages of the urothelial cancer, beginning with muscle invasive bladder cancer. These patients find treatment including surgical removal of the bladder, there was a high risk of occurrence of metastatic disease.We recently initiated clinical evaluation of both PADCEV monotherapy and the combination of PADCEV and KEYTRUDA prior to surgery. Non-muscle invasive bladder cancer also represents a future development opportunity for PADCEV that we are currently evaluating preclinically. In these patients, available therapies are difficult to tolerate and may fail, resulting in a significant unmet medical need.Beyond urothelial cancer, we believe the potential for PADCEV extends to other cancer types. We and Astellas recently initiated a single seeking trial called EV-202 in a range of Nectin-4 expressing solid tumors, including breast, non-small cell lung, head and neck and gastric cancers.I'll move on now to tucatinib, our oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets HER2. We were gratified by the enthusiastic reception at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in December to the remarkable results from a HER2CLIMB pivotal trial.HER2CLIMB data give us conviction to expand upon our clinical development program in HER2 positive breast cancer and other HER2-positive cancers. The key areas of clinical focus include, first, evaluating tucatinib in a randomized Phase 3 trial in combination with TDM-1 versus TDM-1 alone in metastatic breast cancer.In this trial, called HER2CLIMB or 2, patients must have previously received a taxane and a trastuzumab in the adjuvant or metastatic setting and thus represent population receiving first or second line treatments. Second, tucatinib, in combination with standard treatment is being evaluated in neoadjuvant breast cancer through the I-SPY 2 trial.In addition, we are considering a trial in adjuvant HER2-positive breast cancer. Third, the initial data from 23 patients treated with the combination of trastuzumab and tucatinib in metastatic colorectal cancer were very encouraging. After consultation with the FDA, we have expanded the existing clinical trial called MOUNTAINEER to enroll up to 110 patients with third-line metastatic disease.Importantly, this trial is intended to support a potential accelerated approval. We are also working on plans for confirmatory trials in colorectal cancer. And lastly, we are planning trials in HER2-positive solid tumors, including gastric cancer.Next, I'll turn to ADCETRIS, which was the subject of many important presentations at the ASH Annual Meeting in December. Of note, a full-year progression-free survival data from the ECHELON-1 trial in front-line Hodgkin lymphoma were presented and continue to show a sustained clinically meaningful benefit in ADCETRIS plus ABD over ABVD. Peripheral neuropathy, a known side effect of treatment with ADCETRIS, continued to improve over time with most patients experiencing complete resolution.Very recently, the NCCN guidelines for both Hodgkin lymphoma and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma were revised with a number of positive ADCETRIS updates. These included elderly front-line Hodgkin lymphoma, relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma and CTCL.Our ongoing and planned clinical development program with ADCETRIS includes retreatments used in patients who are unfit for combination chemotherapy, novel front-line Hodgkin lymphoma combinations and relapsed/ refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.Now, I'll turn the call back to Clay. -- Thanks Roger.Before we open the line for your questions, I want to recap key upcoming activities across our oncology portfolio. They include, first, continue our strong PADCEV launch in the United States with Astellas and advancing a broad development program, including a Phase 3 trial in first-line metastatic urothelial cancer.Second, work with FDA and other regulatory agencies on tucatinib approval and advance its robust clinical development program. Third, continue to establish ADCETRIS as standard of care in front-line Hodgkin lymphoma and front-line PTCL and initiate additional clinical trials. And fourth, report topline results from the TV pivotal trial in cervical cancer in the first half of this year.As we've highlighted today, we are executing on our bold vision for the future of Seattle Genetics. At this point, we'll open the line for Q&A. Operator, please open the call for questions.Yes, sir. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. -- Thanks so much for the question. I just got a couple. So the first one is on the ADCETRIS guidance. Just wanted to ask at a high level, when you talk about your expectations for PTCL and maybe commercially what's been the trend and the feel going into 2020.And then on tucatinib, it seems like HER2 duration in the real world for other therapies is different than just looking at PFS. And so are there any commercial lessons to be learned from TYKERB or others that can be leveraged when you look to the tucatinib launch? Thanks, guys. -- Okay. So, we'll start with the ADCETRIS question, and our guidance and trends and stuff like that. First of all, I'd like to step back and put ADCETRIS into context. This is a brand that continues to grow in the US and internationally. 2019 was the first year that we hit over $1 billion in global sales. And this -- really the last two years, we've doubled the sales of ADCETRIS. 2020 guidance reflects 7% to 11% growth over 2019. And that comes off of years when we had 32% and 55% growth, double sales in the last two years.In front-line Hodgkin, we have four-year PFS data that we presented in December at the ASH Conference and later this year, we expect five-year data. That's the gold standard, the five-year data in Hodgkin lymphoma and front-line. So that should be helpful with docs. In PTCL, I think you mentioned that. That's still growing, and we have opportunities to increase the use, essentially in non-ALCL as data continue to look good. But it is not the simplest exercise to displace decades old standard of care that are entrenched and we've been doing a great job in it and we'll continue to do that.Importantly, with ADCETRIS, looking to the future, thinking about guidance, we are continuing to do clinical trials and expanding our opportunities with these trials. Some of these opportunities are incremental, but some of them are big. So, we're looking at things in DLBCL, elderly Hodgkin lymphoma, retreatment and there is early Stage 1 and 2 Hodgkin lymphoma. So a lot of different things that we are doing.And like I said, some bigger opportunities like early stage Hodgkin lymphoma, where we're not [Phonetic], in its half of Hodgkin lymphoma front-line and some are smaller. Overall, Geoff, ADCETRIS is really -- it's a terrific first product for Seattle Genetics. And we're so excited to be expanding our product to include PADCEV. And looking into the future, tucatinib.Now, you asked about tucatinib and duration and what lessons we can learn by that. I mean we're not giving guidance on that. We're not at this point saying how long we think patients will stay on this. It's a tablet that's taken twice a day. It's got a very good profile of efficacy and safety. Our data are really remarkable. And I think we'll learn a little bit of how this can be used initially but we have this product development program. And Rob -- Roger, perhaps you want to talk a little bit about just what you think you see with duration of use or what the parameters are as we look at it in different settings. -- Thanks, Clay. One of the key aspects of tucatinib is its tolerability. It has obviously very high efficacy, putting [Phonetic] in patients with brain metastases, a unique population, frankly, to be studied in breast cancer. But tolerability is also key and we actually believe the tolerability of the molecule plays into its efficacy, that patients can stay on the drug for projected periods of time, and then continue to suppress the HER2 signaling access. We have patients in the program anecdotally, who have been on the drug for years. So, we are comfortable that the extended duration of therapy is quite achievable in the clinical trial itself. Based on progression-free survival, I think the average duration of the treatment is around five months, seven months. But obviously, as we move into other areas, we have a duration of therapy maybe dictated by the disease state. We are comfortable that tucatinib can be used for prolonged periods of time.All right. Thank you. Our next question will come from Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. -- Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. So with regard to your ADCETRIS 2020 guide, can you just comment on why you're accounting for such limited growth at approximately 10% at the midpoint, just given this over 30% growth you saw last year? And is this conservatism or are there some dynamics at play here? And then secondly, anything you can give us regarding the early launch metrics or just qualitative feedback as you're looking and launching PADCEV? -- Sure. On ADCETRIS and our guidance, maybe Todd, you want to hop in here and give some commentary about this. I don't want to portray this as us doing anything but providing the best we can do, not that conservative or not anything. I think that this is a brand that first got approved in 2011, and we have been growing and growing and growing the brand both in US and international. It is still growing, but the growth has slowed down. The rate of growth has slowed down. And -- but unlike a lot of brands that have been around for eight years, this is the brand we are still investing in. And we have a lot of new findings and new data, and we're really excited by that.And perhaps Todd could comment on it. And Roger could talk about some very recent additions to NCCN. Maybe we'll start there. Roger, you talk about the NCCN and Todd we will see if he has some color he wants to put on this. -- Sure. And so it is interesting. It's amazing actually, the NCCN Guidelines continue to reflect data that is put out in the public domain, that is valuable for patients that may not necessarily be a registrational trial. A good example of that is the use of ADCETRIS together with Opdivo in the relapsed/refractory Hodgkin lymphoma circumstance, where a level of evidence has been raised from 2B to 2A, which basically means complete content on the value of that.In addition, in populations that struggle to take combination therapies, such as older patients, another novel way of using ADCETRIS, which is to use it sequentially with chemotherapy, ADCETRIS followed by AVD, has also made it into the guidelines and that actually represents not just older patients with Stage 3, 4 disease, but it includes a reference to stage -- to earlier Hodgkin lymphoma with unfavorable product [Phonetic] features in that older population.And then in CTCL, interestingly, the ALCANZA trial is not directly referenced for the use in primary cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. And there is an acknowledgment, which we know well that the ALCANZA trial that was done with a cut point of 10%, the guidelines now reflect the state that we know, the patients who have expression levels below 10%, still do respond. So the guidelines have acknowledged that population is probably broader but just [Technical Issues] trial. -- And those NCCN guideline additions were this week. So, this is brand new. I think it was yesterday or the day before and so brand new additions, three additions to the guideline for ADCETRIS.Todd, any additional color? -- Yeah. I guess, Salveen, I'd just comment that ADCETRIS is a big important drug that helps a lot of patients globally. As Clay mentioned, we're over $1 billion now globally. We're very proud of that. We -- in the US and Canada, we doubled the sales. Over the last two years, we had 32% growth in 2019 and that was 55% in 2018. So, there has been a lot of growth and we're continuing to invest in trials that Roger mentioned that we think can give us growth in the future. But maybe 2019, there is a little bit of a catch of breath here after what's been a pretty remarkable run.I think ADCETRIS provides an incredible base for us to build off of. We've now got PADCEV approved. We're looking to tucatinib approval and we're in a very enviable position where, given our strength and what we have in front of us, we can really invest aggressively in trying to drive PADCEV and tucatinib into really big important meaningful drugs that help patients globally. So, I think ADCETRIS is an important base to that story. -- Thanks, Todd. And going to your second question on early PADCEV uptake and what's going on there. So, what I -- first of all, I want to say that we have not provided financial guidance and we're not going to yet. But we want to and we want to provide as soon as possible opportunity, but we want to provide it. But we have conviction. In that way, we'll give you a meaningful guidance and we really -- we were just to approve toward the end of the year and docs first were just organizing their patients. So the first full month really was in January, so -- where we had sales. And it's only now February.And so -- but having said that, we are incredibly pleased with the uptake. We kind of made some internal predictions, which are not with conviction and PADCEV far exceeded our internal predictions. So so far, we've been really happy with it. Like Robin said, there is about 3,200 accounts in the US that can be called upon. And out of that, about 2,800 of the accounts, we predict have the vast majority of sales. So, those are the ones that we're really focused on, those 2,800 out of the 3,200. And we have -- in the first five weeks, we've seen 1,500 of those. But we are out there in full force, talking about this really important drug at the same time that we have this full development plan.We'll turn it over to the next caller. -- Next question.Yes, sir. Our next question will come from Kennen MacKay with RBC Capital Markets. -- Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. ADCETRIS revenue was down slightly quarter-over-quarter. Can you maybe just help us understand what's happening on a volume basis and whether there is any impact from inventory or gross-to-net in Q4? And on the areas for ADCETRIS growth, I was wondering from the teams' conversations, what needs to be seen in the five-year ECHELON-1 data to win over some of the prescribers who have been the reluctant, the doctors of ADCETRIS in front-line Hodgkin.And then, secondly, on DLBCL. I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on the decision to pursue ADCETRIS there after walking away from potentially registrational trial in that indication several years ago. And then I had a quick follow-up. Thank you. -- Right. As far as the revenue and gross-to-net and all that, Todd, do you want to make a quick comment? We've really discussed this a lot already. -- Hey, look, I guess I wouldn't get too hung up in quarterly variability. There are different numbers of sales days. I don't want to get into that, but I would say, to specifically answer your question, gross-to-net was fairly stable. The book of business was fairly stable. Coming into year-end, you see a little bit of stocking. I think it was probably comparable to what we saw a year ago. So, I don't think that created any significant variability. So, I think, look at this year over year and there we had -- we put up some pretty good numbers for the year. -- And your second question was about ADCETRIS five-year data and what's important. And what I will tell you is what's important is, obviously, efficacy and safety. But on the safety front right away, this has no bleomycin. That is a bad actor. I mean that is a problematic drug for a lot of patients. You see some morbidity with it. Patients have permanent lung scarring and permanent change in their life. And they also have late problems that come up by taking bleomycin, so not taking bleomycin is something that's literally every doctor we talk to, all agree, is a good thing.And what we are presenting is PFS. You may recall that when we first had our data come out with E-1, a while ago we had an agreement with FDA looking at something called modified PFS and we got a lot of hassle from people on why was it modified PFS and not regular PFS and all that. So, we -- our data is strong, whether it's modified or regular PFS, but starting I think with the three-year, we started using regular PFS because that's what everyone asked for. And then the four-year with regular PFS and the five-year will be regular PFS. So no one will say to us, hey, well, how are these different, what is the difference? We're using with the standard. And if you see a 5%, 6%, 7% difference in the long-term survival, in five years, you could start saying it's a defined cure. Obviously, we all die of something. But oncologists look at the five-year progression-free survival and they equate that with cure. And we're going to be up to that.So if you can increase the defined cure rate at five years by 5%, 6%, 7%, whatever, what is that we see in comparison to the year four data that we have, at the same time, there is no bleomycin. That's a win. And so that's what we look at. Now, you asked about DLBCL and ADCETRIS, and what we're looking at. Perhaps, Roger, you want to talk about the efficient study we want to do and what we're looking for in that trial. -- Thanks, Clay. So, relapsed DLBCL has a meaningful number of patients; DLBCL, in general, that express CD30. That's the first thing. And we know that the ADCETRIS actor, we have data demonstrating that DLBCL is an appropriate place to evaluate, etc.Beyond that, we actually know patients with a lower level of expression can also respond. So, we are planning an all-comer trial and we will be sure to account for the CD30 expression. But we think, ADCETRIS, based on its profile of efficacy and its safety profile is a great option for a group of patients who have failed therapy, and are in the space around things like CAR-T treatments and so on.And so acknowledging the fact that this is -- this was an attempt that was made earlier, wasn't prosecuted, I don't think in any way diminishes the value of us taking ADCETRIS into the [Technical Issues]. Actually we are excited. We think that the data that supports the trial is very strong. We obviously need to conduct the trial, but I think we are optimistic we may be able to get ADCETRIS to appropriately help patients with relapsed DLBCL. -- Kennen, you have a quick follow-up. And let's make it a short one because there's a lot of other analysts who want to... -- No, appreciate the color. Lastly, I was just wondering if you could comment on what the next steps are in ongoing dispute resolution with Daiichi Sankyo. Our work is very much cited with your stance within that resolution. So, just wondering next steps. -- So Kennen, we certainly saw your report and it was very interesting. We did not know you were working on that. So it will be interesting for us to see that. And your conclusion is similar to our conclusion that we have a very, very good case. What I would say to you is that legal issues take time and go through a process. We believe that there should be an arbitration based on our 2008 agreement with them and we are making steps toward that. And they publicly stated that they would rather have to sit in court. But -- and the court will rule on it soon, whether it's on the patient report.But other than that, it's hard for me to give you inside guidance on this, except for that we believe we have a very strong case in the history of Seattle Genetics 22 years. We have never proactively gone out and done a legal move like this. We are not a litigious company, but protecting our IP when we see something that's obvious is something we will do every day of the week if we need to. This is the first time we've done it, but we have to protect the IP of the company and to us, this is pretty obvious.Thank you, sir. Our next question will come from Andrew Berens with SVB Leerink. -- Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I'm not going to ask on ADCETRIS. I think there were lot of questions already, obviously. But can you give us some idea of how the payer discussions are going for PADCEV? Has there been any pushback on the price point that you chose? And then I do have a question on tucatinib. -- Sure. I will give a comment and turn over to Robin. I will tell you, it's been going great. I really -- we just haven't had pushback on this at all. We think we did a very good job in pricing this drug. If you look at the world of oncology drug prices, there is quite a lot of drugs that were priced very high above this and there are a number of drugs priced below it. But for the value that PADCEV brings, we think we've put this in a very good spot.Robin, do you want to add any commentary? -- Yes, absolutely. So, we've been monitoring to see if there are any issues that are arising with PADCEV. And what we've seen is really there are no issues, no pushback that we're seeing. We have PADCEV patient solutions in place. So if there are challenges that an account comes across, then we have ways to help them out with that. But the reality is that the launch has been going very well and very positive reception from physicians. So it's a very high unmet need population. -- Okay. Thanks. And then on tucatinib, when can we expect the MOUNTAINEER to read out, now that you've expanded it? And what do you think the bar is for an accelerated approval? -- Thank you for asking the question on MOUNTAINEER. So, we put out data that were very strong at ESMO. And I would say it was somewhat unexpected by the audience. But there is a lot of interest in MOUNTAINEER. And Roger and his team went to regulators and talked about this. And we have an agreement that we would take that trial and expand it and obviously everything is a review decision with regulators. But to take an existing trial and not restart it, just expanded out to 110 patients and bring it back to regulators as a potential approval trial for registration, granted, we would need a confirmatory trial, but that's pretty incredible and we're super-jazzed about that.And so that's open and cranking and just adding onto a trial. And it is a corporate trial that we're running and I really think we have a great chance. We're not looking for data that's better. This isn't something where we're taking different things and combining them and wishing and hoping that we see something we haven't seen. We've seen great data in HER2-positive colorectal carcinoma. We have the combination of hitting on the outside of the cell and the inside of the cell with trastuzumab and tucatinib. And so this is something that we think is a really great opportunity. I mean this double hit on the outside and inside really looks great.Roger, do you want to add to that? I'm sorry, I went on about that. -- I do think, one, we obviously can't talk about timing. But what I would say to you, this is now a Seattle Genetics trial. The full effort of the company and its resources are behind them. But we will go and enroll them as fast as we can and then read the trial at the appropriate time. -- Okay. One just quick follow-up. I guess since it's on top of Herceptin, it's obviously combination. And I guess in other indications, other drugs, the FDA has sometimes required some sort of controlled comparison. So I guess, what do you think is enough efficacy that they'd be willing to approve this on a single-arm trial? -- So, Andy, they don't draw lines in the sand with us and write down numbers, but we showed a 52% response rate of the combination. And in published reports on using Herceptin alone, I mean you have something that's more like 15% response rate and so we're like multiples above what we think Herceptin would be. And we -- in our trial, we do have monotherapy with tucatinib. So, we do know some of the components.So, a lot of work is done and have been presented with Herceptin. We have monotherapy of tucatinib in colorectal and we have the combination. I think the regulators have what they need. And it feels like that's what they've indicated to us. So, obviously, until we get approval, we can't make promises, but to go to regulators and have them say, you can expand this ongoing trial, and we'll look at the data and your data is pretty special. Just bring us more of the same. It's pretty darn good. I don't even think -- and I don't even think we need data as good as we've had. It doesn't have to exactly match. Can't -- obviously, it can't just go away, but we have room there. Okay. Next question.Our next question comes from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. -- Hey. Great. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask about TV since no one has brought that up yet. Maybe you can just talk about what you think is the bar in that study and your confidence level around that when we get the data this year? Thanks. -- Thank you for asking about TV. TV is an interesting antibody-drug conjugate. It binds to tissue factor and we are working on this with Genmab, a partner of ours that we work very closely with. We presented data on this in the past, but it was part of a dose escalation in Phase 1. So it is very hard to know all of the factors on this data. So, we now are doing with our partner, Genmab, a bigger trial, a Phase 2 trial with one dose. So it is a large expansion into Phase 2. It is potentially registrable.We obviously have other trials that we're working on and combination trials and a variety of things that we're excited about with TV. But this is an important trial for us. I think that, from this potentially registrational Phase 2, we need to see something that's meaningful. And I think we can start by putting into context to the last drug that was approved for relapsed cervical cancer and that was KEYTRUDA. That was approved based on a 14% response rate with a duration of about a year and that was in -- they had to screen and that was in the PD-1 high or PD-L1 high, I should say, patients.And so it wasn't even all the patient population. For us, we are looking at all patient population and we showed from our early data, which is not as big of a trial and not our potentially registrable Phase 2, but we showed something in the 20% [Phonetic] response rate for this dreaded condition. If we're talking about lymphoma, that's not something people get too excited about. But if we're talking about relapsed cervical cancer, where there is very little hope and opportunity for patients and you have a drug that could give you substantively higher response rate than the last drug that was approved. We'll just have to also watch for duration. I think the FDA has not given us a line in this yet. But I would think that, if we could get more of that and we want as much as possible, we'd love to see something very long. But I think if we could get more than four months, five months duration or four months, five months, six months, I don't know, something more, something substantively with duration and something with response rate in the 20s, I think we have a really good shot.Now I will tell you that, to me that's step one. Okay? I want to be able to really help patients with relapsed cervical cancer. Okay? And to me, that's going to come from probably a combination study in the future. Yes, we want to get on the market with this as a single agent. Yes, we want to have another alternative for patients who have no other alternatives.But to me, if we could get this approved and then we can combine it with whether it's chemotherapy or I-O therapy or whatever and we could get up to potentially 30%, 40%, 50% response rate in patients that literally have no options. That's what I'm looking to do. So, we're excited to get this into a drug and try to see if we can get this approved. We're also excited to do even better by these patients.Thank you, sir. Our next question will come from Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. -- Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just have two quick ones for you. So first of all, regarding your ASCO GU update next week for PADCEV, how might this differ from what we saw at ESMO in terms of, just more patients or just longer follow up?And then the second question I have. Just curious if the 2020 guide reflects any sort of plan build out for TV, assuming that trial reads out positive or is that not in there yet? -- So the 2020 spend guide and TV and manufacturing, I'll turn it over to Todd in a moment. I'll start with ASCO GU and PADCEV. We are going to update the trial. At ESMO, the trial was a -- it was interim data. We weren't -- we did not have mature data at the time, but we presented everything and it was incredibly well received. I would say, we were one of the stars of ESMO and perhaps the star of ESMO. But that's a lot to say. But when we present the update of this trial ASCO GU, I don't think we're going to disappoint anybody.We have, Todd, guidance? -- Your question with respect to TV and the guidance, I mean... -- Manufacturing and stuff... -- Yeah, I mean, that's built into support the clinical trials that we're working on. There is some dosing work that we're still doing, but we haven't yet backed in a commercial build. We want to get to our data and see how that looks. And if we can hit the bar that Clay just articulated in the last question, then that will put us in a position to start to hear our thoughts on how we build that out. -- Okay. Thank you, guys. -- I hope we have that issue that we need to really spend quickly on tucatinib -- TV manufacturing. -- Okay.Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Schmidt with Guggenheim Securities. -- Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I had two pipeline questions. One follow-up on TV. You've done some work there last year already, but I was just wondering if you can help us a little bit with understanding the initial market opportunity in cervical cancer. For example, how many patients per year might be a treatment candidate should TV-204 succeed this year? And then I have a follow-up. -- Well, we're not at a point now where we're giving guidance in the -- with the specificity that you are asking for. But what I will tell you is that there were about 13,000 patients in the United States that were diagnosed with cervical cancer. And this is despite having a vaccine called GARDASIL, which is a phenomenal vaccine, but not everyone gets it. And in fact, when you look around the globe, not only is it just not in the US, but a lot of other countries, not everyone is getting it. And in fact, in some countries, it's not even in the formulary. This includes Japan and Brazil and other places. So when you start looking at how many patients around the globe were diagnosed last year with cervical cancer, it was 575,000. That is a travesty. And we would be very happy to have no business with TV and cervical cancer and pack it up and go home if everyone was taking GARDASIL. But that's not the reality.And the reality is that this is a horrible devastating disease. And if you're diagnosed with it, it's a death sentence. And we want to do something about it. But like I said, we'd love if everyone in the globe had the vaccine and this disease was wiped out. Just -- it's not really where it is. So, when I tell you, not only was there over 13,000 people diagnosed, but over 4,000 patients died in the US -- annually in US with cervical cancer. So that can give you some idea of the number of patients that are diagnosed and dying each year that I think we can address. Clearly, as we get more data, as we get further along, if we're going to be launched this, we will give more detailed assessment. -- Great. Thanks. And then maybe one for Roger regarding PADCEV and the bladder cancer opportunity. I guess, there has been some news recently and we've seen some results from BAVENCIO maintenance study in front-line metastatic patients and then KEYTRUDA was approved in the earlier-stage setting. I was just wondering how -- what your view is on how some of those things might potentially affect the market opportunity for PADCEV longer term? -- Thanks for the question, Michael. So yes, avelumab had a readout using a maintenance approach, one of the JAVELIN trials, which is great. That's great. Our trial designs as such, if you look, for example in the front-line study that we are going to conduct will include PFS and OS as an outcome and we really see understanding the maintenance profile. But that's limited to people.We have some degree of disease control on the front-end and other response or stable disease. It doesn't address the whole population. I think we are much more excited to try and get PADCEV to the entire population of metastatic urothelial cancer. So, I think that's our view and obviously, we'll operationalize the trial with those endpoints in mind.Thank you. Our next question comes from Shanshan Xu with Berenberg Capital Markets. -- Hi. Can you hear me OK? -- Yes. -- Yes. So, I believe that you have a very robust ADC platform. Historically, you rarely do acquisitions. However, the acquisition of Cascadian is a very successful one. So, would you revisit your M&A strategy? And I have one follow-up. -- Sure. So, we have a ongoing constant evaluation for M&A. We are actively looking. We were looking for a few years before we made the move on Cascadian. And when I look at a lot of things, you could say that we have done heck of a lot of diligence. And the first time we really were making a move was when we tried to license. It wasn't an acquisition. It was a license of sacituzumab govitecan from Immunomedics. And we went out at a time when nobody in Wall Street really was looking at it. Their share price was like $3 or $4 a share. And we went out to do a deal, which the courts overturned because of rationale that had nothing to do with Seattle Genetics. It was more of the activity of the prior CEO of Immunomedics. But we did keep our stock position. Todd referred to it. We made, I think over $200 million or something on that stock position, which the courts did not rule on. So, we were able to keep that, which was part of our license deal that got overturned. And yes, we would have and happy with that license deal if it had got on but it didn't. But it shows you the power of our diligence. And I gave you that story because the next time you heard about our diligence with Cascadian, which is another company that was trading at low-single digits and Wall Street was not focused on it. Cascadian was a company that started its life as Biomira and then it struggled to stay afloat and became Oncothyreon. And then it struggled and it became Cascadian. And after 30 years or so, being a company, they had this interesting product. And it was very early and they really needed a company that was bigger with more power and a full regulatory and manufacturing and medical and everything staff to get this done right.And so, I'm very proud that we took this from a tiny little company and acquired the company with a fair premium to their shareholders and made it into something that this is now we can argue whether this is going to be -- it's not approved yet, so I can't fully argue yet but a best-in-class HER2 tyrosine kinase. And probably the type of tablet that the scientists at GSK, who were trying to make TYKERB couple of decades ago, we're envisioning; one that had high potency to inhibit tyrosine kinase and one that did not bind to EGF receptor so you could stay away from the toxicities associated with that.So, we're really excited with what we did. And to that end, we do a great job in diligence. And unfortunately, that means we turned out. But there's a lot out there that has a lot of hype and it looks good initially, but then we dig deep and we dig incredibly deep and we find stuff that often that is less savory and we don't go forward. But you can be sure that we are out there looking in full force. And if we find something, we are not going to be shy.We are going to go out hard to do it. And I'll remind you, Todd can also comment if you have any questions. When we decided to acquire Cascadian, the next day, we went out and raised money for that acquisition. Not a penny more, we raised for that acquisition and we were transparent and we said, this is what we want to do. And we could go and try to acquire a company that's very small or a little bit bigger, I think we have a little bit more space to do it now. Clearly, we're not going to buy a massive company but we have a little bit more space because of bigger market cap and a little bit more bigger revenue, etc.But if we decide to buy something, you will be sure that we will go to Wall Street right away and say, here's what we want. Here's why we want it. Here's why it fits in and here's how much it's going to be. And here's what we want to do financially. So, we will be incredibly transparent, the way we work with Cascadian. And we will go full force to do it and then if we find something. -- Great. Thanks. I saw that you just achieved a positive profit this quarter. How should we be thinking about the sustainability of profitability going forward? Thank you. -- Thank you for the question. The reason we had a profit in the fourth quarter was because of the mark-to-market adjustment we had on the Immu shares, that was $50 million -- I think, $52 million or $54 million for the quarter and for the year. That's what resulted in the profitable quarter. So please don't read more into it than that because it was a result of that. -- We had a great quarter, certainly. And we had a lot of milestone payments that were one-off that Todd mentioned. We had three or four really important payments that we got. So the quarter was a great quarter. There is no doubt. We were thrilled with the quarter and all the different revenue streams that we brought in. But it is -- we're not -- on ongoing activity, when you pull out the mark-to-market, we are not yet profitable. But thank you for bringing that up.Okay. Next question.Thank you. Our next question comes from Chad Messer with Needham & Company. -- Great. Good afternoon, and congratulations on a strong year. So for PADCEV, that got approved quite a bit ahead of its PDUFA date. And you anticipated that you were ready. Just wondering about tucatinib, especially given that it has real-time oncology review. When -- you said you've got the senior sales leadership onboard for that. When do you think you need to be sort of fully commercially ready for tucatinib launch? -- So, I'll give you a little color on that. Maybe Robin could talk about the amazingly strong progress we're making with our sales staff on tucatinib. So, we went ahead and we used RTOR for ECHELON-2, you can recall. And that one was a supplemental BLA. And the initiation of this pilot program, RTOR at FDA, that's the only thing you can put into it, was supplemental BLAs. And we were able to, from submission, gain approval in 11 days. We were told that is a record. I think it still stands. Someone will obviously beat us in that. Maybe us on some other program that's a supplemental BLA.And later FDA added the ability to bring in a new chemical entity into the RTOR program. Now having said that, since it's a new chemical entity, it can get a very rapid review, but we still need to have inspections of sites and all of the work that you need on the QC/QA front with manufacturing. So it's not going to be an 11-day thing, but it can be very accelerated from a standard first approval. And that has the potential. That's why we're involved in RTOR because of the potential for it to move forward. I don't know what the FDA's criteria is for accepting things into RTOR. I can say that ECHELON-2 had strong overall survival advantage and we went in there with that supplemental BLA.And I can tell you with tucatinib, we have strong overall survival advantage. So, I think that -- I can't tell you exactly what FDA would accept into RTOR. But the two data sets, they've accepted from us are among the best we've had in the history of the company. So by that regard, maybe they're being picky and they should be for something to put a lot of effort and move forward fast.So, we're really excited with that and working with FDA. Keep in mind, we submitted that. We haven't yet passed the 60 days to where it is filed. So that's coming up in not-too-distant future from where accepted to file. So, that's the next thing you should hear from us about -- with tucatinib. But working hard with FDA. I can tell you that it is -- they are putting a lot of effort and we are putting a lot of effort and we communicate with them a lot.Robin, you want to talk about the sales staff and our readiness? -- Very happy to. We've already let you know that we've hired our sales leadership team. One of the great things about having the HER2CLIMB data is that it's not only attracted attention from physicians and they're excited about the data, but also many talented sales reps and other commercial staff are excited about the data as well. And so we have a very aggressive plan in terms of hiring. We want to make sure that we are ready for the approval whenever that may come. And the great news is that Seattle Genetics already had a very strong reputation in terms of the commercial organization.And so that, on top of the positive HER2CLIMB data that is very strong has meant that we have a lot of interest in the positions that we have opened across all of the US. And so the real task for us right now is really just getting through a lot of interviews and a lot of hiring decisions. But our number one standard is to make sure that we have a very strong talented and focused tucatinib team. And I'm very confident we will be ready for launch. -- I don't remember exactly where we are, but I do get updates periodically. And I know that the last update I got, two-thirds of the sales staff already onboard. So, just to let you know, we're not sitting back waiting. And that was a while ago. So, we are really making big progress to having that sales staff at full force and getting it there.Okay. Next question?The next question comes from Gena Wang with Barclays. -- Thank you for taking my questions. Just two very quick one. The first one is regarding PADCEV. I know it is still very early, but just wondering if you can give any color on average reimbursement process time. And the second question is regarding HER2CLIMB-02. I know you tried to go for both first-line and second-line metastatic breast cancer. What is your enrollment assumption for Herceptin-naive patients and how is the study powered? -- Okay. So let's start with PADCEV, and your question on average reimbursement. It is too soon for us to really start getting into that. With time, with ADCETRIS, we were able to say, here is the standard patient and here's how many cycles of therapy and here's how much that's worth and what they paid and all that and the gross-to-net and everything. We are able to really provide details about the duration of therapy and all that with ADCETRIS with time, but we had the data. We will do that likely for PADCEV in the future. We just are not there yet to go do that.Now, the second question you asked was about HER2CLIMB-02. And so that's the second trial and not to confuse it with the original HER2CLIMB. Roger, can you talk a little bit about maybe the type of patients we have that could be first or second line and maybe some of the inclusion and exclusion? That's really all we can talk about at this point. -- Sure. The key component of the population is they have to have seen trastuzumab and a taxane. And that's the key inclusion criteria. And so under that circumstance, provided those two drugs have been administered, whether it's in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant or metastatic session -- setting, you can imagine that there will clearly be patients who will have seen those prior to devoting [Phonetic] metastatic disease. So that will represent a front-line population and then there are clearly patients who will have seen those in the metastatic setting and therefore represent the second-line population. It's not possible to speculate now what the proportion of patients are. We've just begun the trial, and thanks for the question around powering. We can't disclose details, but I can just assure you, [Indecipherable] trial appropriately based on the assumptions that we've put into the study. So we expect if tucatinib plus TDM-1 is better than TDM-1 alone, we will be able to clearly show that. -- Next question?Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Willey with Stifel. -- Yeah. Thanks for taking the questions. Just quickly on PADCEV. Is it your expectation that you guys are going to get slotted in behind the FGFR inhibitors in those patients that have FGFR 2, 3 alterations? And I guess, when you gave your addressable patient numbers, I think, in conjunction with the approval call, did that include a haircut for those patients specifically as well? And then I just have a quick follow-up on tucatinib. -- I have quick answers for the first two. We do not know exactly what you're saying. But it is not our assumption that we are behind the FGFR. That is not the assumption we're going to take. And so in the calculation, we did not pull out any of those patients. -- Okay. And then just on tucatinib. I know that there was some discussion at San Antonio that there would be some additional updates regarding the CNS subgroup data. I guess is there any kind of guidance that you can provide us to when you might be able to present that? Thanks. -- Yes, we are doing a lot of work in that regard. Thank you for the question. It's really exciting to have the opportunity to actually look at cranial scans and start thinking about what you're getting. I mean so few drugs have an impact on PFS in patients with brain mets, that this is one of the rare times you can actually look and say, did you have a direct impact on the tumors.And I would say there is a decent chance that we will be presenting that type of work this year. I don't want to say for sure on anything, but I would -- I think pretty strongly about that. And obviously, we want to publish it as well. We want to present and publish that work. And that's something we're very much looking forward to doing.Thank you. Our next question comes from Andy Hsieh with William Blair. -- Great. Thanks for squeezing me in. So, I am just comparing the two proposed labels in the EU and US. So the EU has basically two prior anti-HER2 treatment -- sorry, this is about tucatinib, anti-HER2 treatment regimens and US is three. So, maybe can you talk about whether the two populations are significantly different or whether it's a function of just treatment differences between the two geographies? -- Roger? -- So thanks, Andy, for the question. So the answer is that the labels -- the addressable populations are the same. There isn't a difference between what we are proposing for the labeled indication in the US versus the EU. We chose to simplify the indications faced in the EU and that is our proposed indication today. I'll address that in a second, based in part on feedback that we got from an early regulatory interaction with The European Medicines Agency.I would also just point out that these are proposed labels, these are proposed indications and the final approved indication will -- if we get approval, will be determined in conjunction with various regulatory authorities. But just to reiterate, we do not -- this is not a different patient population. It is not a different treatment paradigm. It's just a choice about trying to simplify the language in the indications space. And the key goes around words like agents versus regimens. -- Right. Got it. And just a quick follow-up. In terms of the EV-302 study, I guess you could argue that Seattle Genetics and Merck probably understand that EC [Phonetic] landscape is the best. So obviously, the goal is to get the combination out to patients as soon as possible. Just curious about your thinking on interim analyses in that trial. -- Yeah. I would say right now, that is a fantastic question, but it is not one that we're able to address today. So keep that question in your head. Your comments and your thoughts on how we could do something quicker, whether it's in EV-302 and another trial or whatever is something that is under active discussion. So stay tuned. We'll be back to you on that. -- Got it. Cool. Thank you very much.Right. Thank you. Our last question comes from Silvan Tuerkcan with Oppenheimer & Company. -- Thanks. Congrats on the quarter and thanks for squeezing me in. My first question is on TV. We've seen late last year data from CheckMate-358 Phase 1b/2 trial, which kind of has comparable ORR data of Ipi-Nivo in that cervical cancer setting. Obviously, given that your Phase 1 trial was a dose finding trial, so it might be lower bound. But could you just contrast like, what -- how could these two regimens compare, especially maybe with a focus on side effects? -- I don't know off the top of my head the data from that trial. Roger can probably better discuss it. What I'd point to is the last approved drug for cervical cancer, which is KEYTRUDA. I don't remember the trial was from, but it was -- showed a 14% [Phonetic] response rate and a decent duration. We're trying to show a high response rate and best of duration as we can for these patients that have a huge unmet medical need.Roger, you want to add some thing? -- Right. And Clay's making the point Silvan that the history of what's been approved just sort of sets the scene for what it is we would expect to be measured against. [Indecipherable]. Ipi-Nivo is active in cervical cancer and there is a way for that combination to move forward in cervical cancer. That's great. But I think we're pretty excited about TV, as Clay said, such a high unmet need. And I think our data will stand by itself. So, I'm not sure that there is any need to reference combination immunotherapy at this point. -- Good point. And maybe one last question. Daiichi's ADC is making progress, I guess, in breast cancer and I would assume it would take share from TDM-1. Could we see a combination trial with tucatinib in the future? -- I think that your question is whether the drug now referred to as HER2 from Daiichi and AstraZeneca could be a good combination partner with tucatinib and hit on the outside of the cell with a very active antibody directed drug conjugate. And on the inside of the cell, with the very active and safe HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor is, I think a fantastic trial. That this -- whether we do it, whether Daiichi does it or whether eight doctors do it independently as investigator-sponsored trials, it's going to happen in multiple ways. So, I look forward to those data. I think those two drugs should be tested together. It is the right medicine.All right. Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session. And now I would like to turn the call over back to the speakers for closing remarks. -- Okay. Thank you, operator, and thanks everybody for joining us this afternoon. Have a good night.[Operator Closing Remarks] --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --

Innovation knows no borders allowing adventurous biotech investors the opportunity to find hidden gems located outside the major research and development hubs in the U.S., Europe, and Japan. One doesn't even need to look too far.Here we preview three such companies hailing from Canada, specifically the greater Vancouver area, which boast promising drugs in their pipelines and just raised additional financing from savvy insitutional investors eager to get ahead of the curve. These emerging biotechs may be the ticket for risk-tolerant investors to boost their portfolios. Image source: Getty Images.Biotech investors are taking note of Vancouver-based  . In the last year, the stock steadily tripled from $15 to its current price of $46. Last week, the company announced it successfully raised $320.8 million, primarily from institutional investors.Zymeworks engineers antibodies, a component of the immune system, to selectively recognize distinct targets on cancer cells. Each molecule can identify two separate targets leading to their name bispecific antibodies. Zymeworks did not stop there. In some cases, the company attaches highly potent cancer-killing drugs to the bispecific molecule using it as a targeting system. This is called an antibody drug conjugate and potentially increases the ability to kill cancer cells.One of many , Zymeworks initially began development against a set of aggressive cancers that contain the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) gene. The HER2 gene helps regulate cell division, growth, and repairs. Aberrant amounts of the gene can lead to excessive growth of cancer cells. Beyond breast cancer, HER2 overexpression or amplification is found in certain cancers of the stomach, pancreas, and salivary gland, to name a few.Lead compound ZW25 targets two unique variants of HER2, and has entered a slate of human clinical trials. The antibody drug conjugate version called ZW49 is in early stage clinical trial testing.A review of Zymeworks' pipeline shows a long list of drug candidates being developed in collaboration with other companies. These include pharma stalwarts , , , , and emerging China-based pharma . Targeting neurological disorders,   recently raised an additional $60 million in financing to advance its pipeline. This comes on the heels of receiving $50 million from a new partnership. This capital infusion should provide enough resources to advance its four clinical stage drug candidates forward.Xenon plans to advance XEN496 into a pivotal phase 3 clinical trial for a rare and severe form of childhood epilepsy. Towards the end of 2020, the company expects results from a phase 2b trial with XEN1101 as a treatment for adults with focal epilepsy. In this disease, recurring seizures emerge from a specific part of the brain. Like Zymeworks, Xenon boasts prominent strategic partners. Genentech, part of the , forged a collaboration to pursue a novel approach to treating pain. Following an initial discovery collaboration, Merck acquired the rights to a compound as a treatment for cardiovascular disease. In September, Xenon entered a partnership with biotech  to develop an extended-release thermosensitive hydrogel version of Xenon's XEN402 for post-operative pain. Last December,  entered into a partnership to develop novel epilepsy treatments. The pact grants rights to Xenon's clinical-stage epilepsy drug XEN901 and a multi-year collaboration to discover new drug candidates. Neurocrine paid $50 million consisting of $30 million in cash and a $20 million equity investment. Xenon could potentially earn development, regulatory, and commercial milestones totaling approximately $1.7 billion for XEN901 and other collaboration programs. Last December was a whirlwind for  . First, the company announced positive results from a phase 3 clinical trial of its drug voclosporin in lupus nephritis, a dangerous kidney disease caused by the body's immune system attacking healthy tissues. The company plans to file for approval with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration sometime in the first half of 2020. Aurinia plans a commercial launch of the product, assuming approval, in the first half of 2021. Investors excited by the trial results drove up the stock price from the $5 range to the high teens. When the stock was in the $18 range, management at Aurinia opportunistically raised $191.7 million at $15 per share. With more money in the bank, investors clamored for the stock pushing the shares to $21, a four-fold gain from where the stock traded prior to the clinical trial results.Beyond lupus nephritis, Aurinia has commenced clinical testing of voclosporin in dry eye syndrome and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). Chronic in nature, the hallmarks of dry eye syndrome are irritation and inflammation. FSGS, a rare disease that attacks the kidneys' filtering system and can be potentially life-threatening, has no FDA-approved treatments.Zymeworks feels like  in its earlier days. Leveraging expertise in a core technology, it produced a broad array of wholly owned and partnered drugs. Investors should watch for clinical results from ZW25 and ZW49.

The trial results are expected in the second half of the year. While  is risky, Xenon needs to deliver more data to provide investors more comfort.As a single-product company, Aurinia appears to be a likely acquisition target in the rare disease space. Voclosporin faces competition from , but, perhaps, a company like , which has its own program in FSGS, could be a suitor.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will give tucatinib's new drug application a priority review.Patients with HER2-positive breast cancer tumors that keep growing after treatment multiple rounds of standard care could have another treatment option this summer. Image source: Getty ImagesInstead of the standard 10-month process, the FDA granted tucatinib a priority review that will shave four months off the timeline. The agency's expected to announce a decision on or before Aug. 20, 2020. The priority review the FDA gives tucatinib will most likely result in a positive approval decision on or before the FDA's action date. During the  that's supporting Seattle Genetics' new drug application, adding tucatinib to a standard regimen of chemotherapy plus Herceptin reduced patients' risk of death significantly. Two years after beginning treatment, 44.9% of patients given tucatinib plus standard care were still alive compared to a 26.6% survival rate for patients given standard care alone.Roughly half of all patients with HER2-positive breast cancer develop brain tumors that are incredibly difficult to treat. Seattle Genetics' potential new cancer therapy appears to give this underserved population a fighting chance for long-term survival. During the HER2Climb trial, none of the patients with brain metastases given standard care survived past one year without signs of their disease worsening compared to an impressive 24.9% of those treated with the tucatinib-containing regimen.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"You couldn't ask for a much better story for last year. Its shares  thanks to a couple of encouraging clinical updates. Investors' fervor has cooled off so far in 2020, though.Seattle Genetics announced its 2019 fourth-quarter and full-year results after the market closed on Thursday. Did the biotech give a reason for investors to resume cheering? Here are the highlights from Seattle Genetics' Q4 update.Image source: Getty Images.Seattle Genetics announced Q4 revenue of $289.8 million, a 66% jump from the $174.5 million reported in the same quarter of the previous year. This result was also much higher than the average analysts' revenue estimate of $224.5 million.The company announced net income of $25.8 million, or $0.14 per share, in the fourth quarter based on generally accepted accounting principles (). That represented a big improvement from a loss of $119.8 million, or $0.75 per share, in the prior-year period. Analysts were expecting the biotech to report an adjusted net loss in Q4 of $0.45 per share.Seattle Genetics ended the fourth quarter with cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $868.3 million. Lymphoma drug Adcetris performed very well in the fourth quarter, with net sales jumping 26% year over year to $166.2 million. This growth was driven primarily by increased use of the drug in front-line CD-30-expressing peripheral T-cell lymphoma.Seattle Genetics also won FDA approval for Padcev in treating urothelial cancer on Dec. 18. With just a couple of weeks on the market, the drug generated net sales of $0.2 million.The main growth driver for Seattle Genetics in Q4, though, was its increased royalty revenue. The biotech reported Q4 royalty revenue of $72.3 million, nearly triple the $24.6 million made in the prior-year period.  paid Seattle Genetics $40 million in a milestone payment triggered by annual net sales of Adcetris that exceeded $400 million in the Japanese drugmaker's territory.Seattle Genetics also received a nice bump from its collaboration and license agreements. Revenue in the fourth quarter from these agreements totaled $51.1 million, up from $17.8 million in the same quarter of 2018. This solid increase stemmed primarily from a milestone payment from  and an upfront payment from .Seattle Genetics expects Adcetris net product sales of $675 million to $700 million in full year 2020. The company also projects 2020 royalty revenues of between $105 million and $115 million, with collaboration and license agreement revenue between $30 million and $50 million.However, the consensus analysts' revenue estimate for 2020 is $1.1 billion. Seattle Genetics' shares fell in after-hours trading on Thursday, as investors appeared to be disappointed with the company's guidance.The main thing to look forward to with  like Seattle Genetics is pipeline progress. CEO Clay Siegall said the company is ""well positioned to bring a third product to market with the tucatinib marketing applications in the United States, Europe, and other countries for patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer."" In addition, Seattle Genetics and its partner, , should report top-line data in the first half of this year from a pivotal clinical study evaluating tisotumab vedotin in treating cervical cancer.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

There are 12 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Seattle Genetics Inc, but the average is just that — a mathematical average.  There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $95.00.  And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $140.00.  The standard deviation is $15.06.


But the whole reason to look at the average SGEN price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes.  And so with SGEN crossing above that average target price of $116.08/share, investors in SGEN have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $116.08 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

"Biotech investors are always looking for ways to reduce risk. One method is to focus on stocks with drugs that have come out of phase 3 trials with good news. With enough research, you can usually figure out the odds of approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and how large the market opportunity is. That's often a good time to buy an unprofitable biotech. is filing a new drug application for its lupus drug, voclosporin, later this year. And  is waiting for the FDA to approve its drug for triple-negative breast cancer, sacituzumab govitecan. Both of these stocks appear undervalued, given the high likelihood of drug approval from the FDA and the market opportunity that lies ahead.    Image source: Getty Images.Aurinia Pharmaceuticals is currently valued at $2 billion, which is pretty cheap for a company that is bringing a potential blockbuster drug -- one estimated to bring in over  in annual sales -- to market. Aurinia's drug, voclosporin, was a home run in its phase 3 trial as a  for lupus nephritis, which affects an estimated 60% of lupus patients. There is currently no approved drug for lupus nephritis. Aurinia tested its drug in 357 people over 52 weeks. Voclosporin had 40% renal response rates, compared to 22.5% renal response rates with the current standard of care. One person died while taking the drug, compared to five deaths in the control group. The stock .    The overall lupus market is currently dominated by Benlysta, a drug from . Benlysta racked up $581 million in sales in the first three quarters of 2019. Glaxo is trying to expand its drug to the lupus nephritis indication, and ran its own phase 3 trial last year. Its drug had 43% renal response rates, compared to 32% in the control group.   Aurinia has no other drugs in its pipeline, so it's a one-hit wonder. Speculation is rampant that many big pharmas would like to . The stock is up more than 170% over the last year. One type of breast cancer is more dangerous than the rest. It's called ""triple negative breast cancer,"" and it affects about 10%-20% of breast cancer patients. Triple-negative breast cancer is a highly aggressive type of cancer that tests negative for estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, and the HER2 protein. Most cancer drugs aim for one or more of those targets, so most cancer drugs are not very helpful against this type of breast cancer. Immunomedics specializes in antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) therapy. The  designs molecules that target cancer cells and leave ordinary cells alone. Its lead compound, IMMU-132, is a drug for many cancers, including triple negative breast cancer. The FDA has awarded IMMU-132 its  designation, for drugs that provide substantial improvements to the current standard of care for a serious medical condition. IMMU-132 is being tested in clinical trials as a third-line therapy for patients with triple-negative breast cancer -- reserved for patients who have already tried two different cancer therapies to no avail. In this difficult-to-treat group, IMMU-132 had a 34% objective response rate, which is considered very good. , another company that specializes in ADC therapies for cancer, was so impressed with the data that it offered Immunomedics a  to license IMMU-132 in 2017. But the company's majority investor, venBio Select Advisors (now Avoro Capital Advisors), found the offer too low. There was a , and Immunomedics founder David Goldenberg and CEO Cynthia Sullivan were forced to retire. Immunomedics retained control of the molecule. Immunomedics is down about 30% off its highs. Both the market and the company were shocked when the FDA  IMMU-132 last year. The agency cited no efficacy or safety issues with the drug -- only  at the plant where the drug was to be produced. Immunomedics has found a new manufacturing partner and has since refiled its Biologics License Application with the FDA. An independent analysis commissioned by the company reported that IMMU-132 could bring in over $3 billion a year if the drug is approved for triple-negative breast cancer, urothelial cancer, and lung cancer. The company's current market cap is $4 billion, so there is plenty of upside to be had.Odds are high that the FDA will approve both voclosporin and IMMU-132 in 2020. The risk/reward ratio looks good, given the positive trial data and the huge market opportunity. Despite Aurinia's fantastic run-up last year, the market is still undervaluing the stock. A company with a blockbuster lupus drug should fetch more than a $2 billion market cap. Immunomedics is currently valued at $4 billion, about twice the size of Aurinia. Yet its market opportunity is even larger, with a cancer drug that might be used in multiple indications -- including triple negative breast cancer, a disease in dire need of new treatment options. Either of these stocks might well reward patient (and risk-tolerant) investors. When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

When looking at biotech stocks, a big point of focus should be on the products driving revenue now or the solidity of the pipeline, which will drive revenue later. ,  , and   are three companies that fit the bill. And with product news in their favor, now is the time to add these stocks to your portfolio.Image source: Getty Images.Acadia's Nuplazid is the only U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment for hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson's disease psychosis. About one million Americans have Parkinson's disease, and according to the American Parkinson Disease Association, more than half will at some point develop this non-motor symptom.Acadia's annual revenue has climbed since the product was approved in 2016, and in the most recent quarter, the company said net sales of Nuplazid soared $94.6 million, up 62% from the same quarter last year. As a result, Acadia lifted guidance for 2019 net sales of the drug to the range of $330 million to $340 million, up from the earlier range of $320 million to $330 million.The compound behind the Nuplazid name is called pimavanserin, and Acadia is testing it in three additional indications, currently in phase 2 and 3 trials. In December, the company reported favorable top-line results from its phase 3 trial in dementia-related psychosis -- another treatment area lacking an FDA-approved drug -- and said it would meet with the FDA in the first half of 2020 regarding a submission for that indication. According to the Gerontological Society of America, more than two million Americans with dementia experience delusions.Nuplazid's sales so far and the compound's potential to suit other indications -- addressing unmet needs -- make Acadia's stock attractive from a product perspective.Alexion, which focuses on rare diseases, is another company that has increased revenues steadily over the past few years, and recent news should keep that trend going. Late last year, the FDA approved Ultomiris for the treatment of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), and regulatory agencies in Europe and Japan issued approvals of its drug Soliris for adults with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder. In aHUS, abnormal blood clots form in blood vessels in the kidneys and lead to serious medical problems, while neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder causes inflammation of the optic nerve and spinal cord.At the start of this year, Alexion announced the beginning of a pivotal phase 3 trial of Ultomiris in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a disease that leads to progressive degeneration of nerve cells. Alexion has more than 20 investigational drugs in the pipeline, from preclinical to late-stage clinical trials.This hefty pipeline, and a product portfolio of four drugs, along with the planned acquisition of clinical-stage biotech  , are reasons to be optimistic about future earnings -- and therefore, share performance. Recent reports show Alexion can deliver, with a 23% increase in total third-quarter revenue to $1.26 billion and sales gains for all drugs except Ultomiris, which hadn't yet been approved in the year-earlier period.This company now has two products on the market after the FDA in December granted Padcev accelerated approval for locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer, the most common type of bladder cancer. The approval is specifically for adult patients who have previously received platinum-based chemotherapy and a treatment that blocks proteins in the body that help cancer cells. A key point is that Padcev is the only FDA-approved drug for this patient set. Though it's unclear how many patients the drug may serve initially, the general market for this type of cancer is growing. In the U.S., about 80,000 new cases of bladder cancer are diagnosed per year, and about 90% of cases are of urothelial type.In late December, Seattle Genetics said it submitted a New Drug Application for tucatinib, its investigational treatment for HER2-positive breast cancer, to the FDA. In HER2-positive breast cancer, tumors have high levels of a protein that promotes cancer cell growth. Earlier, the FDA granted tucatinib breakthrough status based on data from the treatment's pivotal clinical trial. Breakthrough designation is meant to speed up the FDA review process for drugs that treat serious medical conditions.In the most recent earnings report, Seattle Genetics reported a 32% quarterly gain in sales of its first drug, Adcetris, a treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma, and an increase in royalty revenue from the sales of the product outside the U.S. and Canada. Though the company isn't profitable, revenue has climbed for at least the past three years, and with the addition of Padcev and maybe even tucatinib in the not-too-distant future, it's reasonable to count on more gains.In the case of each of these  companies, earnings should benefit this year from either a product or products with strong growth or a newly launched drug. And for Acadia and Alexion, optimism linked to late-stage clinical trials may boost the shares, while hope for a nod from the FDA on tucatinib may lift Seattle Genetics. As for potential share price gains, for Acadia, Wall Street predicts 42% upside from the current share price and a 38% increase for Alexion. Seattle Genetics has less to , according to the average analyst estimate, with about 5% upside from this point.That said, these aren't stocks to buy for the short-term, but instead to add to your portfolio at this decent entry point. These companies will benefit from increasing product revenue over time -- which should result in a healthy long-term stock market performance.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

(RTTNews) - Seattle Genetics Inc. (SGEN) said that it will receive a milestone payment from Roche triggered by European Commission conditional marketing authorisation for Polivy. Polivy is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that utilizes Seattle Genetics' technology. It was developed and is commercialized by Roche/Genentech.

"As good a year as 2019 was for the markets, it was an even better one for biotech. While the S&P 500 rose 30% during the year, many biotech stocks soared much higher.  skyrocketed more than 3,500% in 2019, dwarfing  , which ""only"" doubled, while '  32% increase looked downright ordinary.All three stocks finished the year trading around their five-year highs, and continuing to rise in 2020 may be a tall task for not just them, but biotech stocks in general.Biotech stocks are very sensitive to news. One major development -- such as a positive result from a clinical trial -- and share prices can take off in a hurry.There were  Axsome stock climbed during the year, and it didn't happen all at once. Although the stock's returns for 2019 had already hit 1,300% by December, shares of Axsome took off even higher when on Dec. 16, the company announced positive results from phase 3 trials of AXS-05. The drug ""significantly improved symptoms of depression"" and fared much better against the placebo. As a result of the positive findings, the company is planning to proceed with a new drug application in the latter half of this year.It's a significant development for the company, and it stated in the release that, ""If approved, AXS-05 would represent the first mechanistically novel oral pharmacotherapy for depression in over 30 years."" Image source: Getty Images.Seattle Genetics also got a bump in its share price in October, when the company released  from the phase 2 study of its HER2CLIMB breast cancer drug. It was successful in reducing death rates and the progression of the disease. The company is going to file a new drug application as well, as early as the first quarter of this year. In addition to the positive drug results, Seattle Genetics gave investors more good news later in the month when it released its third-quarter results, which showed sales growth of 26% from the prior-year quarter. It also raised its guidance for the remainder of 2019. The stock rose on the results as the good news from the top line was more than enough to offset any concerns investors may have had that the company's bottom line was worse than analysts were expecting.Vertex's stock was having a lackluster 2019 heading into October, with its shares flat since the beginning of the year. That changed, though, when investors learned that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the company's cystic fibrosis drug, Trikafta. It's a combination of three drugs, and the approval will allow it to be an option for 90% of people with cystic fibrosis, which is about 27,000 people in the U.S. Given the drug's expensive list price of more than $311,000, it could generate significant sales growth for the company.Then, in November, Vertex and together announced positive results from a gene-editing therapy the two companies are working on, CTX001, which treats people with blood disorders beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease. While it's the first clinical trial -- and the results are still preliminary and only involved two patients -- it showed potential and was another bright spot behind which Vertex and its investors could rally. Although each of the companies on this list has done well this past year, only Vertex has posted a profit over the past four quarters. However, that's not unusual for biotech stocks that are still in the early stages of their development; not only are they among the most volatile stocks, they're also not likely profitable, either. Investors are effectively paying for future expectations, and that's what can make them risky. And given how well these and other biotech stocks have done in 2019, it could make them vulnerable for a correction, whether it's this year or sometime down the road.In Axsome's case, the company hasn't even generated any revenue yet. Investors are banking on the success and approval of AXS-05. The problem is that if there's a hiccup along the way, the stock could stumble as well. With little substance behind the stock other than future expectations, it could be vulnerable to a big correction.However, the stocks that generate revenue are expensive, too. Seattle Genetics trades at 24 times its sales and more than 10 times book value. Both multiples are high for investors concerned about value. Pharmaceutical giant  trades at a more modest five times sales and seven times its book value. Vertex's valuation is a bit more modest, trading at 17 times sales and 11 times earnings, but they're still hefty premiums for investors to be paying.A big development can generate a lot of hype for a stock, especially if investors expect that it will lead to significant growth down the road for a company. However, things don't always go as planned, and whether it's these or other biotech stocks, investors need to remember that clinical trials and new drug applications are not a sure thing. And when stocks are trading at high valuations, and investors are paying significant premiums for them, there's an increased risk that a correction could happen in the share price.While investors can and should be excited about the progress biotech stocks make, that doesn't mean they should ignore valuations and neglect how much a company has proven today.  can produce significant returns for investors, but they can also go in the other direction.With biotech stocks doing so well in 2019 and an election upcoming this year that could have ramifications on the healthcare industry, there's ample risk for biotech investors, especially when it comes to stocks that are at high valuations. Rather than hopping on the bandwagon, investors should exercise a bit of caution when investing in biotech and ensure that there's still a solid business behind a company should an exciting new drug not pan out exactly as the company expects.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, , has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Vertex Pharmaceuticals wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.  The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Are Biotech Stocks Due for a Correction in 2020?@2020-01-15@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/are-biotech-stocks-due-for-a-correction-in-2020-2020-01-15

"Legendary investor Warren Buffett advises to be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful.  One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100.  A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.

In trading on Monday, shares of Seattle Genetics Inc (Symbol: SGEN) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 25.0, after changing hands as low as $104.50 per share.  By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) is 68.4.  A bullish investor could look at SGEN's 25.0 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.    The chart below shows the one year performance of SGEN shares:
   
   

Looking at the chart above, SGEN's low point in its 52 week range is $62.90 per share, with $122.36 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $104.88.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''.  These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand.  Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).  Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

The  has outperformed the S&P 500 in eight of the past 10 years, so the industry has been a great source of market-beating ideas.Biotech investing isn't easy, though. Clinical-trial failures, expiring patents, and stiff competition mean there's plenty of risk associated with owning biotech stocks. Nevertheless, the potential rewards associated with investing in the industry could make owning stocks with upcoming catalysts a great idea. For example,  ,  , and   have events coming up that could make buying shares this year smart.BioMarin could be about to  how doctors treat hemophilia with a mega-blockbuster indication worth $10 billion in revenue annually.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Currently, hemophilia treatment involves regular infusions of missing proteins necessary for clotting blood to prevent or stop bleeding. These infusions cost payers hundreds of thousands of dollars per year, and despite widespread use, patients are still at risk of life-threatening bleeds, joint and organ damage, and a shortened life expectancy.If BioMarin has its way, European Union (EU) and U.S. regulators will soon approve its gene therapy for hemophilia A, a treatment that could do away with infusions and significantly reduce the risk of uncontrolled bleeding by inserting a gene that produces the missing protein (Factor VIII) in a patient's liver. The EU is expected to begin its review of BioMarin's gene therapy this month, while the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) should begin reviewing the therapy as soon as February. In both cases, a successful review could lead to approvals that allow BioMarin to begin selling the therapy before the end of 2020.Although regulators could balk at approval, clinical-trial results for the therapy were solid. BioMarin recently released long-term follow-up data from its phase 1/2 trial showing average annualized bleeding rates and the need for factor VIII infusions fell 96% from baseline in the third year following administration of the therapy in the highest dose cohort. Given the significant costs associated with factor VIII infusions and the fact that BioMarin's therapy could be the first of its kind to win a regulatory OK, BioMarin could be on the cusp of launching a blockbuster.There's a big need for new, late-line treatment options in patients with melanoma. Currently, just 4% to 10% of patients whose disease has progressed following administration of a PD-1, BRAF, and MEK-targeting treatment respond to re-treatment.In 2020, Iovance expects to report data from pivotal studies of lifileucel, an autologous adoptive cell-transfer therapy utilizing a tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte manufacturing process, which may improve response rates.A unique approach, TIL manufacturing involves identifying immune cells that have successfully infiltrated a tumor, multiplying those cells into an army of billions in a lab, and infusing them back into the patient. This process takes about 23 days, but the wait could be worth it. In phase 2, 35% of metastatic melanoma patients had at least some response to lifileucel, despite the average person having failed on a median 3.3 prior treatments, including PD-1 inhibitors -- a common immunotherapy.Similarly, data from one cohort in an ongoing phase 2 study evaluating a second TIL, LN-145, in cervical cancer showed a  rate, including an 11% complete response rate in heavily pretreated patients. If final data from that study is positive, then Iovance expects to file for approval in that indication this year, too. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Last year, investors may have been questioning a decision by activist investors in 2017 to scuttle a plan for   to license Immunomedics' lead drug, sacituzumab govitecan, for $2 billion in upfront money and potential milestones, plus double-digit royalties on future sales. Instead of granting a review and potentially approving sacituzumab govitecan, the FDA issued Immunomedics a complete response letter (CRL) for its use in third-line or higher metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) last January, dashing hopes for a regulatory green light in 2019.Fortunately, the CRL may prove to have been a temporary hiccup. Since the FDA's concerns weren't related to clinical trials but instead to ""chemistry, manufacturing, and control"" issues, Immunomedics was able to address the FDA's concerns and  for approval last month.In clinical trials, the overall response rate to sacituzumab govitecan was 33% in the third-line setting. Progression-free survival observed in the study was 5.5 months. In both cases, the results were better than the mid-teens rates historically observed for chemotherapy regimens in the second-line setting.The potential to reshape late-line TNBC treatment shouldn't be ignored. About 8,000 people in the U.S. alone pass away annually from TNBC, an aggressive, tough-to-treat disease accounting for roughly 20% of all breast cancers.Sacituzumab govitecan's potential isn't limited to late-line TNBC, though. Management expects data from its late-line use in metastatic urothelial cancer soon. If results are positive in that indication, it plans to file for FDA approval, as well.The company's studying sacituzumab govitecan in combination with immunotherapies as a potential early line alternative, too. The flurry of activity suggests this could be a multi-indication drug with blockbuster potential, so an approval this year could make it one of biotech's big winners in 2020. When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

" used to be a pretty compelling investment for many  investors out there. Its only drug, Nerlynx (also known as neratinib), targets a significant portion of the breast cancer patient population and definitely has the potential to be a lucrative drug. However, the company seems to have taken a major turn for the worse over the past year.While bad news has sent share prices falling by around two-thirds in the past 12 months, some investors think that the company is now a cheap buy, especially since it still boasts significant revenue figures for its meager $325 million market cap.Let's take a closer look at whether you should consider buying into Puma, or if you should stay clear of this stock.Image source: Getty Images.Puma's only drug, Nerlynx, received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval back in 2017 to be used as an adjuvant (extended post-surgery) therapy in patients who have early stage HER2-positive breast cancer. More specifically, Nerlynx is a pan-HER inhibitor, which means it fights HER2-positive breast cancer cells by preventing them from receiving growth signals. However, it turns out that an alarming number of patients who are prescribed Nerlynx quit the treatment within the first month due to the drug's side effects. Nerlynx, which is an oral daily medication, has long been known to cause severe diarrhea in many patients, with Puma going so far as to provide vouchers to patients for anti-diarrheal medications. However, Puma's management went on to say in a conference call that many patients discontinued the drug due to the severity of their symptoms.Nerlynx is also relatively expensive for doctors to prescribe, costing over $10,000 per month while providing only a modest increase in survival chances for the small group of patients who have early stage HER2-positive breast cancer. The story gets worse for Nerlynx when one looks at another biotech stock, , which is developing a drug candidate that would target a similar group of patients. Tucatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) which inhibits specific enzymes called tyrosine kinases involved in protein activation. More specifically, Tucatinib targets HER2, a growth factor present in many cancer patients, including those with breast cancer.While it's not specifically a breast cancer treatment, analysts on Wall Street suspect that Tucatinib could siphon market share away from Nerlynx. This is especially possible considering that Tucatinib seems to be better tolerated among patients than Nerlynx, although diarrhea is still present for some patients, according to the latest trial results. Back in October, Goldman Sachs analyst Paul Choi downgraded Puma to ""sell"" for precisely for this reason and cut his price target down from $24 to just $8 per share. He went on to say that Seattle Genetics' Tucatinib ""is underappreciated and creates a challenging set up. We believe that even if Tucatinib is not differentiated on efficacy, it may garner more market share on greater tolerability,"" something that may very well prove to be the case. While Nerlynx seems to have a fair number of problems going for it, Puma Biotechnology -- from a purely financial perspective -- might seem a little undervalued to some investors. Even after cutting back on its year-end guidance multiple times this year, Nerlynx sales for 2019 are expected to be around $210 million. Coupled with royalty and license revenues, which are roughly around $60 million, Puma's total revenue for the year would be around $270 million.Considering that Puma's market cap is just $325 million, that's quite cheap. In terms of its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio, Puma trades at just 1.15 times its sales, whereas in January 2019 it was trading at 4.7 times sales. Although the company is still reporting quarterly losses, with its most recent third quarter seeing a $16.9 million loss, Puma's $58.9 million in cash is enough to last it almost a year at its current rate of expenditure.To Puma's credit, the company is addressing its discontinuation problem with some new strategies. Besides increasing the number of patients who start on lower doses, Puma has seen some  in trying to co-prescribe a novel combo of antidiarrheal medications alongside Nerlynx. Although it's quite possible that sales in 2020 will increase, Nerlynx's potential as a blockbuster $1 billion-plus revenue drug don't seem realistic anymore.Despite its bargain-bin valuation, I don't think that's enough to recommend this stock to anybody. Puma Biotechnology has lost almost 95% of its market valuation over the past two years and trying to catch a falling knife is always a big risk. When you take into consideration potential competition from Seattle Genetics, Puma's core business can easily fall apart if a superior competitor drug emerges onto the scene. This is one biotech stock that investors should keep their distance from.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"Investors in Seattle Genetics Inc (Symbol: SGEN) saw new options begin trading this week, for the February 2020 expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the SGEN options chain for the new February 2020 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $110.00 strike price has a current bid of $6.60.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $110.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $103.40 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of SGEN, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $112.75/share today.

Because the $110.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 60%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.00% return on the cash commitment, or 41.32% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.


Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Seattle Genetics Inc, and highlighting in green where the $110.00 strike is located relative to that history:


   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $115.00 strike price has a current bid of $7.60.  If an investor was to purchase shares of SGEN stock at the current price level of $112.75/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $115.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 8.74% if the stock gets called away at the February 2020 expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if SGEN shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Seattle Genetics Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing SGEN's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $115.00 strike highlighted in red:



   
Considering the fact that the $115.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 51%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.74% boost of extra return to the investor, or 46.42% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.


The implied volatility in the put contract example is 51%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 52%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $112.75) to be 44%.

"This past year proved profitable for investors in   and  . Handily beating broad market and biotech indexes, these two drug manufacturers hit the $20 billion valuation mark and are poised to continue growing in the coming year -- unless, of course, an acquirer emerges.  Image Source: Getty Images2019 was a solid year for Incyte, with its  approximately 42%. Sales of its lead drug Jakafi exceeded $1.2 billion in the first nine months of the year. The company expects full-year sales of Jakafi to reach $1.65 billion to $1.68 billion. Royalties and sales of leukemia drug Iclusig in Europe added another $283 million over the first three quarters of the year. Incyte's pipeline remains one of the most extensive in biotech. With nine late-stage drug candidates, seven have two or more phase 2 or phase 3 clinical trials under way. Its early stage portfolio sports another dozen drug candidates. What does this mean for ? Expect to see continuous program updates and clinical trial results throughout 2020 and 2021. Also, the breadth of the research and development pipeline coupled with revenues approaching $2 billion in 2020 should be able to absorb any R&D setbacks or failures.Seattle Genetics flourished in 2019 with its stock more than doubling on the heels of positive news. Adcetris, Seattle Genetics' first approved cancer drug, continued to reach record sales levels each quarter, representing growth between 30% and 42% compared to the corresponding periods in 2018. The company expects the total year revenue to range between $625 million to $640 million for Adcetris. This week the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted accelerated approval three months ahead of schedule for Seattle Genetics' drug Padcev to treat the most common form of bladder cancer. Earlier this month, the company  for a novel breast cancer drug called tucatinib. While Seattle Genetics feverishly readies tucatinib's New Drug Application (NDA) for approval, the FDA designated the drug as a Breakthrough Therapy. Seattle Genetics is a stock to own for 2020. Padcev's approval means another revenue stream in addition to Adcetris. Importantly, three products could be marketed by the end of 2020. The company's management announced that it expects to file the NDA for tucatinib in the first quarter. This promising breast cancer drug also showed the ability to combat cancer that spread to the brain. Incyte and Seattle Genetics are both perennial M&A targets. However, since both companies boast valuations of $20 billion, any acquirer needs to be able to afford that plus the premium to make a buyout attractive. Only big pharmaceutical companies can afford to shell out $20 billion to $40 billion, assuming a 100% acquisition premium at the top end of the range.Currently, several big pharmaceutical companies are trying to digest recent or on-going acquisitions, taking them off the table as prospective near-term buyers. In January,  closed its $62 billion acquisition of Shire.  concluded its $74 billion acquisition of Celgene in November.  remains in the thick of its $63 billion deal with . And by mid-2020,  hopes to complete the Viatris transaction, formed through the spinoff and merger of its Upjohn business unit with . Japanese pharma   stands out as the natural buyer for Seattle Genetics. The companies enjoy a long-standing partnership dating back to 2007, which yielded Adcetris and now Padcev. However, Astellas' market cap is just $33 billion. Therefore, it would likely need to be a merger instead of an acquisition. Culturally, the existing partnership may be more productive than forcing a cross-border merger. Astellas traces its roots back to 1894 and may prefer smaller, less dilutive acquisitions, like its recent $3 billion buyout of gene therapy company .  Incyte partners   and   seem like the most likely buyers. Even for Eli Lilly, the smaller of the two, an acquisition could be manageable. Earlier this month, Eli Lilly appointed Josh Bilenker and two of his key lieutenants to run oncology R&D. Eli Lilly bought their company Loxo Oncology earlier this year for roughly $8 billion. Could this changing of the guard with a deep background in targeted small molecules look to make a statement by acquiring Incyte?Since we're speculating, here's another food for thought scenario. What if Incyte and Seattle Genetics merged? It's not so far-fetched...at least, on paper.Both companies focus on oncology, while Incyte would bring diversification through its R&D in immunology, rheumatology, and dermatology. The merged company would have five marketed drugs. That could easily reach seven if Seattle Genetics' tucatinib and Incyte's pemigatinib gain approval in 2020.Jakafi and Adcetris combined should generate more than $2.25 billion in sales in 2019. Incyte also sells the leukemia drug Iclusig in Europe. This commercial infrastructure and capability could be leveraged to market tucatinib, assuming approval. Seattle Genetics owns worldwide rights to the drug.What about the R&D fit? Historically, Incyte discovered and developed small molecule drugs to inhibit specific enzymes called kinases. Through recent partnerships with  and , Incyte expanded into therapeutic antibodies and bispecific antibodies. This allowed it to get into the ultra-hot immuno-oncology field. Seattle Genetics' platform seeks to develop antibody-drug conjugates, a ""smart bomb"" cancer therapy that tethers highly potent cancer-killing small molecules to an antibody that recognizes a specific molecular target on a cancer cell. Seattle Genetics' 2018 acquisition of Cascadian Therapeutics gave it tucatinib, a kinase inhibitor for breast cancer that could be FDA-approved next year, and an early stage immuno-oncology program. Thus, the R&D efforts of both companies can be viewed at a high level as complementary.The biggest potential roadblock in a deal like this comes down to management. Who will run the combined company? Arguably, both management teams have done tremendous jobs at creating shareholder value and delivering new therapies to patients, with more to come. If the personnel issues can be worked out, and with some additional creative deal-making, I can envision a dynamic entity able to step in to fill the hole left by Celgene. Willing to bet on cutting-edge science, Celgene transformed into one of the most prolific dealmakers sought out by emerging biotech companies as their partner of choice. Can Incyte and Seattle Genetics do the same? If $1 plus $1 can equal $3, will $20 billion plus $20 billion equal $60 billion?I hope readers fully grasp the speculative nature of my idea. Incyte and Seattle Genetics are great companies in their own right. Creating much-needed therapies for patients remains the backbone of their businesses. The two companies benefit from approved drugs providing attractive cash flow to support the additional promising R&D. Will either or both companies get acquired? Nobody knows for sure. However, the stock prices should be higher this time next year making them each a worthy investment opportunity today.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''.  These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand.  Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).  Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

This has been an outstanding year for biotech stocks, and 2020 could be even better thanks to a slate of bonafide life-savers that hit pharmacy shelves months ahead of schedule. The FDA approved dozens of drugs in 2019, but the agency rushed to greenlight these new cancer therapies much sooner than expected. Here's why they could be the industry's most successful product launches in 2020.Padcev (enfortumab vedotin-ejfv)Data source: U.S. Food and Drug Administration.In 2019, it cost $2.6 million to file a drug application with the FDA, and it still takes up to two months to learn whether the agency will begin reviewing that application. Once the review begins, the FDA provides an expected action date exactly 10 months later, or six months later for a shortened priority review.If the FDA's fees and timing seem ridiculous you should know that before electronic filing was available, new drug applications could fill an office from floor to ceiling. That's why it's always a good idea to pay attention to drugs the agency finds important enough to finish reviewing months ahead of schedule.Image source: Getty Images.In November, the FDA approved a new Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor called Brukinsa for patients with mantle cell lymphoma who have relapsed after standard first-line treatment.During trials leading to its approval, Brukinsa shrank tumors for 84% of lymphoma patients. Another BTK-inhibitor marketed by   and   called Imbruvica earned approval to treat the same group of patients in 2013 after shrinking tumors just 66% of the time. During the first nine months of 2019, J&J and AbbVie reported Imbruvica sales that reached a combined $5.9 billion. With an apparent advantage over Imbruvica, Brukinsa could begin adding 10-figure sums to Beigene's top line in a few short years.Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are mini-chemo bombs attached to proteins that recognize specific targets frequently found on cancer cells. Once reaching their target, ADCs deliver a lethal payload to cancerous cells while leaving healthy neighboring cells alone.ADCs nearly fell out of favor after some  clinical trial , but they're making a comeback. In December, the FDA approved a first-in-class Nectin-4-directed antibody called Padcev from Seattle Genetics.The antibody side of Padcev seeks out a new target, but it's attached to the same chemotherapy used in the first ADC from Seattle Genetics, Adcetris. Padcev's approved to treat bladder cancer patients who have relapsed following treatment with Keytruda or similar therapies.During the pivotal study that led to its approval, Padcev shrank tumors for 44% of patients. Bladder cancer isn't the most common malignancy, but it claims the lives of around 17,000 Americans annually. With a new treatment option, though, this figure should fall significantly.Image source: Getty Images.Two days after greenlighting Padcev, the FDA approved another ADC from AstraZeneca, called Enhertu. The antibody in Enhertu is also the active ingredient in Herceptin, a targeted cancer drug approved in 1998 to treat breast cancer patients with HER2 positive tumors. During a pivotal trial leading to its approval, Enhertu shrank tumors for a surprising 60.3% of patients who had relapsed after at least two lines of therapy. Enhertu isn't for everyone, but it is aimed at a large patient group. In 2019, around 50,000 breast cancer patients will be diagnosed with HER2-positive tumors.If you're thinking about buying shares of any drugmakers, you could do a lot worse than Beigene, AstraZeneca, or Seattle Genetics. If I were to pick just one, though, it would probably be Beigene. You may remember that in 2017, Celgene acquired rights to Beigene's PD-1 inhibitor, tislelizumab and Beigene began marketing Celgene's cancer drugs in China. During the first nine months of 2019, sales of Celgene's products in Beigene's territory rose soared 78% from the previous-year period to $166 million.Earlier this year,  acquired Celgene and returned tislelizumab to Beigene. Not long after that,  agreed to purchase around $2.7 billion of Beigene shares in return for a hand in developing 20 new cancer drug candidates. Beigene will also market three Amgen products in China -- Xgeva, Kyprolis, and Blincyto.At recent prices, Beigene stock is trading at 23.6 times trailing sales, which is awfully high. With Brukinsa's U.S. launch under way, growing sales in China of products from Celgene and Amgen, and tislelizumab under review at the FDA, it's probably worth the risk.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"Investing in healthcare can be an excellent way for investors to diversify their portfolios and take a position in strong, stable markets that will continue to see demand for the foreseeable future. The two stocks listed below not only have a lot of long-term potential but have already delivered strong results this year with both of their share prices doubling, dwarfing the S&P 500's returns of 29% in 2019. was having a good year in 2019 with the stock up around 30% in September. Things really started to take off for Seattle Genetics when the company released results of its phase 1 clinical trial for EV-103, which is designed to treat patients with urothelial cancer, the most common type of bladder cancer. The company announced that ""the study met outcome measures for safety and exhibited encouraging clinical activity for this platinum-free combination in a first-line setting."" It's a good first step for the drug, but  is still very early on in a drug's testing and it is no guarantee that EV-103 will hit the market anytime soon. It could still be years before all the necessary testing is complete.The company got another boost in its share price in October when it announced positive results from a trial evaluating its tucatinib drug in treating patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. The drug was used with trastuzumab and capecitabine and showed encouraging results, so much so that the company announced it would submit a new drug application in early 2020. Image source: Getty Images.On Oct. 29 the company released its third-quarter results for 2019, which showed strong year-over-year sales growth of 26%. And although losses rose from $67.4 million last year to $91.9 million in Q3, given the company's progress in its drug trials in recent months, it's easy to see why investors haven't been discouraged by the results. There's a lot of potential for Seattle Genetics to rise even higher if the company continues to see progress from the development of its drugs.'s  stock has fallen in December, but the stock has still had an impressive year in 2019. Strong Q2 results in early August gave it a big  in price as it recorded a profit and raised its guidance for revenue for the remainder of the year. The medical device company's Omnipod Insulin Management System saw strong sales growth outside the U.S. with international Omnipod revenue rising 120% from the prior year. The stock also surged in November when it released strong Q3 results and again raised its guidance. And the company still has a lot of potential, as Insulet announced in December that patients in Europe will begin using the Omnipod Dash Insulin Management System. The new system ""provides up to three days of non-stop insulin delivery, without the need for daily injections and allows individuals to discreetly and intuitively manage their diabetes via a new touchscreen interface allowing for greater freedom and flexibility to focus on living life to the fullest."" The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the new system and it could provide people with diabetes a more discreet, convenient way of managing their insulin. Both Seattle Genetics and Insulet have significant growth potential over the long term. But neither stock is cheap today. Insulet trades at a massive 70 times its book value and 15 times sales; Seattle Genetics, meanwhile, trades at 11 times its book value and 24 times its top line. However, these numbers can change quickly as these companies continue to evolve and grow their top and bottom lines. From a risk standpoint, the safer  today is Insulet. Although it's pricey, given its growth and that its products are already generating strong results, it's much more of a sure thing. Seattle Genetics could produce stronger results than Insulet if its drugs are successful in further trials, but that's by no means a guarantee.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

he San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS) transformed over the past few years into one of the biggest venues for companies releasing data on . Breast cancer remains one of the most common forms of cancer globally. Thanks to many new treatment options over the past decade, long-term survival has grown dramatically.Among the many presentations on the docket at SABCS from Dec. 10 to 14, pivotal trial results stand out for 's  oral paclitaxel and '  tucatinib. Both companies have already heralded their trials as successes; this will be the first public airing of the details.Image source: Getty Images.Both Athenex and Seattle Genetics plan to submit applications for approval to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) during the first quarter of 2020. Their actions and specificity on timing indicate that both companies have a fairly high degree of confidence that they will succeed in securing the approvals.Paclitaxel, a backbone chemotherapy drug for decades, holds a storied past. Originally extracted from the bark of the Pacific yew tree by scientists at the National Cancer Institute, its rights passed to  , which pushed the drug through clinical development. Once on the market, Taxol, as it was commercially branded, became a blockbuster drug with sales in excess of $1 billion. The book  underscores its significance.Paclitaxel made the World Health Organization's Model List of Essential Medicines as a treatment for breast, lung, and ovarian cancers. Given paclitaxel's widespread use, companies like Athenex have tried to improve its delivery and reduce side effects. The most notable improvement to date is Abraxane, a nanoparticle delivery of paclitaxel, originally developed by Abraxis before Celgene acquired it; Abraxane now resides at Bristol-Myers Squibb, following .Abraxane cut the infusion time of standard paclitaxel from three hours to 30 minutes. It also eliminated the need to pretreat patients with steroids before the infusion. Those features, plus its ability to shrink tumors, paved the way for FDA approvals in multiple cancers. This week, Tecentriq, an immuno-oncology drug from  , gained approval as a treatment in first-line non-small cell lung cancer in combination with Abraxane and the chemotherapy drug carboplatin. I suspect that Abraxane'sfuture holds more regulatory approvals as part of a multidrug regimens.Now back to Athenex: The company's upcoming presentation will highlight the superiority of oral paclitaxel over the intravenous version, based on tumor shrinkage and survival in patients with metastatic breast cancer. Athenex also claims that the oral formulation produced less neuropathy, a side effect of paclitaxel, than the traditional IV version. Investors should focus on the improvement in survival and the side-effect profile.Elimination of the infusion, whether it's the 30 minutes for Abraxane or three hours for standard paclitaxel, could make a big difference in convenience for patients. An oral option could be viewed positively by patients and their oncologists.Investors should also be aware that a switch from IV to oral versions creates a change in reimbursement. Currently, the doctor's clinic buys the IV drug, administers the infusion, and then bills the insurance company. With an oral drug, the doctor writes a prescription which the patient then fills at a pharmacy. The patient may be subject to higher out-of-pocket payments, which could deter the use of the oral form. When drugs are too costly, patients often abandon prescriptions at the pharmacy or take fewer pills than prescribed.Image source: Getty Images.Seattle Genetics provided initial data on tucatinib's efficacy in its Oct. 21 press release. In combination with two other anti-cancer drugs, tucatinib proved superior at the primary and secondary endpoints to the two drugs without tucatinib.Tucatinib reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 46%. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival, the duration of time until a tumor starts growing again. On the secondary endpoint of overall survival, the addition of tucatinib reduced the risk of death by 34%.Importantly, tucatinib demonstrated a significant benefit for patients whose cancer had spread to their brains, an exceptionally challenging situation to treat. In those with brain metastases, the drug reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 52%.Safety-wise, patients tolerated tucatinib in combination with the two other cancer drugs. Increased diarrhea and elevated liver enzymes were the most common of the severe side effects but only occurred in a small percentage of patients. Healthcare investors will seek to get a clearer picture of safety at the SABCS presentation.Investors loved the initial data, causing  65% in the past three months. Since the share price is near its all-time highs, the stock could drop if the results underperform investor expectations. However, since data was provided in the October press release, this may be less of an issue.These two oral cancer drugs should provide interesting fodder at SABCS. The novel mechanism of Seattle Genetics' tucatinib provides greater upside potential for , especially based on the drug's activity in brain metastases. Meanwhile, oral paclitaxel provides a convenient new option that may be favored by patients and oncologists, but Athenex needs to actively address potential reimbursement roadblocks in order for the drug to gain commercial success.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

There are 12 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Seattle Genetics Inc, but the average is just that — a mathematical average.  There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $87.00.  And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $140.00.  The standard deviation is $15.669.


But the whole reason to look at the average SGEN price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes.  And so with SGEN crossing above that average target price of $112.42/share, investors in SGEN have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $112.42 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

It's the most common kind of bladder cancer, and develops in the cells lining the inside of the bladder. The approval is specifically for adult patients who have previously been treated with platinum-based chemotherapy and a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor. PD-1 and PD-L1 are proteins in the body, and in some cases, they help cancer cells hide from an immune system attack. Inhibitors prevent this from happening. As for Padcev, it targets the Nectin-4 protein and leads to the destruction of cancer cells.A key point in this approval news is that Padcev is the only FDA-approved drug for this patient set, meaning that it will be an obvious choice and welcome option for many. Seattle Genetics has said about 2,000 to 4,000 new patients per year may be candidates for Padcev, but CEO Clay Siegall said it's difficult to forecast an exact patient population. However, according to Grand View Research, the global urothelial cancer drug market will reach $3.6 billion by 2023, with a compound annual growth rate of 23%. In the U.S., about 80,000 new cases of bladder cancer are diagnosed per year, and about 90% of cases are of the urothelial type. So a foothold in this market is a definite growth opportunity for Seattle Genetics.Seattle Genetics aims to submit tucatinib, its investigational treatment for HER2-positive breast , to the FDA in the first quarter. That's a positive development, but even better is the fact that the FDA already granted tucatinib breakthrough status based on data from a phase 3 clinical trial. Tucatinib was administered along with 's Herceptin and another drug, and risk of death declined by 34%. The study also showed a 46% decline in risk of disease progression. HER2 stands for a protein -- human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. In HER2-positive breast cancer, high levels of this protein within tumors lead to the spread of cancer cells. Tucatinib inhibits enzymes that activate this type of protein.Breakthrough status is meant to expedite review and approval for treatments that address life-threatening illnesses, so if all goes well, Seattle Genetics could have a third drug on the market sooner rather than later. (The company also sells Adcetris for Hodgkin lymphoma.) The market for HER2-positive breast cancer is expected to increase by 54% from its 2015 level to $9.89 billion in 2025, according to GlobalData.Padcev and tucatinib both address conditions where the need for new treatments is obvious. Though Seattle Genetics' earnings history hasn't been great -- it missed its EPS forecasts in the past two quarters -- its recent product news offers investors reasons for optimism about revenue streams to come. A new drug on the market and high hopes for another approval are catalysts that should help its share price make healthy gains in the new year.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Retirement savers received a big let down from the IRS recently. While the tax agency did raise the annual contribution limits on 401ks by $500, it left the amount of cash you can stuff into an IRA —  — the same. This is now the second straight year at those contribution caps. That means anyone contributing to an IRA needs to make the most out of each contribution.Luckily, there are several exchange traded funds (ETFs) that can do just that.The best ETFs for IRAs and Roth IRAs are those that feature plenty of long-term growth and opportunity. The tax-deferred or tax-free nature of IRAs allow for decades of compounding potential. The best ETFs track market segments and themes that deliver on those lines. Just contribute, click “buy” and walk away for 20 to 30 years. It’s here that investors can make the most out of the flat-lining contribution caps for IRAs and grow their capital over the long haul.But with more than 1,750 different exchange traded funds now on the market, how do you know which could be the best ETFs to stuff in your IRA? Fortunately for you, InvestorPlace has done some of the leg work.With that, here are five of the best ETFs for your IRA.   XT tracks an index of the firms operating in the latest in innovation. We’re talking cloud computing, 3D printing, Internet of Things (IoT), bioinformatics, etc. It’s all in there. The beauty is that the ETF doesn’t just focus on traditional tech stocks. In fact,  is in tech companies. The rest spans everything from financials to industrial names. Top holdings include  (NASDAQ:) and  (NASDAQ:).This broad mandate and focus on high-innovation is a wonderful long-term theme. Some of these ideas will take a while before becoming mainstream and are still in their infancy. So, the ETF is designed to be a long-term growth engine of a portfolio. Why pay taxes on the long-term gains along the way? XT in an IRA just makes sense.And it’s done pretty well on that front already. Since its inception in 2015, XT has managed to produce an average yearly 11% return.With low expenses of just 0.47%, or $47 per $10,000 invested, XT is one of the best ETFs to hold in an IRA.   VBR tracks the performance of the  This benchmark owns the cheapest small-cap stocks in the U.S. The ETF currently owns nearly 860 different stocks. That’s just under half of the entire small-cap universe. This concentration allows for investors to tap into the full potential of the small-cap value out-performance phenomenon.And outperform it has. Over the last decade, VBR has managed to produce a staggering 11.57% annual return. Meanwhile, the ETF also throws off some impressive yield- currently at 2.25%. These sorts of high, long-term returns just beg to be placed inside a tax-deferred/free vehicle. And given the recent shift back to value stocks, VBR’s long-term success is almost assured. Even better is as a Vanguard ETF, VBR is dirt cheap to own at just 0.07%.All in all, small-cap value has been one of the best places to find growth and VBR could be one of the best ETFs tracking that theme.   One of the oldest and elder statesmen funds in the sector is the  (NYSEArca:).The U.S.-focused ETF tracks a basket of stocks that are  That’s actually a pretty mandate and includes the obvious solar panel producers like FSLR. However, PBW includes other stocks that operate in the clean energy realm such as construction firm  (NASDAQ: ), who specializes in erecting wind turbines and transmission lines, as well as  (NASDAQ:), who makes smart-meters. This makes PBW a very broad play on the renewable energy theme and its overall growth.As for realizing that growth, returns for PBW have been spotty. But that just underscores the long-term nature and risk of renewable energy. With adoption growing, long-term investors may finally realize the potential. With that PBW could be one of the best ETFs to buy in your IRA and forget about for a while.   The truth is, we kind of can do that via  (NYSEArca:).FM focuses on . These are “emerging” emerging markets and are nations just in their beginnings of economic expansion and growth. We’re talking about countries like Kenya, Vietnam, and Romania. These nations feature plenty of risk, but also plenty of reward as they start to transform. The beauty of using FM and why its one of the best ETFs is that it allows Regular Joes access to these stocks. It’s pretty much impossible for you or I to buy stocks on the Kuwait Stock Exchange. But with FM, it’s one-ticker access.And the ETF does belong in your IRA as this is not an overnight theme. It’s going to take some real time for many of these nations to move up the economic ladder. That means buying shares and ignoring them for a bit in order for the theme to take off.Perhaps the only drag is the FM is expensive at 0.81%. However, considering what it owns, the cost is justified.   The  (NYSEArca:) could be a wonderful way to get your exposure. SCHH tracks the bread-and-butter  With the ETFs 98 different holdings, investors get access to apartment owners, office buildings, shopping centers and even warehouses. Better still is that the index focuses on the top real estate owners in their respective categories. This provides plenty of stability, size and cash flows.SCHH has had plenty of returns as well. Since its inception in 2011, the ETF has managed to produce a great 10.31% annual total return. This just underscores REITs ability to produce gains over the long haul. By placing them in your IRA, investors can get maximum compounding potential with the tax headaches.And with low expenses of just 0.07%, SCHH could be the best ETF to do just that.At the time of writing, Aaron Levitt held a long position in XT.The post  appeared first on .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Stuff Your IRA With the Best ETFs & Forget About ‘Em@2019-11-18@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/stuff-your-ira-with-the-best-etfs-forget-about-em-2019-11-18

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''.  These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand.  Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).  Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

"ealthcare is huge. In 2017, healthcare spending in the U.S. totaled $3.5 trillion -- nearly 18% of the country's , which is the total market value of all products and services produced. Worldwide healthcare spending topped $7.7 billion. By 2022, global healthcare spending will reach at least $10 trillion, according to professional services firm Deloitte.Where there's a lot of money being spent, there are opportunities for investors. While one option is to buy individual healthcare , many investors might prefer going with healthcare-focused , which let you buy a basket of stocks with one transaction. But you don't want to buy just any healthcare ETF. Here's what you need to know about the top healthcare ETFs and why investing in them is something you should consider.Image source: Getty Images.Probably the most important trend fueling growth in healthcare is the aging of populations across the world. In the U.S., around 10,000 baby boomers turn 65 every day. By 2030, all of the 61 million American baby boomers will be at least 65 years old. By 2034, Americans 65 and older will outnumber those under 18 for the first time in U.S. history, according to projections from the U.S. Census Bureau. In Europe, 1 out of every 4 residents already is at least 60 years old. Lower birth rates in Europe mean that populations will age even more rapidly than in the U.S. It's a similar story in Asia, with a United Nations report finding that ""all countries in Asia and the Pacific are in the process of aging at an unprecedented pace.""As people age, they're more likely to require healthcare services. And as demand rises, companies that provide products and services to address healthcare issues for aging populations should benefit.In addition, significant advances are being made in healthcare and new technology is likely to generate tremendous growth for pioneering companies.For example, drugmakers are developing new approaches that could revolutionize how diseases are treated. The use of personalized medicine, where individuals' genetic information is used to determine the appropriate therapy, is picking up momentum. This is especially true in cancer treatment, where  are in clinical testing, with several immunotherapies already on the market. Biotechs and pharmaceutical companies are even using  to cure rare genetic diseases that in the past had no effective treatment available.Diagnostics companies are developing ways to detect cancer at early stages using  that identify fragments of DNA that have broken off from tumors and made their way into patients' blood. Medical device companies are launching new devices that use , robotics, and other advanced technology to improve the delivery of healthcare services.There's also a major focus among healthcare companies to provide products and services that help control the rising costs that are associated with higher demand. The use of  -- the delivery of healthcare services remotely using technology, especially the internet -- is being adopted more widely. Surgical robots are being used to perform minimally invasive surgeries that in the past required much more complicated and risky procedures. Technology to monitor patients with chronic conditions and alert healthcare professionals when issues arise is helping reduce expensive hospital visits.Rapidly growing demand fueled by aging populations across the world. Amazing new innovations that are revolutionizing patient care. It's no wonder that healthcare is a hot area for investors.There's one big reason why using an ETF to invest in healthcare is a great idea: It provides  across lots of individual healthcare stocks. Each of the top five healthcare ETFs holds positions in at least 57 stocks, with three of the ETFs holding more than 100 stocks. This diversification across multiple stocks lowers the amount of risk taken by investors. If only a small number of individual stocks drop significantly, the rest of the stocks owned by the ETF can offset those declines. Because the healthcare sector is so broad in scope, all healthcare stocks don't necessarily move in the same direction all of the time. For example, regulations specific to medical device makers could hurt medical device stocks but not impact pharmaceutical stocks at all. Using ETFs also enables investors to target specific industries within healthcare. For example, some healthcare ETFs focus only on  or  rather than the entire healthcare sector. Of course, you do lose some of the benefits of diversification by investing in these industry-specific ETFs. So now that you know that ETFs offer the advantage of investing in a wide range of stocks in one fell swoop, let's look at which healthcare ETFs are especially popular. An important metric for healthcare ETFs is their assets under management. This refers to the total market value (how much a stock or other holding can be sold for) of all the financial assets that the ETF manages on behalf of its clients. The larger the assets under management, the more money investors have poured into the ETF, which reflects a broad level of confidence in the ETF. The five top healthcare ETFs -- as measured by assets under management -- are: Data sources: Fund companies. All data as of Oct. 17, 2019. The Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund is managed by  Global Advisors. This ETF attempts to track the performance of the Health Care Select Sector Index, which includes all of the stocks in the healthcare sector that are listed in the broader .The ETF provides exposure for investors to stocks in multiple healthcare industries, including biotechnology, healthcare equipment and supplies, healthcare providers and services, healthcare technology, life sciences tools and services, and pharmaceuticals. The top holdings of the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund in terms of market value as of October 2019 include , , , , , , , , , and .  Since its inception in 1998, the Health Care Select SPDR Fund has delivered an average annual return of 8.07%. Over the last three years and five years, the ETF has provided average annual returns of 9.44% and 8.92%, respectively.Many of the stocks held by the Health Care Select SPDR Fund pay dividends. As a result, the ETF offers an attractive  (annual dividend payments expressed as a percentage of the ETF's net asset value per share over the last 12 months) of 1.62%. This dividend yield more than offsets the ETF's low expense ratio (the fund's operating expenses divided by the average total dollar value of its managed assets) of 0.13%. ETFs deduct these expense ratios from investors' accounts.  Vanguard pioneered the use of ETFs. The company's biggest healthcare ETF in terms of assets under management is the Vanguard Health Care Index Fund ETF, which tracks the performance of the MSCI U.S. Investable Market Index (IMI)/Health Care 25/50. This benchmark index consists of stocks of large, midsize, and small U.S. healthcare companies based on  (the total dollar value of a company's shares).  The Vanguard Health Care Index Fund ETF primarily holds positions in the stocks of companies that provide medical or healthcare products, services, technology, or equipment. Like the Health Care Select SPDR Fund, the ETF's largest holdings as of October 2019 are Johnson & Johnson, UnitedHealth Group, Merck, Pfizer, Abbott Labs, Medtronic, Amgen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, AbbVie, and Eli Lilly. This healthcare ETF has generated an average annual return of 9.47% since its launch in 2004. It has delivered average annual returns of 9.78% and 9.2% over the last three years and five years, respectively.The Vanguard Health Care Index Fund ETF currently offers a dividend yield of 2.1%. Its expense ratio of 0.10% ranks as one of the lowest among all ETFs.The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF is managed by . This ETF attempts to track the performance of the  Biotechnology Index, which consists of U.S. biotechnology and pharmaceutical stocks that are listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange.As its name indicates, the ETF focuses mainly on biotech stocks. Its largest holdings as of October 2019 include Amgen, , , , , , , , , and .Since its launch in 2001, the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF has provided investors an average annual return of 6.2%. Over the last three years, the ETF has delivered an average annual return of 1.29%. The average annual return over the last five years was 1.97%.Most biotech stocks don't pay dividends. It's not surprising, therefore, that the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF's dividend yield of 0.27% is much lower than the yields offered by ETFs that target the broader healthcare sector. The ETF's expense ratio of 0.47% is also higher than the ETFs that own holdings in more stocks across the healthcare spectrum.BlackRock also manages the iShares U.S. Medical Devices ETF. This ETF attempts to track the performance of the Dow Jones U.S. Select Medical Equipment Index, which includes selected medical equipment stocks.The iShares U.S. Medical Devices ETF focuses only on stocks of companies that derive all or a significant portion of their total revenue by selling medical devices. The ETF's largest holdings as of October 2019 include Abbott Labs, Medtronic, Thermo Fisher Scientific, , , , , , , and .BlackRock launched the iShares U.S. Medical Devices ETF in 2006. Since then, the ETF has delivered an average annual return of 13.17%. Over the last three years and five years, it has provided annual average returns of 19.83% and 20.71%, respectively.This ETF's dividend yield currently stands at 0.3%. That level is nearly enough to cover the ETF's expense ratio of 0.43%.State Street's SPDR S&P Biotech ETF attempts to track the performance of the biotechnology segment of the S&P Total Market Index, which tracks the broader U.S. equity market.While the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF and the SPDR S&P Biotech ETF both focus on biotech stocks, their top holdings are very different. The SPDR S&P Biotech ETF includes larger positions in small and midsize biotechs than the iShares ETF does. The largest holdings of the SPDR S&P Biotech ETF as of October 2019 are Seattle Genetics, , , , Regeneron, AbbVie, Amgen, Celgene, Incyte, and .Since the inception of the SPDR S&P Biotech ETF in 2006, the ETF has generated an average annual return of 12.21%. Over the last three years, the ETF's average annual return was 4.96%. It delivered an average annual return of 8.33% over the last five years.You might think that an ETF with a lot of relatively smaller biotech stocks among its holdings would have a low dividend yield -- and you'd be right. The SPDR S&P Biotech ETF's dividend yield of 0.02% is the lowest of these five top healthcare ETFs. The ETF's expense ratio of 0.35% is in the middle of the pack for the top healthcare ETFs.One key reason to consider investing in these five healthcare ETFs is that they claim strong  (the average of how many shares are bought and sold over a given period). This means that there is plenty of , a term that refers to how quickly an asset can be bought or sold without affecting its price. You want high-liquidity investments in case you need to sell in a hurry.And while your eyes might have glossed over reading about the expense ratios, they're important. The lower expense ratios for these ETFs boost investment returns over time.Should you just buy the healthcare ETF with the highest lifetime return? Nope. For one thing, future returns might not correlate with past returns. Also, these ETFs have different approaches. If you don't want to focus only on medical device stocks, you wouldn't want to go with the iShares U.S. Medical Devices ETF even though it claims the highest lifetime return.Although buying a healthcare ETF reduces the risks for investors by diversifying across multiple stocks, there are still a number of key risks for these ETFs. Several, for example, have relatively large positions in certain stocks. If these stocks decline, they could cause the ETF to fall as well.  Abbott Labs makes up 13.53% of the total holdings of the iShares U.S. Medical Devices ETF. Johnson & Johnson makes up 10.14% and 8.6% of the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund and the Vanguard Health Care ETF, respectively. Over 9% of the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF is held in Amgen stock.These heavy weightings make these ETFs especially susceptible to risks that could impact these stocks. Abbott Labs' growth prospects could be hurt if it fails to win U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for its next version of the Freestyle Libre continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system. Johnson & Johnson and Amgen face competition from  and generic rivals, which could negatively affect the companies' growth prospects. The good news, though, is that ETFs adjust their holdings as they see the need to do so. An ETF that suffers over the short term due to a large position in a stock that doesn't perform well can still be a winner over the long term.All of the top five healthcare ETFs could also experience significant declines as a result of major changes to the U.S. healthcare system. Biotechs and pharmaceutical stocks could feel the brunt of potential reforms to how drug prices are set, which could pull down all of the ETFs except the iShares U.S. Medical Devices ETF.But this ETF isn't immune from the negative effects of potential U.S. healthcare system changes. There is significant political support for a single-payer healthcare system in the U.S. It's possible that  -- and weigh on healthcare ETFs as well -- if considerable progress is made toward implementing such a system.Healthcare ETFs can withstand overall economic downturns better than many stocks since healthcare products and services usually are needed regardless of what's going on with the economy, however, that doesn't mean that they can't fall during a recession or broader market pullback.In 2008, for example, each of these five healthcare ETFs dropped by double-digit percentages at one point during the toughest part of the financial crisis. Two of these ETFs -- the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF and the SPDR S&P Biotech ETF -- ended down for the year and underperformed the broader S&P 500. Despite these risks, the positives should outweigh the negatives for healthcare ETFs. The aging demographic trends discussed earlier will almost certainly drive higher demand for healthcare products and services over the long run.While some companies might not fare as well as others, the indexes tracked by these ETFs follow the rules of survival of the fittest. If individual stocks underperform too much, they'll be replaced in the indexes (and in the ETFs' holdings) by better-performing stocks.It's not a bad idea to invest in healthcare stocks that appear to be in the best position to succeed over the long run. But for investors who either don't want to do the research required to pick individual stocks or who prefer the lower risk resulting from diversification, healthcare ETFs are a great option. When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

hina spent $137 billion on healthcare in 2018 and could spend up to $170 billion annually by 2023. Two exciting ,   and  , allow investors an opportunity to get in on the action while it's still early.And why wouldn't you? Both companies have products already on the market, they have new drugs awaiting approval from Chinese regulators, and they're investing in promising R&D. Add in a multitude of pharmaceutical and biotech partnerships and well-known institutional investors, and everyday investors get an opportunity to invest alongside some of the most prominent names in the industry.Image source: Getty Images.If you're unsure about biotech, China, or the combination, it might help to start with a company that's already drawn interest from two of the best-known biotechs in the world. BeiGene recently sold one-fifth of its outstanding stock to   after a handful of years working with  .Let's start with the Amgen news. On Oct. 31, Amgen announced its purchase of 20.5% of BeiGene's stock for $2.7 billion, a 26% premium to the market price. Investors liked the deal, propelling the stock upwards by 33% that day.BeiGene will begin selling three cancer drugs belonging to Amgen: Xgeva, Kyprolis, and Blincyto. The Chinese rights will revert to Amgen after five, seven, or 12 years, depending on the drug. BeiGene also gains rights to 20 early stage drug candidates from Amgen.BeiGene's work with Celgene takes a little explaining, but you'll see why it has us excited.BeiGene transformed from a cancer research and development shop to a fully integrated pharmaceutical company through a 2017 strategic transaction with Celgene. As part of the arrangement, BeiGene acquired Celgene's commercial operations in China along with the rights to sell the cancer drugs Abraxane, Revlimid, and Vidaza. made a hefty $263 million up-front payment and a $150 million investment into BeiGene. In return, it acquired the worldwide rights outside of Asia for BGB-A317, BeiGene's promising PD-1 inhibitor. This class of drug, called a checkpoint inhibitor, binds to cancer cells, resulting in the immune system boosting its attack on the cancer.Touted as a potential best-in-class PD-1 inhibitor, BGB-A317 competes in a crowded field led by Keytruda from   and Opdivo by  . Keytruda produced an astonishing $3.1 billion in sales in the third quarter of 2019; Opdivo trailed in second place with more than $1.8 billion in third-quarter sales. This class of drugs is becoming the new standard of care for many types of cancer.Now for the twist. Because Bristol-Myers is acquiring Celgene and already has a PD-1 inhibitor with Opdivo, Celgene had to return BGB-A317 to BeiGene this summer. Even more painful, Celgene shelled out an additional $150 million to BeiGene as an early termination fee.That's good news for BeiGene. Chinese regulators are currently reviewing applications for approval of BGB-A317 in the first two cancer indications. In parallel, BeiGene submitted applications in China and the United States for its targeted cancer therapy zanubrutinib.Zanubrutinib inhibits Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), an important mediator in blood cancers including certain types of lymphomas and leukemias. Imbruvica, the first approved BTK inhibitor, generated over $2 billion in third-quarter revenue between its marketing partners  and . In addition to Imbruvica, BeiGene will battle for market share with Calquence by  .BeiGene's pipeline runs deep. Positioning itself as China's leading developer, manufacturer, and marketer of targeted cancer drugs, BeiGene convinced , , , , and private companies BioAlta and Ambrx to hand over rights to their drugs in China (and in many cases, other countries).By the way, BeiGene chalked up another R&D pact with a notable biotech on Nov. 5 — this time, Beigene secured the Asian rights excluding Japan for a pre-clinical cancer drug from  . Another China-focused biotech worth investors' time is Zai Lab, a Shanghai-based developer of treatments for cancer, autoimmune diseases, and infectious diseases. This emerging biotech has garnered its first product approvals and awaits regulatory sign-off in larger markets.Zai Lab is awaiting the approval in China of its ovarian cancer drug Zejula, which is partnered with  . AstraZeneca's competing drug Lynparza received approval in 2018, giving it a healthy head start to gain market share.Zai Lab's second product, Optune, hails from U.K.-based   and was launched in the Hong Kong market. The Optune device shoots targeted electric signals into the brain to fight glioblastoma, a lethal stage-IV brain cancer. Clinical trials demonstrated that wearing the device for more hours each day correlated with months of survival benefit.Image source: Getty Images.Beyond Zejula and Optune, Zai Lab created an oncology pipeline through licensing transactions, including  from , ripretinib from , brivanib from Bristol-Myers Squibb, and bemarituzumab from . Additionally, Zai Lab in-licensed the antibiotic omadacycline from .All but two of the pipeline candidates are in phase 3 trials in China; several have multiple phase 3 trials under way. This means that Zai Lab should have lots of news and catalysts in the near term and midterm to help drive the company's growth. Additional partnering deals may also positively impact the stock price.Both Fidelity and venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins backed Zai Lab early on, providing essential capital and credibility. Zai Lab looks like an emerging story to watch. While earlier-stage than BeiGene, Zai Lab has the potential for great stock appreciation as its sales begin to ramp up, and its pipeline drugs emerge successfully from phase 3 clinical trials.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

he past six months have been rough for investors and the management team at  . The  nearly 40% from its high north of $24 in April to its recent range of $15. Today, however, sentiment appears to be shifting in Exelixis' favor.While the stock looked weak, the business remains strong. The latest earnings report irked some investors, since the net product revenue came in just under analyst expectations. Some fear that competition from big pharma competitors   and   might be creating tough headwinds for Cabometyx (Cabo), Exelixis' leading drug.Source: Getty Images.Let's review the numbers. Exelixis earned $271.7 million in revenues in the third quarter, with the Cabo franchise responsible for 70%, or $191.8 million. That represents revenue growth of 17.7% from the prior year. Not too shabby. An additional $79.9 million came from collaboration revenues. In particular, the European company  paid Exelixis a $50 million milestone because it attained $250 million in net sales of Cabo over four consecutive quarters. Exelixis granted Ipsen exclusive rights to Cabo outside of the U.S., Canada, and Japan in 2016.Here's another positive sign. For the first time ever, global sales of Cabo exceeded $1 billion over four consecutive quarters. While approved in 49 countries, it is currently only commercially available in 34. That means further revenues when Cabo launches in those additional 15 countries. Exelixis earns a healthy 22% royalty on sales by Ipsen.In January 2019, Cabo received its third approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Cabo was initially approved as a treatment for thyroid and kidney cancers, and the new approval added hepatocellular carcinoma, the most common form of liver cancer. It will take some time to ramp up sales in the U.S. for a large indication like liver cancer.Cabo scored more approvals in October and November in Canada. Regulators approved the drug for use in kidney cancer patients that have not received any prior drugs. Cabo had been approved to treat kidney cancers but only after patients received a certain type of prior therapy. In November, liver cancer joined the list of cancers to be treated with Cabo. Broadly speaking, expanding the pool of eligible patients should translate into revenue growth.Beyond Cabo, investors can look to Exelixis' collaborations for additional revenue. A 2006 pact with Japanese pharma  has only just begun to bear fruit. The licensed drug esaxerenone gained approval in Japan in January as a treatment for hypertension, which triggered a $20 million milestone payment to Exelixis.On Nov. 7, Daiichi announced positive phase 3 pivotal trial results with esaxerenone as a treatment for diabetic nephropathy. Highlighted during the American Society of Nephrology's Kidney Week annual meeting, the results confirmed the activity and safety seen in a previous phase 3 trial. Daiichi claims that roughly half of all type 2 diabetic patients suffer from nephropathy, and it is the leading cause of dialysis in Japan.Exelixis entered into another partnership back in 2006. Genentech, part of  , stepped up to develop cobimetinib in combination with one of its own drugs for advanced melanomas with specific mutations. The drug is approved and on the market in the U.S., Europe, and some other countries. The year-to-date revenues of nearly $8 million are nice but don't really move the needle.Investors should keep an eye on the emerging pipeline. Exelixis entered into deals in May and July with  and , respectively.The Iconic option arrangement gives Exelixis the ability to take over development of ICON-2, Iconic's lead antibody-drug conjugate or ADC, following achievement of certain milestones. ADCs combine potent anticancer payloads attached to antibodies specifically designed to home in on a specific cancer target.   and Genentech brought the first ADCs to market, proving this smart-bomb approach works.   should file for  before the year-end.The broad Aurigene transaction provides options to acquire up to six different programs focused on cancer and inflammation. Details on the programs have been scant to date. Investors should note that Exelixis' outlay for these deals is quite low. This prudent approach allows Exelixis to delay incurring more substantial development expenses until more information is known about the compounds.Exelixis has a lot of good things going for it: growing global revenues, expanding drug approvals, more than $1 billion in cash on the balance sheet, and an interesting, albeit early, pipeline. I first liked Exelixis' stock when it dipped below $20. Now in the $15 to 16 range, it appears even more tempting.

Shares of   gained over 25% last month, according to data provided by . The company  from the HER2CLIMB clinical trial evaluating a combination therapy involving tucatinib, its lead drug candidate, to treat advanced breast cancer.Patients taking the combination of tucatinib, trastuzumab, and capecitabine demonstrated a 46% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death compared to those taking trastuzumab and capecitabine alone. The study also met two key secondary endpoints, which bolsters the case for approving tucatinib. Seattle Genetics plans to submit a new drug application (NDA) in the first quarter of 2020. Image source: Getty Images.Tucatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that blocks the activity of HER2, a growth factor that is often overexpressed in breast cancer and other malignancies and causes tumors to grow uncontrollably. In addition to achieving a significant improvement in progression-free survival compared to the standard of care, the tucatinib arm of the study delivered a 34% reduction in the risk of death overall and a 52% decrease in the risk of disease progression or death in individuals with cancer that had spread to the brain.The results were much better than many analysts had expected, which caused many to raise their peak sales estimates for the drug. After initially expecting a relatively paltry $250 million in peak annual sales, many on Wall Street have increased their expectations closer to $750 million or higher. Seattle Genetics is suddenly buzzing with activity and optimism after a lackluster past three years in which the  underperformed the .

"Image source: The Motley Fool. Q3 2019 , Good day, and welcome to the Seattle Genetics Third quarter 2019 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Peggy Pinkston, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma'am, please go ahead. -- Thank you, operator, and good afternoon everyone. I'd like to welcome all of you to Seattle Genetics Third Quarter 2019 conference call. With me today, are Clay Siegall, President and Chief Executive Officer; Robin Taylor, Chief Commercial Officer; Todd Simpson, Chief Financial Officer; and Roger Dansey, Chief Medical Officer.Accompanying today's conference call are supporting slides, which are available on our website in the Investors section, Events and Presentations page.Following our prepared remarks today, we'll open the line for questions. We ask that you limit yourself to one to two questions to ensure we're able to get to everybody during our call today.Today's conference call will include forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial and operating performance of the Company, such as those among others relating to the Company's 2019 financial outlook, including anticipated 2019 ADCETRIS sales and future revenues, cost and expenses, and the Company's anticipated timing to achieve potential future clinical and regulatory milestones, including data readouts, regulatory submissions and approvals.Actual results or developments may differ materially from those projected or implied in these forward-looking statements. Among the factors that may cause such a difference includes the difficulty in forecasting sales, revenues and expenses, and the uncertainty associated with the pharmaceutical development and regulatory approval process.More information about the risks and uncertainties faced by Seattle Genetics is contained under the caption Risk Factors included in the Company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission including the Company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2019.And with that, I'll turn the call over to Clay. -- Thanks, Peg and good afternoon, everyone. Seattle Genetics has reached a transformational point in it's history. We are poised to bring multiple targeted therapies to cancer patients in need. Our progress is evidenced by significant milestones across our oncology portfolio, including several in only the past few months.First, ADCETRIS is a leading lymphoma brand that continues to grow with record revenues of $462 million year-to-date up 34% in the first 9 months of 2018. Under our collaboration with Takeda, ADCETRIS is on pace to exceed $1 billion in global sales in 2019. In addition, ADCETRIS remains the focus of a substantial clinical development program. At ASH in December 10 abstracts will feature ADCETRIS in Hodgkin and T-cell lymphomas including the 40-year follow-up from the ECHELON-1 trial in frontline Hodgkin lymphoma.Next, in our late-stage pipeline is Enfortumab vedotin or EV which we're developing in collaboration with Astellas. During the quarter, we submitted the BLA for EV in previously treated metastatic urothelial cancer patients and it was filed by the FDA with priority review, with an action date of March 15th, 2020. If approved, EV would be our second marketed product and expand our commercial portfolio into solid tumors. Our EV US sales force is in place and we are looking forward to bringing this drug to patients in need.In parallel, we and Astellas are advancing a robust clinical development program for EV across the spectrum of urothelial cancer, including a planned Phase III trial in first-line metastatic patients. Roger will provide more detail about the impressive data presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology Conference and our development plans for EV.Our next late-stage clinical program is Tucatinib. Last week, we reported exciting results from our HER2CLIMB pivotal trial of Tucatinib in metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer, including patients with brain metastasis. Trial was a success and achieved its primary and two key secondary endpoints. Full results will be presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in December. The data further support Tucatinib as a potential best-in-class HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Our team is already preparing the NDA which we plan to submit to the FDA in the first quarter of 2020.This would put Tucatinib in line to become our third marketed product. HER2CLIMB data also support our continued investment in the Tucatinib clinical development program in earlier lines of HER2 positive breast cancer and in other solid tumors such as colon cancer. Tisotumab Vedotin or TV is a late-stage program we are developing in collaboration with Genmab. Our initial focus is in recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer. We expect to report top line data from the TV pivotal trial called Innova 204 in the first half of 2020.Lastly, investing in our early stage pipeline is a key part of our strategy for future growth. We are advancing multiple programs in ongoing clinical trials including ladiratuzumab vedotin or LV. We plan to report initial data at SABCS from it's ongoing clinical trial of LV, plus pembrolizumab in triple negative breast cancer patients. We will continue to advance innovative new product candidates into clinical trials including ADCs and other targeted therapies with several of these planned in 2020.At this point, I'll turn the call over to Robin to discuss our commercial activities. Then Todd will comment on our financial results and 2019 guidance. After that, Roger will discuss our clinical development activities. Robin? -- Thanks, Clay. ADCETRIS net sales in the US and Canada were $167.6 million in the third quarter, an increase of 32% compared to the same quarter in 2018, at an increase of 5% over the second quarter of 2019. Continuing growth in Q3 reflected an increase in the overall share of frontline PTCL patients treated with ADCETRIS and sustained share in frontline Hodgkin lymphoma.The PTCL growth was highest among newly diagnosed ALCL patients with a significant majority receiving ADCETRIS. Our sales organization is focused on continuing to promote ADCETRIS under it's broad label that now includes six indications. They are also emphasizing the 3-year PFS data from the ECHELON-1 trial in order to continue to shift adoption for advanced stage Hodgkin lymphoma patients. The data showed that with extended follow-ups, the PFS benefit was maintained with ADCETRIS plus AVD. We're narrowing our 2019 ADCETRIS sales guidance to $625 million to $640 million.Now I would like to transition to Enfortumab vedotin. We are encouraged by the positive reaction from investigators and key opinion leaders to the EV-201 data that was presented at ASCO. There is significant unmet need in metastatic urothelial cancer, post platinum chemotherapy and PD-1 or PD-L1 therapy and we look forward to providing a new option for patients.We are actively preparing for the potential approval and commercial launch of EV. EV sales team is fully on board and in the final pace of training to ensure that we are ready to launch upon FDA approval. Our sales organization was hired from 18 different companies in addition to Seattle Genetics and has an average of 14 years oncology experience. Our team is also actively engaging with key payers to provide them with information that will help them plan and budget for future coverage and to a reimbursement decision related to EV. We are working in close collaboration with our partner Astellas to ensure the joint commercial team is launch ready.Moving onto Tucatinib, the commercial team is excited by the results from HER2CLIMB. We have been preparing launch plans in anticipation of the data that we announced last week. Hiring of the US sales leadership team has already been initiated with a focus on deep expertise in the breast cancer space. I'm confident that we will have a highly experienced Tucatinib sales force in place in advance of approval.In summary, ADCETRIS is the mainstay of our business and we continue to focus on expanding our newer indications of frontline Hodgkin lymphoma and PTCL. We look forward to potential approvals and launches of EV and Tucatinib and to making a difference in the lives of cancer patients.Now, I'll turn over the call to Todd. -- Great. Thanks, Robin and thanks to everyone for joining us on the call this afternoon. Today, I'll summarize our financial results for the third quarter and year-to-date and provide a few updates to our financial outlook for the year. Total revenues were $213 million in the third quarter of 2019 and $627 million for the year-to-date. This included record ADCETRIS net sales in the US and Canada of $168 million in the third quarter and $462 million for the year-to-date.Royalty revenues in the third quarter of this year increased to $27 million, compared to $23 million in the third quarter of 2018. For the first 9 months of 2019, royalty revenues were $66 million, compared to $59 million for the same period last year. Royalty revenues primarily reflect ADCETRIS sales by Takeda and to a lesser extent sales of Polivy under our collaboration with Roche.Collaboration revenues were $18 million in the third quarter and $99 million for the first 9 months of 2019. This included the earned portion of $43 million in milestones achieved earlier this year, most notably triggered by Takeda's approvals of ADCETRIS in frontline Hodgkin lymphoma and the recent approval of Polivy.R&D expenses were $196 million in the third quarter of 2019 and $518 million for the year-to-date. Growth over 2018 reflects higher investment across our pipeline, primarily on our late-stage programs Tucatinib EV and TV, as well as the upfront cost of a pre-clinical asset that we acquired in the third quarter. SG&A expenses were $96 million in the third quarter of 2019 and $259 million in the first 9 months of the year.These are both increases over 2018 and reflect commercial efforts to support ADCETRIS in frontline Hodgkin lymphoma and PTCL, launch preparation activities for EV and costs related to supporting our other late-stage pipeline programs. We ended the third quarter with $870 million in cash and investments, which includes net proceeds of $549 million from our July common stock offering.In addition, we hold approximately $102 million in Immunomedics common stock. These shares are mark-to-market and contributed to a small investment loss for the quarter and year-to-date this year, that created some variability in results in 2018.Lastly, I want to highlight four updates to our financial outlook. On revenues, we are narrowing our ADCETRIS net sales guidance to a range of $625 million to $640 million. In addition, based on strong sales by Takeda, we are increasing our expectations for royalty revenues to a range of $90 million to $95 million. On expenses, we are updating our R&D expense guidance to a range of $690 million to $715 million. This reflects the technology acquisition that I referred to earlier, as well as development activities for EV and Tucatinib.And lastly, following the positive HER2CLIMB results last week, we expect to initiate several launch preparation activities this year for Tucatinib. As a result, we are increasing our SG&A expense guidance to a range of $355 million to $370 million. We plan to provide our 2020 financial guidance on our next quarter call.Now, I'll turn the call over to Roger. -- Thanks, Todd and good afternoon everyone. The past few months have been remarkably productive. This afternoon I will recap key outcomes and activities in our late-stage programs and highlight our development plans going forward to maximize the potential of these program for patients in need. I'll begin with Enfortumab vedotin. Positive data from the pivotal EV-201 trial in metastatic urothelial cancer patients who received prior platinum chemotherapy and PD-1 or PD-L1 treatment were presented at ASCO and published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. The data supported our Biologics License Application that was submitted to the FDA in July and was accepted for filing by FDA in September with a PDUFA date of March 15, 2020.We and our partners at Astellas are actively engaged with FDA in support of the application. As a reminder, in the previously received Breakthrough Therapy designation from the FDA in this patient population. Beyond our initial registration pathway, our development plan are evaluating EV in the first-line metastatic setting, as well as in earlier stages of the disease. This is supported by initial results from the Phase 1 EV-103 trial presented at ESMO in September, where we reported data from 45 metastatic urothelial cancer patients who were previously untreated and were ineligible for cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Cisplatin in eligible patients typically receive a carboplatin regimen, which is associated with a response rate of approximately 36%.The study made outcomes for safety and in addition among those patients who received the combination of EV and pembrolizumab, the objective response rate was 71% including a 13% complete response rate. A total of 93% of patients had reduction in tumor volume. The combination of EV and pembrolizumab showed a manageable safety and tolerability profile. Importantly, we observed responses regardless of PD-L1 expression. Treatment related adverse events of clinical interest that were grade 3 or greater were rash, hypoglycemia and peripheral neuropathy. These were expected events and the rates were similar to those observed with Enfortumab vedotin monotherapy. 11% of patients had treatment related immune-mediated adverse events of clinical interest, greater than or equal to grade 3 that required the use of systemic steroids. This was consistent with the safety profile observed with pembrolizumab monotherapy, which is not appear to worsen with the addition of EV.Based on these data, we are proposing to conduct a front-line randomized Phase III trial. We will provide additional specifics about our Phase III plans in the coming months. EV plus pembrolizumab represents a second encouraging data set that has been generated from the combination of a vedotin based ADC and a checkpoint inhibitor. We have previously shown promising data from the combination of ADCETRIS and nivolumab in several lymphoma settings. We believe in the potential of combining our vedotin based ADCs with immune checkpoint inhibitors and we are evaluating some of the cost combinations across our ADC pipeline.The EV-103 trial is ongoing in first-line metastatic urothelial cancer patients to evaluate the combination of EV and platinum chemotherapy, as well as the triplet of EV pembrolizumab and chemotherapy. In addition, we recently expanded the trial to evaluate EV monotherapy and the combination of EV and pembrolizumab in patients with muscle invasive urothelial cancer who are cisplatin ineligible. Approximately 20% of urothelial cancer patients are diagnosed with muscle invasive disease, which is not yet spread outside the bladder. There was a significant unmet need for new therapies for these patients.Lastly, the activity of EV in urothelial cancer suggested may have application in other Nectin-4-expressing malignancies. To that end, we have Astellas plan to start a signal finding trial in other solid tumors in the near future. I'll move on now to Tucatinib, our oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets HER2. Last week, we reported positive top line results from the randomized, double-blind pivotal trial called HER2CLIMB.The trial was conducted in 612 heavily pre-treated HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer patients, including 47% who were known to have brain metastases at study entry. Patients received either Tucatinib in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine or trastuzumab and capecitabine unknown. We reported a statistically significant and clinically meaningful outcome on the primary end two key secondary endpoints.The data showed that the Tucatinib regimen reduce the risk of disease progression or death by approximately half and by a greater amount in the patients with brain metastases, most importantly Tucatinib also reduce the risk of death by a third in the overall population. Tucatinib in combination with Trastuzumab and capecitabine was generally well tolerated with a manageable safety profile. Full results from HER2CLIMB are scheduled for an oral presentation at SABCS on December 11th 2019 and we expect to submit a new drug application to the FDA in the first quarter of 2020.Next, I'll turn to ADCETRIS, which we are evaluating in several new trial for potential registration or to inform clinical practice. As previously stated, we are enrolling patients who have been retreated with ADCETRIS in Hodgkin and T-cell lymphoma to progress after prior response, including those who received ADCETRIS in the frontline setting.We are also conducting a trial of ADCETRIS in frontline Hodgkin lymphoma and PTCL patients who are unfit for combination chemotherapy. In addition to these studies, we recently expanded an ongoing Phase II trial to evaluate ADCETRIS in a novel combination of nivolumab, bleomycin and dacarbazine in newly diagnosed and perhaps Hodgkin lymphoma patients. This regimen excludes when blasting [Phonetic], which is part of the approved ADCETRIS plus AVD regimen and adds nivolumab and blasting is known to cause neuropathy and ADCETRIS in combination with nivolumab has produced promising data in several connected trials. Combining the two most active agents in Hodgkin lymphoma, ADCETRIS and the PD-1 inhibitor in a frontline regimen has the potential to improve efficacy and reduce toxicity.The trial reflects our long-term strategy to improve outcomes Hodgkin lymphoma patients with ADCETRIS based regimens. Another interesting opportunity we are exploring is it's use in the treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, we'll keep you posted as our plans progress. We also have a number of important presentations at ASH and look forward to continuing to expand the ADCETRIS dataset in hematologic malignancies.Now I'll turn the call back over to Clay. -- Thanks, Roger. Before we open the line for your questions, I want to recap our key upcoming activities across our oncology portfolio. They include, first continue to establish ADCETRIS as a standard of care in frontline Hodgkin lymphoma and frontline PTCL and initiating additional clinical trials. Second working with FDA on our EV submission in collaboration with Astellas toward the March 2020 PDUFA date, initiating a Phase III trial in front line urothelial cancer and expanding EV development program with new trials.Third reporting Tucatinib HER2-client data at SABCS, submitting an NDA to the FDA in the first quarter of 2020 and advancing a randomized trial in combination with T-DM1 and reporting top line results from the TV pivotal trial in cervical cancer in the first half of next year. We aim to continue our positive momentum through 2019 and into 2020 as we strive to bring important new drugs to cancer patients.At this point, we'll open the line for Q&A. Operator, please open the call for questions.Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Michael Schmidt with Guggenheim. -- Thanks for taking my questions. I actually had a quite -- a pipeline question on Ladiratuzumab, as you mentioned rightfully so I think a lot of excitement around combining your ADCs with PD-1 inhibitors and you did mention the upcoming presentation of the KEYTRUDA combination study at SABCS. I was just wondering if you could help us a bit more with what investor expectation should be with respect to this update from LV plus pembrolizumab [Technical Issues]. -- Michael, thank you for the question. So we are very interested in the LIV-1 ADC, it's interesting molecule, it's certainly active, we've shown that and presented that has single agent activity. And we are continuing to evaluate as a monotherapy and also in combination with pembro. We are not yet ready to go forward and announce registrational or Phase III trials. But we are continuing to develop it and trying to maximize dose schedule monotherapy combination with pembro and we're very excited about that.Clearly SABCS will be from a Seattle Genetics standpoint a big show on Tucatinib because we have a lot to discuss there, but LIV-1 is also important to us. And additionally, I may point out that the basket trials a trial in a variety of different tumor types that have LIV-1 expression has recently opened. So that's something we're working on as well. -- Great, thanks. And then maybe a follow-up, so you mentioned the upcoming trial results for the TV study and cervical cancer from the TV 204 trial. Can you just remind us of sort of expectations for what are the clinical barriers here in terms of efficacy to -- for approvability? -- There is a lot there and maybe I'll give you a few comments, but Roger can also follow up. And if you look at relapsed cervical cancer, it's in fact grim prognosis, no one survives this, this is bad and despite Carticel and vaccines, not everyone gets vaccine across the globe and in the US. And so there is still unfortunately a need for therapies for relapsed cervical cancer. And if you look at perhaps the most recent approval in cervical cancer, it was pembro in PD-1 high-expressers with a 14 that's 14% response rate, but they were durable responses.And if you look at chemotherapy that has been used in a lot of publications, there are I would say the range is probably somewhere between 8% and maybe 16%, 17% response rate, sometimes with durations that are tiny measured in two months, a duration where with a checkpoint you can get a year or so of duration, which is likely why it got approval, even with needs to minimis response rate because it had duration. So I think those maybe can help you give you some landmarks of what's out there. And clearly we want to do well by patients and have a best response. We can have with single agent, look at this in future in combination. Roger, do you have any color you want to add beyond that? -- No, Clay, I agree with your comment that the bar is set by historical precedent and we need to wait for the TV results, see, they match up. -- Great, thanks. There is lot to talk about obviously, but congrats on all the pipeline progress in the quarter. I'll hop back in the queue. -- Thanks.Thank you. Our next question comes from Kennen Mackay with RBC Capital Markets. -- Hi, thanks so much for taking the question. Congrats on the quarter and the narrowed in slightly raised guidance, maybe a quick commercial question. First, I'd hope for a little bit more color on the growth of ADCETRIS in frontline PTCL and higher growth in CTCL is where its like two factors are at play, all of those patients are CD30 positive and I think the NCCN guidelines there may be a little bit more generous versus other PTCL. So I was wondering, of those two drivers, which had been the bigger impediment to use outside of CTCL sort of lack of broad CD30 testing there or just lack of supportive data and really what can be done about that to increase utility outside of CTCL. And then I have one quick follow-up. -- So, you know, there has been -- a lot of worked on looking at CD30 expression in both CTCL and in PTCL. And if you asked scientifically, are there patients with PTCL and CTCL that are absolutely negative for CD30, I could not with a clear conscience say that there are patients that are truly negative. What I can tell you is there are some patients that have low scores on histology when looking at a single module. But if you look at other nodules they could be high. Keep in mind. CD30 is an activation antigen. And if you take some tissues that are low or in background with histology and you do other types of techniques to look at expression, you can see CD30 expression there. So to me it's not totally is our CTCL and PTCL CD30 positive or negative. It's more of a what the rate, what the expression level is and are some really in the background of histology, which is kind of a blunt tool although readily used across different cancer centers. So it's an easy tool to use.But having said that, you're asking about what can we do about that, how can we grow and there has been trials done and evaluated for instance in CTCL that were presented not that long ago, showing that you have CD30 positive and then CD30 I will call histology [Technical Issues] product is in the field longer and study this. And Roger, you know a lot about expression of this. And is that something that you want to comment on in to? -- Yeah, no, I think and Clay has made the point that there is a dynamic nature to this expression and there is a sampling variability and we have data not just in CTCL, but in other diseases as well with CD30 expression. One would expect it to mark for responses where we have parent CD30 negative is negativity where we see response. From a testing perspective obviously pathologists are an important part of this and getting the pathologist to understand the importance now of CD30 testing in PTCL because it is a therapeutic that can make a difference, it's something that we are obviously focused on and interested in trying to improve adoption of scoring and the appropriate reporting of pathology. -- Great, thank you very much. And then I had one quick pipeline follow-up. I'm up here in Boston at the AACR-NCI-EORTC Triple Conference and some of your data on the next generation peg good Codorad linkers and tubulysin paying loads was presented up here maybe enabling higher paying load delivery per ADC. Can you maybe help us understand the utility of these technologies. And I think this is getting used on one of your next generation ADCs SGN-228A which is in Phase 1, if I am right on that, could you maybe help us understand when we might see some of that initial data and what to look for in that data? Thank you very much and congrats again. -- Thanks, Kennen. So thank you for the introduction to talk about stuff that's part of our growing technology and our leadership in ADCs. So we are really excited about our newest ADC in clinical trials that we call 228A targets CD228 or what's referred to as p97. And this is expressed on a variety of solid tumors and we have also not only just use this target, but we have used that new confirmation in ADC that utilizes pet groups, utilizes an implode. You may be aware that with ADCETRIS and with LV, we utilize approximately four drugs per antibody molecule. And with our newest technology with 228, we're using eight drugs per antibody molecule, but it has a completely different linker and a completely different stabilization agent and we've been working on this and it's in clinic now and it's an exciting prospect for us.One of the commitments that we've made is after we became the industry leader in ADC is to stay there and that's to continue investing in our technology and continue to make drugs that are more potent, but also safer and try to work on our liquid systems to make them more specific for the tumor. And so this is one example where we are very hopeful with our technology and we are investing in new ADCs. But as you will see going forward, we have a couple of new technologies to build on what we already have is in leadership positions. And I think that the future will be a good one for ADCs not only at Seattle Genetics, but in other companies as other companies are making advances in really helping patients.Okay, thank you. Our next question comes from Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. -- Thanks. Could you just comment on the next steps for tucatinib may be in colorectal cancer and perhaps plans look at other indications such as gastric or the frequency of HER2 expression is much higher? -- Thank you very much for the question. Roger, can you talk a little bit about maybe on data and what we're doing next. And then also touch on other diseases. -- Right. So, thanks for the question and obviously the HER2 climb results, which are really and be remarkable, it does point to the potential business nature of Tucatinib. And so we are interested in -- since you're creating a program around Tucatinib which will include expanding into other areas of breast cancer, Clay has already mentioned the TDM-1 trial which is in earlier stage of metastatic disease, they have a neoadjuvant effort through by two and we are looking at other areas as well.With regard to HER2 expressing tumors that are outside of breast cancer, we did have very exciting data, a small data set but very exciting at SMO, with a combination of Trastuzumab Tucatinib for the response rate that's north of 50% and look pretty durable. So we're excited about taking that on so much so that that was an investigator-initiated trial, which we've taken over essentially only IND and the trial is now Seattle Genetics open-sponsored trial. And we plan to continue to evaluate third line colorectal cancer HER2 positive in a broader patient population utilizing amounts in their trial and that obviously if that data is we produce or what you think it will be that's an area of potential seeking potential registration outcomes.And in earlier lines of colorectal cancer, even though the frequency is in sort of 2% to 5% range, nevertheless it's an important unmet need and it's a large addressable population. So we're working on thinking about what we could do earlier. With regard to gastric exactly as you say, this is another opportunity and we already have thought through internally what a development plan could look like. We're not ready to share that information at this point, but we are definitely interested in gastric and potentially other HER2 expressing tumors as well. -- And a follow-up if I may, at this point, how much is HLA driver with ADCETRIS revenue growth versus PTCL? -- You know, I'll turn it over to Robin in a moment, but the general answer is we really don't split them up and both of them are very important to us. Robin you want to give a little color? -- Sure. HLA is certainly one of the key revenue growth areas for ADCETRIS. And I think there is certainly room to grow with Hodgkin lymphoma. We've seen good uptake both in PTCL and Hodgkin lymphoma, but if you look at Hodgkin lymphoma is really facing a much more entrenched usage chemotherapy. The three-year PFS data that we presented has really helped us get traction in terms of physicians understanding the benefit of ADCETRIS and we will have for your follow-up data at ASH. I think as the data matures with Echelon-1 when one can see is there is -- we've seen that continued benefit from the 3-year PFS data. The more we can show that there is an interim benefit, I think the more that we are going to be able to convert physicians understanding the benefit of ADCETRIS. In terms of the relative contribution as Clay said, we don't split those up, but I believe that Hodgkin lymphoma is continuing to be an important driver for us. We've seen obviously rapid uptake with PTCL as well and I think that's -- has been very encouraging.Thank you. Our next question will come from Gena Huidong Wang with Barclays. -- Thank you for taking my questions and the first one also regarding the commercial question. So, I'm wondering how's the first line PTCL and the Hodgkin lymphoma, the growth trajectory or growth rate in this quarter compared to the last quarter? -- So we don't report the specific growth of the disease types, no. As a whole, we've had a lot of growth year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter we grew a little about 5%. And so that is -- it's a strong growth rate within what we have it for guidance. And we're excited about that and we expect that ADCETRIS over time year-to-year will continue to grow as a brand as we make more progress there.But the specifics of PTCL for instance as you ask is not something we present. What I will say is that with PTCL we had OS from our first data set. So it is a less challenging discussion with doctors, when you go out with OS data, where with Hodgkin lymphoma, it was contemplated to be -- to take a number of years to get there because you need a certain amount of events to see statistical volumes.So we are not there and it is important for us to follow the protocol as it said and as it's written and try to get to those events. But in the meantime, the gold standard is 5 years and docs look at that with Hodgkin lymphoma. Our additional data which we published showed 2 year worth of data and some doctors and it was great data, some doctors converted and some didn't. And then last year we put out our 3 years data and we had a nice bump in our revenues and more docs took it on and the data got actually better, it wasn't just continuation of two to three years that look better. And now this year, we're going to show our at ASH coming up in a couple of months, we're going to show 4 year data. And then next year, presumably we have ASH but it's way too early to speculate, we'll show the 5 year gold standard data. And I think that that will go a long way to addressing any questions without even having OS data. So, we're really excited to continue to age the data and go forward. -- Great. And then just quick follow up, quick question regarding the EV-103 hopefully. So you did mention that you plan to start randomize the Phase III trial in first-line, just wondering any additional color you can provide and giving those individual 130 data reported at ASCO and we will be thinking about triple it versus double or it will be EV-103 plus pembro versus [Indecipherable]? -- No, we have not yet spelled out the exact trial and that's something as soon as we start the trial we will spell it out, that's been our history that it's not appropriate to state the exact trial till it starts. So stay tuned, we will be doing that. But Roger, perhaps you can give some color on your thoughts on in bigger and the kind of approaches we could take to go toward approval and the importance of it. -- Sure, thanks, So as you can see the EV-103 trial offers you a road map as to how we're thinking about what possible combinations we can use and as Clay said, we haven't disclosed those, but you can get a sense of the data generation that we will need to support the Phase III frontline trial. With regard to Envigo it's a positive trial, the OS didn't quite make it obviously from a -- from an efficacy perspective, although it's hard to cross compare. But we are encouraged by our EV pembro data, which has been a response rate of 70%, which is an unusual outcome in this disease. And again, cross trial comparisons of -- have limits for sure, but the response rates that were shown with the tisotumab together with chemotherapy would suggest that at this point anyway, what are our plans to proceed into a frontline trial would suggest that we have a good shot to potentially improving the outcomes further.All right, thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Berens with SVB Leerink. -- Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess is what is primarily for Roger, one of the buzzes that came out of the EV presentation in Barcelona was potential synergies between vedotin and checkpoint and I think it's one of the things a lot of investors are also thinking about in regards to have the value of the platform. Do you guys have any additional color for us regarding what could be driving potential synergies? And is there anything about the payload for the linker that differentiate in regard to other ADC approaches? -- So, Roger? -- Sure, thanks for the question and so it's the Holy Grail of drug development is to be able to put two drugs together and have a better outcome than in individual drugs alone and certainly that response rate is high. Proof of synergy is a very different thing, which requires a high level of scientific rigor. And what I can say is that from a mechanistic perspective, you think about what an ADC is, it's essentially a targeted therapy. So, delivering a payload to a group of tumor cells, inducing in those tumor cells things like immunogenic cell death, replicate of stress, such that the the tumor microenvironment may become favorable for an inflammatory response and may in fact be amenable into an immune response that would be assisted by taking the breaks off an immune response by giving a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor. And in the sense of, chemotherapy may be much more, much more permissive in terms of what other cells could potentially damage, one could speculate that that limited delivery of a cytotoxic payload just the tumor cells may keep the microenvironment more intact, that's one possibility. With regard to the actual data in terms of what does -- could 71% represent a represent synergy?What is interesting is if you look at the data, you can see that there is a response regardless of PD-L1 expression, which is encouraging. We don't have EV monotherapy data at this point to sort of make the comparison. So it's very hard from a pure numbers perspective to say this is what would you expect with pembro and this is what you could expect from EV. But regardless of whether it's synergy or not, the clinical data are pretty compelling and it's certainly compelling us to move forward on the development program. -- Okay. Is there anything about Vedotin specifically or your linker technology that could make it hard for another ADC to have similar effects? -- You know Andy, you're asking a really good question. And there is a lot of work going on in our research effort that I do not -- our research group I should say that do not are not ready for full discussion. And we're, what we're doing is in general is we're evaluating all the different type of payloads. And their impact on immunogenic cell death. And I could tell you that they're not all the same and Vedotin work really well there. And I don't want to say more than that at this point and at some point in future we'll put our research data in appropriate conference like an AACR type conference, but we're really excited with our choice of Vedotin and how they work well with immuno-oncology agents like PD-1's.Thank you. Our next question will come from Andy Hsieh with William Blair. -- Great, thanks for taking my questions and congratulations on the quarter. So it's encouraging to see that Seattle is really hoping to expand the frontline treatment paradigm for Hodgkin lymphoma and also MTCL. So just curious these Phase III trials usually take anywhere from three to five years to run, anything you guys learn from the ECHELON programs in terms of potential surrogate endpoint to kind of shorten these trials? -- So it's a good question. I think especially in the Hodgkin lymphoma space there is the Stage 1 and 2 that we do not yet have approval in for example. And despite that there is a lot of good data that's been presented, but albeit they're relatively small trials and they're not approval trials, but the data is strong. And I think that when you look at work that's going on, whether it's in Europe with consortiums or cooperative groups in the US or corporate studies, I think that there is a building momentum for using ADCETRIS in a lot of lines of Hodgkin lymphoma. But we have to continue really powering through trials and try to look at some novel endpoints and they don't take very long. And I think that is something that is up for discussion with regulators. I can't give you any details on that. Roger, is there anything else you want to say based on what we can? -- Yeah I think Clay is right thereof, it's not just corporate trials, the trial is what can be fairly long-term trial. There are cooperative groups and so on which are important entities in those trial execution. We are interested -- what we talked about today was a signal-finding study to see if we could in a single-arm trial show what ADCETRIS, nivo, Adriamycin dacarbazine combination could look like in frontline advanced Hodgkin lymphoma. And we think if that data is compelling enough that could then be the genesis for yet more work either by ourselves or by others to see because the ultimate goal is to cure as many people as we can. And that's I think what our focus is on in terms of developing new treatments for Hodgkin lymphoma new combinations. -- And a follow-up is I can, so in terms of DLBCL, Clay, I think in 2015 ASCO when the company decided to forgo the frontline opportunity, I'm just wondering what changed there. I think you mentioned about just the markets were pretty crowded and given kind of failures in the frontline setting one with REVLIMID, one with IMBRUVICA, were those kind of the genesis behind the rationale to look at potentially frontline DLBCL again? -- So first of all, we are in NCCN with DLBCL. And so we hear back from doctors who utilize it. And that's an important thing to try to understand what's going on in the world and we figured that out over the last couple of years. And have been able to talk to docs and been able to understand the benefit that ADCETRIS has in DLBCL. The landscape has changed and not necessarily we had big victories as you say. And there are other specifics that we have in mind, but we have not announced a specific trial yet and -- but it's coming and we're excited with it and it's something that we need to obviously work through regulators and with the team here at Seattle Genetics and we're trying to go forward and see if we can get another label in DLBCL, so stay tuned on that. -- Great. Thanks for taking all my questions.Thank you. Our next question will come from Shanshan Xu with Berenberg Capital Markets. -- Hi, thank you for taking my questions, a few quick ones from me. So this year at ASH, I believe you will have the full-year update for ECHELON 1 on the PFS front. Can you please update with us, when should we expect the OS update for ECHELON 1? -- Yeah, like I said earlier in the call, OS has a preset target number for events and at that point is when we open up the trial and we have not hit that, it is -- has always been contemplated to be quite a number of years. So we're just not there and it would be inappropriate for me to try to tell you when I think it's going to be since it's a hard prediction. In the meantime, we are getting PFS data and our PFS data is ageing from two years to three years to four years presentation in a couple of months at ASH, we're excited to do that. And then next year hitting that gold standard of five years PFS and as we get closer to the five year PFS data time point, doctors ask about the OS less because if you're at five year PFS and your lines are pretty flat in the Kaplan-Meier plots that signifies really what the doctors need to know. So while we are going and planning on getting OS, I think that 5 year PFS is going to be very significant as well. -- No problem. And next one is that given the strength of the data from HER2CLIMB and the fact that you're already in niche aided HER2CLIMB, two for Tucatinib plus TDM-1, we actually look forward to including this market opportunity in our model. So how should we think about the size of the indicated patient population for Tucatinib and TDM-1 combination, considering the dynamic in the treatment arena for HER2 positive breast cancer patients. -- Right. Well, we haven't really come out yet at this point and talk about the size of the population. I mean it's a little premature for us, we just came out with our data to start talking about what we think size of population is and which leads right into a marketplace discussion which leads into a pricing discussion. We have done a lot of work on this. We have been doing a lot of work. We're intending for HER2CLIMB to be not just a US product, but a global product. I mean we have a randomized study and a great dataset. We're really looking forward to presenting that dataset at San Antonio. And so I think that the market opportunity is substantive and you'll be hearing more from us on that in the future.Thank you. Our next question will come from Silvan Tuerkcan with Oppenheimer. -- Thank you for taking my question and congrats on all the progress this quarter. It's very promising that you think about moving into muscle invasive bladder cancer with EV. What types of data have you seen before to inform the utility of EV in the setting? -- Thanks for the question, I will turn it over to Roger to give you his thoughts on muscle invasive bladder cancer, which is a really big opportunity and an unmet medical need opportunity, but we have not -- we have recently opened a cohort of patients. So we're just now treating our first patients in muscle invasive. So if you're asking what is our clinical data? We're assembling our first clinical data, if you're asking about pre-clinical about why we are looking at this, we have looked at expression of Nectin-4 and the pre-metastatics and certainly it's expressed strongly there as well. And there's been a bunch of pre-clinical work that have been done to show that we think that this could be very effective and not only muscle invasive, but even earlier stage in a non-muscle invasive.So in all stages of bladder cancer, which is a very substantial size market with about 80,000 incidents in just US each year, for those three types of cancers, the metastatic, the muscle invasive and the non-muscle invasive. So a lot of preclinical work, substantial amount of clinical work in metastatic both the single agent in combination. And now we're treating patients in muscle invasive. Roger, is there any further details? -- Yeah, I think so EV is obviously active in metastatic disease and so one could, it's not a difficult step to take to expect that it may have meaningful activity in Nectin-4 expressing non-metastatic disease and so I think that's where we are. We obviously as Clay said we need to generate the data, so we can see exactly what the effect of EV monotherapy is and also look at the combination. And as you know, the landscape from muscle invasive bladder cancer because there is a meaningful unmet need is busy right now. And there were lots of trials that are running. And so understanding what a regulatory path forward could look like, we already have evidence, we have worked examples ahead of us.And so if we are able to take EV into a randomized trial essentially the population splits into cis-ineligible and cis-eligible and the reason why its cis-eligible versus ineligible because cisplatin is the only drug that's shown versus cisplatin combination is the only combination that is shown to actually have benefit in the muscle invasive space. And so you can see clinical trial designs, compartmentalize those two populations. And we would be interested obviously in both. We have generated data with EV pembro in the cisplatin ineligible metastatic population, so we do have that first piece of information and just stay tuned, we're working on moving EV-4 into these earlier lines of bladder cancer. -- Great, thank you so much. And a quick follow-up if I may, I'm also encouraged that you already expanded Tucatinib. What made you initiate Tucatinib plus Kadcyla and was anything promising that you've already seen in the HER2CLIMB data set or is it just a commercial mission? -- Please keep in mind that there was a study that had been done, an early study that was single arm not randomized, but it combined Tucatinib and Kadcyla. And the data had been presented at a conference and they were very strong. So we do have the early data. And to us together with the early data and the outstanding HER2CLIMB data that you'll see in San Antonio, it makes sense to go earlier in line and invest in it. And this time, it's a randomized study and so we don't need to do another single arm study that's been done and the safety and efficacy or the risk benefit that some docs call it, looked pretty darn and good, but it was a single arm study. So we are investing in a randomized study that is up and running. -- Great, thank you so much for taking my questions.Thank you. Our last question in the queue comes from Tazeen Ahmad with Bank of America. -- Hi guys. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Maybe Todd a couple on the financials, so as you guys diversify out away from ADCETRIS and a lot of the key studies for ADCETRIS have read out, you are putting more money now into the rest of the pipeline, whether it be EV or Tucatinib or TV. Can you give us a sense about the waiting of expenses for modeling purposes for EV versus the rest of the program on a go forward basis? Should we assume that EV is the bulk of expenses just based on what you said or do you think that it will be more equal spread across all of your pipeline products? Thanks. -- Yeah, so great question. I don't know that I can give you specifics on exactly how it spreads, but historically ADCETRIS has been the prominent driver of our expenses. We've now got six labels, we've run a number of very large clinical trials. And while we're continuing to do additional work some of which you heard on the call today, it's becoming a probably a lower overall percentage of our investment in R&D, what is now really starting to come forward are investments in programs like EV, where as you heard today, we've got a very expansive development program for that compound, as well as Tucatinib.I think the HER2CLIMB data to us turns this into a program, not a clinical trial. You've heard a little bit about our work that's already starting in combination with Kadcyla in lines of therapy before the HER2CLIMB setting. And then certainly we're looking at things like colorectal cancer where the data that we presented as well were quite encouraging. So, you know, I think maybe to get back to your question, I think you'll see a growing share of expense hitting programs like Enfortumab and Tucatinib. ADCETRIS will continue to be substantial, but probably becoming a smaller contributor to the overall pie. And then, we'll obviously look to see what else comes out of the pipeline. We've got TV in a pivotal study in a very broad portfolio of earlier stage assets that we just talked a little bit about today.Okay. Thank you. The next question comes from Chad Messer with Needham & Company. -- Great, thanks for taking my question and congrats on all the recent progress. First real quick, is there any word you can say about the preclinical assets that Todd referred to in prepared remarks, maybe you can just a rough idea what the spend on that was? -- Well, I can tell you not from a financial standpoint that we do a lot of different deals and we bring in technology, we bring in preclinical assets. This has happened like almost every year we do, small different deals. And some of them work out really well and some of them they are just in our research front. And Todd, you could talk a little about why it was in -- why you mentioned it. -- Yeah, sure. So, not that it was a huge deal, but it was the principle driver of why we increased our R&D guidance just a bit. So, I won't -- I can't give the numbers out, but that was the main contributor. And as Clay mentioned, it's a really interesting preclinical asset that we think could become a clinical asset relatively soon, so that's what got us excited about it. -- Great. Yeah, that's very helpful. And then just for a follow-up, let me -- couple of questions here, but they're all very related, if you can indulge me, I wanted to go back to TV. Clay, you mentioned how terrible relapsed cervical cancer is and that not everybody gets vaccinated, so it's still a problem. What is your view of the kind of opportunity in relapsed cervical cancer, but also for TV, I know you're looking at a whole bunch of other cancers that express tissue factor. So your thoughts on the opportunity for a tissue factor targeting therapy more broadly. And then tissue factor itself -- can you just remind me is that sort of sparingly expressed across tumor types say like a CD30 is or is it a little bit more uniform? Thanks for taking my questions. -- Sure. So, first of all on TV, we are -- we expand the past just cervical for sure. We have a trial that's listed on clintrial.gov that's in ovarian cancer. And we have a Basket study, we're working on in other types of cancers. So, stay tuned for us to report in the future when we have enough substantive data at appropriate peer-reviewed conferences like we always do on the data outside of cervical that we're working on. So there is a lot of interest in it.And you asked about the expression of TF or tissue factor and that's something that's expressed broadly on solid tumors at very high density. It's not really a heme target, so I wouldn't expect us to go and do a lot of lymphoma, leukemia myeloma type work with it, rather it's more on the solid tumors that you would expect, the big solid tumors. And the expression on cervical and things like ovarian are very high. So, really good targets and important diseases that need additional therapies that have unmet need for a lot of patients. So we're really excited about our partnership with Genmab working on TV and we continue to look forward to presenting more and more data.Thank you, sir. We now have no further questions in the queue. -- Okay. Thank you, operator and thanks everybody for joining us today. Have a good night.[Operator Closing Remarks] --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --

"ne out of every eight women in the United States will develop breast cancer, according to Breastcancer.org. Of those, about 25% will have an aggressive type called ""HER2-positive,"" which also recurs at higher rates.The human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) gene produces proteins that control breast cell division, growth, and repairs. Too many copies of the gene, or too many receptor proteins, lead to excessive growth of cancer cells.Image Source: Getty ImagesHere we'll explore four  developing new therapies aimed at HER2-positive breast cancers.Shares of    following the announcement of positive clinical trial results for its oral HER2-targeted breast cancer drug tucatinib. Patients in the trial received either trastuzumab and capecitabine, or those two drugs plus tucatinib. The patients had received three prior therapies before entering the trial. Of note: The cancer had spread to the brain in 47% of patients in the trial.Seattle Genetics highlighted that the trial reached the primary endpoint of progression-free survival. The tucatinib-treated patients had a 46% reduction in risk of disease progression or death. For patients whose cancer had spread to the brain, the drug demonstrated a 52% reduction in disease progression or death. Additional trial endpoints, including overall survival, favored tucatinib treatment.Seattle Genetics plans to unveil more detailed results from the trial at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS) in December. Until then, the company has begun work to gain approval globally, starting with a New Drug Application filing to be submitted to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the first quarter of 2020.This week did not go so well for  . Following a planned interim update on its pivotal phase 3 clinical trial, the  of its value. To add insult to injury, dozens of class-action law firms are lining up to get investors to sue the company based on the results.MacroGenics set out to test whether its drug margetuximab, given with chemotherapy, is superior to trastuzumab with chemotherapy in metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer patients who have had at least two prior therapies. Both margetuximab and trastuzumab are monoclonal antibodies targeting HER2.The Sophia trial, as it's dubbed, plans to have full results in 2020. The data release this month included a preplanned interim analysis to determine the survival benefit between the treatment arms. Patients receiving margetuximab showed a 1.8-month benefit, increasing survival to 21.6 months compared to 19.8 months. The market's reaction indicates that investors clearly expected to see a greater improvement.MacroGenics further highlighted that 85% of the patients in the trial had a specific genetic profile. Margetuximab's overall survival benefit in these patients increased to 4.3 months better than the comparator arm. MacroGenics also analyzed smaller subgroups with different genetic signatures. Detailed results from the Sophia trial will be presented during an oral session at the SABCS meeting.Looking beyond Seattle Genetics' tucatinib, an oral small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and Macrogenics' monoclonal antibody margetuximab:   and   are developing novel therapies that work by different mechanisms.Merus created MCLA-128, a bispecific antibody that binds to HER2 as well as HER3; this dual mechanism will allow MCLA-128 to overcome resistance to cancers that develop in response to other HER2 treatments. Merus is conducting a phase 2 clinical trial of MCLA-128 in patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, and a phase 1 clinical trial in patients with a specific protein fusion known to activate HER2.Merus' stock jumped 13% Friday morning, on news that it would present data on MCLA-128 and another pipeline compound at the AACR-NCI-EORTC International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics, being held over the weekend in Boston. The presentations focus on the phase 1 trial and the ability to target cancers with the fusion protein.Like Merus, Zymeworks seeks to fight HER2-positive cancers with a bispecific antibody named ZW25, which binds to two distinct areas on that receptor. The company believes this approach increases the drug's ability to enter and destroy the cancer cell. Currently ZW25 is in a phase 2 clinical trial in HER2-expressing cancers.Zymeworks did not stop there. Piggybacking on ZW25 and its ability to enter cancer cells, Zymeworks created ZW49, which attaches highly potent anticancer warheads to the original ZW25. This antibody-drug conjugate can potentially kill HER2-positive cancer cells more effectively. ZW49 is in a phase 1 clinical trial, so it will take time before its cancer-fighting ability is known.Zymeworks' stock has risen 20% since a data presentation on SW25 in late September at the European Society for Medical Oncology's annual meeting; year to date, shareholders have doubled their money. With half its shares in the hands of institutions, Zymeworks appears to be a consistent gainer, but it needs to show some meaningful midstage trial results.Breast cancer patients with the aggressive HER2-positive form need better treatment options. It appears that Seattle Genetics' tucatinib will provide one next year, if approved; importantly, it appears to benefit patients with brain metastases.As for MacroGenics, investors may want to hold off until margetuximab's full overall survival data are known in 2020. Finally, Merus and Zymeworks look interesting for those willing to take riskier, long-term bets.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"ver the span of two years,  saw its stock rise more than 1000%, from $2.20 per share in October 2016 to $26 a share in August 2018. Then bad news hit in 2019. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration didn't approve the company's billion-dollar molecule, sacituzumab. The stock dropped all the way to $12 a share. But now sacituzumab is back on track, and Immunomedics is slowly rising again.Image source: Getty Images.A few years ago, Immunomedics signed away most of the rights of its cancer drug, sacituzumab, to . The drug was widely seen as a potential blockbuster in the fight against triple-negative breast cancer. Seattle Genetics paid $300 million upfront for global rights to the drug, in a deal that could have been worth as much as $2 billion to Immunomedics.Nonetheless, Immunomedics investors were unhappy with the deal. The company's largest shareholder, a hedge fund called VenBio, sued Immunomedics, claiming that it was ""giving away its crown jewel"" by assigning the rights to Seattle Genetics. The fight over the drug's future turned into a fight for control of the company. Ultimately, the founder David Goldenberg and CEO Cynthia Sullivan of Immunomedics were both ousted. VenBio won several seats on the board of directors, and a managing partner at the hedge fund, Dr. Behzad Aghazadeh, was named the new chairman of the company. In May 2017, the agreement with Seattle Genetics was ended, resulting in Immunomedics keeping all the rights to sacituzumab. The board hired a new CEO, Michael Pehl, who was formerly head of oncology at . As the market became more and more certain the drug would be approved by the FDA, the stock price went up and up.When  the stock dropped 26% in one day. That's what happens when unprofitable biotechs aren't allowed to sell their drugs to the public. And yet the news was not as bad as it first appeared. The FDA did not raise any objections to the results from the clinical trials. The science was still good. Instead, the FDA was unhappy with manufacturing issues at the plant where the drug was to be made.During an ordinary inspection, the FDA discovered data manipulation and fraud going on at the factory where sacituzumab was to be manufactured. So, of course, the FDA couldn't approve the drug until this situation was fixed. In response, Immunomedics cleaned house. The new CEO Pehl resigned in February. A month later, Robert Iannone, the chief medical officer, also resigned. In the meantime, the chairman of the board took control of the company. Immunomedics decided to farm out all its drug manufacturing to another business, Samsung Biologics, a subsidiary of  that is the world's largest contract development and manufacturing organization. One really nice thing about  is that there are clear events that cause the stock to immediately go up or down, and in a big way. So the correlation between the stock price and what's happening in the real world can be very specific. A drug fails a clinical trial, and the stock price goes into free-fall. Or the FDA approves a drug, and the stock price responds by doubling. We know what's happening, and we know why it's happening. In the case of Immunomedics, investors know exactly why the stock dropped so dramatically. The FDA did not approve sacituzumab. And we know precisely what the FDA objected to: fraud at the manufacturing plant. And we know that this issue has been resolved. People resigned, and Immunomedics no longer plans to manufacture its drug. Samsung Biologics is going to handle it. We also know that the FDA's  sent in January was not based on the underlying science. The company's billion-dollar molecule is still a marvelous drug, with . When the company first filed the NDA, the market was very optimistic about approval. So the price was $26 a share. Now the company has resolved the issue and will file a Biologics License Application (BLA). So the price of the stock should be restored to where it was before. Yet the market is still punishing the stock for news that is no longer relevant. The stock price is now $16 a share, more or less. That's a huge difference in value, over $1 billion dollars, for a company with a $3 billion market cap. If Immunomedics hadn't had the hiccup at the manufacturing facility, its stock price would probably be a great deal higher than it is right now.  That $10 difference (between $16 a share and $26 a share) is how much the stock is likely to rise as the company gets closer and closer to its BLA. As the manufacturing blip fades into the distance, and the market focuses on the opportunities for this billion-dollar drug, and all the great news from its clinical trials, and how likely it is this drug will be approved, the stock will do what it did the first time around. And, of course, if and when the drug actually gets approved by the FDA, the stock should jump even higher. This is why owning Immunomedics is a no-brainer right now. When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Immunomedics wasn't one of them!

There are 11 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Seattle Genetics Inc, but the average is just that — a mathematical average.  There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $83.00.  And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $140.00.  The standard deviation is $16.626.


But the whole reason to look at the average SGEN price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes.  And so with SGEN crossing above that average target price of $106.36/share, investors in SGEN have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $106.36 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?  Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Seattle Genetics Inc:

ancer treatment has undergone a revolution in recent years, creating opportunities for companies pioneering new approaches and their investors. In the last five years, since around the time the first immuno-oncology drugs hit the market, 61 cancer drugs have been launched to treat 23 different kinds of cancers. Last year, worldwide sales of oncology drugs amounted to about $124 billion, more than twice that of any other therapy area, and are growing at a double-digit rate.Investors wanting to profit from the trend should consider buying several stocks in the space to spread out the risk. There are over 700 cancer drugs in late-stage development, a 60% increase over the number a decade ago, and many of them will fail in clinical trials. But choosing several stocks of companies that have already established a history of success is one way to build a portfolio to take advantage of one of the most innovative and lucrative markets in healthcare.Three such stocks, spanning the range of  from pharmaceutical giant to under-the-radar mid-cap, are  ,  , and  .Image source: Getty Images.Any investor building a portfolio of cancer treatment stocks should consider making a position in Merck a core holding. Merck's immunotherapy drug Keytruda is becoming a foundational treatment for a wide variety of cancers, and its rapid growth is expected to make it the world's best-selling drug in the next five years.Keytruda is a PD-1 inhibitor, which works to defeat a mechanism that cancer cells use to hide from the body's immune system. A number of companies have drugs in this class, but Keytruda is on its way to overtake 's Opdivo as the best-selling immunotherapy treatment.The drug has been approved for 20 different indications, including melanoma, lung cancer, lymphoma, gastric cancer, and kidney cancer. Because it can be combined with chemotherapy and other cancer-fighting strategies, Keytruda is in over 1,000 clinical trials by various companies that are testing Keytruda against a wide variety of cancers.In the most recent quarter, Keytruda sales grew 58%, to $2.6 billion, helping Merck post a 12% revenue gain. Market research firm EvaluatePharma expects Keytruda sales to grow to $17 billion a year by 2024 to take the top spot in the drug industry, but even that estimate could prove to be conservative as the company turns in  in clinical trials.Merck is definitely dependent on this single drug for its results, often a danger sign for investors, with 22% of sales and most of its growth coming from Keytruda. But because Keytruda has so much potential ahead of it and its patent won't expire until 2028, it's worth the risk. Merck also has anti-virals, vaccines, an antibiotic, and a cardiovascular drug among its 35 drugs in late-stage trials or under regulatory review.Analysts expect Merck to grow earnings per share 11% next year, and the stock sells for 15 times the consensus estimate for 2020, with a $217 billion market capitalization. It also .If you're looking for a smaller company that's focused entirely on cancer treatments, consider Seattle Genetics. This $14 billion biotech has one cancer-fighting drug in its portfolio that has , and three others in late-stage testing that are on the verge of commercialization.Seattle Genetics specializes in antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) technology, which uses a monoclonal antibody that's designed to find and attach to certain cancer cells combined with a toxic agent that kills the target cell. The company's lead drug is Adcetris, which is approved for six different lymphoma indications and is being evaluated in 70 clinical trials. Growing acceptance by oncologists and new indications are driving rapid growth, with sales of the drug rising 35% in the first half of 2019, to $294 million.Adcetris will soon be joined in the portfolio by a second drug, enfortunab vedotin (EV), an ADC that's very effective in fighting metastatic bladder cancer. Seattle Genetics has filed an application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and a decision is expected on March 15. The company also  at the European Society for Medical Oncology meeting last month when it presented results of a trial that showed that EV in combination with Keytruda shrank tumors in 71% of patients with advanced or metastatic bladder cancer.Besides the launch of EV, Seattle Genetics will have some other events in the next few months that could propel the stock. A pivotal trial for tucatinib, an oral, small molecule drug for HER2-positive breast cancer, should read out before the end of the year, and results from a pivotal trial for tisotumab vedotin in metastatic cervical cancer are expected in the first half of 2020.With accelerating revenue growth and three potential pipeline catalysts for the stock in the next few months, the prospects for Seattle Genetics have never been better, and the stock is a buy right now.This pick is a company that doesn't develop drugs for cancer, but its services are becoming increasingly vital for treatment of the disease. NeoGenomics is the leading oncology testing company, and its cancer genetic testing helps physicians diagnose the disease and decide on the best course of treatment.NeoGenetics has two lines of business. The largest segment is clinical services, with the company offering a comprehensive menu of tests for oncologists, pathologists, and hospitals. The company's pharma services business serves drug companies and researchers by offering cancer genetic testing to help advance drugs from pre-clinical research through to regulatory approval.The emergence of precision medicine to treat cancers based on their specific genetic makeup is one of the most important trends in , and is driving rapid growth for NeoGenetics. Revenue in the most recent quarter grew 50%, to $101.7 million, thanks to a 34% increase in clinical test volume and a 12% increase in average revenue per test.Part of that volume growth is due to an acquisition, but the company estimates organic growth is running at about a 20% clip. The company is just edging into profitability, earning $2 million last quarter and expecting net income between a loss of $1 million and profit of $3 million in the current quarter. NeoGenetics has raised its full-year guidance for revenue two quarters in a row.Other clinical testing companies offer oncology tests, but NeoGenomics is the pure-play oncology reference lab with the most comprehensive menu of tests, and the company is growing market share in an industry that could be as large as $6 billion. With a market capitalization of $2.1 billion, the stock is still relatively underfollowed, and the stock is one way to participate in the growth of the cancer treatment market without exposure to the risk of failed clinical trials.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

(RTTNews) - The following are the healthcare stocks that hit a new 52-week high on Monday.Seattle Genetics, Inc. (SGEN) hit a new high of $102.84 in intraday trading on Monday, before closing at $100.89.The stock is up 78% year-to-date.Seattle Genetics develops and commercializes therapies for the treatment of cancer.Yesterday, the company announced positive top-line results from its HER2CLIMB trial, sending the stock up over 15%.HER2CLIMB is a pivotal trial evaluating investigational drug Tucatinib in combination with approved chemotherapy drugs Herceptin and Xeloda against Herceptin and Xeloda alone in patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer.The trial met the primary endpoint of progression-free survival, showing that the addition of Tucatinib to the regimen of Herceptin and Xeloda demonstrated a 46 percent reduction in the risk of disease progression or death.The Company is planning to submit the Tucatinib New Drug Application to the FDA in the first quarter of 2020.Another drug in the pipeline Enfortumab vedotin, which Seattle Genetics is co-developing with Astellas pharma is under phase III study, dubbed EV-301, for the treatment of metastatic urothelial cancer.The company had revenues of $218.45 million in the second quarter ended June 30, 2019, compared with $170.17 million in the same quarter a year ago. Analysts expect revenues of $211.83 million in the third quarter, which is going to be reported on October 29, 2019.Avita Medical Limited (RCEL) jumped to a new high of $9.29 in intraday trading on Monday, before closing at $9.19. The stock has gained nearly 720% year-to-date. Avita, which was trading on the OTC market, was up-listed to the Nasdaq on October 1, 2019, and was added to the S&P/ASX 300 index, on 23 September 2019.Avita's lead product RECELL System, an autologous cell harvesting device that produces a suspension of spray-on skin cells using a small sample of the patient's own skin, is indicated for the treatment of acute thermal burn wounds in patients of 18 years and older. The device was approved by the FDA in September last year. The company is exploring additional therapeutic applications for this its proprietary technology.New data exploring the use of the RECELLSystem in combination with dermabrasion to treat acne scars was reported on September by the Department of Plastic Surgery at Peking Union Medical College Hospital.The company reported revenues of A$5.24 million in the fourth quarter ended June 30, 2019, compared with A$5.12 million in the last year.Recro Pharma Inc. (REPH) recorded a new high of $13.18 in intraday trading on Monday, before closing at $13.10. The stock has jumped nearly 90% year-to-date.Recro Pharma is a revenue-generating, specialty pharmaceutical company that operates through two divisions; Contract Development and Manufacturing (CDMO) and development of non-opioid products for the treatment of acute pain.The lead product candidate, an injectable form of Meloxicam, a long-acting preferential COX-2 inhibitor for the treatment of acute postoperative pain was rejected by the FDA for the second time, in March this year. Meloxicam has been marketed by Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. since the 1990s as an oral agent, Mobic, for treatment of symptoms of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.Another drug candidate, Fadolmidine in combination with bupivacaine for the treatment of postoperative pain has successfully completed phase II study.The company reported revenues of $31.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, compared to $21.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018.For 2019, Recro Pharma expects annual revenue to be in the range of $91 million to $94 million.

Natera, a genetic testing and diagnostics company, develops and commercializes non-invasive methods for analyzing DNA.In order to focus squarely on its core genetic testing business in reproductive health, oncology and organ transplantation, Natera divested its Evercord cord blood and tissue banking business to CBR, a California Cryobank Life Sciences company, last month.Natera had revenues of $74.4 million in the second quarter ended June 30, 2019, compared to $63.1 million in the second quarter of 2018.The company anticipates total revenue in the range of $275 million to $305 million in 2019, while analysts expect revenue of $293 million for the year.U.S. Physical Therapy, Inc. (USPH) touched a new high of $141.93 in intraday trading on Monday, before closing at $140.00. The stock is up nearly 37% year-to-date.The company operates physical therapy clinics that provide pre- and post-operative care and treatment for orthopedic-related disorders, sports-related injuries, preventative care, rehabilitation of injured workers, and neurological-related injuries.U.S. Physical Therapy said on October 2 that it has acquired 67% interest of an 11-clinic physical therapy practice for approximately $12.3 million. The practice generates $6.6 million in annual revenue.Net revenues in the second quarter of 2019 increased by 9.8% to $126.4 million from $115.1 million in the second quarter of 2018.The company expects revenues of $121.33 million in the third quarter.

Markets chugged higher on Monday, as investors gobbled up stocks after a strange finish to last week. Let’s look at a few top stock trades as investors gear up for a busy week of earnings. (NYSE:) caught a nice boost on Monday after  from RBC Capital Markets. The rally took PINS stock to the top of its current downtrend.Can it push through channel resistance (blue line) or will resistance hold strong?If it holds, a retest of $24 could be in store. A channel breakout could send Pinterest stock to the 38.2% retracement at $28.28. Above that, at $28.72, is the 100-day moving average. Moving over that could kickstart a move toward $30.Man, InvestorPlace readers   (NYSE:) trade. Shares didn’t quite get down to range support near $26.50 ahead of earnings.Post-earnings, BAC stock has been moving well, spending last week consolidating just below range resistance. On Monday, we have a breakout in the name. Over $30.50 and BAC stock looks good on the long side.Shares are hitting multi-year highs now, and if they continue higher, see if BAC stock can surpass $31.70. Over $32 could cause an even further breakout. Bank of America’s unadjusted high from 2018 is up at $33.05, for reference. (NYSE:) has spent the month chopping between $39 and $40, as it clings to the 100-day moving average. The 61.8% retracement has been support on the downside, while $40 has been resistance on the upside.The company reports on Thursday before the open, so be aware of that, too.On the downside, look to see if the 61.8% retracement buoys the stock. Below it puts channel support (blue line) and the 200-day moving average near $37 in play. Over $40 puts the 50-day moving average and 78.6% retracement at $41.66 in play. Above that and $44+ is possible. (NYSE:) has been mostly range-bound between $270 to $275 on the upside and $245 to $250 on the downside. Additionally, the 100-day moving average has been resistance, while the 200-day moving average has been support.With range support and the 200-day moving average now giving way as support, it opens up the door to more possible downside in NOW stock.Shares are flirting with a close below the 61.8% retracement too. If they fail to reclaim this mark and the 200-day moving average in a relatively quick manner, more downside could be on the way.The 50% retracement is all the way down near $225. To fill its February gap, Service Now would need to fall below $200 per share, although that kind of slide may not be warranted, especially in the short term. (NASDAQ:) shares surged on Monday, up more than 15% on positive results for an oral breast cancer drug.Monday’s move is a powerful rally, bursting SGEN stock over uptrend resistance (blue line). Sitting between its 123.6% and 138.2% retracements, see if SGEN stock can take one out in either way.Above the 138.2% and SGEN may be able to continue higher.

ess than two years ago,   received a great deal of criticism for acquiring Cascadian Therapeutics to get its hands on an early clinical-stage cancer drug called tucatinib. Since then, the stock has climbed about 91% thanks to some impressive results from the experimental cancer tablet.Biotech analysts derided the acquisition at the time because a similar treatment called Nerlynx from   earned an approval around six months earlier. Since then, however, sales of Nerlynx have floundered and shares of Puma Biotechnology have lost around 90% of their value.Image source: Getty Images.Clearly Seattle Genetics saw something in tucatinib's early trial results that Wall Street missed. Nerlynx hasn't been nearly as successful as imagined, and it looks like Seattle Genetics' new star candidate will perform much better if it reaches the commercial stage.Can tucatinib lead Seattle Genetics to market-beating gains? Here's what you need to know.Seattle Genetics is a pioneer of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), which are simply proteins that carry mini chemo-grenades that explode inside cancer cells after they bind to specific antigens on the cell's surface.The company's first and only commercial-stage product, Adcetris, is an ADC that earned approval in 2011 and is currently a popular lymphoma treatment. In the first half of 2019, Adcetris sales rose 35% over the previous-year period, to $294 million.There are two more ADCs in Seattle Genetics' late-stage pipeline, and in the first half of the year the company invested a combined $27.9 million developing them. Over the same period, Seattle Genetics plowed $43.8 million into the development of tucatinib, a  kinase inhibitor that's vastly different from the company's ADC programs.Nerlynx and tucatinib are both orally available kinase inhibitors meant to prevent tumor growth by shutting down overactive human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). The main difference is tucatinib doesn't inhibit the first type of epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR) the way Nerlynx does.Generally speaking, inhibiting proteins that aren't overactive usually causes unintended side effects. Nerlynx's EGFR activity is thought responsible for a high rate of discontinuation caused by diarrhea. During the ExteNET study that led to the approval of Nerlynx to prevent recurrence of breast cancer, 95% of patients reported diarrhea, and altogether adverse reactions caused 28% of patients to quit early.Image source: Getty Images.Around the time Seattle Genetics acquired Cascadia, Puma's Nerlynx was still expected to become a  because it significantly reduced the risk of recurrence for breast cancer patients with HER2-positive tumors. Analysts were taken by surprise when Seattle Genetics opted for Cascadia and tucatinib following a  trial when Puma Biotechnology had already started selling its HER2 inhibitor.Compared to Nerlynx's ability to reduce the risk of invasive recurrences by 34% over the course of two years, tucatinib's in a different league altogether. During the HER2Climb study with HER2-positive breast cancer patients, adding tucatinib to standard care reduced the risk of disease progression by 46% compared to standard care itself. Around half of the patients had tumors that had already spread to their brains, and among this difficult-to-treat group, adding tucatinib to standard care reduced their risk of death by an eye-popping 52%.Image source: Getty Images.In 2019, around 47,500 patients with HER2-positive tumors will receive their first breast cancer diagnosis. Seattle Genetics will probably submit a new drug application to the FDA in the first quarter of 2020 that could make tucatinib a lifesaver for members of this group. That isn't an enormous patient population, but it's more than enough to drive sales past $3 billion annually in 2025.Roughly 5,800 people will be diagnosed with HER2-positive colon cancer this year, and results of a phase 2 trial suggest tucatinib could be an effective treatment for this group as well.Seattle Genetics submitted an application in July for one of its late-stage ADCs called enfortumab vedotin. The Food and Drug Administration granted the application to treat bladder cancer a shortened review that should wrap up in January. That means the company could launch a new drug around the same time it sends the FDA tucatinib's first application.A little over a year ago, the FDA expanded Adcetris' addressable patient population to include newly diagnosed patients with Hodgkin lymphoma. In the first half of 2019, Adcetris sales surged 35% to $294 million, and a recent label expansion will allow the company's only revenue stream at the moment to continue growing at a rapid rate.Seattle Genetics' market cap has already risen to a whopping $17.1 billion at recent prices. That's a lot to pay for a company that generated only $758 million in top-line revenue over the past year. Operating expenses are still outrunning product sales and any hints of trouble for tucatinib, Adcetris, or enfortumab vedotin could lead to steep losses.Continued success on all three fronts could lead to market-beating return gains from recent prices, but it's probably best to wait for a significant pullback from this  before making a purchase.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Shares of   are up 15% at 11:55 a.m. EDT after the  reported positive results for the HER2CLIMB phase 2 study testing tucatinib in patients with late-stage breast cancer.Treatment with tucatinib plus 's Herceptin and Xeloda reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 46% compared to Herceptin and Xeloda alone. The triple combination also reduced the risk of death by 34% compared to Herceptin and Xeloda alone. Looking at the hard-to-treat patients whose breast cancer had moved to the patients' brain, the triple combination reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 52%.Tucatinib certainly isn't a cure, but the improvements over the control treatment are quite impressive and suggest the drug will be quickly adopted by doctors for late-stage patients once it's approved. More importantly, the solid efficacy data indicate tucatinib is likely to help earlier-stage patients, which would substantially increase the drug's potential market.Image source: Getty Images.Investors will get to see the full data during Seattle Genetics' presentation at the 2019 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium on Dec. 11.While HER2CLIMB is only a phase 2 clinical trial, the study should be enough to gain an accelerated approval from the Food and Drug Administration given the unmet need for the late-stage patients. Seattle Genetics plans to submit a marketing application in the first quarter of next year, which should result in an approval toward the end of the year.Tucatinib is also being tested in a phase 3 clinical trial of patients with earlier-stage breast cancer and a phase 2 study in patients with colorectal cancer.

rug development is hard and expensive, but so is commercialization.  that persevere and make it through late-stage pivotal trials face the challenges of gaining regulatory approval. Many biotech companies will never endure this because promising drug candidates often get licensed by more established commercial players with experience bringing new drugs to market.Preparing to launch a new drug can be quite expensive, particularly for large, fragmented patient populations. We will explore one company that recently had its first regulatory submission accepted for review and another that plans to refile its application by the end of the year.Photo by Thought CatalogIn September,  received  from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the New Drug Application of its sickle cell disease (SCD) drug voxelotor. This designation shortens the review time for approval from 10 to six months. The company should know the FDA's decision by February 20, 2020.The pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial results, published in  in August, demonstrated a statistically significant benefit for patients receiving voxelotor compared to those getting placebo. Until voxelotor, only symptomatic treatments for SCD have existed. If approved, the disease-modifying daily pill could become a blockbuster.Sickle cell disease impacts approximately 160,000 people in the U.S. and Europe. According to Global Blood, up to $186,000 is spent annually for patients with complications from sickle cell disease. Voxelotor should garner attractive pricing for the company if it can indeed reduce the overall financial burden on the healthcare system. The company embarked on an aggressive pre-approval awareness campaign to get the word out to doctors and health insurers. Global Blood states that 85% of U.S. SCD patients live in 17 states. A 75-person commercial team aims to engage with the medical community in those states to deliver voxelotor to patients.This company is a Wall Street darling, covered by 15 analysts. On Oct. 8, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Dr. Elemer Piros reiterated a buy rating and $110 price target. A day later, Wedbush analyst Liana Moussatos echoed that sentiment, reiterating a buy rating and a price target of $120. Global Blood should trade higher as the approval deadline in February approaches. The Phase 3 data are strong making approval likely. A big question for the board and management will be whether to remain independent or sell to a hungry pharma company. Either way, investors should benefit.It has not been smooth sailing this year for  . The company received the dreaded Complete Response Letter from the FDA regarding its antibody-drug conjugate sacituzumab govitecan. This means the FDA did not accept the application to review the drug for approval. The deficiency cited was based on an FDA pre-approval inspection of one of the manufacturing facilities. Shortly thereafter, its Chief Medical Officer left the company.In August, Immunomedics stated its intent to file the amended New Drug Application in the early part of its fourth quarter. This was subsequently pushed back to late November or early December. The FDA's acceptance of the filing will be a step in the right direction for the company. However, investors must be cautious not to interpret the FDA's willingness to review the submission as an indication of a future approval.Sacituzumab govitecan is an antibody-drug conjugate that allows for the delivery of a toxic payload to specific molecular target. Immunomedics conducted a Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with triple negative breast cancer who already received two prior therapies. The advanced condition of these patients makes it a challenging population to treat, and oncologists desperately seek new drugs for intervention. In the Phase 3 trial, sacituzumab govitecan posted progression-free survival of 5.5 months, which is double what has been reported with other therapies in similar patients. A confirmatory Phase 3 is under way. Additionally, Immunomedics recently reported  last month in metastatic urothelial cancer, a tumor that affects about 32,000 people in the U.S., Japan, and major European countries.Immunomedics is led by Executive Chairman Dr. Behzad Aghazadeh, a seasoned biotech investor at Avoro Capital. Not unexpectedly, Avoro owns 11% or 21 million shares, making it the company's largest shareholder. Dr. Aghazadeh gained control after a proxy battle in 2017 following a licensing deal for sacituzumab govitecan with . Avoro contended that terminating the license and developing the drug independently would yield greater value for shareholders.Avoro won the vote and ended the license. During this time, Immunomedics' stock appreciated from around $5 to $10 share up to $25 and is now in the $14 range. A successful filing this quarter and approval next year will likely send the stock back into the $20s or higher. However, if sacituzumab govitecan gets approved, Avoro will probably push for a sale given the expense and effort to successfully launch a drug. As substantial investors for several years, they likely want an exit if the acquisition premium is attractive.  While not for the faint of heart, binary events like drug approvals can provide meaningful upside for investors. Global Blood and Immunomedics appear to have reasonable chances for success, but the FDA wields the final decision.

Shares of   fell as much as 20.2% after the company disclosed through a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that Chief Commercial Officer Steven Lo will resign on Oct. 18 to become the CEO of an emerging pharmaceutical company. However, a departing executive isn't the real reason shares are tumbling. In an unrelated move, Goldman Sachs analyst Paul Choi downgraded Puma Biotechnology stock from neutral to sell, changed the price target from $24 to $8 per share, cut his 2025 sales estimate by 25%, and reminded investors that   has a drug candidate that might compete well against Puma's Nerlynx, according to . As of 11:08 a.m. EDT, Puma Biotechnology stock had settled to a 17.4% loss.Image source: Getty Images.Puma Biotechnology hasn't been able to convince investors or Wall Street that Nerlynx can live up to its blockbuster potential. The drug product, prescribed for one year to individuals that have completed treatment for breast cancer, has faltered recently. A significant number of individuals have to discontinue treatment due to severe side effects, although that decision is a lot easier for doctors to make considering .While Nerlynx has gradually earned supplemental approvals from regulators to expand its use, revenue growth has slowed significantly due to patient churn. Sales in the second quarter of 2019 grew only 6% from the year-ago period. Licensing revenue from international sales should begin to trickle in soon, and operating losses are beginning to shrink, but investors are concerned with the drug's future. Nerlynx is the only drug product or drug candidate owned by Puma Biotechnology.Nerlynx has struggled to overcome its own inherent problems relating to tolerability, which Choi thinks could be further exposed by a drug candidate from Seattle Genetics. Tucatinib is being evaluated in the same settings as Nerlynx, has proven to have fewer side effects, and is expected to have new data from an important clinical trial before the end of 2019. Choi thinks better tolerability could allow tucatinib to grab more market share than Nerlynx even if it proves less effective, but the drug candidate has to earn marketing approval first.It may be tempting to label , especially considering that the company's market cap now sits at just $325 million. On the one hand, the business could achieve sustainable operations with just a little more growth from Nerlynx. Choi's optimism for tucatinib from Seattle Genetics may be a bit premature and overblown. After all, many have questioned the value of Nerlynx based on its high cost and slight improvement to overall survival, so could a less effective drug really make a splash even if it has fewer side effects?On the other hand, Nerlynx is clearly not living up to expectations. It should receive a boost from recent supplemental approvals and international expansion, but investors might be better off waiting to see another quarter or two of operating results before getting too carried away.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''.  These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand.  Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).  Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

The European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) meeting, which wrapped up on Tuesday, featured presentations from a few smaller companies that saw their stock prices move substantially after the meeting.Data source: YCharts.Seattle Genetics  with a pair of clinical trials.Tucatinib helped 52.2% of late-stage colorectal cancer patients when combined with Roche's Herceptin. The results should give investors confidence in a late-stage study called Her2climb, testing tucatinib in patients with metastatic breast cancer, which is expected to read out later this year.Enfortumab vedotin (EV), which is up for Food and Drug Administration review in patients with late-stage urothelial cancer, also appears to help previously untreated patients with the same type of cancer when combined with 's  Keytruda. A solid 71% of patients responded to the combination.Immunomedics' sacituzumab govitecan (SG)  in 29% of patients with late-stage urothelial cancer. That shouldn't be compared to Seattle Genetics' 71% response rate for EV since these are late-stage patients who should be harder to treat. Unfortunately for Immunomedics, Seattle Genetics' late-stage patient data, currently under review by the FDA, showed 44% of patients responded to EV.Immunomedics also announced a delay in plans to resubmit its application for SG as a treatment for breast cancer that was  earlier this year. Instead of resubmitting the application early in the fourth quarter, Immunomedics now plans to file in late November or early December. A couple of months' delay shouldn't be that big a deal -- especially if it ultimately increases the likelihood of approval -- but short-minded investors might have been selling on the news.Image source: Getty Images.G1 Therapeutics  in June that its phase 2 trial of trilaciclib helped patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer live longer. The data presented at ESMO put some numbers to the results, showing trilaciclib plus chemotherapy helped patients live a median of 20.1 months compared to 12.6 months for patients taking chemotherapy alone.Maybe investors were expecting a larger difference, but more likely, the report ended up being a sell-the-news event, especially when combined with a second clinical trial presentation at ESMO for one of G1's other pipeline drugs that was rather disappointing.An early-stage study of G1T48 in a different type of breast cancer showed only 1 of the 19 evaluable patients experienced a partial response. Granted, these are late-stage patients who have failed multiple treatments, but a 5.3% response rate is still rather poor.Mirati Therapeutics didn't present any significant data at ESMO this year for its KRAS inhibitor MRTX849, but its shares fell because its competitor   presented miserable data for its competing KRAS inhibitor AMG 510. In an early-stage clinical trial, only 1 of the 12 colon cancer patients treated with the highest dose had a partial response to AMG 510.MRTX849 might be different enough to work, but the disappointment in colon cancer is likely a class effect, since Amgen has shown AMG 510 works well in lung cancer, where 54% of patients responded.When , it's usually better to jump in late after seeing good data than to try to catch the bottom after disappointing news, making Seattle Genetics the clear winner of the group.If you're dead set on investing in something on sale, the move in G1 Therapeutics looks overdone. But with a market cap that's still more than $850 million and no drugs on the market, it's hard to argue that G1 is a great value, even after the post-ESMO fall.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"Last week,  — and other monuments across the country — to mark the start of Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Over the last few months, survivors and supporters of those with childhood cancer rallied for the . And early in September, over 700 cancer patients and survivors lobbied U.S. legislators for increased funding. One key point in their efforts: Several of the drugs used to treat deadly forms of cancer are many decades old.For investors, these sociopolitical movements translate into the rise and fall of biotech stocks. Companies emerge, ready to tackle the problems of old drugs. In doing so, they capture massive attention and sometimes shoot high. And cancer drugs aren’t the only ones capturing this great demand. Plenty of current biotech companies have risen to address a host of rare diseases in hopes of launching a new — or potentially even the first — treatment on the market.But as much as the world is personally betting on a cure for cancer, the unfortunate reality is that not all promising biotech solutions pan out. This means these stocks are particularly volatile — and hinge heavily on approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. So what does this mean? While it’s a high risk, high reward space, following headlines of FDA approvals and positive trial results can really pay off.These ten biotech companies are all currently stocks to buy, thanks to their robust drug pipelines and encouraging FDA news.Source: nine muses / Shutterstock.com
	(NASDAQ:) has been a long-time darling in the biotech space. It is the industry leader in antibody-drug conjugates (ADC), which unlike other cancer treatments, aim to spare non-targeted cells. In traditional chemotherapy, cancer drugs are known for having more damaging effects because they kill healthy cells in addition to ones mutated by cancer.The company started 2019 with a bang, thanks to great news regarding Adcetris, its most famous drug. Already available in 65 countries, Adcetris treats Hodgkin Lymphoma, which is a form of cancer targeting the body’s immune system. Results from a Phase 3 clinical trial show that when combined with other chemo drugs, Adcetris , reducing the risk of death by as much as 34%.Plus, SGEN has other promising drugs in its pipeline. The stock is up 52% year-to-date, and rising higher after recent news. In a partnership with (OTCMKTS:), Seattle Genetics received  for enfortumab vedotin. SGEN and Astellas are investigating enfortumab vedotin as a treatment for urothelial cancer. What does this mean? The FDA extends Breakthrough Therapy designation to drugs that are intended to treat serious conditions and are likely to be much more effective over other existing treatments.And when a company receives Breakthrough Therapy designation, its stock usually pops.Just the other day, Seattle Genetics announced that when patients received enfortumab vedotin in combination with (NYSE:) Keytruda, the objective response rate was 71%. Investors can anticipate a final ruling from the FDA in March 2020 — so make sure to keep SGEN stock on your radar. Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com
	(NASDAQ:) is another biotech legend, and it’s up 57% year-to-date. While SGEN has Adcetris, Celgene has Revlimid, which is approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma (a cancer in plasma cells) and forms of anemia. Although Revlimid hasn’t been the cash generator CELG needed in 2019, the company is still on a roll.News that (NYSE:) would acquire Celgene dominated headlines at the start of the year, but the future of that acquisition remains unclear. BMY is in  to negotiate the planned $74 billion deal — to be the largest in the pharmaceutical industry. But Celgene isn’t stuck in a rut waiting.In August, the  — making it the first new drug in over a decade to treat myelofibrosis. Myelofibrosis is a rare form of cancer in the bone marrow.“Myelofibrosis can cause patients to suffer in many ways, including experiencing debilitating symptoms,” Mays Cancer Center Director Ruben Mesa, M.D. said in a press statement. “There has not been a new treatment approved for this disease in nearly a decade. With INREBIC, physicians and patients now have another option available for myelofibrosis.”There are still more reasons to put Celgene on your “buy” list. In mid-September, the company . Intended to treat acute myeloid leukemia, the drug was found to have a statistically significant impact on survival rates during a Phase 3 study. CELG will submit regulatory paperwork for the drug’s approval in early 2020.Source: Eyesonmilan / Shutterstock.com
	In just under 30 years, (NASDAQ:) has developed a robust pipeline of cancer-fighting drugs. And with news of new drugs on the market, INCY stock is up over 20% year-to-date.In May, the FDA approved Jakafi for the  (GVHD), which can occur any time after a transplant. Incyte’s Jakafi is the only FDA-approved drug for the rare disease. Prior to that news, Jakafi was FDA-approved to treat forms of blood cancer, including polycythemia vera and myelofibrosis.Thanks to this success, InvestorPlace’s James Brumley  for August and September. And analysts from Oppenheimer and Nomura recently reiterated “buy” calls for Incyte stock, with price targets of $100 and $110, respectively. That’s as much as 27% upside from its current price.“But, with double-digit sales growth expected this year and next thanks to strong interest in its relatively young cancer drug Jakafi, the odds of a breakout are a little too good to ignore,” Brumley wrote.I have to agree with Brumley. Make sure to keep INCY stock on your radar.Source: Denis Linine / Shutterstock.com
	One of the most exciting things about (NYSE:) is the fact that NVS markets a wide range of products — as many as 100 drugs in the U.S. Its drugs treat conditions from chronic migraines to psoriasis to ADHD. Oh, and it has a handful of cancer-fighting names in there, too.Like Seattle Genetics, Novartis recently was granted FDA , a drug designed to treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). NSCLC refers to a specific subset of rare lung cancers that are considered to be very aggressive. There is currently no approved treatment for these conditions on the market.There are two things to note here. To start, Incyte has actually been licensing capmatinib to Novartis since 2009. While Novartis definitely stands to gain, INCY could also see as much as . NVS plans to file regulatory paperwork sometime this quarter, so NVS stock is a great name to watch. This process is often associated with stock price rallies — and NVS is already up 12% year-to-date against broader industry declines.However, the second thing to note is that competition is fierce. Many biotech companies are trying to be the first to release a treatment for NSCLC. Merck’s Keytruda (referenced above) is also a competitor in the space.So while the future with capmatinib is uncertain, there is still a lot to like about Novartis. The company recently announced a partnership with (NASDAQ:). The  to streamline Novartis’ business practices and to tailor personalized treatments for patients. It’s no secret that artificial intelligence is hot in the investing world right now, so this could be a big boost to the NVS stock price.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com
	Although it doesn’t have the largest year-to-date gains on this list of biotech stocks to buy, MRK stock is still up 10% since the beginning of the year. Merck leads its peers in bringing the most FDA-approved new drugs to the market, whether through internal development or external licensing agreements.The week of Sept. 20 brought Novartis positive FDA news on two fronts. Merck’s Keytruda is sometimes referred to as a  It is already approved for a lengthy list of cancers, and MRK is awaiting approval to expand its reach. Most recently, the FDA granted accelerated approval for the use of Keytruda in combination with Lenvima (another of Merck’s medicines) . There are currently very few other treatment options for women with advanced-stage endometrial cancers on the market.Late September’s second positive announcement came in for one of Merck’s investigational vaccines, V920. The FDA accepted the biologics license application for the vaccine, which is a request to . A decision on V920, developed to treat the Ebola Zaire disease, should come Mar. 14, 2020.A sure strength with MRK stock is that it features both well-received cancer treatments and up-and-coming investigational medicines. Also in the pipeline are treatments for HIV, schizophrenia and pancreatic cancer.Source: Shutterstock
	(NASDAQ:) has soared high as a breakout biotech stock this year, up 740% year-to-date. In January 2019, AXSM stock traded for just over $2. Now shares are near $18.30. According to , Axsome Therapeutics is a “strong buy” with an average 12-month price target of $34.33. That’s 87% upside from here.So what happened to set AXSM stock off running? One of Axsome Therapeutics’ , AXS-05, received Breakthrough Therapy designation in March 2019. Although the company has no approved drugs on the market, it is exciting investors with its potential. AXS-05 received  to explore its use in treating treatment-resistant depression and agitation in Alzheimer’s.The company is also studying its use in supporting smoking cessation and in treating major depressive disorder.In  year-to-date gains, AXSM was also added to the and indices in July 2019.Unlike some of the other names on this list, Axsome Therapeutics reflects the high-risk, high-reward side of biotech stocks. Because it lacks currently approved drugs, a lot is riding on its investigational therapies. While AXS-05 is promising thus far, investors should be cautious with this stock to buy.Source: Shutterstock
	(NASDAQ:) is undergoing a major . Previously, much of the company’s focus was on anti-inflammatory and antacid drugs. But these treatments for more common maladies limited HZNP’s pricing power.Now, Horizon Therapeutics is marketing itself as a manufacturer of orphan drugs — therapies for rare diseases lacking effective treatments. Often these orphan drugs require federal support, but the biotech companies behind them have more control in setting their prices. The company is up 33% year-to-date, and is awaiting a decision regarding FDA approval for its first foray into the so-called orphan drug business.September was a busy month for biotech stocks. The FDA accepted HZNP’s  for the treatment of active thyroid eye disease (TED). The federal administration also granted the application Priority Review designation. If approved, teprotumumab would be the first treatment for active TED.Active TED is a condition where inflammation is present in the eye muscles, eyelids and the eye’s fatty tissues. Approximately 1 million Americans are diagnosed with the condition each year, so FDA approval could significantly boost the company’s sales.Source: Shutterstock
	(NASDAQ:) and the next name on this list of stocks to buy are both top holdings in the (NASDAQ:), along with Seattle Genetics. CNCR is an exchange-traded fund, designed around a specific set of cancer treatments.“Immunotherapy is a transformational field within the biotechnology space that may have a foundational impact on cancer care,” the fund’s page reads. “… Our ETF seeks to support this important work and its positive impact on society.”Compared to CNCR’s essentially flat performance, YMAB stock is up 33% since January. However, its current price near $25 is off its mid-September high above $31. Beyond the socially conscious investing thesis, Y-mAbs Therapeutics also has some exciting drugs in its pipeline.In July 2019, Y-mAbs received  after a meeting with the FDA. Because of this designation, the company will start to submit its biologics licensing materials on a rolling basis. Naxitamab is in clinical trials to determine its effectiveness in treating specific types of neuroblastoma, a type of cancer that predominantly affects children.The company’s other drug in Phase 3 trials, omburtamab, is also a proposed treatment for neuroblastoma. In early phase trials it prolonged survival among high-risk patients.Like Axsome Therapeutics, this is a high-risk, high-reward situation as investors wait to hear the FDA’s decision on the two potential neuroblastoma treatments. But with , its a stock to buy now.Source: Shutterstock
	The third-largest holding in the CNCR ETF, (NYSE:) is up almost 83% year-to-date. The Canadian biotech company has two drugs in clinical development and a handful of drugs in pre-clinical development.Exciting news for the company came in May, when its biggest asset ZW25 received Breakthrough Therapy designation. This asset uses the company’s Azymetric platform, which essentially helps bind existing drugs or antigens (which connect antibodies) together. The ongoing clinical trials are studying the impact of ZW25 on gastric and breast cancers.“Receipt of Fast Track designation from the FDA emphasizes the large unmet need of patients with these types of HER2-expressing cancers,” CEO Ali Tehrani . “This designation is key to our objective of getting important new therapies to patients as quickly as possible.”Also in the Zymeworks pipeline are drugs aimed at treating various types of tumors. Although this is another potentially volatile company, analysts at Raymond James just upgraded ZYME stock to a “strong buy,” noting that it appeared  The firm set raised its price target to $40 — reflecting 66% upside from its current price near $24.Source: Shutterstock
	The last company on this list of stocks to buy, (NASDAQ:), went public just in July 2019. Its IPO raised $582 million, making it the second-largest biotech IPO in the U.S. It opened July 18 at $18.25 and now sits near $19.30.Beyond its IPO buzz, it is also a biotech stock to watch because it is the largest holding in the (NYSEARCA:). According to the fund’s investment objective, IDNA supports investing in what will prove to be .Genmab has two products on the market: Darzalex and Arzerra. Darzalex treats forms of blood cancers, including multiple myeloma and leukemia as well as amyloidosis, a rare disease caused by abnormal protein buildup. Arzerra treats leukemia and multiple sclerosis. Arzerra is marketed through a partnership with Novartis.In the pipeline, GMAB is researching treatments for cervical and ovarian cancers and Parkinson’s disease. Plus, it has partnered with Horizon Therapeutics in studying teprotumumab.Since the company is relatively new to the public markets, it will be important to watch over the coming weeks. Genmab will report its financial information for the first nine months of 2019 on Nov. 6. Investors should pay close to attention to GMAB stock then. For now, the four analysts who cover it have it as a “strong buy” with an average price target of $23.50.Sarah Smith is a web editor at InvestorPlace.

Shares of   jumped 17.6% in September, according to data provided by , as the biotech rounded out the month with positive data from a pair of clinical trials  at the 2019 European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress.In a phase 2 clinical trial, Seattle Genetics' tucatinib combined with 's Herceptin produced a response in 52.2% of patients with a specific type of late-stage colorectal cancer. There wasn't a control group that received placebo or an alternative drug, but these patients had already failed two treatments, so over half of the 23 patients responding was quite impressive.Image source: Getty Images.The second ESMO presentation was for an early stage study testing Seattle Genetics' enfortumab vedotin (EV) with 's  Keytruda in patients with previously untreated, locally advanced, or metastatic urothelial cancer who can't take a chemotherapy called cisplatin. The combination produced a response in 71% of the patients, including 13% with a complete response and 58% with a partial response.The second study didn't have a control, either, but a clinical trial run by Merck testing Keytruda as a monotherapy in similar patients produced a response rate of 29%. Even in patients with high expression of PD-L1, the pathway that Keytruda targets, the response rate was only 47%, so adding EV seems to be substantially increasing the efficacy.Seattle Genetics will likely have to test EV plus Keytruda in an additional clinical trial before gaining regulatory approval in newly diagnosed urothelial cancer patients, but EV is already under FDA review for patients with late-stage urothelial cancer who have received a PD-1/L1 inhibitor, such as Keytruda. Assuming the drug is approved, which seems likely, some doctors may use it off-label for previously untreated patients, or, at the very least, the ESMO data offer additional efficacy evidence that should persuade doctors to use the drug on late-stage patients.Tucatinib is also being tested in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the Her2Climb clinical trial that should be sufficient to gain regulatory approval if the data are positive. In addition to expanding the potential market, the colorectal cancer data provide additional evidence that tucatinib is working, which should give  increased confidence in a positive outcome for the Her2Climb study.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

There are 12 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Seattle Genetics Inc, but the average is just that — a mathematical average.  There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $53.00.  And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $98.00.  The standard deviation is $12.493.


But the whole reason to look at the average SGEN price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes.  And so with SGEN crossing above that average target price of $80.92/share, investors in SGEN have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $80.92 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

Shares of the mid-cap    were down by 12% as of 1:20 p.m EDT today on heavy volume. Why are investors running for the door today?Immunomedics shares are falling in response to the company's clinical update at the 2019 European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress over the weekend. Specifically, the biotech unveiled interim data at the conference from a midstage study evaluating sacituzumab govitecan (SG) in patients with advanced urothelial cancer (bladder cancer) who have relapsed or are refractory to immune checkpoint inhibitors and platinum-based chemotherapy. The drug reportedly achieved a 29% overall response rate (ORR) during this preliminary peek at the data.Image source: Getty Images.While a 29% ORR for advanced bladder cancer isn't a shabby outcome by any stretch of the imagination, investors seem to be concerned that   may have a more potent candidate for this high-value indication.During the same conference, Seattle Genetics  for its combo therapy, consisting of enfortumab vedotin and's Keytruda, as a treatment for previously untreated bladder cancer in patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease who were ineligible for treatment with cisplatin-based chemotherapy. This combo therapy reportedly produced a 71% confirmed objective response rate in the study.  Should investors hit the panic button? Certainly not. There should be plenty of room for both treatments once the dust settles. Also, Seattle Genetics' ORR in advanced bladder cancer could perk up as the data mature. Put simply, the market appears to be overreacting to this preliminary peek at Seattle Genetics' bladder cancer data.    When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"nvestors in Seattle Genetics Inc (Symbol: SGEN) saw new options begin trading this week, for the January 2022 expiration.  One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 856 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the SGEN options chain for the new January 2022 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $70.00 strike price has a current bid of $13.50.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $70.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $56.50 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of SGEN, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $72.09/share today.

Because the $70.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 67%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 19.29% return on the cash commitment, or 8.22% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.


Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Seattle Genetics Inc, and highlighting in green where the $70.00 strike is located relative to that history:


   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $80.00 strike price has a current bid of $14.40.  If an investor was to purchase shares of SGEN stock at the current price level of $72.09/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $80.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 30.95% if the stock gets called away at the January 2022 expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if SGEN shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Seattle Genetics Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing SGEN's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $80.00 strike highlighted in red:



   
Considering the fact that the $80.00 strike represents an approximate 11% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 39%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 19.98% boost of extra return to the investor, or 8.52% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.


The implied volatility in the put contract example, as well as the call contract example, are both approximately 48%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $72.09) to be 48%.

Shares of   are up 12% at 12:05 p.m. EDT after the biotech presented a pair of positive clinical trial results at the 2019 European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress.In a phase 2 clinical trial testing Seattle Genetics' tucatinib with 's Herceptin in patients with a specific type of late-stage colorectal cancer, over half of the 23 patients responded to the therapy. The combination delayed the progression of the tumor and/or death by 8.1 months. Patients lived for a median of 18.7 months.There wasn't a control arm to compare the data with, but these are heavily treated patients who have already failed two other approved treatments, so a 52.2% response rate is pretty impressive.Image source: Getty Images.Seattle Genetics also presented initial data from a phase 1 clinical trial, dubbed EV-103, testing its enfortumab vedotin (EV) with's  Keytruda in patients with previously untreated, locally advanced, or metastatic urothelial cancer who can't take a chemotherapy called cisplatin. The response rate for the combination was 71% for the 45 patients, with 13% having a complete response and the other 58% having a partial response.There wasn't a control arm to compare the data with in this study, either, but a phase 2 study that Merck used to get Keytruda approved for urothelial cancer patients who can't take cisplatin showed 29% of patients responded to the drug. Even in patients with high expression of PD-L1, the pathway that Keytruda targets, the response rate was only 47%, substantially below the 71% response rate for the combination.Both drugs are already in late-stage testing -- EV is already under Food and Drug Administration review -- but the data at ESMO will help the  expand the potential market for both drugs.EV is under FDA review for patients with late-stage urothelial cancer who have already received a PD-1/L1 inhibitor, such as Keytruda, so moving it into the first-line setting would greatly increase the number of urothelial cancer patients eligible to take EV.Tucatinib is in a late-stage trial called Her2climb in patients with metastatic breast cancer, so the data in colorectal cancer offers a new opportunity to expand into an additional tumor type, while also giving investors additional confidence that Her2climb will be positive.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"egendary investor Warren Buffett advises to be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful.  One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100.  A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.

In trading on Tuesday, shares of Seattle Genetics Inc (Symbol: SGEN) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 29.2, after changing hands as low as $65.44 per share.  By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) is 53.0.  A bullish investor could look at SGEN's 29.2 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.    The chart below shows the one year performance of SGEN shares:
   
   

Looking at the chart above, SGEN's low point in its 52 week range is $50.71 per share, with $84.37 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $66.66.

That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.{% render_component 'sa-returns-as-of' type='rg'%}Welcome to , the show that dives into a different sector of the stock market every single day. Today is Wednesday, Oct. 2, and we're talking . I'm Shannon Jones, your host, and I am joined by healthcare guru Todd Campbell. Todd, how's it going?I'm doing well, Shannon. As always, happy to be here and talk all things, healthcare. One of my favorite treats of the week, and today is no exception, because we're going to be diving into Amazon's latest step into healthcare and what that could mean for Fool favorites like Teladoc. We're also going to be diving into one of the biggest cancer conferences that just happened in Europe, giving you some updates there.Todd, let's kick things off with Amazon. For those that don't know, that's ticker symbol AMZN. Amazon has been making a series of moves into the healthcare space. They just announced something called Amazon Care, a new way of delivering healthcare to its employees. Todd, what exactly is happening here?What's interesting is, everybody's so fascinated by Amazon because they have this tendency to approach something as an internal project, and then boom, it becomes a business model and a source of revenue. With so much money at stake in healthcare, the thinking has been that Amazon has larger designs than just simply offering better healthcare to its own employees. What we saw in 2018 was Amazon teaming up with and to create Haven, a research-driven company that's going to try and find better ways to deliver healthcare to their employees. More recently, this week, Amazon rolled out something that they're calling Amazon Care. It's going to begin for employees only in the Seattle area, but it's widely expected that if it works well, they'll roll that out to other geographic areas of the country where they happen to employ a lot of people.What Amazon Care is going to do for those employees, it's going to provide them with telemedicine, so, virtual health visits with a doctor. It's going to provide employees with an opportunity for an at-home visit, if, for example, a test needs to get done and they need to collect a sample, like a blood sample. They're going to be delivering prescriptions straight to the home. And they're going to incorporate a chat feature that allows you, if you have a quick question, to be able to chat quickly with, say, a nurse or a nurse practitioner.One of the things that's really fascinating about this is, it shows just how focused big companies are on trying to figure out how to rein in this Goliath, this unstoppable force that is healthcare spending.Yes, and it's really no wonder that Amazon is taking the approach of this employer-based model to try to drive down costs. There was a recent survey from Kaiser Foundation, about half of the U.S. right now is receiving some employer-sponsored health insurance. In 2019, annual family premiums for employer health insurance rose 5% to an average of $20,576. If we break that down a little bit further, workers are actually paying roughly about $6,000 toward that premium cost. That means employers are having to foot the bill for about 75%. With half the population getting their insurance, it makes complete sense to me that as Amazon tries to tackle, basically, the war on healthcare spending, it makes sense to me to do it, of course, in-house, as they always have done with many of their initiatives, and focus on that employer-based model.I've mentioned the Haven healthcare that they're doing. Would not surprise me at all to see this rolled up into that initiative. They've been pretty mum about what's happening with Berkshire and JP Morgan, and Amazon with this initiative. But I could easily see that.You also can't forget, they did that acquisition with PillPack, the online pharmacy, back in June. And, they just announced that they are actually rolling out earbuds. They're getting into the earbuds business with a project that will basically allow you to put an earbud in your ear, and it basically becomes a fitness tracker. This is a really interesting move, especially with the likes of , which recently made its debut onto the market, digital health monitoring. Livongo was actually the first company to have an Alexa-enabled skill built in for controlling diabetes. You see Amazon taking this series of steps to try to tackle not just healthcare spending, but also drive actual patient outcomes over the long term as well. You hit on an important number, and I'm going to drive that home for investors and listeners. Private health insurance spending: $1.2 trillion-plus annually. $1.2 trillion. What's really interesting -- I've talked about this a lot in the past -- we focus a lot of attention on trying to curb spending on drug prices and drug costs. The reality is that we spend way more money on physician and clinical services. We spend, as a healthcare system, $3.5 trillion a year, and 20% of that is on physician and clinical services. If you really want to move the needle on cost, you've got to figure out -- we keep doing these demand-oriented solutions, where we're going to increase access to care. That doesn't help on price. We really need to start focusing on innovative new ways to increase supply. Make supply more efficient. One of the best ways, in my view, to do that is to make the best use of the time that you have available now. If you have a doctor available today, take a look at how much of that doctor's time is being spent on things like patient cancellations, or admin duties, and say, ""We're going to remove all of that, and we're just going to allow you to meet with patients on-demand as they need it."" We've seen this in the industry. We mentioned Teladoc at the top of the show. The average meeting on a virtual health [platform] is only 15 or 20 minutes, something like that. So you can pack these right in, and you never have to worry about someone no-showing. And then, of course, from the employee side or the patient side, what a convenience factor. You've got the flu? You don't have to drag yourself out of bed. You can just go on your app, click a button, and find out if you need a prescription.Great point, Todd. Going back to Teladoc, I think the question right now on a lot of investors' minds -- here at The Fool, we follow Teladoc quite a bit, ticker TDOC. Teladoc is far and away the leader in the telemedicine space. It's hard for some of the competitors out there to even try to match what they're doing. They've got an expert panel of doctors. They employ around 50,000 medical experts across 450 different specialties. They have a little over 26 million paying members, and that's still less than 10% of the U.S. opportunity ahead of them. Todd, the question is, what does this mean for Teladoc? One of the first things I think of is, why isn't Amazon buying or partnering with Teladoc when they have such an expansive reach? They have so much technology already at their disposal. If you're not convinced yet that you want to go this direction, it's better probably to do something small, internally. Then, when you decide that you want to roll this out or do something broader, then go out, maybe, and do an acquisition.Teladoc is down 10% as of the time of recording, 10% in one day. That follows, obviously, getting hit on this Amazon news. I think that's a complete overreaction. Listen, Teladoc did 2.8 million visits last year. They'll probably do 4 million visits this year. Shannon, how many primary care visits would you guess happen in the U.S. every year?Oh, gosh. Just throw a number out. I'll say 5 million. Primary care visits in the U.S.: 500 million. Half a billion visits. So, to be concerned about the growth opportunity ahead of Teladoc with Amazon dipping its toe in, I think that's foolish. This might be a buying opportunity presenting itself here. It's something, obviously, we're going to want to watch. But I think this market is so big that you're not just going to have one player.Exactly. Telehealth is the way of the future. It's not just Teladoc. You're seeing other medical specialties jump on the telehealth bandwagon with teledentistry now. That is the way of the world. If I'm an investor, I want to invest where I think the world is going and the future that I want to see. Teladoc is one of those companies.Alright. In other news, we do have some big updates on companies that recently presented at one of Europe's most closely watch medical conferences. That's none other than the European Society of Medical Oncology, or ESMO, as we like to call it. The first update actually came from biotech behemoth Amgen, ticker AMGN. This is a company that made headlines for one of its drugs. It turned a lot of heads earlier this year, in June and again in September, for impressive results related to its drug AMG 510, specifically in lung cancer. But, for this conference, Amgen released data for AMG 510 in colorectal cancer. Todd, what did we see in this indication? This is part of this whole idea of getting to precision medicine, where we're actually able to drill right down and find these targets that we wouldn't have been able to find before, and actually be able to move the needle, not based on where the cancer originated, but basically based on the makeup of it or the causes behind it. In this case, we're targeting something called KRAS. We're specifically targeting KRAS G12C. That's found in about 13% of non-small-cell lung cancers, about 3% to 5% of colorectal cancers. And, we're talking about a patient population that Amgen estimates is about 30,000 people diagnosed every year. They've known about this as a target for a long time. But up until very recently, they considered it undruggable, they couldn't figure out a way to exploit it. As a result, a lot of people were thinking, ""This could be a really exciting opportunity for Amgen,"" and for one of its competitors, which we'll talk about in a second.But, all of the hype you saw earlier in the year fizzled out a little bit on this latest update at ESMO, because in the colorectal cancer group, the results were nothing overly spectacular. The cohort that was available was only 12 patients. That's a very small number of people. We have to keep that mind. But, only one patient experienced a partial response. That's an 8% response rate. They did argue that 10 of the patients had stable disease. That's a disease control rate of 92%. But we're talking a very, very short window of time to be evaluating that. So, I think a lot of people came out of the ESMO update for Amgen and said, ""Oh, maybe this isn't as exciting as we once thought it to be."" Yeah, so true. You mentioned, with this particular target, the KRAS target, as being undruggable. We've known about this target for over 30 years now. Trying to figure out a way to crack the code has been tough. It comes down to a lack of binding pockets on the surface of the protein itself. Amgen was hoping, with this drug in colorectal cancer, that they could crack the drug in this particular indication. But I think what we're seeing time and time again is, colorectal cancer is an indication that is not a mono-therapy indication. You're probably going to have to go at it with some sort of combination strategy. I think what's driving this is that colorectal cancer is so different. There are probably several mutations that are happening to actually drive this cancer growth. We don't necessarily know what those are, but it becomes a much harder target to go after.There is another company that is going after this opportunity, and it's a company called , MRTX. They've got their drug, MRT849 that they're studying in this indication. We could actually get data from them later in the month. There is a cancer meeting happening at the end of October that we'll be closely watching to see where they are going in this particular space. Right. It's very important for investors now to shift their focus to thinking about that. What we saw earlier in the year is, when Amgen reported data that was viewed more positively, Mirati's share price took off. Then, we saw some data that was a little bit meh, and Mirati's shares took off again because people were thinking, ""Maybe Mirati has a better drug in development. Maybe they could deliver better results."" Again, no data yet to be able to parse out of Mirati on their drug.This time around, Mirati did fall. It's going to be very important -- Mirati doesn't have any drugs on the market right now. Roughly $3 billion market cap. So, all eyes now for investors should shift to Mirati, and see what their data looks like at the end of the month.Exactly. Still, for Amgen, a big lung cancer opportunity. We're by no means writing off this drug. We're just getting closer now in the science where we're starting to see where that personalized medicine approach does work and where it doesn't. I think what's even more helpful is seeing the efficacy data.Let's talk about another update, and that is none other than Seattle Genetics, ticker SGEN, along with its partner Astellas also reported data at ESMO. They're studying a drug called enfortumab vedotin. Why couldn't they make it one word, Todd? Why did they have to have two difficult words for the name of this drug? Anyway, they're studying it in combination with 's immuno-oncology wonder drug Keytruda in a certain type of bladder cancer. What did we see there, Todd? Let's just call it EV for short. I like it. This is a really interesting medicine. It's an antibody drug conjugate. Basically, what you're doing is, you're taking something that can go out and attach itself to a molecule, and then you're taking that and combining it with something that can then cause the cancer cell to die. This is a very intriguing approach. The whole mechanism of action has been proven out because Seattle Genetics already has one of their drugs on the market in a different indication. What we saw at ESMO was Seattle Genetics and its partner Astellas, they're partnered on this drug 50/50. Each of them shares 50% of the cost to produce it, and if it gets approved and hits the market, they'll share 50% of the profits.What they reported was that if you used this particular medicine, EV, you can actually have really strong response rates in first-line cancer. That's really impressive, first-line bladder cancer. The confirmed objective response rate was 71%. The complete response rate was 13%. And yeah, obviously, there were some adverse events and such, but they looked pretty manageable.Now, that's really encouraging because they already have filed for approval and received priority review status from the FDA for this medicine, EV, in later-line use. So, heavily pre-treated patients who are out of other treatment options. A decision on that is expected in March 2020. This data that just came out of ESMO, in my view, not only increases the possibility, the likelihood, of the FDA giving this a green light in the later lines, but eventually getting this so that it can get a label expansion into the early lines, which, of course, allows for more patients to be treated and theoretically more revenue and increased profitability.Yeah. You mentioned the safety issues. I think it was 51% had at least a serious side effect. Grade three. There was one patient that did die, unfortunately. This was a patient that had multiple diseases and died due to multiple organ dysfunction. But ultimately, Todd, these results here well beat chemotherapy alone. That has about a 41% objective response rate. The data coming out of ESMO for this company, just like you said, it's extremely encouraging, extremely impressive.Doesn't mean there's not competition out there, though, because there is a smaller company, , IMMU. They've got a therapy out there, similar target, saw 29% of its patients respond. Of course, their shares took a tumble off of this news coming out of Seattle Genetics. All in all, Seattle Genetics, looking at this data, definitely gets a checkmark from me. Granted, there are some safety concerns, but all in all, pretty impressive.Yeah. To put some numbers out there for listeners to keep in mind, 12,000 people in the U.S. roughly pass away because of late-stage bladder cancer. That would be, theoretically, the target market initially, if it is approved next March, those 12,000 patients with limited treatment options. And then, overall, about 82,000 Americans are diagnosed with bladder cancer in the U.S. every year. Theoretically, six times more if they eventually get the approval for earlier line therapy.Yeah. A lot to watch here. I believe they've got a March 2020 PDUFA date. That's when we could see approval here. We still need to see durability of these responses over time. But all in all, positive checkmarks.As for us, that'll do it for this week's  show. If you're looking for more stock ideas and recommendations, be sure to check out our service.

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. 	For the iShares Morningstar Mid-Cap Growth ETF (Symbol: JKH), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $272.52 per unit.


With JKH trading at a recent price near $245.76 per unit, that means that analysts see 10.89% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings.   Three of JKH's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Zscaler Inc (Symbol: ZS), MercadoLibre Inc (Symbol: MELI), and Seattle Genetics Inc (Symbol: SGEN). Although ZS has traded at a recent price of $69.16/share, the average analyst target is 12.93% higher at $78.10/share. Similarly, MELI has 11.17% upside from the recent share price of $588.15 if the average analyst target price of $653.88/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting SGEN to reach a target price of $81.23/share, which is 10.92% above the recent price of $73.23. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of ZS, MELI, and SGEN:  

   Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:

Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

"nvestors in Seattle Genetics Inc (Symbol: SGEN) saw new options become available this week, for the October 18th expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the SGEN options chain for the new October 18th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $75.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.80.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $75.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $71.20 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of SGEN, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $79.38/share today.

Because the $75.00 strike represents an approximate 6% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 66%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.07% return on the cash commitment, or 31.34% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.


Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Seattle Genetics Inc, and highlighting in green where the $75.00 strike is located relative to that history:


   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $85.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.10.  If an investor was to purchase shares of SGEN stock at the current price level of $79.38/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $85.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 12.24% if the stock gets called away at the October 18th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if SGEN shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Seattle Genetics Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing SGEN's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $85.00 strike highlighted in red:



   
Considering the fact that the $85.00 strike represents an approximate 7% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 59%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.17% boost of extra return to the investor, or 31.95% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.


The implied volatility in the put contract example, as well as the call contract example, are both approximately 54%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $79.38) to be 47%.

hen looking for compelling stocks with significant long-term growth potential, investors will often turn to biotechs. A biotech is any company that uses technology involving living organisms to create medical or agricultural products. The S&P Biotechnology Select Industry Index, the biotech section of the index, gained 18% over the last ten years. Many analysts and financial bloggers believe that this trend will persist. But how do investors know which biotech stocks are ready to grow?As investors, we look at a combination of factors rather than a single metric to make the most informed decisions. These factors can include analyst ratings, insider activity, news sentiment and financial blogger opinions. The Smart Score metric weighs these factors and combines them into a single numerical score with 10 being the highest.Here are 3 biotech stocks that scored a “Perfect 10.”GILD researches, develops and commercializes antiviral drugs primarily used for the treatment of HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C and influenza.The company will report its Q2 2019 earnings on July 30. According to recent consensus estimates, it is expected to see a 2% dip in revenue from the prior-year quarter to $5.5 billion. EPS is expected to be $6.90, up 4% year-over-year. While the revenue projection is worrisome, the company has made significant efforts to pull off a turnaround.On March 28, Gilead and its partner, Galapagos NV (), announced positive results from its phase 3 clinical study testing its filgotinib drug to treat rheumatoid arthritis. The study demonstrated the drug’s improved efficacy when compared to other treatment options. The company announced on July 15 that it will invest $5.1 billion to increase its stake in Galapagos. This will allow both companies to research and bring new treatments to the market over the next ten years.The company also announced on July 19 that it would be licensing three preclinical programs from its competitor, Novartis AG (). The deal gives GILD exclusive rights to develop and create commercial treatments using several small molecules that have the potential to treat human rhinovirus, influenza and herpes. As per the terms of the agreement, NVS received an upfront payment for an undisclosed amount, and will potentially get an additional $291 million in milestone payments and royalties on annual net sales.Top financial blogger,  writes, “If nothing else, GILD belongs on your list of stocks to buy thanks to its cash position. Even under a challenging environment, Gilead managed nearly $12 billion in operating cash flow last year. The company is more than stable enough to continue supporting its dividend yield, which currently stands at 3.68%.”Five-star analyst from Wells Fargo, , agrees that investors should still pick GILD. On July 15, he upgraded the stock to a Buy and raised his price target from $68 to $88, suggesting 35% upside. “We expect GILD earnings growth to reaccelerate beyond 2020 on continued HIV product growth and on incremental contribution from Galapagos-Partnership programs in fibrosis and inflammation,” he said. The analyst has a 22% average return per rating.The Street is cautiously optimistic on GILD. The “Perfect 10” stock has a ‘Moderate Buy’ analyst consensus and an $81 average price target, indicating 25% upside potential. It also boasts bullish financial blogger and news sentiment. SGEN is the innovative biotech company known for using monoclonal antibody-based therapies to develop treatments for cancer. Share prices have soared 32% year-to-date, with the word on the Street being that there’s more growth to come.Based on the company’s July 16 earnings release, things are looking good. Its Q2 2019 revenue was up 28% year-over-year to $218 million from the prior-year quarter. Sales of Adcetris, the company’s lymphoma drug, increased 30% year-over-year in the U.S. and Canada. Management attributes this jump to the drug’s improved treatment of peripheral T-cell lymphoma and frontline Hodgkin lymphoma. Its full year guidance is forecasting $610 million to $640 in Adcetris sales. The company also saw royalty revenue surge by 13% year-over-year.At the beginning of July, SGEN announced it submitted a marketing application to the FDA for a new urothelial cancer treatment with its partner, Astellas Pharma. If the drug is approved, shares could rise even more.Piper Jaffray analyst, , agrees with that sentiment. On July 17, he upgraded the stock to a Buy and raised the price target from $64 to $75. “We believe Seattle Genetics’ 2019 guidance of $610M-$640M is well within reach while it has the opportunity to report positive data from multiple potential registration trials over the next 12 months,” he said.Another top analyst, , maintained his Buy rating while raising the price target from $79 to $80, suggesting 7% upside. The RBC Capital analyst said on July 17, “The Adcetris beat adds commercial excitement to catalyst rich H2. We conservatively increase FY19 Adcetris sales estimates to the high end of FY19 guide ($610M-$640M) noting high probability of beat/raise in quarters ahead.”SGEN has a ‘Moderate Buy’ analyst consensus, with 6 Buy ratings vs 4 Holds received over the last three months. It has an average price target of $79, suggesting 4% upside. Financial bloggers and hedge funds are bullish the stock. Over the last quarter, hedge funds have increased their SGEN holdings by 113,000 shares.The last “Perfect 10” on our list is dedicated to discovering new cystic fibrosis (CF) treatments. CF is a genetic disorder that primarily affects the lungs and causes difficulty breathing. While share prices have only increased 5% year-to-date, the company’s broad product pipeline inspires confidence.The company controls a majority of the cystic fibrosis market space, as its drugs treat the underlying causes of the genetic disease. VRTX believes that it has only reached half of the patients that could benefit from these treatments. Management believes they can expand their patient base by another 50% through additional treatments for younger patients.Not to mention VRTX stands to grow its reach even further. The company plans to file a triple-drug combo for FDA approval to help it access more of the market as well as develop therapies for other diseases.On June 7, VRTX announced that it entered into a definitive agreement worth $245 million to acquire all outstanding shares of gene editing therapies developer Exonics Therapeutics. Exonics’ technology will allow VRTX to offer treatments for other genetic diseases such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD).Ahead of its July 31 earnings release, the company is expected to deliver gains. According to consensus estimates, revenue could reach $884 billion, up 18% year-over-year. Quarterly EPS should also see an increase of 11%, reaching $1.04 per share.H.C. Wainwright analyst, , is optimistic about this biotech. On July 22, he reiterated his Buy rating and price target of $220, suggesting 27% upside. He notes that while the company runs the risk of “failure in further combination clinical studies, failure to achieve peak sales revenue and product competition”, he maintains his bullish thesis.Top financial blogger,  writes, “In the past I have usually cautioned about its relatively high stock price and market capitalization compared to other large-cap biotechs, but its pipeline is broad and deep, which is a good sign for long-term investors,” he said.The Street is bullish on VRTX. The stock boasts a ‘Strong Buy’ analyst consensus and a $215 average price target, suggesting 23% upside. It also has a very bullish sentiment from news outlets, with positive technicals and fundamentals.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@3 'Perfect 10' Biotech Companies to Buy@2019-07-25@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-perfect-10-biotech-companies-to-buy-2019-07-25

"fter a ,   picked up the pace in the second quarter, with doctors increasing their use of Adcetris early in the treatment paradigm for various types of lymphoma.Data source: Seattle Genetics.Image source: Getty Images.Clay Siegall, Seattle Genetics' president, CEO, and chairman,  how following the progression-free survival (PFS) in frontline Hodgkin lymphoma patients for longer has helped drive sales: ""Going from the two-year data that we produced when we first got approval to the 37-month data that came out with PFS -- I think that caught a lot of doctors' attention. And so, they looked at this, they saw it, and they were more comforted by that.""Given the great quarter, multiple analysts asked why the company wasn't raising Adcetris' sales guidance for 2019. Siegall's response was the equivalent of a shoulder shrug emoji:I know we had a bunch of questions on guidance, it's hard to really give guidance on this. We're in uncharted territory in frontline Hodgkin, in frontline PTCL, and the data we have is great. The age data is great, doctors are rallying to this, and we're out there trying to do the best we can by patients. And what I would say is, stay tuned on this, and we'll provide you with whatever data and follow up that we can when it's appropriate.In Siegall's defense, most biotechs don't give guidance during a drug's initial launch, but Seattle Genetics previously gave Adcetris guidance when the drug was growing slower in the initial indications it was approved for. The company either had to not give guidance during this second growth phase or throw out conservative numbers it's confident it can hit.Unfortunately, neither option is very satisfying to investors and analysts.While Adcetris' guidance didn't change, management did increase expectations for collaboration and licensing agreements to a range of $110 million to $125 million, up from $95 million to $110 million. On the expenses side, management is looking to spend more on selling, general, and administrative expenses as it hires a sales force to launch enfortumab vedotin.On the pipeline front, look for data from the Her2climb clinical trial of tucatinib in patients with metastatic breast cancer this year. And in the first half of next year, Seattle Genetics and partner  will get data from a clinical trial testing tisotumab vedotin in patients with late-stage cervical cancer. If positive, both studies should be enough to gain FDA approval for the respective drugs.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Seattle Genetics wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.  The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Seattle Genetics Hits Its Second Growth Phase@2019-07-18@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/seattle-genetics-hits-its-second-growth-phase-2019-07-18

he stock market moved lower on Wednesday, driven by rising concerns on the trade front that could have a negative impact on companies as they begin to announce their second-quarter financial results. The threat of new tariffs remains in place despite the announcements that the White House made in the aftermath of the G-20 summit meeting, and investors seem ill-prepared to deal with the consequences on those U.S. companies that rely on free trade for maximum profit. Yet some companies had good news that outweighed the downward pull of the major benchmarks. , , and  were among the top performers. Here's why they did so well.Shares of Seattle Genetics soared 19% after the biotech company reported its . Revenue for the quarter was higher by 28% compared to the previous year's period, with record sales of the company's Adcetris treatment for patients suffering from certain types of lymphoma. Seattle Genetics had expected that Adcetris would gradually start to show its superiority over more traditional forms of chemotherapy, and the latest results support that hypothesis. At the same time, Seattle Genetics also hopes that its enfortumab vedotin treatment for urothelial cancer will also gain approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, as that could help send future results even higher.Image source: Seattle Genetics. in a rare occurrence on Wall Street.

"nvestors in Seattle Genetics Inc (Symbol: SGEN) saw new options become available this week, for the July 19th expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the SGEN options chain for the new July 19th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $65.00 strike price has a current bid of 80 cents.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $65.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $64.20 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of SGEN, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $68.59/share today.

Because the $65.00 strike represents an approximate 5% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 73%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.23% return on the cash commitment, or 24.96% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.


Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Seattle Genetics Inc, and highlighting in green where the $65.00 strike is located relative to that history:


   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $70.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.50.  If an investor was to purchase shares of SGEN stock at the current price level of $68.59/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $70.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 4.24% if the stock gets called away at the July 19th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if SGEN shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Seattle Genetics Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing SGEN's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $70.00 strike highlighted in red:



   
Considering the fact that the $70.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 56%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.19% boost of extra return to the investor, or 44.35% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.


The implied volatility in the put contract example is 45%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 44%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 250 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $68.59) to be 43%.

"Image source: The Motley Fool. Q2 2019 , Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to today's Seattle Genetics Second Quarter 2019 Financial Results Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. For opening remarks, I'd like to turn the conference over to Peggy Pinkston, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. -- Thank you, operator, and good afternoon everyone. I'd like to welcome all of you to Seattle Genetics second quarter 2019 conference call. With me today are Clay Siegall, President and Chief Executive Officer; Robin Taylor, Chief Commercial Officer; Todd Simpson, Chief Financial Officer; and Roger Dansey Chief Medical Officer.Accompanying today's conference call are supporting slides, which are available on our website in the Investors section, Events and Presentations page.Following our prepared remarks today, we'll open the line for questions. We ask that you limit yourself to one to two questions to ensure we're able to get to everybody during our call today.Today's conference call will include forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial and operating performance of the Company, such as those among others relating to the Company's 2019 financial outlook, including anticipated 2019 ADCETRIS sales and future revenues, cost and expenses, and the Company's potential and anticipated timing to achieve future, clinical and regulatory milestones, including data readouts, regulatory submissions, and approvals.Actual results or developments may differ materially from those projected or implied in these forward-looking statements. Among the factors that may cause such a difference include the difficulty in forecasting sales, revenues and expenses, and the uncertainty associated with the pharmaceutical development and regulatory approval process.More information about the risks and uncertainties faced by Seattle Genetics is contained under the caption Risk Factors included in the Company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission including the Company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31st, 2019.Now I'll turn the call over to Clay. -- Thanks, Peg, and good afternoon, everyone. In the past few months, we've delivered on several important goals focused on growing our flagship brand ADCETRIS and continuing our evolution into a multi-product oncology Company. Our late-stage portfolio includes enfortumab vedotin, which have been submitted to FDA for approval in metastatic urothelial cancer based on the positive outcome of the EV-201 trial.In addition, we're advancing two other programs in pivotal trials. Tucatinib in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer and tisotumab vedotin in metastatic cervical cancer. I'll begin with some comments on ADCETRIS, which is an important global product for the treatment of lymphoma.Under our collaboration with Takeda, it is now available in 73 countries. In the US and Canada, we reported record ADCETRIS net sales of $159 million in the second quarter, up 18% from the first quarter of the year. This growth was mainly driven by increased utilization in frontline peripheral T-cell lymphoma. There were -- there was also increased use in frontline Hodgkin lymphoma. In addition, these results reflect second quarter strength that we have previously seen with ADCETRIS. We will provide more detail on our commercial progress later in the call.Outside the US, we and our partner Takeda, are continuing to expand the approved indication for ADCETRIS. In frontline Hodgkin lymphoma, we received Canadian approval in May and Takeda recently received approval in a third key country outside of Europe and Japan. This triggered a milestone payment to us of $7.5 million. To date, we've achieved a total of $118 million in milestones under our collaboration, including $47.5 million related to frontline Hodgkin lymphoma approvals in Europe, Japan and key countries.For frontline PTCL, we submitted our approval application to Health Canada in May and Takeda also plans to submit frontline PTCL for approval to the EMA and other health authorities this year.Next is enfortumab vedotin or EV, which we're developing in collaboration with Astellas. Today, we announced the BLA submission to the FDA for accelerated approval of EV in metastatic urothelial cancer based on results from the EV-201 study. The data were featured in an oral presentation at ASCO and selected for an ASCO press briefing. We are encouraged with the positive reception to these data by the physician community.In anticipation of potential approval, our launch preparation is rapidly advancing. EV is positioned to become our next marketed drug, and if approved, will expand our commercial portfolio beyond hematologic malignancies into solid tumors. We are working closely with Astellas to advance and expand the clinical development program for EV including in first-line metastatic urothelial cancer. Roger will recap the EV-201 results as well as the clinical development plan during his remarks.We're also advancing two other solid tumor candidates in late-stage development. These include Tucatinib in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer and tisotumab vedotin or TV in metastatic cervical cancer. We expect to report top line data from the Tucatinib pivotal trial, called HER2CLIMB, later this year, and from the TV pivotal trial called innovaTV 204 in the first half of 2020.Lastly, I want to highlight the first FDA approval from one of our technology licensees. Polivy or polatuzumab vedotin is an ADC developed by Genentech, that targets CD79b. It was approved more than two months ahead of the PDUFA date for patients with relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Genentech is conducting several additional trials of Polivy including in frontline DLBCL.Amongst several other collaborators that use our technology, GSK is advancing an ADC in late-stage development targeting BCMA. This ADC have PRIME and BTD designations, and GSK has stated that they are planning a regulatory submission in the second half of this year.At this point, I'd like to introduce our Chief Commercial Officer, Robin Taylor, who joined Seattle Genetics in May. Robin, was most recently at AstraZeneca and before that he spent more than 17 years at Genentech. He has contributed to the global commercial development and strategic marketing of several successful oncology drugs. His skills are well suited to driving our global commercial presence including the planned launch of EV as well as other potential drugs emerging from our pipeline such as Tucatinib. We are pleased that he has joined the team. Robin? -- Thank you, Clay. I am tremendously excited to have joined Seattle Genetics at this transformational time. I was drawn to the Company based on the strong leadership team, the innovative science, and the clear focus on patients as demonstrated by the continued investment in new indications for ADCETRIS and the exceptional late-stage pipeline. This is an important time for the commercial organization with the planned launch of EV and pivotal data anticipated for Tucatinib later this year.Let me turn now to our second quarter results. ADCETRIS net sales in the US and Canada were $159 million in the second quarter, an increase of 30% compared to the same quarter in 2018. For the first half of 2019, ADCETRIS sales were $294 million, a growth rate of 35% for the first half of the year compared to the first half of 2018.We attribute the growth in Q2 to three main drivers. First, we have observed continued strong uptake of ADCETRIS plus CHP in CD30-expressing PTCL following the US approval of this indication in November 2018. This is driven by the positive ECHELON-2 data, including the overall survival advantage that showed a 34% reduction in the risk of death compared to CHOP.Second, we have seen continued growth of ADCETRIS in Stage III and IV frontline Hodgkin lymphoma. This reflects a positive reception to the three-year PFS data from Echelon-1 trial reported at ASCO. In addition, there has been an increase in patient engagement with growth in unique visitors to our online resources and downloads of the ask your doctor brochures. This encourages patients to ask their physicians about all available options for frontline treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma.The update to the NCCN guidelines in April 2019 may also have contributed. And third, we have historically observed the strongest sequential growth between Q1 and Q2 for ADCETRIS, with continued, but more moderate growth in other quarters of the year.Based on these historical patterns, we are maintaining our guidance of full year 2019 ADCETRIS net sales in the range of $610 million to $640 million.Finally, we're actively preparing for the commercial launch of enfortumab vedotin with our partner Astellas. Sales force hiring is very close to complete, and we are beginning training activities to ensure that we are fully prepared for lunch. Having participated in multiple successful oncology drug launches over [Phonetic] my career, I have been pleased with the depth and rigor of the preparations of the commercial team at Seattle Genetics to date. I'm confident that we will be ready for the EV launch upon FDA approval.Let me turn now to Todd to provide the finance update. -- Great. Thanks, Robin, and thanks to everyone for joining us on the call this afternoon.So today, I'll summarize our financial results for the second quarter and year-to-date, as well as provide two updates to our financial outlook for the year. Total revenues were $218 million in the second quarter and $414 million for the year to date in 2019. This included record ADCETRIS net sales in the US and Canada of $159 million in the second quarter and $294 million for the first half of the year. Growth in 2019 primarily reflects the frontline label expansions in Hodgkin lymphoma and PTCL and the other dynamics that Robin described.Royalty revenues in the second quarter of 2019 were $23 million compared to $21 million in the second quarter of last year. For the first half of 2019, royalty revenues were $39 million compared to $36 million in the first half of last year. We expect ADCETRIS royalties to increase throughout the year as Takeda sales grow, and as increasing sales trigger higher royalty rates. As a reminder, royalty revenues in 2018 included Takeda's portion of third-party royalty obligations paid on ADCETRIS, some of which expired in 2018. Therefore, despite the increases in sales by Takeda, royalty revenues grew at a lower rate, while cost of royalty revenues decreased.Going forward, royalty revenues will also reflect amounts earned on net sales of collaborator ADCs such as Polivy, however, this did not contribute to second quarter results and is not included in our guidance.Collaboration revenues which includes amounts earned under our ADCETRIS collaboration with Takeda and our ADC deals were $36 million in the second quarter and $81 million for the first half of 2019. This included the earned portion of $13 million in milestones achieved in the second quarter and $43 million in the first half of 2019, most notably by Genentech's recent approval of Polivy and Takeda's approvals of ADCETRIS in frontline Hodgkin lymphoma.R&D expenses were $164 million in the second quarter and $322 million for the first half of 2019. The increases over 2018 primarily reflect investment across our pipeline primarily on our late-stage programs EV Tucatinib and TV.SG&A expenses were $82 million in the second quarter and $163 million in the first half of 2019. These increases reflect commercial efforts to support ADCETRIS in the frontline indications as well as costs related to our late-stage pipeline programs.We ended the second quarter with $376 million in cash and investments. This is in addition to $107 million in Immunomedics at the end of the second quarter. These shares are mark-to-market, which causes variability in our financial results and is not core to our business. These results or -- this resulted in a non-cash investment loss of $43 million for the second quarter, which was slightly higher than a similar non-cash gain in the first quarter.Lastly, I want to highlight two updates to our 2019 financial guidance. First on revenues, given the recent milestones under the Takeda and Genentech deals, we are increasing our guidance for collaboration revenues to a range of $110 million to $125 million.And secondly on SG&A expenses, in anticipation of the EV BLA submission announced this morning, we proceeded with hiring substantially all of the enfortumab vedotin US sales organization. As a result of this, we are increasing and narrowing our guidance for SG&A expenses to a range of $335 million to $360 million. Our other guidance remains unchanged.Now I'll turn the call over to Roger. -- Thanks, Todd, and good afternoon, everyone. As Clay mentioned, the positive EV-201 pivotal trial results were featured in an oral session at ASCO in early June, and they also part of the subsequent best of ASCO program.Among metastatic urothelial cancer patients, who received both the platinum regimen and the PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor, the confirmed response rate was 44% by blinded independent central review, including a 12% complete response rate.For context, single agent chemotherapy which is the current standard of care in this setting shows limited activity with a response rate of approximately 10% with complete responses barely obtained. Responses in EV-201 were observed across all patient subgroups including those with liver metastases have particularly poor outcomes.The median duration response was clinically meaningful at 7.6 months. EV was tolerable with a manageable safety profile. The most common treatment-related adverse events included fatigue, alopecia, decreased appetite, rash and peripheral neuropathy. Notably, the results are consistent with the earlier Phase 1 experience in the same heavily pre-treated patient population.Based on these results, we and Astellas have submitted a BLA to the FDA seeking accelerated approval of EV.As a reminder, we have breakthrough therapy designation in this patient population. The remarkable activity of EV monotherapy in patients with multiply treated metastatic urothelial cancer provide substantial development opportunities for EV to address a wide array of unmet medical needs.Our EV development plan is focused in four key areas. First, enrollment is ongoing in the second cohort of the EV-201 trial of metastatic urothelial cancer patients, who perceived the PD-1 or PD-L1 treatment but are ineligible for cisplatin and/or platinum naive.Second, the ongoing confirmatory randomized trial EV-301, which is intended to support global regulatory submission continues to enroll well.Third, the ongoing EV-103 trial, which combines EV with pembrolizumab and/or platinum chemotherapy in the first-line metastatic setting. This is the precursor to a frontline randomized trial, and we expect to report data from the EV plus pembrolizumab cohort later this year. And fourth, trials are being planned in earlier stages of urothelial cancer such as muscle invasive bladder cancer as well as other Nectin-4 expressing tumors.I'll move on now to ADCETRIS, which was the subject of numerous presentations at ASCO, as well as the European Hematology Association and the International Conference on the -- lymphoma meetings. Across these three Congresses, we reported on several important data sets. First, we showed that with an extended follow-up in the ECHELON -1 trial, the PFS benefit for ADCETRIS plus AVD determined by investigators was maintained. The three-year PFS was 83.1% compared to 76% in the AVD arm, a difference of 7.1%.Importantly, consistent improvement in PFS was observed among patients treated with the ADCETRIS regimen across the majority of pre-specified subgroups, including disease stage in prognostic score. Second, analysis of several trials including Echelon-2 showed responses in non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients across all levels of CD-30 expression. These data support the notion that there may be no specific expression level required for efficacy.And third multiple abstract highlighting the activity of ADCETRIS in combination with the nivolumab including in Hodgkin lymphoma and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma.Importantly, ADCETRIS plus nivolumab was recently added to NCCN treatment guidelines for second-line Hodgkin lymphoma.Lastly, we are now initiating additional trials of ADCETRIS that may result in label expansion, two of which I've mentioned today. One trial will evaluate retreatment with ADCETRIS in Hodgkin and T-cell lymphoma patients, who progress after a prior response, including in patients, who received ADCETRIS in the first-line setting.Encouraging data with retreatment in the relapse refractory setting have been previously published.We are also initiating a trial of ADCETRIS in Hodgkin lymphoma and PTCL patients, who are unfit for combination chemotherapy either due to old age or comorbidities. This is an area of high unmet need. We believe the generating data for labeled indication is important for physicians and patients. We also expect to initiate additional label enabling and practice-informing trial, and we'll keep you posted as our plans progress.Next I'd like to briefly highlight the status of our late-stage programs tucatinib and tisotumab vedotin. Both of which are in registration trial.Tucatinib is a potentially best in class oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets HER2. We are conducting a randomized pivotal trial, called HER2CLIMB in heavily pre-treated HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, including patients with brain metastases.Patients in this setting have a poor outcome with standard of care treatments. HER2CLIMB enrollment is complete and we continue to expect to report the top line results for the primary endpoint of PFS later this year.We are also initiating this year a Phase 3 randomized trial of tucatinib in combination with TDM-1 compared to TDM-1 alone in the second-line metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer setting.The primary endpoint of PFS was a key secondary endpoint of OS. With this trial, we aim to show improved outcomes combining tucatinib with a HER2 ADC, which is a well-established standard of care in earlier lines of breast cancer. Data from a published Phase 1 trial support evaluating this combination. Tisotumab Vedotin or TV is an ADC targeting tissue factor that we are developing in partnership with Genmab. We are conducting a pivotal Phase 2 single-arm single-agent trial in women with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer, where there is no standard of care and outcomes are poor. The primary endpoint of the trial is confirmed objective response, enrollment is complete, and we are following patients for a response assessment and importantly durability of response.We estimate reporting top line data in the first half of 2020, if positive, the trial could support regulatory submissions and the FDA's accelerated approval mechanism. Now, I'll turn the call over to Clay. -- Thanks, Roger. We've accomplished much in the first half of 2019. And the second half of the year is poised for many additional activities that are important to our goal of bringing drugs to patients in need. These include: first, continuing to establish ADCETRIS as the standard of care at frontline Hodgkin lymphoma and frontline PTCL and initiate clinical trials to further expand the ADCETRIS label.Second, work with FDA on our EV submission in collaboration with Astellas, report initial results from the first line EV-103 trial and expand the EV development program with several new trials.And third, report top line data from the Tucatinib pivotal trial HER2CLIMB later in 2019 and advanced the TV pivotal trial in cervical cancer toward top line data in the first half of next year.I'm excited by the progress we're making with ADCETRIS, enfortumab vedotin and the rest of our product pipeline. We'll keep you updated on our progress.At this point, we'll open the line for Q&A. Operator, please open the call for questions.Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Kennen MacKay with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. -- Hi, thanks for taking the question. For the team, first off, big congrats on the quarter. I was just wondering, if you could help us understand the decision not to increase guidance here. I ask because given the recent price hike in ADCETRIS, it seems like it will squarely be within your guidance, with zero growth and with only 3% sequential quarter-over-quarter growth in Q3 and Q4 you'll hit the upper end of guidance, which seems quite doable. Is there anything we should be reading into here.And also on that topic, I was just wondering if you could help us understand the ADCETRIS inventory in Q2. Could there may be a week or two of stocking here given the June 28, price hike? Thank you. -- Thanks, Kennen, and thanks for the questions. So when we think about ADCETRIS, it's a really important brand, it's growing as a brand in US, growing international, and we're pleased with what we're seeing. We reiterated the guidance, and please note, we're giving annual guidance, we're not giving quarterly guidance that we did while we were in the middle of getting frontline approvals. And so we reiterated $610 million to $640 million, which is 30% over 2018. And so it's a strong guidance, and we're trying to be as accurate as we can. We have a range there. And we have good connection with docs and our three-year PFS data with E1 was particularly important.And E2 data was spectacular, you know that, not only with PFS but with OS. But Q2 is typically strong. Now looking out into the future, is really hard to know exactly what we're going to get. It's hard work out there, we're continuing to displace decades old standard of care that are entrenched in the marketplace, and we're working harder. We like what we see a lot, we still feel that our products are growing and that's -- our guidance indicates that. And I would just say to stay tuned and we're out there at full force, our commercial team is doing well, and we're really connecting with docs. -- Thanks. [Speech Overlap] -- Your second part... -- Go ahead. -- Your second question, Kennen, we have really no evidence that there is really any stocking as you call at the end of the inventory, we really don't see that. We know that there are some big cancer centers that will -- more vials in the small cancer centers, because they treat more patients, but that's not really stocking. So we don't see any evidence for stocking of ADCETRIS. We deliver in real time, people order it, they get it quickly. And so we feel really good about where we are, and we just don't see sites accumulating inventory. -- And Kennen, this is Todd, I want to add just one more comment, you talked about the price increase, we did have a 3.9% price increase in July. But keep in mind that we only see about half of that come through our net sales, because of the discounting in the gross to net, particularly around the PHS share of our business, which is pretty significant. -- Thanks, Todd, that's really quite helpful context, especially given the current political environment, and I think important to remember. Maybe just one follow-up for Clay and maybe also for Robin. Just wondering, if you can help us understand the changes that you've been making with the ADCETRIS sales force here. It seems like tracking the website, there has been quite a bit of hiring going on here. Is that also sort of playing into the increased ADCETRIS sales that we saw in Q2 and is that responsible for the SG&A guidance increase or is that more of the EV sales force? Thanks and congrats again. -- First of all, thanks for mentioning we had a good quarter. We're very proud of that. It is really more related to the last thing you said, EV sales force. We thought it would be important to have some of our sales people from ADCETRIS go to the EV program for continuity and connection. And so we replaced some of the people on the ADCETRIS sales force. Robin, do you want to talk about the folks that we're getting, the type of people that are looking to come work with us both on ADCETRIS and EV? -- Yeah. No, what I'd say is that, we are seeing very strong interest in Seattle Genetics. The hiring on the EV sales force as I mentioned is almost fully complete, and we had a lot of interest in those roles. We did have a few folks come over from the ADCETRIS sales force over to EV. And of course, you -- what you saw online with some of the backfills for those positions, but I would say that we've got a really high performance group with great depth of oncology experience for the EV sales force. -- Operator, we'll take our next question.Our next question is from Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. -- Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. This is Matthew on for Cory. So for my first question, I'm trying to understand the potential impact of the international pricing index proposal on ADCETRIS pricing? And I was wondering if you could provide any qualitative or quantitative commentary in that regard should [Phonetic] this policy be implemented? -- Thanks, Matt. Look, we're aware of the issues and closely track them, it certainly dynamic, there's changes literally daily or frequently. We're paying attention like any biotech or pharma company is. Ultimately, we believe fully that innovative medicines that provide meaningful benefits will continue to be valued by patients, physicians and payers.ADCETRIS is a first-in-class drug. EV, another drug that we believe will be first-in-class, and these are drugs that really have an impact on patients, and they are valuable. And so we're watching. I'm not sure what will happen exactly, I think you're not sure as it -- as we are. -- Got it, thanks. And then, my second question is on tucatinib in the initial data expected this year for the HER2CLIMB. I'm just curious what you're hearing from KOLs [Phonetic] in terms of what PSF value or hazard ratio would be clinically meaningful in the context of all the other available treatments in this space? -- Sure. We're really excited about HER2CLIMB and coming forward with data later this year. Roger, do you want to go talk a little bit about the context of what's out there in the world. -- Sure. Yeah, it's a good question. So the HER2CLIMB trial has some unique aspects to it, particularly, the patient population that has been enrolled with a very high frequency of patients with brain metastases. So it is an extremely high unmet need population. But the trial design is the triplet versus the doublet of tucatinib added on to Trastuzumab and capecitabine, we think is a very thoughtful design that may result in positive outcomes.In terms of what is a meaningful delta, I think it's very hard without seeing the data to make any specific comments on that. Again, there isn't really historical control that you can absolutely map to. And the unmet need is very high. So everything is a relative decision. And I think that's about where we can go at this point, but we're excited as Clay said, the trial enrolled well. We're hoping to get the read out by the end of the year, and of course we'll note that time. -- Great. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the quarter.We'll take our next question from Michael Schmidt with Guggenheim. -- Hey, thanks for taking my question and congrats on the good quarter for me as well. I had a question again on the ADCETRIS sales number for this quarter. It sounds like -- and correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like much of the ADCETRIS sales growth was driven by increased use in PTCL. And I was just wondering, if you could comment a little bit more about on what are you seeing in terms of market dynamics in PTCL right now for example, what market share do you have in frontline treatment at the moment and are those rates comparable in the different subtypes of TCL? -- Thank you for your questions, Michael. So first of all, as we said in the prepared remarks, we think that as we track this, our growth in revenue was attributed to both the E2 regimen, which is in PTCL growth as well as in the E1. Now in the E2, we're not going to report the different subtypes. We can tell you that they're being used in all of the subtypes as far as what we can find, but we're not going to report specifics about that.We also don't report the specific market share. What we can say is that we predicted that it would take a number of quarters to get bigger and bigger market share, because this was a regimen that we were displacing CHOP specifically in PTCL that was around for almost three and half decades. So this is -- it's not that easy to displace these entrenched therapies. Now the good news with the E2 regimen is we had not only PFS data but OS data.And so now let's switch to E1 regimen for frontline Hodgkin lymphoma, and there, as you know, we experienced little headwinds in the past, we had to -- we got a lot of early adopters and then we had some -- docs have said look, I know how to treat frontline Hodgkin lymphoma. I've been doing it for decades well, and you're showing us data that's only of limited duration of follow-up. We'd like to see some more.So this year, for instance, we have shown now 37 months of follow-up data, and the data actually improved with time. So now, if you just look at PFS, good old fashion PFS and you look at 37 months, we are now 7.1% better in PFS. And that's important, because while you can't yet call these cures, these are a long-term disease survival and once you get out past five years or the definition of a cure from oncologists, we can start calling it that, but it is likely that a lot of these patients will go that long and hopefully within the not-too-distant future, we can really look at what could be a cure rate increase in Hodgkin lymphoma.And going from the two-year data that we produced, when we first got approval to the 37-month data that came out with PFS. I think that caught a lot of doctors attention. And so, they looked at this, they saw it and they were more comforted by that, because we don't yet have OS, which in E1 in the E1 regimen in frontline Hodgkin lymphoma was not contemplated to have yet.So there was nothing wrong, it just takes a while. With E2 and PTCL, the standard of care wasn't nearly as good as it was with E1, the Hodgkin regimen. So I really understand what doctors are saying, I understand that they wanted to see a little bit more aging of our data and the data improved with age.So I think that's a big deal too. -- Okay. Thanks. And then I had a pipeline question regarding tisotumab vedotin. I know the initial indications obviously cervical cancer, but I was just wondering, when we might learn about the potential of that agent in other solid tumors? -- Yeah. We're definitely looking at cervical cancer. Roger, can you touch on a little bit of generally what we're looking at with TV? -- Sure. So the program is configured to evaluate cervical cancer, as you -- as you mentioned in the pivotal trial with data readout hopefully in early 2020. The -- but we have other efforts going on. So we in fact have a basket trial, which is looking at other tumors that express tissue factor with TV potentially has a role and that's an ongoing trial at the moment, we haven't read out data yet, but obviously when we do, we'll present that.We also have an effort going on specifically in ovarian cancer. So we have a number of different trials outside of cervical cancer exploring the potential for TV in other diseases. -- And what I would add also is we actively speak with our partners, Genmab, I'm often about trying to maximize TV. So just so that you know, we're excited about the product and working hard on it. -- And maybe one piece to add is we in fact do have the beginnings of a combination trial with TV and pembrolizumab as well. So that's up and running. -- All right. Thanks for taking my question.We'll take our next question from Andrew Berens with SVB Leerink. Please go ahead. -- Thanks. I appreciate it. And congrats on the quarter guys. I also had two questions, one on PTCL, given the prepared comments, and I know you said, you wouldn't talk about different subgroups, but is this a disease or opportunity that we should think of as a prevalent opportunity? Or is it really new patients that are driving what you're seeing -- is there a possibility patients are going to get ADCETRIS through multiple lines of therapy when they relapse, it's more of a prevalent disease? -- So on PTCL, we're out there talking about is the data on for incident patients, and so that's what we're looking at. Newly diagnosed incident patients. So I don't -- we don't have a lot of data on prevalent. I mean, we still have approval to treat relapse patients, and that's one of our labels especially in ALCL and some other in CTCL. But we are really focused on the newly diagnosed patients and working with our commercial team and doctors to get newly diagnosed patients ADCETRIS CHP, because the data is so clearly positive and not just on PFS, but on OS and you look at the Kaplan-Meier curves and you'd be hard pressed to find bigger white space between Kaplan-Meier curves and clinical trials.This is a really positive dataset that I feel that patients and doctors should really look at this before jumping into a different therapy, because they can really be benefited. -- Okay. And then one of the things we've heard from some of the community docs is that buying and billing the patient is a real concern for some of the docs with private practices. I was wondering, if you guys have heard that? And if so, what efforts could be done to kind of waylay some of those fears and financial concerns to the clinicians? -- We haven't really heard much of that at all, I have to say. As far as physicians getting reimbursement in PTCL, which is I think what you're looking at, we really have not heard that there is issues out there. We think that our market share is growing in this space as we predicted. We think it was going to take some time to grow and entrenched -- previously entrenched therapy, and it's -- we're pretty much on track for what we thought the growth rate would be on a quarter-to-quarter basis with the E2 regimen in PTCL. So I don't view what you said is this buying and billing thing as an issue. -- [Speech Overlap] It wasn't limited to E2, I was talking about ADCETRIS and really Hodgkin lymphoma. I think is where these comments originated? -- We -- I have to say we just aren't hearing it in the way you are, so I don't know where this information comes. I'll certainly explore this with our commercial team. But I don't think we are seeing. Todd, do you have any comments? -- Well, I'm just going to say, the other thing to keep in mind is we have an incredibly efficient model, where a site can order drug today and they'll have it tomorrow, so there isn't this need to buy ADCETRIS and hold it, because of a concern or a fear that it's going to take weeks and weeks and weeks for your drug to show up, we're literally overnight shipping. -- Okay. Appreciate it. Congrats again. -- Thanks.Well take our next question from Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. -- Yes. Hi, thank you for taking our questions. This is Maryana Breitman for Salveen. We had a couple. One, we were wondering with the NCCN updates for Hodgkin lymphoma. Do you have any color on changes to prescriber activity due to updated guidelines? And we were also wondering about tucatinib opportunity in metastatic breast cancer, especially in patients with brain metastasis, how are you thinking about that opportunity? How are you thinking about going into that market? Thank you. -- Thank you for the two questions. Concerning the NCCN that you asked, we think that certainly we'd like the new wording with NCCN, but it's not really -- it's hard to know what that impact will be or what that impact was. We think that the three-year PFS data that we showed at ASCO, and we think that the response from doctors, we think is the most valuable thing that we have, because we could tell that they look at that closely.With NCCN that also connects with how pathways are, and how doctors prescribe it, and those are things that evolve slowly. Pathways don't meet very often at all, and that -- it takes its own life, and we're not really part of that, but the data and the way doctors respond to this age data, that's improved and really gives benefit to the patient. That's really what we think is the most important thing for the increased E1 regimen sales that we are seeing.And you asked about tucatinib and the opportunity. Tucatinib is something that is a drug that we think could be a best-in-class drug, it's clearly not the first of the HER2 TKIs out there, there are a few of them. So it's a validated pathway, but our goal is to really raise the bar and get to that next level with helping patients with a very potent drug, but one that doesn't buying the EGF receptor and cause all that toxicity that you would have with some of the other HER2 TKIs.As far as the specific benefit and talking about the size of the population, it's a little early for us to do that. We're still doing, working on our pivotal trial and it's an event-driven trial, we guided to later this year more data to come out. And then let's just see what the data -- we're happy to give data and there is plenty of time in the future to talk about the specific opportunity. And I really think it depends on the data. We have -- the primary endpoint is all of the patients put together, and then the secondary endpoint include importantly brain metastasis. So this is a unique trial design with a couple of different data sets that will result from the data.And I think that looking at the opportunity for this really depend on whether this works on all patients, including pembrolizumab [Phonetic] patients. What works most on one or another set of patients, then we could adequately start addressing your question. But until then, we will hold off on it and are excited to address this question in the -- hopefully not too distant future, later this year. -- Thank you.We'll take our next question is from Gena Wang with Barclays. -- Thank you very much for taking my questions, and also follow up with CapEx. Maybe I will ask. Wondering if you can remind us the event rates of PFS and also if the trial designs do design to detect 50% PFS improvement and another related questions regarding the bring mats [Phonetic] patient. What is the percentage of patients you plan to enroll? -- Okay. So I got your three points there. So, the event range from PFS, we have not reported and that's something that we keep confidential. The amount to detect a 50% improvement, also is internal information and that's not something we will be reporting. We have said that we are planning to enroll. And I know it has. This is true, because all the patients are enrolled that we have roughly half the patients, have pre-existing measurable brain mats. And that mix has one of the uniqueness of this trial, we're really addressing a major unmet medical need. -- Great. And I have one quick follow-up regarding ADCETRIS quarter revenue. So you mentioned that the majority the growth is driven by frontline PTCL, is it fair to say out of $24 million quarter-over-quarter growth close to $20 million will be from frontline PTCL? And then should we expect the future growth mainly driven by the PTCL revenue? -- I think our prepared remarks said that we're really pleased with the growth in frontline PTCL. But we also have growth in frontline Hodgkin lymphoma. We did not look at the breaking that apart nor do we plan on breaking apart. I think looking forward, we continue to see that we are getting increased market penetration and that goes for PTCL, which was approved like almost a year later than Hodgkin lymphoma, maybe it was early in 2018 to late in 2018. So maybe a little less than a year. But so frontline Hodgkin lymphoma has been out there a little longer and its growth rate is probably a little slower at this point just because it's out there a little longer than frontline PTCL, but both are growing, and we're really pleased with what we're hearing from docs out there.And I know we had a bunch of questions on guidance, it's hard to really give guidance on this. We're in uncharted territory in frontline Hodgkin, in frontline PTCL and the data we have is great. The age data is great, doctors are rallying to this, and we're out there trying to do the best we can by patients. And what I would say is, stay tuned on this, and we'll provide you with whatever data and follow up that we can when it's appropriate. -- Thank you very much.We'll take our next question from Tazeen Ahmad with Bank of America. -- Hi, good afternoon, and thanks for taking my questions. Clay, I just wanted to get a sense on the sales force that Todd had talked about, you guys have hired, how big of a sales force do you anticipate you'll need for EV in the US? And do you plan on hiring all the sales people at once?And then secondly for Tucatinib, as that data that reads out, I guess what kind of data should we expect at the top line, what level of efficacy would you consider to be clinically meaningful? And how important is it for you to show a better safety profile than currently approved treatments vis-a-vis especially diarrhea rates. Thanks. -- So let's those are two different questions. Let's start talking about the sales force for EV and I'd like to turn it over to Robin to kind of explain our thoughts here. Robin? -- Sure. Thanks, Clay. So, we worked really closely with Astellas to size the sales force to ensure that we have a broad reach to healthcare practitioners, who treat metastatic bladder cancer. We will have with Astellas an equal number of reps in the field. We will utilize our existing commercial infrastructure for activities managed markets and distribution, but we will also have some brand specific roles, such as the dedicated EV marketing team and that's really sort of where we stand, which is equal partnership with Astellas here. -- So the second question is on tucatinib and talking about efficacy and the safety profile. And for sure the reason we acquired Cascadian to largely get this drug as that we saw, a really exciting drug from a safety standpoint because it didn't bind to EGF receptor. And a really exciting drug from an efficacy standpoint in single arm studies. I will repeat that, single arm studies. And the [Indecipherable] us to perform in a randomized study in order to get registration.So Roger, can you talk about some of what -- give context to where we are? -- Sure. So as you know HER2CLIMB is fully enrolled. Just to reiterate some of the points.. This is a high unmet need population with a substantial proportion of patients with brain metastases, there is really no historical precedent that we can actually define what the potential for the control arm would be? Based on the profile of Tucatinib, it's highly selective. So in addition it's lack of inhibition of EGFR, that is a potential best-in-class molecule, both characteristics are key to both its efficacy and its safety and the tolerability. So as Clay said, the data has been generated with single-arm trials obviously very encouraging. Including with Tucatinib and TVM-1, which is why we've proceeded to start another Phase 3 trial, but until we see the data it's really -- we can't really make any statements about what the potential treatment effect would look like. -- What I can say to the -- one thing I can add, is that, you've seen a lot of data sets come out from other trials. And when you look at PFS in this type of population, it's always measured in terms of months. So the first thing I can tell you from that whenever I see that in my decades of doing cancer work, it says to me loudly unmet medical need.So we're in an area, where patients need something, they don't just walk away saying, Yay! There is drug, extra drug, why I'm cured, that's not what it is. We're talking a lot of these patients, they get a drug and response were measured in month.So we have a really big important area to go into. And when you have brain metastasis, which literally half the patients get, there is not anything really out there. So it's a grim prognosis and we're trying to really do a good job and help patients and work on this drug. So data, it's coming soon sometime this year. We are incredibly excited, and I'll remind you we really loved all the data from single-arm trials. We just thought they were outstanding, and this was the right drug. But we do not yet have the randomized data and FDA rightly wants in this setting, with all the other drugs, they want to see randomized data, and we're up to that challenge and we're looking forward to reporting it. -- Okay. And then just on safety Clay to wrap it up. How are you thinking about diarrhea rates, do you think that's an important differentiator in this population? Or is it -- as you said, when you have PFS in the months that this is a high unmet medical need area and any improvement is a good improvement? -- I would go back to our early data on this drug, because obviously, we have not reported data from this pivotal trial. And early data shows a dramatic difference in any GI toxicity. You just don't bind EGF receptor. I'll remind you that both the first two HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors that were approved both bind to HER2 and inhibit the tyrosine kinase. But both of them bind to EGF receptor. And I don't believe that they were screened to not bind to EGF receptor. I think they were screened specifically for the HER2 TKI activity, whereas tucatinib with screened with not only carry something potent for HER2 TKI, but screened that it didn't bind to EGF receptor. So this is what's unique about this drug. And if you look at the safety profile for literally hundreds of patients that were treated in single-arm trials, it's from a standpoint of comparison to the others that are out there, it's pretty dramatically different.So I think that -- I felt very confident about the safety profile, where we just didn't know is in a randomized trial versus active competitor, how would you -- how would it come out. And Roger, do you have -- so do you want to add anything to that? -- No, I do. So I think just as a case in point around the safety profile. I just remind you that HER2CLIMB is a blinded, is a placebo-controlled trial. And in general, placebo-controlled trials can only be done, if you are unable to tell which drug you're on placebo or the active agents. So that's an important point to remember.And secondly, in a disease like breast cancer, which is a chronic disease, tolerability is key. If you're taking a drug twice a day and you can't take it for too long, it's not just, is it a safety issue, it can potentially feed into efficacy as well. So I think those two points are worthy of some consideration. -- Okay. Thanks for that color. I appreciate it.We'll take our next question from Steven Wiley with Stifel. -- Yeah. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a really good quarter. Just a quick question on PTCL and then one on tucatinib. So just curious to what extent screening for CD30 expression may or may not represent a rate-limiting step for ADCETRIS right now and PTCL, either from just the utilization of reimbursement perspective. And I guess how does the recent data demonstrating that the ADCETRIS benefit is agnostic the CD30 expression potentially change that? -- So -- and certainly at ASCO, you saw the presentation from the docs that said that they had responses whether patients were CD30 high or CD30 low or even CD30 without even be able to through histology, be able to see it. Now when you -- historically we've looked at all these pensions and you could look them would histology and histology, has a very big gray area background noise.So when you get down to lower levels of CD30, it's impossible to know whether it's positive or negative. You could just say histology a negative, but that doesn't mean negative. And when you look at molecularly and it's -- we are hard pressed to find a lymphoma that's a T-cell lymphoma that CD30 negative when you look at it molecularly and also CD30 is an activation antigen.And it kind of goes up and down, and when you look at different nodules you can even find different amounts of CD30 within the same patient. So it is a very complicated scenario, where the prediction would be that all patients respond, because CD30 is there on all and can go up and down and in fact that is exactly what the doctor showed in their presentation at ASCO.So I think to the utility of it in different subtypes, and based on all our data and everything we know, I think we have a really good case there, the doctors should use this and it could benefit patients. So I certainly don't think that hurts and you had a second question on Tucatinib? -- Yeah. Just a quick follow-up on that, then I guess if there were a mechanism by which you could remove that CD30 expression requirement from the label. Would that change the narrative of uptake, do you think? -- What our requirement on there is it's CD -- I mean, in Hodgkin lymphoma is out there at all. And in T-cell lymphoma, it's just as CD30 positive. So it's not like I mean, it could be a trace of it and be positive. So we don't find it as an impediment at all quite frankly. -- Okay. And then just for clarification on Tucatinib. I know that you're talking about in other study here in combination with TDM-1 in the second line. Just want to clarify if the initiation of that trial is contingent upon HER2CLIMB data? -- Roger, do you want to comment on that? -- No, it's not. It's the, we believe it's the right time, tucatinib all the properties we've described, this is again a validated pathway and we've generated the Phase 1 data, which supports the combination, and we think it's the right time to proceed in that direction. -- Great. Thanks for taking the questions.We'll take our next question from Shanshan Xu with Berenberg Capital Markets. Please go ahead. -- Thank you for squeezing in. I have one question for Roger. If the upcoming readout of HER2CLIMB is positive, how should we think about expanding indications beyond breast cancer for tucatinib? And I have one follow-up for EV. -- Sure. Thanks for the question. So as we are -- as we are now, we have tucatinib being incorporated into us by looking at neoadjuvant applications, you see HER2CLIMB in the multiple-treated population. We're now moving into second line metastatic breast cancer. We have an investigator-initiated trial called [Indecipherable], which have data combining tucatinib together with Herceptin in a third line plus colorectal cancer population. We hope to have that data out later this year.I think we, again if tucatinib turns out to be the potential best-in-class realizes it's potential than anywhere that the TKI can have a role in the HER2 expressing tumor is where we want to go. So that includes CRC, it includes other stages of breast cancer potentially gastric cancer. There are other cancers that our HER2 expressing that could be of interest as well.So I think if we have a real molecule here we will flesh out the development plan as appropriately fully as we can. -- I think it's a good proposition for any breast cancer oncologists. If our data turns out where we think it could with HER2CLIMB to have a tablet that's well tolerated and really works. I think would be this would be a really important drug and we'll get a lot of use in and we'll be in many different lines and of therapy in breast cancer and outside of it. So [Indecipherable] you had an EV question? -- Yeah, I absolutely agree with your commentary on tucatinib. One follow-up on EV so we witnessed a very impressive data of screens Tier 1 which is a third line trial in EV2, while the medium OS is only two to three months shorter than the standard of care in frontline urothelial carcinoma. So I believe this is actually in everyone's interest to move EV into the pivotal trial of the frontline urothelial carcinoma. In the past, at ASCO we saw that it took CALGB 90601 almost five years to achieve a full enrollment. So, Roger and Clay, what are potential drivers to accelerate enrollment for frontline urothelial carcinoma trial for EV? Thanks. -- First of all, I did want to make a commentary before getting to your question on EV. We have not had a single question from any analyst or comments from any analysts to the speed with which we submitted EV. We busted our back and submitted this much faster. We guided that it will be submitted sometime this year and it's July and we submitted it in the middle of July. So this is months ahead of where most of you had in your models. I think most of you had some time in the middle of fall in your models. So, I would like the analysts to notice that, which I think will translate into getting this product on the market faster, and it's an important product, and doctors are screaming for. So, this is part and parcel into we're trying to make a difference in patients' lives and we, together with Astellas, worked like morning, noon to night on getting this to a submission because it's important. Okay? This isn't just a Wall Street thing. It's a patient thing. And so, I want everyone to notice how fast we worked on this.Secondly, we are excited about the potential of EV in frontline, and there is a lot of different approaches. Roger, do you want to give context to that? -- Sure. So, if you look -- you can look back into the EV-103 trial and you can understand what our potential choices are. It's EV is the backbone with a PD-1 inhibitor plus-minus chemotherapy. Those are the types of choices that we're facing. I must say, I agree with you, there is a frontline metastatic urothelial cancer is still a high unmet need. I think that personally if we come up with a very thoughtful considered acceptable trial design, the excitement around the combination of EV with other drugs once we have that data presented, if it supports that will drive a lot of the enrollment. Bladder cancer has changed because all of the immuno therapies have come in and there is a lot of interest now in bladder cancer, docs are focused on moving trials ahead, whereas in past times where there was really just chemotherapy versus chemotherapy, not an interesting question, not an exciting question to answer. That's possibly why the CALGB trial was so slow. I would hope that we would be way quicker than anything like that. -- Operator, we'll take our next question, please.We'll take our next question from Andy Hsieh with William Blair. Please go ahead. -- Great. Thanks for taking my questions and congratulations to the Seattle Genetics team. It's nice to see that inflection point commercially. So I have two questions. One is probably for Roger. So, could you remind us the specificity and potency of tucatinib, specifically pertaining to HER2 mutants? And if that is potential differentiator versus other oral TKIs? -- Yeah. Thanks for the question, Andy. We are interested in the mutant population, we haven't studied it. So that's something that we need to potentially move forward on. Tucatinib is very similar to neratinib in terms of its HER2 selectivity and potency. They are very close. So, the ability to inhibit the target with tucatinib is as good as any other -- as sort of the most potent inhibitor currently available, which is neratinib.Again, coming back to the HER2 mutants, we are interested. Again, anywhere there is a potential role [Phonetic] for tucatinib, we need to signal sign. So that's for our future effort. -- Andy, we believe that -- and this is based on data, like, with Herceptin, for instance, but -- and HER2 TKIs. When you keep pressure on a tumor in a patient, the patient does better, and that's what you see with other agents. And one of the things about these HER2 TKIs is if they're really toxic, you can't see pressure on the tumor. You have to discontinue and not -- enable that to get therapy. So it's not -- as Roger said before, it's not just a safety issue, it also relates to efficacy and that's what we saw when we did a lot of diligence on this. We saw that this could change the paradigm and raise the bar and allow for a TKI to keep pressure on the tumor for a substantive period of time. And that's really what's important. -- Okay. Thanks for that. Just as a follow-up, and this pertains to EV. So most of the time when you go from early Phase 1b to Phase 3 of any pivotal studies you take some sort of response rate PFS duration, penalty. Just curious, have you identified kind of any factors that contributes to just the impressive consistency across these -- the early stage [Indecipherable] analysis and the 201 top line results? -- I will tell you that the clinical team at Seattle Genetics and the certainly has been the case prior to Roger joining, but even emphasized more with Roger is, we don't want to get too over excited about Phase 1 data unless we do a blinded third-party reviews and things like that. So we want to look at, not just responses, we look at confirmed responses. So, when you see Seattle Genetics data from Phase 1 and it says confirm responses, the chance that that will repeat in a bigger study is pretty high, because these have already been stared at, where I see a lot of times companies put our data and there are unconfirmed responses, and then you see the later and it's a much smaller response rate and much less duration, and all these things and that's because they weren't as fastidious as we are.We're more interested at this point, or at all points in Seattle Gen's history, we've been interested in actually making substantive improvement in patients' lives with unmet medical needs and not just getting a little bit of hype on some drug. So we want the real data out there and I think that's what contributes to our your early stage data matching pretty closely to the pivotal because we do it the same way with the same rigor.Roger, any... -- Yeah. Two other comments. So firstly, good drugs really work, and when they really work, they really work again and again. That's certainly one part of this. The other is just bear in mind, the sample sizes are not 10 patients or 20 patients. We're talking 100 plus. And so, the variability around those constant integrals is much smaller than a very small sample size, where you can potentially get yourself misled. So, it's great that the data is reproducible. You're right, many times that Phase 1 experience, as Clay described, degrades overtime and that's obviously not something that anyone likes to see, but certainly with EV, we have not have that experience. And so, it does bode well for the future of the drug. -- Thanks for answering all my questions. And super helpful context.We'll take our final question from Silvan Tuerkcan with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. -- Thank you for taking my question and congrats on the quarter and the submission. Could you please give us a little bit more color on your pre-launch activities for EV outside of the sales force, such as maybe interactions with payers you have? And also, is there any strategy that leaps out at you in terms of how you can roll this out quickly in terms of what centers to target? -- First of all, I will thank you for the question. I mean, I -- we are putting in a very large amount of effort on our pre-launch activities for EV, and it's across the board in lots of different areas. I mean, this is -- this drives the real deal. So we're not going in for a soft launch. We're going in for the full launch, no soft launch here in EV for sure.Robin, you want to put this in context? -- Yeah, certainly, Clay. Like any new product launch you need to be prepared for everything that you're going to be doing at approval. And as you say, that's not just preparing the sales force in terms of the training materials, it's also understanding the payer environment, it's preparing the rest of the organization and also, outside of commercial. So, on the medical side, our medical affairs organization will be prepared and, of course, we'd be preparing for months already, and even more than a year in terms of thinking through the brand strategy and how we're actually going to position this product in the market. And so, all of these elements and I think what I said is that, my experience in oncology launches, what I saw coming into Seattle Genetics is a team that is very prepared, I was really impressed. -- Great. Thanks. And do you expect an Adcom? -- We can never make a comment on whether there is an Adcom or not, it's not our decision, but we do have breakthrough therapy designation. And I think that -- I don't want to handicap this actually. But we're thinking pretty positively about this drug.Roger, any addition? -- Agree. -- Great, thanks. And maybe just quickly, for tucatinib. I think the brain metastases will be very important and it's great that you're studying it. What -- do we have seen any data on activity in brain metastases to date and earlier trials and will this data be top line and same time you may put top line the PFS of the entire trial? Will it be mature enough at that point? -- So, there has been data early on in looking -- in single-arm trials, not in the randomized setting at brain metastasis. And with relatively really nice data, that was something that stuck out on us as we reviewed this, that we were surprised with -- not surprised, but we were pleased, I should say, we're seeing the data in brain mets that we did with a single-arm trial. Yes, you have to do this in a randomized trial to prove it but the data in brain mets was well -- was better, considerably better than you would have expect to see in populations of brain met patients, based on looking at other drugs at historic studies, but you have to do the randomized study. So, that's it.Roger, any other comments on this? -- I agree, Clay. So, the data that was generated, clearly tucatinib is active in brain metastases that I think is no doubt. And so, it's a matter of how active in the combination that we're testing.With regard to what we will release top line, I don't think we'll get into any specifics about what data would be obtained in that release. -- Yeah. That's too premature to say what will exactly released now. Our goal will be to release everything that we possibly can while retaining the ability for doctors to present this at an appropriate, peer-reviewed, large conference. And, I mean, breast cancer work is normally presented at conferences, such as the San Antonio meeting, which specializes in breast cancer, but also is at ASCO and ESMO and some other cancers. But the San Antonio conference is clearly the premiere breast cancer conference or it's evolved to being the premiere breast cancer conference, didn't used to be that way but it is now. -- Great. Thank you so much.Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back to your speakers for any additional or closing remarks. -- Okay. Thank you, operator, and thanks everybody for joining us this afternoon. Have a good night.[Operator Closing Remarks] --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --

"nvestors in Seattle Genetics Inc (Symbol: SGEN) saw new options begin trading this week, for the August 16th expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the SGEN options chain for the new August 16th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $65.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.65.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $65.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $62.35 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of SGEN, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $68.59/share today.

Because the $65.00 strike represents an approximate 5% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 67%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.08% return on the cash commitment, or 29.18% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.


Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Seattle Genetics Inc, and highlighting in green where the $65.00 strike is located relative to that history:


   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $70.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.70.  If an investor was to purchase shares of SGEN stock at the current price level of $68.59/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $70.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 7.45% if the stock gets called away at the August 16th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if SGEN shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Seattle Genetics Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing SGEN's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $70.00 strike highlighted in red:



   
Considering the fact that the $70.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 51%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.39% boost of extra return to the investor, or 38.61% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.


The implied volatility in the put contract example is 46%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 45%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $68.59) to be 43%.

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. 	For the First Trust Large Cap Core AlphaDEX Fund ETF (Symbol: FEX), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $66.90 per unit.


With FEX trading at a recent price near $60.98 per unit, that means that analysts see 9.71% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings.   Three of FEX's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Square Inc (Symbol: SQ), Hess Corp (Symbol: HES), and Seattle Genetics Inc (Symbol: SGEN). Although SQ has traded at a recent price of $72.87/share, the average analyst target is 20.00% higher at $87.44/share. Similarly, HES has 16.89% upside from the recent share price of $61.20 if the average analyst target price of $71.54/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting SGEN to reach a target price of $80.15/share, which is 11.73% above the recent price of $71.74. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of SQ, HES, and SGEN:  

   Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:

Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

Management has  that it would take some time to unseat the decade-old chemotherapy regimens -- even though Adcetris was proven better in clinical trials -- and that theory is starting to play out.At this point, it seems likely that Seattle Genetics will be able to hit management's 2019 Adcetris sales guidance of $610 million to $640 million. The first half of the year brought in $294 million, and even if there's no growth for the rest of the year, sales would reach the low end of guidance: $294 + $159 + $159 = $612 million.Clearly Seattle Genetics needs to keep its foot on the gas, pushing sales of Adcetris higher. But the next growth opportunity is around the corner, with a second drug, enfortumab vedotin, currently under review at the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of urothelial cancer.Given the strong data and unmet need, an approval for enfortumab vedotin seems likely -- so likely that Seattle Genetics and its partner Astellas have already started preparing for the commercial launch, including hiring a sales force so they'll be trained by the time the drug is approved.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Image source: The Motley Fool.  Q1 2019 , Good day, and welcome to the Seattle Genetics First Quarter 2019 Financial Results. Today's conference is being recorded.At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Peggy Pinkston, Vice President Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir, ma'am. -- Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to welcome all of you to Seattle Genetics First Quarter 2019 Conference Call. With me today are Clay Siegall, President and Chief Executive Officer; Todd Simpson, Chief Financial Officer; and Roger Dansey, Chief Medical Officer.Accompanying today's conference call are supporting slides, which are available on our website in the Investors section under the Events and Presentations page. And following our prepared remarks today, we'll open the line for questions.Today's conference call will include forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial and operating performance of the company such as those, among others, relating to the company's 2019 financial outlook, including anticipated 2019 ADCETRIS sales and future revenues; cost and expenses; and the company's potential and anticipated timing to achieve future clinical and regulatory milestones, including data readouts, regulatory submissions and approvals.Actual results or developments may differ materially from those projected or implied in these forward-looking statements. Among the factors that may cause such a difference include the difficulty in forecasting sales, revenues and expenses and the uncertainty associated with the pharmaceutical development and regulatory approval process.More information about the risks and uncertainties faced by Seattle Genetics is contained under the caption Risk Factors, included in the company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.Now I'll turn the call over to Clay. -- Thanks, Peg, and good afternoon, everyone. During the first quarter of 2019, we further positioned Seattle Genetics to become a multiproduct oncology company. This was illustrated by the remarkable top line data we reported from the enfortumab vedotin in trial in metastatic urothelial cancer, which puts EV on path to becoming our next marketed drug.We have also reached the targeted patient enrollment in pivotal trials of our 2 other late-stage programs, tucatinib in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer and tisotumab vedotin in metastatic cervical cancer. These late-stage pipeline milestones are in addition to continued ADCETRIS sales growth. ADCETRIS net sales in U.S. and Canada were $135 million in the first quarter.ADCETRIS sales are typically lower in the first quarter and grow throughout the year. Ordering patterns in January were light compared to December, but we have seen growth month-over-month since then including a strong April to date. Sales in the first quarter of 2019 increased by 42% over the first quarter of 2018. And we are maintaining our guidance of full year 2019 ADCETRIS net sales in the range of $610 million to $640 million.We expect ADCETRIS sales will continue to grow in the U.S. and Canada driven primarily by our 2 frontline approvals in 2018. First, stage III and IV classical Hodgkin lymphoma in March and more recently, CD30-expressing PTCL in November. This brings the number of approved indications to 6 since initial launch in 2011.One key dynamic in frontline Hodgkin lymphoma is the NCCN Guidelines, which are more restrictive than our labeled indication. These guidelines are translated into treatment pathways. Importantly, there was a recent update to NCCN Guidelines for ADCETRIS in a number of clinical settings. In frontline stage III and IV Hodgkin lymphoma, the guidelines are now less restrictive toward utilization of the E1 regimen.Notably, the compendia listing now includes a 2A recommendation for patients with no known neuropathy. This provides an opportunity for our commercial and medical affairs teams to update physicians and work with pathways toward more closely aligning use of ADCETRIS with the approved frontline indication. Roger will speak to other recent changes to the NCCN Guidelines.We are intensifying our efforts to increase Hodgkin lymphoma patient awareness notably through digital patient outreach. Upon diagnosis, we know that many patients spend a significant amount of time online researching the disease and treatment options.This information allows patients to understand the role that ADCETRIS could have as they discuss treatment options with their physician. We believe raising awareness among patients is important because many physicians see only a few Hodgkin lymphoma patients per year.I'll now turn to our most recent frontline approval in PTCL. While still relatively early in the launch, we're hearing positive reactions to the E2 data, especially to the overall survival advantage that showed a 34% reduction in the risk of death. The efficacy advantage of the ADCETRIS plus CHP regimen demonstrated by the E2 trial resulted in its rapid inclusion in the NCCN Guidelines and treatment pathways that are consistent with the label.There is a significant unmet need in frontline PTCL, and our goal is to establish ADCETRIS plus CHP as the new standard of care for CD30-expressing PTCL patients in the U.S. We and our partner, Takeda, have also made progress outside the U.S. with frontline approvals. In frontline Hodgkin lymphoma, ADCETRIS was approved in Japan in September and in Europe in February. These approvals triggered a combined $40 million in milestone payments to us.In Canada, we also expect a approval decision in frontline Hodgkin lymphoma in the near term, and we recently submitted an application for approval in frontline PTCL. Takeda plans to submit E2 to the EMA and other health authorities this year for frontline PTCL.I'll move on now to enfortumab vedotin or EV, which we're developing in collaboration with Astellas. In late March, we reported positive top line data from the pivotal Phase II trial, EV-201, in patients who had received both a platinum-containing regimen and the PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor.The EV-201 data will be presented in an oral session at the American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting in early June. The pivotal trial also forms the basis of the Biologics License Application that we plan to submit to the FDA this year under its accelerated approval mechanism. We believe the activity and safety profile will be well received by the physician community and may lead to a new standard of care for these patients.This is a transformational period for Seattle Genetics as we expand from hematologic malignancies into a multiproduct company with drugs that also target solid tumors. In addition to EV, we're advancing tucatinib in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer as well as tisotumab vedotin in metastatic cervical cancer. Both of these programs are in pivotal trials. These are followed by a number of earlier-stage programs, including both ADCs and novel agents.Our portfolio is strongly positioned to address the significant unmet medical needs of cancer patients. Antibody drug conjugates are playing an increasingly important role in cancer therapy. This is demonstrated by our results with EV, the positive impact ADCETRIS is having globally in the treatment of lymphoma and progress by other companies.We also have several collaborator ADCs in late-stage development. These include polatuzumab vedotin from Genentech/Roche, which has received priority review in the U.S. for relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and a PDUFA date in August 2019.An approval application was also filed in Europe. GSK is advancing in ADC for multiple myeloma in several ongoing trials and is planning a regulatory submission in the second half of 2019. And AbbVie has an ADC in a Phase III clinical trial for glioblastoma with data expected in 2019. It's an exciting time in the field of ADCs.Now I'll turn the call over to Todd who will discuss our first quarter financial results and then Roger will provide additional comments on our clinical development activities. Todd?Great. Thanks, Clay, and thanks to everyone for joining us on the call this afternoon. Today, I'll summarize our first quarter 2019 financial results and provide a few updates to our guidance for the year.Total revenues in the first quarter of 2019 were $195 million. This included ADCETRIS net sales in the U.S. and Canada of $135 million. This was a 42% increase over the first quarter of 2018 and reflects the 2 label expansions in frontline Hodgkin lymphoma and PTCL. Takeda sales increased meaningfully over the first quarter of 2018.However, royalty revenues in the first quarter of 2018 included additional amounts attributable to Takeda's portion of third-party royalty obligations some of which expired in 2018. Therefore, despite the increase in sales by Takeda, royalty revenues in the first quarter of 2019 were comparable and the cost of royalty revenues decreased.Collaboration revenues were $45 million in the first quarter of 2019 primarily driven by amounts earned under our ADCETRIS collaboration with Takeda and our ADC deals. This includes the earned portion of a $30 million milestone payment from Takeda related to ADCETRIS approval in Europe for frontline Hodgkin lymphoma.Turning now to expenses. R&D expenses were $158 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to $153 million in the first quarter of 2018. Expenses in 2019 primarily reflect investment across our pipeline, notably our late-stage programs, EV, tucatinib and TV.SG&A expenses increased to $80 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to $66 million in the first quarter of 2018. This increase reflects commercial efforts to support ADCETRIS in the new frontline indications as well as costs related to our late-stage pipeline programs.We ended the first quarter with $418 million in cash and investments. This is an addition to approximately $148 million in common stock holdings in Immunomedics at the end of the quarter. As a reminder, these shares are mark-to-market and that resulted in a noncash investment gain of $38 million for the first quarter.Regarding our 2019 financial guidance, last quarter, I mentioned that we expected to provide updates based on progress with our late-stage programs, including pivotal trial outcome. One of those trials was EV-201, and based on the positive results, we are increasing our expectations for expenses.We now expect 2019 R&D expenses to be in the range of $650 million to $700 million, and that SG&A expenses for the year will be in the range of $300 million to $335 million. These increases reflect the clinical development activities for EV as well as launch preparation activities of our late-stage assets. Our other guidance remains unchanged.Now I'll turn the call over to Roger. -- Thanks, Todd, and good afternoon, everyone. As Clay indicated, exciting results from the EV-201 trial in previously treated metastatic urothelial cancer patients support our plans to submit a BLA this year. Among patients who received both the platinum regimen and a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor, the confirmed objective response rate was 44%.And the duration of response was consistent with that recently reported from the Phase I trial. From a safety perspective, the most common treatment-related adverse events included fatigue, alopecia, decreased appetite, rash and peripheral neuropathy. The BLA submission is a priority and our clinical development and regulatory teams are working together with our partner at Astellas to rapidly achieve this important objective.We continue to work on expanding the clinical development plan for this highly active ADC in urothelial cancer. We are still enrolling a second cohort of the EV-201 trial of metastatic urothelial cancer patients who received the PD-1 or PD-L1 treatment but our platinum-naive and ineligible to platinum. This is also a population with a high unmet need. In addition, the confirmatory trial EV-301 is enrolling in the same population as EV-201 cohort 1 and is well under way.Importantly, we are also conducting the EV-103 trial, which combines EV with pembrolizumab and/or platinum chemotherapy in the first-line metastatic setting. The positive EV-201 top line data have also opened the door to other opportunities for EV that we and Astellas are considering for the development, including in other solid tumors.Next, I'll return to ADCETRIS. We continue to work on ensuring that the medical community is educated on the E1 study, including the updated data presented at ASH in 2018. These data show that with extended follow-up, the PFS benefit for ADCETRIS plus AVD was maintained and the peripheral neuropathy continued to resolve.We are communicating the outcomes of E1 by interim PET status as we think this is also important information for oncologists. ABVD is frequently modified in clinical practice using an end-of-cycle 2 PET-adapted approach to either reduce the potential for lung injury from exposure to bleomycin or escalate the intensity of chemotherapy if needed due to lack of response. The ADCETRIS plus AVD regiment E1 did not contain bleomycin and was not adapted by PET status.While cross-trial comparisons have their limitations, the data from E1 appear to be better in similar patient populations then, for example, the PET-adapted RATHL trial. Related to the NCCN Hodgkin lymphoma guidelines, ADCETRIS combined with bendamustine or with Opdivo is now listed as specific regimens in the second-line setting. The availability of these combination regimens are important for patients as they provide well-tolerated and effective options for outpatient-based salvage therapy.Another update to the guideline is in frontline Hodgkin lymphoma where ADCETRIS combined with dacarbazine is now listed as a treatment option for patients over the age of 60 with either Stage I or II unfavorable disease and for all Stage III and IV patients. We believe this is also an important addition as it recognizes the value of ADCETRIS in a failed and difficult-to-treat population that is traditionally associated with poor outcomes.Another area we're focused for ADCETRIS is its potential for the new development opportunities. ADCETRIS is part of various combination regimens, has been shown to be highly active in a number of settings in Hodgkin lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. We are now evaluating several trial designs that could support ADCETRIS label expansion and/or result in practice-informing data sets. We'll keep you posted as these plans mature.I'll now move on to our 2 pivotal-state programs, tucatinib and tisotumab vedotin. Tucatinib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets HER2. The primary focus of this program is a randomized pivotal trial called HER2CLIMB in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, including patients with brain metastasis. We announced earlier this year that we've enrolled 480 patients in HER2CLIMB, which will support analysis of the PFS primary endpoint.Today, we announced the target enrollment of 600 patients for HER2CLIMB has been range. As a reminder, the increased trial size strengthens the analysis of the key secondary endpoints, which are overall survival in the entire study and PFS in patients with brain metastasis.These will be important additional endpoints in assessing how tucatinib may help patients in need. We believe tucatinib has the potential to be a best-in-class HER2 TKI. HER2CLIMB has rapidly advanced, and we are looking forward to reporting data later this year.Tisotumab vedotin or TV is an ADC that we are developing in partnership with Genmab. We are conducting a pivotal Phase II single-arm, single-agent trial for women with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer, which has recently completed enrollment and is designed to support a regulatory submission under the FDA's accelerated approval mechanism. The primary endpoint of this trial is confirmed objective response rate by independent review.Updated data from the Phase I trial were recently reported at the Society of Gynecologic Oncology annual meeting showing a 22% confirmed objective response rate by independent review with a medium duration of response of 6 months. The safety profile of TV was as previously reported. We remain encouraged by the data in this setting where there is no standard of care and outcomes are poor. We and Genmab are also evaluating TV in combination with other agents to inform our strategy of moving TV into earlier lines of cervical cancer. Further, we are enrolling patients in trials of TV with other solid tumors.Beyond our late-stage portfolio, we are advancing several other targeted therapies for cancer. This includes ladiratuzumab vedotin, which is in multiple trials for triple-negative breast cancer, including in combination with pembrolizumab. In addition, we expect to submit several more INDs during 2019 and 2020 for other agents.For example, at AACR earlier this month, we presented pre-clinical data on SGN-CD228A, a novel auristatin-based ADC for solid tumors. The data showed antitumor activity on several models, including melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer. We expect to initiate the first Phase I trial of this agent in 2019 after IND approval.With that, I'll turn the call back over to Clay. -- Thanks, Roger. Before we open the line for questions, I'll recap the key upcoming activities across our portfolio. First, continue establishing ADCETRIS as a standard of care in frontline Hodgkin lymphoma and frontline PTCL. Second, report full results from EV pivotal trial in urothelial cancer at ASCO in June and submit the BLA to FDA this year.Third, report top line data from the tucatinib pivotal trial, HER2CLIMB in 2019. And lastly, advance the pivotal trial of TV in cervical cancer, which is now fully enrolled. At this point, we'll open the line for Q&A. Operator, please open the call for questions.(Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from Michael Schmidt with Guggenheim. -- Clay, could you maybe comment a little bit more on the ADCETRIS sales in the first quarter and through the dynamics relative to the fourth quarter figure in terms of organic growth and then contribution of ordering patterns? Can you just help us understand those dynamics a little bit better? -- Well, sure, I could comment on. Let me start by saying that ADCETRIS is a remarkable drug that patients and doctors really depend on. First of all, there is a typical softness in sales in the first quarter. And we've seen this pretty much every year and you see it in other oncology products as well. But what I could say is in January, the sales were lower and higher in February and higher in March, and we've had a really strong April.So I think when you look at month to month to month, we're really feeling good about where it's going through time. Second of all, please note that as we've mentioned many times that ADCETRIS is -- in frontline, is coming up against entrenched standard of care that have been around for 40 years. So it does take time. And the third thing that I'll mention, maybe you didn't ask, but we also discussed the very recent NCCN changes and these we think will be important going forward. -- And then could you -- a question on HER2CLIMB. You mentioned the study is now fully enrolled. Just a question on potentially filing time lines here. Would you anticipate filing potentially based on the initial PFS data set and then submitting the OS analysis later on? Or would potentially have to wait for the full data set to read out, including secondary endpoints for potential filing assuming success, obviously? -- These are a really, really good questions that we talk about internally. I mean some of what you asked is confidential to what we're doing, but I'll turn it over to Roger to give you a little bit of color on how we're thinking about HER2CLIMB with the caveat that we can't answer all of what you're saying at this point, Michael. -- So thanks, Clay. So as you pointed out, the primary endpoint PFS is on the entire population, and we 2 key secondary endpoints, PFS in patients with brain metastases and overall survival. I mean in general, in a clinical trial circumstance, the primary endpoint is the key focus of the trial.And so readouts and plans that one would make around if a trial is positive, what would a defining approach look like is focused primarily on the primary endpoint. Although the secondary endpoint is obviously very important to have as well. So without giving any specifics around what we're doing, that's sort of general guidance. Hopefully, it's of some help.Our next question comes from Kennen MacKay with RBC Capital Markets. -- Another one on ADCETRIS and the guidance. I guess just looking at the guidance, it seems like throughout the rest of 2019, we're going to need quarter-over-quarter growth somewhere from 5% to 10% or 11% to reach the low and high end of guidance respectively?And I guess thinking about the quarter-over-quarter growth we saw from Q4 to Q1, can you help us understand sort of where this is going to come from? I guess it's hard for me to really conceptualize how much of Q1 was just sort of order timing impact, especially when there was a price benefit that came throughout the quarter.And then beyond that, I was wondering if you would help us understand what is sort of going on in the relapsed/refractory Hodgkin setting with the NCCN Guideline changes midyear and last year, it seems like there's potential for some clinicians to sequence checkpoints in front of ADCETRIS? Is that something that is, sort of, taking place? Obviously, the standard of care there is going to change within the next couple of years, but any color as to commercially what's happening would be super helpful? -- Sure. It's a bunch of questions there; I'll try to take as I heard them. So as far as the sales and our guidance, look, we feel that this quarter-over-quarter -- I mean, excuse me, month-over-month change in the sales has been very important, and it does matter a lot of history and matches a lot of other cancer drugs, which they have some seasonality right after the holiday. So I wouldn't get too wrapped up in it.I mean we did not provide quarterly guidance. We provided an annual guidance that we feel that we can hit, and we feel that the growth is tracking well. The E2 launch is going well. We hear from a lot of docs for this, but we're only one quarter outed to that. So it's early.We have more data coming out at ASCO on watching E1 age and it's -- the data is a strong. And so all of that is something that we really feel is good. But going to the guidelines, the NCCN Guidelines initially were more restrictive than the label.And -- but the committee of doctors has -- literally a couple of weeks ago, has made changes that can open the previous limitations that were there for some doctors and some pathways to write prescriptions because it now more closely matches the label, which is what the case is for E2 but for E1 had never really matched a label.But now it's much closer as of the few weeks ago. So we think that, that's something that's very important to get out there, talking to doctors and talking to pathways. So that's a complete new thing for us to work on.And -- but we're really excited with what we see as the growth of the product with doctors and their happiness in using it and helping patients. As far as the price specifics you mentioned, I'll turn that over to Todd to talk a little bit about the price benefit in some specifics. And then Todd you could turn it back to me to talk about the last question. -- Great. Thanks, Clay. Kennen, good question. So I did want to give a little bit more color on the price increase. We did have a price increase in January, but when you look at growth in the quarter, it was predominantly all volume-based.And while that may sound a little bit unusual, maybe I can give a little bit more color around that point. A substantial part of ADCETRIS business is covered under PHS pricing. When we do a price increase, the PHS price is limited to the rate of inflation.So we actually see very little of the price increase come through into net sales as it relates to the PHS part of business. What we saw in Q1 was a little bit of a shift in the mix of business, a little bit more PHS ordering in the quarter.So while we did have a price increase, we didn't see a lot of that come through in the form of a sales driver. And again, most of the increase for the quarter, in fact, the vast majority of the increase was all volume-based. And we think that bodes well for how we're doing with the drug. -- Thanks, Todd. And going to your saying about -- questions about relapsed/refractory Hodgkin lymphoma and checkpoints and it was a conglomeration of question. What I could tell you in the new guidelines, which really are important, you have ADCETRIS plus nivolumab, which is for the first time, only a few weeks ago, is now listed in guidelines. And in fact, previously, the guidelines called out ADCETRIS plus chemotherapy, but it was a little fuzzy. And in the newest guidelines of a few weeks ago, it specifically states ADCETRIS plus bendamustine.And let me just remind you, ADCETRIS plus bendamustine in the relapsed patients has an overall response rate of 93% with a CR rate of 74%, real truly amazing data. And ADCETRIS plus nivolumab has also an overall response rate of 93% and a CR rate of 80% and better tolerated than any bendamustine regimen.So you have 2 choices to use, and it kind of takes the whole concept of do you choose a single agent there and you sequence them and how does it work to be why not get the highest response rate and the highest CR rate that you can get.And with ORRs at 93%, it certainly makes sense for doctors to take a look at that. And now just recently, it's in the guidelines. And so that's something that's really important for the relapsed/refractory patient to consider. -- Super helpful. One ultra-quick follow-up. Just wondering on the EV filing in bladder cancer, just wondering if you could help us understand what the gating factor is for filings here. And what point we might have a little bit more precision on when we might expect a filing here? Looking forward to that data at ASCO. -- Yes. We are working really hard on EV. EV -- I will tell you something. EV is a very important drug for us. And it is -- it's the real deal. This is a special drug and can really help patients. The number of doctors that contact us is a lot. They want -- all the doctors want to be involved with this drug. And so we're working really hard on EV-201 to get that submitted. It is the first time this will be submitted.So it's not a second or third level. So all of the CMC and the manufacturing needs to be included in this one in a way that's different when you have a fourth or fifth or third label or whatever that we've had with ADCETRIS.So this one takes a little longer to put together. But we are working really hard on it. We're very confident with what we're doing and at the same time, have a very big development plan with EV that's going on. So this year is what we're saying for submitting.Our next question comes from Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. -- This is Matthew on for Cory. First on ADCETRIS, I'm curious how you would characterize what you're seeing in terms of physicians prescribing that, depth versus reaching out to more physicians than Q1. -- You know what, it was a little fuzzy, the question. Can you state it one more time? You're asking about ADCETRIS prescribing, I didn't hear that. -- Yes, just wondering how you would characterize physician prescribing depth versus reaching more physicians than Q1. -- Okay. I will say that we keep on seeing more docs prescribing here. So we have not yet had every hematologist prescribe ADCETRIS. It's kind of -- even though it's been out there for a few years, some docs refer out the late-stage patients.And so we're seeing more and more docs come in that -- treating the frontline. So it's really great to continue to see the depth of doctors using ADCETRIS growing. And that's something we're excited about that we've seen in Q1 and have seen every quarter since the data came out. -- Got it. And then on -- just quickly on EV. You mentioned that docs have been calling you and been pretty positive on the top line data. But what are they looking to see in the full data presentation at ASCO? -- Thank you for the question. So we have to reserve a lot of data for the principal investigators that worked on EV to present their data at ASCO. And it was important also for the conference for them to have a lot of data. So there will be a substantial amount of data that is released.And I think that while the top line data of the 44% is out there, there is substantial other data that you can look at that includes other efficacies and CR rates and waterfall plots and safety parameters and all sorts of things that you'll see in the data. So I really would encourage you to listen in.We got an oral presentation in the big section for the appropriate diseases. We're really thrilled with where ASCO put us and looking forward also to making sure we get the publication of these data out in a peer-review journal.So I'm very pleased with what's going on with EV-201. And I just may add that we look forward to, later this year, also putting out data of the combination of EV with checkpoint inhibitors. And that's something we're really very keen on and you'll hear more about that.Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham with Barclays. -- I just got a couple. Clay, you mentioned seeing good month-over-month growth trends. Can you talk a little bit about where you are PTCL versus Hodgkin's just with respect to sequential growth? And beyond guidelines, are there any other external threats that you think could help impact the ADCETRIS' trajectory for the balance of the year? And then I have a follow-up. -- So we don't really break out the Hodgkin's from PTCL, if that's what you're asking. I do understand that we look at it internally, but that's not something we report. But we continue to see growth in both areas and expect that growth will continue there.I think the guidelines is quite important to us. We certainly have provided a lot of data and information to guidelines committees there. And to get the guidelines to be more closely matching the label is something that we have certainly been aspiring to work toward. And this just happened recently.We're very pleased with that. We think it's the right thing for docs and right thing for patients that the guidelines more closely mimic the label. And so we think that, that is really good. As far as you asked the question should we expect more for the rest of the year, the committee meets once a year and they're going to meet later this year, and I can't speculate at whether the committee will do anything more.The committee sometimes for these kind of things, they ask us to provide them data, and we provide them with data. I think that the aging of E1 is only to the benefit, and we continue to present that as it gets longer and longer.And the last time I looked at data, and we presented some data at ASH, you saw the Kaplan-Meier curves get even better when you look at over longer time period. And so I think our data, as its maturing, is improving. And that's a really important factor here. Because as you with E2, we had OS, but with E1, we have not reached OS yet.So as our data matures, doctors will look at this, and I've heard them say that is important for them because Hodgkin lymphoma is a potentially curable disease in a pretty substantial quantity of patients that get chemotherapy and to have longer time in seeing how the Kaplan-Meiers are improving for the ADCETRIS continuing regimen really gives doctors a lot of comfort to use it more and more in their patients. So we see that and we feel that and we're working on that and presenting the data. -- That's helpful. And then on tucatinib, clearly you're making progress in breast cancer with enrollment, but I just want to get your updated view outside of breast. I think CASCADE originally had some data in colon or perhaps other HER2 tumors, but I wasn't sure where you were with that. -- Indeed, we do. Roger, do you want to touch on that? -- Sure, Clay, thanks. So you're correct. The whole HER2 signaling pathway is of relevance where HER2 is overexpressed including in diseases like CRC and gastric cancer. And we're obviously very interested in exploring the role of tucatinib in those 2 diseases.So there is an investigator-initiated trial ongoing looking at CLC. There's the possibility that we may have data available some time later this year, which we think will be important in order to understand what else tucatinib may be able to do.And we are looking carefully at gastric cancer and thinking about what a development plan could potentially look like in that disease, beyond that, even with the whole question of HER2 mutants. So there are lot of opportunities for us to explore tucatinib further.Our next question comes from Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. -- This is Andrea on for Salveen. Maybe first with regards to the sales force that you're envisioning for EV as you launch, can you provide some additional color on how you think that buildup might progress as you move from what has traditionally been indications in blood cancers to solid tumors and then I have a follow-up. -- Thank you very much for the question. So EV, as I mentioned before, it is a very important drug to us -- for us and the data is just -- is strong. And so it's really -- it's remarkable. I mean it's better data when you look at what other drugs have been used for patients that have seen that are relapsed patients or refractory patients, the 44% objective response rate is way above anything else.So it's really unprecedented data in the relapsed setting in that area. So based on that, we are going full force on building the sales for EV. We have a lead person that's in charge of that sales force that reports into our top commercial person and that buildup is happening now.We're going to bring in fantastic people like we've done with ADCETRIS. And we're going to really grow and build this sales force. So that by the time we're ready to launch this product, we will have all of the boots on the ground and we'll be cranking forward.And I'll remind you this is a collaboration with Astellas, and we're working very closely with them on all of the commercial aspects as well. And just in case you're wondering we -- to remind everyone, this drug is a 50-50 around the globe with Astellas. Todd, would you like to add something? -- Yes. So maybe just to give a little bit more color on how we're thinking about commercialization there. As I mentioned in the guidance update, there are some preparatory activities that we have under way.We think that the commercial infrastructure that we've built for ADCETRIS can be leveraged, to a large degree, as far as things like distribution and just leadership, that type of thing. But with respect to a sales force, we do envision it being a completely separate sales force. We want to lead the ADCETRIS team solely devoted to ADCETRIS and then build a separate sales team for EV.And I think with respect to timing, what you should expect and the way we're thinking about it is, once we see what the BLA submission time line looks like and get some insights into what kind of a PDUFA date might look like, then we'll start to become more active on the broader build on the sales team. Clay was right, we're doing some of the leadership pieces now, but the real boots on the ground would be pending more of a clear look at the submission time line. -- Okay. And then just one on tucatinib. Can you help us think about the opportunity there just in the context of a number of other competitors' agents that also target HER2 having shown positive benefits? -- Sure. Yes, thanks for the question. It's Roger here. So bear in mind, tucatinib is an oral small molecule TKI inhibitor and it's taken obviously orally. The competitors that you're referring to I think are the other TKIs, neratinib, lapatinib, we do thing we have a best-in-class HER2 TKI. So depending on how HER2 claim plays out, we may be able to make that argument very clearly.Other molecules such as margetuximab where we will see some data at ASCO is essentially a better form of trastuzumab. And so from a, sort of, direct competitor perspective, we would see it more as a potential combination approach rather than a direct competitor.Our next question comes from Andrew Berens with SVB. -- Just another question on the guidelines. When I look at the revised guidelines relative to the previous ones, one of the issues I thought with the previous guidelines was it really didn't recognize that ADCETRIS substitution follow-on had an efficacy benefit. And I'm still -- I'm looking at this revision and it still lists the ABVD regimen as preferred and the other regimens, including BEACOPP and the A+AVD regimen as useful in certain circumstances.So I still just don't get that sense what the doctors are going to see this as a potential to get better efficacy to mimic what you guys saw in ECHELON-1. So I just was wondering how you can get the message to the doctors that this is not just a drug to use in patients that have lung disease or don't have neuropathy and get a -- seen as the preferred regimen. -- Roger, do you want to comment on the guidelines? -- Sure. So the wording has changed. And it's pretty clear that the description in the earlier -- in the prior version was a definition of what patients represent category 2A. And the wording was such that it appeared as though you had to have multiple conditions in place in order to be considered a 2A. So had to have no neuropathy plus IPS greater than 4 or bleomycin contraindicated.The wording now is much clearer. It states that category 2A in select patients, for example, no known neuropathy or IPS greater than 4 or bleomycin contraindicated. So the wording really shifts the definition of category 2A more clearly into there's no known neuropathy group.And of course patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma are generally younger people and at diagnosis in an untreated stage are likely to have neuropathy. So it obviously is a subtlety around the difference between category 2B and 2A, nevertheless, it's a very important difference in regard to the guidelines indicating unanimous agreement around the recommendation. -- And I will add that there is a lot of patients with Hodgkin lymphoma are under groups that proscribe to certain pathways. And when you look at certain pathways, if you're not a 2A, then a lot of pathways discourage use for a variety of reasons.And so doctors are hesitant to use it when it is not a 2A. And this opens up the vast majority of patients now for 2A. So it's a big difference from what we've had. And this is within 2 weeks old. And so we're just now to get out there and it really has the potential to impact the pathways and the log jam that we had with various groups. -- All right. Well, I mean it's definitely an improvement, but what's going to take to get it to the preferred treatment for it to reflect that, there's actually an efficacy benefit if you substitute A+AVD? I just wonder when I look at this, the preferred regimen of the ABVD for two cycles and then you restage and then there's 3 branches, which could include A+AVD for support cycles or the other 2 options in chemotherapy. And I just wonder if the reason of the guidelines are not recognizing the full benefit that ECHELON-1 has because it wasn't compared to one of these other branches in the tree. -- You're asking some really good questions, and over time, guidelines can change, and we just saw a change in guideline. We remained very excited about our data. There is no doubt that ADCETRIS AVD is a better regimen for patients. And you get -- you don't have the bleomycin toxicity and you get a higher efficacy.And as we track this longer and longer, we get even better efficacy. So it is -- there is no doubt to us that ADCETRIS AVD is the best regimen. What we're talking about is entrenched 40-year regimens by doctors who a lot of these people making the rules are the same doctors that did these trials and put it together.And so it is a -- it is -- you're up against something that when we started and said, we're going to improve frontline Hodgkin lymphoma and get a higher cure rate without the deaths and toxicity associated with bleomycin, there were some folks who said why you're doing this, Hodgkin lymphoma is cured in everybody, which is not true.There are a lot of patients where it's not cured and a lot of patients suffer the side effects. Some patients die from the side effects. And the more docs we get out there, the more docs are convinced to use ADCETRIS AVD. So we are working along this entrenched pathway and making really good progress. -- Okay. Is there any plans to expand the sales force to reach the community docs more? And what percentage of the community docs have been detailed on the ECHELON-1 results? -- Thank you for the question. We actually expanded our sales force when we went into and got frontline approval. So we added another 50% to the sales force. We think that our sales force now -- with our enhanced sales force is the right size.We feel that we are detailing the community docs and the academic docs as much as possible. As you know, there is a lot of roadblocks to detailing with docs these days. It's not as easy that it used to be to get out in their office, get their time, get their attention. We've been doing a lot of different things.One of the things that's pretty darn effective is hosting regional dinners with key opinion leaders coming to give talks about what the data are with Hodgkin lymphoma and when docs hear key opinion leaders talk about the data and they talk about the benefits of ADCETRIS-containing regimen, we see improved ordering because they're helping patients.So we need to continue doing the best we can do to get out into the field with the appropriate and compliant ways of doing it in 2019 and beyond because these compliance rules of talking to docs change all the time. And they're making it really tough to talk to docs in a way that it used to. But we're getting through that. We have a lot of great things going on. And the other thing that we've been working really hard is the whole digital approach.We're increasing our focus on digital because patients come in and especially these young people, which is a big chunk of Hodgkin lymphoma, and they go right to the Internet. They want to know what's going on.And so we're increasing our focus on banner ads and social media advertisements and media placements to get the people that go online to go on and see the data and look at the data. And those people, they talk to their docs about this.And what we hear it from the docs, they like that, they like the patient take some activity and looks at the data. And they like to have that discussion with patients when patients are informed of the newest data. So this is something that we're really adding a lot of focus to.Our next question comes from Tazeen Ahmad with Bank of America. -- Clay, a couple for you. You said at the beginning of the call that the beginning of the year was impacted by seasonality. I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on what the drivers of that seasonality might be.And then to follow up on your comments about the collaborations and upcoming data with some of your partners including GSK, for example, could you give us a sense, based on what you know about the indications being studied, that which of them could potentially have the most impact in terms of payments to SGN over time? And then I have a follow-up for Todd on financials. -- Yes. So we see the seasonality event happening pretty much every year. Hodgkin lymphoma is not a superfast moving disease like some diseases are. And if you're not feeling well and you have night sweats or fever and you go to your doc, you don't know necessarily of Hodgkin lymphoma or if you're just diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma, you may decide to delay treatment until after the holiday.So you first start coming in perhaps sometime in January for even your first dose. So it can delay your treatment and that way you could spend the holidays with your family. And it's just something you could see in a more slow-moving tumor than some of the more rapid ones where you got to hop on it that minute.So we do see the seasonality. It's something we see over and over and over from year to year. So it was not surprising to us to see February being better than January and March better than February and April being very strong. So we're really happy with what we're seeing right now. Onto the collaborations, you brought up GSK.GSK has some fantastic data in multiple myeloma with their BCMA antibody drug conjugate. What we hear from them is they're planning to submit in the second half of this year. And we're delighted through the impact in multiple myeloma.That is a potential large market. And they also are doing many other trials, including frontline. And so that potentially could be a really big drug for GSK and really beneficial to patients and to Seattle Genetics.The other two collaborator drugs that we pointed out in our prepared remarks included Genentech/Roche with polatuzumab for non-Hodgkin lymphoma and that is likely -- to me, likely to get approved this year. Their PDUFA date is August.The data that they have is fantastic. And I was very impressive with the data. And they're also doing frontline trial. So both GSK and Genentech are looking toward getting their first approvals in the relapsed setting but then moving into frontline with ongoing trials. So it's not just hand waiving. It's very exciting to see what these 2 drug conjugates can do in patients.And lastly, AbbVie, they have a glioblastoma drug. They put out their numbers this morning and on their conference call talked about this drug for glioblastoma and their excitement level with it. So that's something that you should definitely keep on the lookout for when AbbVie releases data from their Phase III trial. -- Okay. And then Todd, you talked about the changes that you expect for expenses heading into the rest of the year with regards to R&D. Can you directionally give us a sense on what proportion of your spend in R&D is going to be for your late-stage trials versus your early pipeline expirations? And then can you just give us a sense of what the cash runway is based on where you are today? -- Sure. So with respect to late versus early, I think, as probably you would expect, the late-stage programs have advanced quite nicely with multiple drugs in pivotal studies. So without getting into a specific allocation of what gets spent by program, you can rest assured that the lion share of the investment is in late-stage programs.ADCETRIS continues to actually be fairly significant area of spent for us. EV I, think, will be cranking up now with the very positive results we saw from the 201 study. Tucatinib has been a big program and will continue throughout the year.And then drugs like LV and TV are cranking along as well. TV, we just recently announced that the pivotal study has been fully enrolled. So we're very focused in the late-stage pipeline. But I think as we've talked about before, there's also a deep pipeline of other assets in technology that we continue to look at.So we don't only invest in late-stage, we're trying to keep the pipeline full as well. And then with respect to cash runway, the company continues to be in a really strong position. ADCETRIS is a strong base of business for us through not only our sales in the U.S. and Canada, but through the royalties that we receive from Takeda.So that continues to really provide a lot of fuel for the engine, so to speak. And we have a strong cash position. We ended the quarter with about $420 million on the balance sheet. That doesn't include obviously the investment we have in Immunomedics, which is about another $140 million to $150 million. So we feel really good about where we are even with the added burn and feel that we're well positioned to continue really aggressively pushing all of our programs forward.Our next question comes from Stephen Willey with Stifel. -- I know it's early in terms of PTCL but just kind of wondering if you could maybe characterize some of the initial commercial dynamics you're seeing there, specifically with respect to utilization in some of those subtypes beyond ALCL. And then I have a follow-up. -- Yes. Thanks for the question. We hear really good things about the use of ADCETRIS to the E2 regimen and all the different subtypes. We're not hearing that docs are not using it in certain areas. That's just not what we're hearing. I do want to say that for the E2 regimen, and we've previously said this, that the number of cycles that a patient gets is a little less than E1 regimen.And they're just based on how they're treated and in our protocol, there's always less cycles. So the standard patient with E2 is less financial -- less of a payment for the drug than it is for E1. So that's something -- it's about 20-or-so percent less, something like that per patient. But it depends certainly on their size. So that is something just to point out that they're not exactly equivalent. And you have another question? -- Yes. So I know retreatment with ADCETRIS appears to be a fairly well-accepted concept within the realm of Hodgkin's. But just wondering if you think this is a phenomenon that we'll see play out over time in PTCL? And I guess, how you're thinking about the legacy relapsed/refractory sales you're generating in ALCL? -- Sure. Retreatment with ADCETRIS works really well. I mean we have data -- early on we had data that showed 70% retreatment reresponse rate and that was in Hodgkin lymphoma. And I hear from docs that they feel comfortable in using ADCETRIS in retreatment.One of the things that happened was when we first got approval, we had a cap of how many cycles of ADCETRIS could be used in a patient. And that was in 2011. But when -- as we provided more data to regulators, only a few years after that, they removed the cap. So I think that was in 2013 or '14, they removed the cap on the use of ADCETRIS.So it's capped to 1 year of potential use. You can now use ADCETRIS as you see -- as the doctor sees fit, much like how they use Rituxan. They treat with Rituxan and then they come up with another regimen and come up with another regimen. And we've shown that, that can be very valuable for patients. So we feel very good about retreatment. And you had another -- I forget the second part of your question. -- No, that was it.Our next question comes from Shanshan Xu with Berenberg Capital Markets. -- I think you have talked about the North American subgroup analysis of ECHELON-1 quite a bit in the past. I'm just curious that you published another subgroup analysis on AYA, adolescent and young adult patients in which actually the risk reduction for the traditional PFS is 40%, and that was in 2018 ASH.This is a very impressive data and I'm wondering if there's any ongoing effort to promote this AYA data in the medical community, given that the younger patients will probably tolerate ADCETRIS better and they receive additional survival benefit from it. And could this become another tailwind for ADCETRIS? -- So first of all, thank you for seeing our data. We really are excited with our data with E1 and it proves over and over, every time you look at it, every time we age a data, looking at the North American region, looking at the young folks, the E1 regimen definitely outperforms ABVD every which way we look at it.And so -- but showing the data in these subpopulations is not necessarily something you can promote to. So it's really good for us to get out the publications and put them in great journals. And doctors can see what we're doing and the power of the ADCETRIS-containing frontline regimens. -- Another forming is that I would like to touch briefly upon EV-103. So this is a combination trial in the first-line you see with cisplatin or carboplatin. So given that EV is essentially a chemotherapy, actually with -- obviously with the GPS with the navigation, so how should we think about the tolerability and toxicity profile for the combination of chemotherapy together with EV? -- So first of all, when you think about EV-103, it has a couple of different groups in there. First of all, and probably the most important of the groups in EV-103 is EV plus pembrolizumab or KEYTRUDA, as it's called.And that subgroup is the one we have been focused on the most. And that's the subgroup where we think that we've been collecting a lot of data in substantive amount of patients. And I think there's a decent chance we will present those data later this year. So stay tuned for the group of EV-103, arguably the most important with EV and pembrolizumab.In that same trial, there's also an arm that's EV plus a platinum. And that's something that we wanted to look at -- largely to look at what the safety is because we've never really put those 2 together. And the reason is, we may also look -- or also contemplated in EV-103 is putting a platinum regimen plus a checkpoint plus EV together in a triplet.So that's also contemplated in that, in EV-103. And that is because there are quite a few companies now doing trials in the frontline combining checkpoints with platinum regimens. And so we wanted to be prepared for whichever way this goes, our first approval is going to be what we're submitting for EV-201 is in patients that have been exposed to both a platinum and a checkpoint. And so that's initially.But as we go toward frontline, it is really important to know all the parameters, all the components -- what the components bring forward and then we can make the best choice for frontline. But I'm really jazzed up about our options in frontline in the future. And Roger has a comment. -- Sure. So on the point of combining agents, just bear in mind when you look at, for example, ADCETRIS, which has the same vedotin component as the EV molecule, we've combined ADCETRIS actually quite well, including, for example, vinblastine in the E1 program.There is some early data with ADCETRIS looking at a platinum-containing regimen and we believe they were tolerable. So the -- obviously we have to test the safety and report out the safety and make sure that these sorts of combinations with chemotherapy are indeed tolerable and safe. But it may well be that we can get significant additive benefits combining with these agents.As Clay indicated, I think our focus is heavily weighted toward the PD-1, but we do need to understand what EV looks like, both from a safety and then from an efficacy perspective, when we look at the other agents that are commonly used in bladder cancer such that if any particular combination looks particularly favorable and has an acceptable safety profile, that's something we can take forward.Our next question comes from Silvan Tuerkcan with Oppenheimer. -- You already touched on treatment options in breast cancer a bit, but I want to ask about the since being renewed interest in HER2 targeting ADCs, I think Roche is working on one. And there was a deal between AstraZeneca and Daiichi. Could you just let us know what potential differentiators are there between the different ADCs targeting HER2 plus? -- Well, that's sort of a question outside a little bit of Seattle Genetics, if you will. And what I would tell you is, TDM-1 seems to be a very important drug and helps a lot of patients. And if used in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer along with -- I mean trastuzumab or Herceptin is used same way the PERJETA or -- and same way the TDM-1.So there's really a suit that Genentech/Roche sells of HER2-targeted agents. I think that the Daiichi Sankyo 8201 looks very interesting. I think it can really help patients. And that's a drug that I think you should keep an eye out for. And Roche is constantly looking at HER2. So I can't comment on what they have in their pipeline.Our next question comes from Andy Hsieh with William Blair. -- I just have a question on the second-line Hodgkin physician adoption. So probably for Roger. So in terms of ADCETRIS plus bendamustine, ADCETRIS plus nivolumab or added to the NCCN Guidelines, do you think that these regimens are mostly for ABVD upfront or be a cop upfront? Or do you think, given, I think, Steve's question earlier about retreatment, you can actually get a lot of patients from the E1 regimen to go on these 2 combinations? -- Yes. I think the point was made earlier that retreatment with ADCETRIS appears to be vary in Hodgkin lymphoma. So in the circumstance of having initial therapies and the reasonable gap between individual therapy and follow-on treatment, ADCETRIS monotherapy is acceptable.The ADCETRIS, as Clay indicated earlier, ADCETRIS plus bendo, ADCETRIS plus nivo, both of those outcomes, they're small data sets, but they are very encouraging results and have obviously risen to the level where the guidelines committee has considered them worthy of recommendation.So the idea of someone, for example, getting E1 in the frontline and then having relapse and then getting reexposed to ADCETRIS, again, I think is an entirely reasonable concept, if that's what you're asking. I think you would expect that the regimen should be tolerable. -- And also -- you also emphasized the CR rates. Is that in the context of bringing these patients to transplant eventually? -- Exactly, exactly. I think as you heard in the prepared remarks, ADCETRIS plus bendo is a tolerable regimen, ADCETRIS plus nivolumab is a tolerable regimen with remarkable results, high CR rate -- high ROR and high CR rates, which is exactly the circumstance patients need to be in as they head into transplantation. So providing obviously you need to have an outpatient salvage rate, which lines you up for a good outcome post-transplant is what we think these regimens may offer patients. -- Andy, if you are a Hodgkin lymphoma patient, what you want the most is to get at cure with your first treatment regimen. And what ADCETRIS offers upfront is a higher long-term disease-free survival rate than what ABVD offered. And then in that small population that's remaining, they also want to have another bite at the apple for a cure.And what you want to do is you want to get a patient into a CR and do a transplant, if you need to go that direction. And the CR rates that we have with ADCETRIS and benda or ADCETRIS and nivo are extraordinarily high. So there are really 2 different ways you can get to cure with Hodgkin lymphoma.And if you're a patient with Hodgkin lymphoma, you're -- you have options to get a substantial amount of these people into long-term disease-free survival. And ultimately, a lot of these patients could be cured meaning they don't die of their Hodgkin lymphoma in their lifetime.And so could we all die of something? And so it is really exciting to me to see how ADCETRIS has redefined the landscape of how you treat Hodgkin lymphoma, and I believe we'll end up curing a lot more patients. -- Great. And just one thing. Am I correct in thinking that the manufacturing issue that was brought up during this Q4 call that's been completely resolved? -- I wouldn't call it manufacturing issue. We reported that we had to remake 1 batch of drug. Andy, I will tell you that we have manufactured and supplied ADCETRIS to 72 countries since 2011 without any failure to do so and working with regulators around the globe. We're pretty good at this. Todd, do you have any comments? -- Well, yes. I was just going to say, there wasn't a manufacturing issue, there was a quality release threshold that we didn't meet on a few batches. So we let them go. But to Clay's point, we've never had a supply interruption and that happened in Q4 didn't even put us close to that. And we have now substantially reestablished all that inventory. So we're in good shape.And we have no further questions in the queue at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back to our presenters for any closing remarks. -- Okay. Thank you, operator, and thanks, everybody, for joining us this afternoon. Have a good evening.Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's presentation.

  continued its solid year-over-year increases in revenue as the biotech takes advantage of recent approvals that expanded the use of Adcetris into frontline Hodgkin lymphoma and peripheral T-cell lymphoma.Data source: Seattle Genetics.Image source: Getty Images.Seattle Genetics' CEO, Clay Siegall,  plans to ramp up sales of Adcetris for frontline Hodgkin lymphoma:We are intensifying our efforts to increase Hodgkin lymphoma patient awareness notably through digital patient outreach. Upon diagnosis, we know that many patients spend a significant amount of time online researching the disease and treatment options. This information allows patients to understand the role that Adcetris could have as they discuss treatment options with their physician. We believe raising awareness among patients is important because many physicians see only a few Hodgkin lymphoma patients per year.Sales of Adcetris in the U.S. and Canada were basically flat quarter over quarter, but Siegall said that's typical of many oncology drugs after the December holidays and noted that sales ramped as the quarter went on. Ultimately, he advised:I wouldn't get too wrapped up in it. I mean we did not provide quarterly guidance. We provided an annual guidance that we feel that we can hit, and we feel that the growth is tracking well.While the company maintained  for 2019 Adcetris sales, it upped expectations for spending on research and development and on sales, general, and administrative expenses as it prepares to get enfortumab vedotin approved and launched. Don't expect the company to turn profitable soon.In addition to the potential approval of enfortumab vedotin, Seattle Genetics has a stake in polatuzumab vedotin from Genentech (a part of ), which should get a decision from the FDA in August.  is also planning on submitting belantamab mafodotin, which uses Seattle Genetics' antibody-drug-conjugate technology, in the second half of this year. If approved, Seattle Genetics will get royalties on sales of both drugs.And on the pipeline front, look for data later this year from the Her2climb study testing tucatinib in patients with metastatic breast cancer as well as late-stage data from a partnered drug, depatuxizumab mafodotin, being developed by  in patients with glioblastoma.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

 along with Japanese partner Astellas Pharma, Inc announced positive top-line results from the first cohort of the phase II EV-201 study on enfortumab vedotin. The candidate is being evaluated in the pivotal study for the treatment of patients with advanced/metastatic urothelial cancer who were previously treated with both a checkpoint inhibitor (PD-1/PD-L1) and platinum-based chemotherapy.Both the companies plan to submit a biologics license application (BLA) for enfortumab vedotin to the FDA later this year.Results from this study demonstrated a 44% objective response rate (ORR), per blinded independent central review. Moreover, the duration of response was similar to that of the previously reported data from phase I EV-101 study. The companies plan to present this data at an upcoming medical meeting.Enfortumab vedotin is an investigational antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) targeting Nectin-4, a cell adhesion molecule that is expressed in many solid tumors.We would like to remind investors that, in July 2018, Seattle Genetics and Astellas initiated the phase III EV-301 study on enfortumab vedotin in patients with advanced urothelial cancer who previously received both a checkpoint inhibitor (PD-1/PD-L1) and platinum-based chemotherapy. Both the companies also completed the cohort enrollment in EV-201 study for the same.The phase III EV-301 study will support the regulatory filing for potential approval of the candidate.

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the Invesco PureBeta MSCI USA ETF (Symbol: PBUS), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $30.52 per unit.With PBUS trading at a recent price near $27.82 per unit, that means that analysts see 9.69% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of PBUS's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Plains GP Holdings LP (Symbol: PAGP), Seattle Genetics Inc (Symbol: SGEN), and Liberty Media Corp (Symbol: FWONK). Although PAGP has traded at a recent price of $23.36/share, the average analyst target is 18.43% higher at $27.67/share. Similarly, SGEN has 15.29% upside from the recent share price of $69.39 if the average analyst target price of $80.00/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting FWONK to reach a target price of $38.25/share, which is 12.70% above the recent price of $33.94. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of PAGP, SGEN, and FWONK:Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
  
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past.

 month has gone by since the las  report for Seattle Genetics (SGEN). Shares have lost about 6.1% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Seattle Genetics due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recen  in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Seattle Genetics reported an adjusted loss of 57 cents per share for the fourth quarter of 2018, significantly wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 39 cents and also the year-ago quarter's loss of 43 cents.Adjusted loss included a market-to-market net investment loss related to Seattle Genetics' common stock holdings in Immunomedics and a non-cash income tax benefit pertaining to the acquisition of Cascadian Therapeutics.Revenues came in at $174.5 million in the reported quarter, up 34.6% year over year, primarily driven by strong sales and a recent label expansion of Adcetris (brentuximab vedotin) in frontline stage III/IV Hodgkin lymphoma and in frontline CD30-expressing peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL). The top line also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $166 million.Seattle Genetics' top line comprises product revenues, collaboration and license agreement revenues plus royaltiesThe company's only marketed product, Adcetris, generated net sales of $132.1 million in the United States and Canada, up 58% year over year. The improved sales of the drug were owing to its recent label expansions in frontline CD30-expressing PTCL and the frontline Hodgkin's lymphoma resulting in higher patient population.Collaboration and license agreement revenues plunged 31.2% year over year to $17.8 million. This included the amounts earned under the ADC collaboration in the ex-U.S. markets.Royalty revenues rose 23% year over year to $24.6 million on the back of high demand and sales of Adcetris outside Canada and the United States by Takeda.Research and development (R&D) expenses were $149.8 million, up 35.6% year over year, primarily attributable to higher investment across the late-stage pipeline comprising the enfortumab vedotin (EV), tucatinib and tisotumab vedotin (TV) program.Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses soared 63.9% year over year to $79.5 million, mainly on costs pertaining to the acquisition of Cascadian Therapeutics and the rapid approval and launch of Adcetris in frontline PTCL.Seattle Genetics expects full-year total revenues in the range of $790-$840 million. The guidance disappointed as the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $861.8 million.The label expansion of Adcetris for treating frontline stage III/IV Hodgkin lymphoma and frontline CD30-expressing PTCL looks encouraging. The company now projects full-year net sales of Adcetris in the range of $610-$640 million.Seattle Genetics expects collaboration and license revenues in the range of $95-$110 million, backed by milestones received from Takeda. Royalty revenues are anticipated in the band of $85-$90 million.R&D expenses are estimated in the range of $600-$650 million for 2019. SG&A expenses are forecast in the band of $280-$310 million in the current year.Non-cash costs (primarily attributable to share-based compensation) are predicted in the band of $135-$145 million for 2019.The company held stock investments worth $113.8 million in Immunomedics.Fresh estimates followed a downward path over the past two months. The consensus estimate has shifted -21.12% due to these changes.At this time, Seattle Genetics has a poor Growth Score of F, however its Momentum Score is doing a lot better with a C. However, the stock was allocated a grade of F on the value side, putting it in the lowest quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of F.

he stock market had a mixed session on Friday, and most major benchmarks finished close to unchanged. Investors continue to deal with conflicting influences on stocks, with reasonably favorable earnings reports that nevertheless point toward the possibility of slower growth ahead. Meanwhile, geopolitical and macroeconomic factors paint a gloomier picture of the near future. Some stocks reflected that negative sentiment, and  (NASDAQ: GT) ,  (NASDAQ: HSIC) , and  (NASDAQ: SGEN) were among the worst performers. Here's why they did so poorly.Shares of Goodyear Tire & Rubber fell 9% after the tire maker announced discouraging results in its  . Goodyear said that revenue was down 5% compared to the previous year's fourth quarter, with a combination of lower tire sales volumes and weak foreign currencies contributing to the top-line decline. CEO Richard Kramer tried to emphasize Goodyear's operational wins during 2018, including getting its products involved in electric vehicle manufacturing. Yet many of the same challenges remain for Goodyear in 2019, and it could take a while for the tire maker to mount a complete recovery.Image source: Goodyear. fetched about 25% less than it did on Thursday, but after accounting for a spinoff transaction, the shares were really down much less, closer to 5%. The company completed the separation of its global animal health business into a distinct corporate entity, with the immediate merger of that business into what will henceforth be known as  (NASDAQ: CVET) . As part of the spinoff, the continuing company will receive about $1.1 billion in cash that it expects to use to pay down debt. Going forward, the move will allow Schein to focus on the dental and medical market for its healthcare solutions, and the company sees great growth opportunities in those markets. Schein investors will get 0.4 shares of Covetrus for every Schein share they own, and that makes up in part for the hit to the share price of Henry Schein stock today.Finally,  . The biotech company reported fourth-quarter financial results that included a 35% rise in revenue, due largely to strong sales for the company's lymphoma drug Adcetris. However, investors don't seem to be quite as comfortable with the ambitious plans that Seattle Genetics has for Adcetris, with guidance for $610 million to $640 million in sales for the drug during 2019. That represents a gain of roughly 30% from 2018 levels, and it'll take considerable effort for the company to convince medical professionals that Adcetris is a better choice than some of the alternatives that have been on the market for a longer period.

And the company expects 2019 Adcetris sales in the U.S. and Canada to increase 28% to 34% over last year.

Of course even with today's decline, shares are still up more than 14% year to date, so today's move could simply be investors taking profits.Data source: Seattle Genetics.Image source: Getty Images.Clay Siegall, Seattle Genetics' chairman, president, and CEO, talked about the quick approval for Adcetris to treat patients with PTCL: ""The PTCL approval came 11 days after submission under the FDA's real-time oncology review pilot program. This is a testament to the strength of data, close collaboration with FDA, and our commitment to bringing Adcetris to patients in need.""While Seattle Genetics has made inroads into front-line treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma, Siegall  to convince doctors who have been using the old standard of care, a chemotherapy cocktail called ABVD, to use Adcetris, given the positive data from the Echelon 1 (E1) study:Management is looking for 2019 revenue of $790 million to $840 million, with Adcetris sales contributing $610 million to $640 million, an increase of 28% to 34% over last year. Royalty revenue is expected to fall in the range of $85 million to $90 million with the remaining revenue coming from research collaborations.Takeda is still waiting on a European approval in front-line Hodgkin lymphoma, and plans to submit the data to get it approved for PTCL to European regulators later this year, which should drive royalty revenue higher in 2020 and beyond.On the pipeline front, Seattle Genetics could have two drugs ready for submission to the FDA this year. The company and its partner  plan to report data from a clinical trial of enfortumab vedotin in metastatic urothelial cancer this quarter. And Seattle Genetics also expects data later this year from another late-stage compound, tucatinib, in a study called Her2climb that's testing the drug in patients with metastatic breast cancer.In addition to its internal pipeline, Seattle Genetics has also out-licensed its antibody-drug conjugate technology to other companies, including Genentech (a part of  ), which has submitted its blood cancer drug polatuzumab vedotin to U.S. and EU regulators.

"nvestors in Seattle Genetics Inc (Symbol: SGEN) saw new options become available today, for the April 18th expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the SGEN options chain for the new April 18th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $65.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.15. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $65.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $62.85 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of SGEN, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $66.12/share today.Because the $65.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 58%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of SGEN stock at the current price level of $66.12/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $70.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 8.29% if the stock gets called away at the April 18th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if SGEN shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Seattle Genetics Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing SGEN's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $70.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $70.00 strike represents an approximate 6% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

Eylea is approved in the United States, EU, Japan and other countries for the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD), diabetic macular edema (DME), and macular edema following retinal vein occlusion, which includes macular edema following central retinal vein occlusion and macular edema following branch retinal vein occlusion.We note that Regeneron has a global development and commercialization agreement with Bayer AG, outside the United States, for Eylea. Product revenues from ex-U.S. Eylea sales are recorded by Bayer.Meanwhile, Regeneron is working on expanding Eylea's label into additional indications, which should further boost sales.

The FDA also accepted for review the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) of Eylea for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy, with a target action date of May 13, 2019.Apart from Eylea's performance and label-expansion efforts, investors will be focussing on the uptake of Dupixent.Strong Dupixent sales drove Regeneron's impressive sales in the first nine months of 2018 and we expect the momentum to continue in the fourth quarter as well. The uptake of the drug has been strong after it obtained approval last year for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD). The company and partner Sanofi (SNY) are also working to expand Dupixent's label, which should diversify the company's revenue base and reduce dependence on the lead drug. The FDA has accepted for priority review the sBLA for AD in adolescent patients and set a target action date of Mar 11, 2019.Kevzara, an anti-interleukin (IL)-6 receptor monoclonal antibody used for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis, was approved by the FDA in May 2017. The uptake of the drug has been encouraging so far.The company has a collaboration agreement with Sanofi for both the drugs. The company updated its projection for collaboration revenues along with the announcement of third-quarter results. Collaboration revenues from Sanofi are now projected around $430-$455 million compared with the previous guidance of $455-$485 million. Both the companies have restructured their existing global Immuno-oncology Discovery and Development Agreement for new immuno-oncology cancer treatments. The original agreement, which was signed in 2015, is scheduled to end around mid-2020.Hence, the companies have revised the agreement and selected two clinical-stage bispecific antibody programs for further development. Per the revised agreement, Regeneron will retain all rights to its other immuno-oncology discovery and development programs. Sanofi can advance its early-stage immuno-oncology pipeline independently.Meanwhile, Regeneron is working to expand its portfolio/pipeline. In September 2018, the FDA approved Libtayo for the treatment of patients with metastatic or locally advanced CSCC who are not candidates for curative surgery or curative radiation. The drug is also under review in Europe and a decision is expected in the first half of 2019. Libtayo is also being evaluated for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer in a phase III study, which is currently enrolling.The company is also working to expand its PCSK9 inhibitor, Praluent's label. The FDA approved Praluent for the treatment of patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) undergoing apheresis. The agency also accepted an sBLA for Praluent as a potential treatment to reduce major adverse cardiovascular events and had set a target action date of Apr 28, 2019.Hence, focus will be on the company's performance, particularly on Eylea and Dupixient's uptake during the  . Investors are also expected to await updates on the company's pipeline.Regeneron's stock has gained 10.3% in the past six months, against the  's decline of 12.5%.Here are a couple of health care stocks you may want to consider as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Seattle Genetics  has an Earnings ESP of +12.82% and a Zacks Rank #2.

" incurred an adjusted loss of 57 cents per share for the fourth quarter of 2018, significantly wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 39 cents and also the year-ago quarter's loss of 43 cents.Adjusted loss included a market-to-market net investment loss related to Seattle Genetics' common stock holdings in Immunomedics, Inc.  and a non-cash income tax benefit pertaining to the acquisition of Cascadian Therapeutics.Revenues came in at $174.5 million in the reported quarter, up 34.6% year over year, primarily driven by strong sales and a recent label expansion of Adcetris (brentuximab vedotin) in frontline stage III/IV Hodgkin lymphoma and in frontline CD30-expressing peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL). The top line also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $166 million.Shares of Seattle Genetics have surged 46% in the past year against the  decline of 14.1%.Seattle Genetics' top line comprises product revenues, collaboration and license agreement revenues plus royalties.The company's only marketed product, Adcetris, generated net sales of $132.1 million in the United States and Canada, up 58% year over year. The improved sales of the drug were owing to its recent label expansions in frontline CD30-expressing PTCL and the frontline Hodgkin's lymphoma resulting in higher patient population.Collaboration and license agreement revenues plunged 31.2% year over year to $17.8 million. This included the amounts earned under the ADC collaboration in the ex-U.S. markets.Royalty revenues rose 23% year over year to $24.6 million on the back of high demand and sales of Adcetris outside Canada and the United States by Takeda.Research and development (R&D) expenses were $149.8 million, up 35.6% year over year, primarily attributable to higher investment across the late-stage pipeline comprising the enfortumab vedotin (EV), tucatinib and tisotumab vedotin (TV) program.Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses soared 63.9% year over year to $79.5 million, mainly on costs pertaining to the acquisition of Cascadian Therapeutics and the rapid approval and launch of Adcetris in frontline PTCL.Seattle Genetics expects full-year total revenues in the range of $790-$840 million. The guidance disappointed as the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $861.8 million.The label expansion of Adcetris for treating frontline stage III/IV Hodgkin lymphoma and frontline CD30-expressing PTCL looks encouraging. The company now projects full-year net sales of Adcetris in the range of $610-$640 million.Seattle Genetics expects collaboration and license revenues in the range of $95-$110 million, backed by milestones received from Takeda. Royalty revenues are anticipated in the band of $85-$90 million.R&D expenses are estimated in the range of $600-$650 million for 2019. SG&A expenses are forecast in the band of $280-$310 million in the current year.Non-cash costs (primarily attributable to share-based compensation) are predicted in the band of $135-$145 million for 2019.The company held stock investments worth $113.8 million in Immunomedics.In March 2018, the FDA approved Adcetris in combination with chemotherapy for treating stage III or IV classical Hodgkin's lymphoma (cHL) in patients with no previous treatment history, based on data from the phase III ECHELON-1 study.Last November, the FDA approved Adcetris for the frontline treatment of PTCL. The drug is approved to treat patients with previously untreated systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma or other CD30-expressing peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL) including angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma and PTCL not otherwise specified in combination with CHP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone).This is the sixth FDA approved indication for Adcetris and the first FDA approved regimen for frontline PTCL.The company with its partner Astellas initiated the phase III EV-301 program for patients with advanced urothelial cancer, who previously received both a checkpoint inhibitor (PD-1/PD-L1) and a platinum-based chemotherapy. The company continues to evaluate EV combined with Merck's  Keytruda in first-line setting.Both companies also completed the cohort enrollment in EV-201 study for the same indication. The companies expect to report top-line data from this cohort during the first quarter of 2019.Last November, Seattle Genetics initiated dosing of its pipeline candidate SEA-BCMA in the phase I study. The early-stage candidate is currently being evaluated for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (MM). | Seattle Genetics currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Another top-ranked stock in the biotech sector is Celgene Corp.  , which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

"Image source: The Motley Fool. (NASDAQ: SGEN)Q4 2018 Feb. 7, 2019 Good day, and welcome to the Seattle Genetics fourth-quarter and year 2018 financial results. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Peggy Pinkston, vice president, Investor Relations.Please go ahead, ma'am.Please make sure you've selected a ticker. -- Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to welcome all of you to Seattle Genetics' fourth-quarter and year 2018 conference call. With me today are Clay Siegall, president and chief executive officer; Todd Simpson, chief financial officer; Roger Dansey, chief medical officer; and Darren Cline, executive vice president, Commercial. Accompanying today's conference call are supporting slides, which are available on our website in the Investor section, the Events and Presentations page.Following our prepared remarks today, we'll open the line for question. Today's conference call will include forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial and operating performance of the company such as those, among others, relating to the company's 2019 financial outlook, including anticipated 2019 ADCETRIS sales and future revenues; cost and expenses; the company's potential and anticipated timing to achieve future clinical and regulatory milestones and published data for ADCETRIS, enfortumab vedotin, tucatinib and tisotumab vedotin. Actual results or developments may differ materially from those projected or implied in these forward-looking statements. Among the factors that may cause such a difference, includes the difficulty in forecasting sales, revenues and expenses and the uncertainty associated with the pharmaceutical development and regulatory approval process.More information about the risks and uncertainties faced by Seattle Genetics is contained under the caption Risk Factors, included in the company's periodic report filed with the securities and exchange commission, including the company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2018, and future periodic reports filed by the company, including the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. Now I'll turn the call over to Clay. -- Thanks, Peg, and good afternoon, everyone. 2018 was a remarkable year, highlighted by significant ADCETRIS achievements and substantial progress with our late-stage clinical portfolio, bringing us closer to becoming a multiproduct oncology company. In 2018, ADCETRIS was launched in two front-line indications and is becoming the foundational therapy in CD30-expressing lymphomas. We expect to continue our momentum in 2019, including maintaining focus on ADCETRIS commercial growth.Beyond ADCETRIS are three late-stage programs in solid tumors that are approaching near-term milestones. Importantly, in 2019, we'll report data from pivotal trials with enfortumab vedotin and tucatinib. In March, ADCETRIS in combination with chemotherapy was approved for stage three and four Hodgkin lymphoma, based on the ECHELON-1 trial. And in mid-November, ADCETRIS in combination with chemotherapy was granted Breakthrough Therapy designation and then approve in front-line CD30-expressing peripheral T-cell lymphoma, based on the positive results from the ECHELON-2 trial.The PTCL approval came 11 days after submission under the FDA's real-time oncology review pilot program. This is a testament to the strength of data, close collaboration with FDA and our commitment to bringing ADCETRIS to patients in need. In 2018, we achieved record net sales of $477 million in the U.S. and Canada.U.S. approval in front-line Hodgkin lymphoma was a primary contributor to the 55% increase in net sales in 2018 over 2017. For 2019, we estimate that ADCETRIS net sales in the U.S. and Canada will be in the range of $610 million to $640 million, an increase of 28% to 34% over last year.Our guidance reflects the expanded patient populations provided by the new front-line labels in indications with decades-old standards of care. Globally, ADCETRIS could exceed $1 billion in sales in 2019. Our partner, Takeda, continues to make great progress in its territories. In Japan, ADCETRIS was approved for front-line Hodgkin lymphoma in September.In Europe, approval is pending in front-line Hodgkin lymphoma based on the E1 trial, and Takeda plans to submit E2 data to the EMA and other health authorities later this year. Turning to our three late-stage solid-tumor programs, we are preparing for several upcoming milestones. With enfortumab vedotin, or EV, we and our partner, Astellas, expect to report top-line data from a pivotal trial in metastatic urothelial cancer this quarter. These data could support a regulatory submission in 2019 under the FDA's accelerated approval regulations for the EV on the path to becoming our next marketed drug.Our second late-stage program is tucatinib, which is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets HER2. The pivotal trial called HER2CLIMB, we've completed the enrollment of 480 patients to enable analysis of PFS, the primary endpoint of the trial. We expect to report topline data this year. If HER2CLIMB is successful, our intention is to build tucatinib into a broad development program into earlier lines of breast cancer and other HER2-expressing tumor types, which Roger will further outline.Our third pivotal stage program is tisotumab vedotin, or TB, which we're developing in partnership with Genmab. Our initial focus with TB is metastatic cervical cancer, where we're conducting an ongoing pivotal trial designed to support a regulatory submission under the FDA's accelerated approval pathway. We expect to complete enrollment by mid-2019. In parallel, we're evaluating TV in earlier lines of cervical cancer and other solid tumors that express tissue factor.In addition to these late-stage programs, we're developing multiple targeted therapies, including ladiratuzumab vedotin and ADC for triple-negative breast cancer that's in phase oneI development, and SEA-BCMA, an empowered antibody in phase one development for multiple myeloma. We also expect to submit INDs during 2019 for additional novel agents to treat cancer. Investing in our pipeline is a key part of our strategy for future growth. Our ADC collaborators are also making progress with programs using our technologies.Of note, Genentech/Roche announced that they have submitted polatuzumab vedotin in relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma for approval in both the U.S. and EU. We believe that our accomplishments in 2018 and progress expected in 2019 position us better than ever to bring new medicines to people with cancer. At this point, I'll turn the call over to Darren to review our commercial activities.After that, Todd will discuss our 2018 financial results, as well as our 2019 guidance. And then Roger will provide additional comments on our clinical pipelines. Darren? -- Thanks, Clay. Since the commercial launch in 2011, our vision has been to build ADCETRIS into a blockbuster brand in the U.S. and Canada. The front-line approvals in 2018 bring the number of approved indications in the U.S.to six and further position us to achieve that vision. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we saw continued sales growth. ADCETRIS net sales were $132 million in the quarter and were $477 million for the full year in 2018, a 55% increase over 2017. The front-line approvals significantly expanded the addressable patient opportunity for ADCETRIS.We're confident that an ADCETRIS-based front-line regimen could become the preferred treatment of choice. This is based on the strength of our clinical data from our front-line trials and the experienced commercial team that we have in place. That said, we're up against long-standing broadly used chemotherapy standards of care in both settings with ingrained physician habits. Therefore, achieving our vision will take time and solid execution.I'd like to share with -- some additional context around the front-line opportunities. Let me start with an update on front-line Hodgkin's lymphoma. As you know, this was approved in March 2018 for stage three and four patients. During the fourth quarter, we continued to build physician awareness in both community and academic centers.It will take time and effort to establish A+AVD to its full potential in the setting. We view the marketplace as having three main segments: first, physicians who are familiar with ADCETRIS and regularly treat patients with Hodgkin lymphoma; second, physicians who appreciate the product profile of ADCETRIS but see only a few Hodgkin lymphoma patients per year; and third, physicians who do not recognize the benefit that ADCETRIS may have for their patients and continue to use ABVD. Our commercial plan is intended to reach of these physician profiles, and our market research shows that we're making progress. We continue to see increased utilization in newly diagnosed stage three and four patients.This is reflected in market share improvement over the last two quarters and an increase in the number of new ordering accounts. Importantly, we've seen growth in community practices where the majority of front-line Hodgkin lymphoma patients are diagnosed and treated. Physician recall of our key messages continues to be strong. We're also focused on ensuring that physicians have access to the evolving ADCETRIS data.For example, the North American data from the E1 trial were recently published. These data provide additional evidence that A+AVD along with prophylactic growth factor support can result in superior, efficacy, while avoiding the toxicities associated with bleomycin. These data are an important part of our efforts to align the treatment guidelines and pathways with our label. Next, I'll comment on our most recent approval in front-line PTCL.As you know, we received disapproval rapidly following the submission, and the commercial team was ready. While still early into the launch, we are hearing positive reactions to the E2 data from the physician community, including the significant improvement in overall survival. The efficacy advantage of using the ADCETRIS regimen, shown in the E2 trial, resulted in conclusion of A+CHP into the NCCN guidelines in December that is consistent with the label. Our goal with the E2 trial is to improve upon the decades-old CHOP chemotherapy regimen that leaves a significant unmet need for patients in front-line PTCL.The successful E2 trial supports our belief that A+CHP can become the new standard of care for CD30-expressing PTCL patients in the U.S. In conclusion, we believe that ADCETRIS will have a meaningful impact on the lives of patients with CD30-expressing lymphomas. This is an exciting time in the life cycle of the brand. We believe that ADCETRIS can become the product of choice in these front-line indications.We will also continue our efforts in the four other labeled indications. Our ultimate goal is to ensure the best possible treatment outcomes for both patients and physicians. I look forward to updating you on our progress. I'll now turn the call over to Todd to discuss our financial results. -- Great. Thanks, Darren, and thanks to everyone for joining us on the call this afternoon. In addition to achieving important milestones with ADCETRIS and making substantial progress with our late-stage pipeline, we also had a strong year financially with record ADCETRIS sales. Today, I'll summarize our 2018 financial results for the fourth quarter and full year and then provide our financial outlook for 2019.Total revenues in the fourth quarter of 2018 were $175 million. This included ADCETRIS net sales in the U.S. and Canada of $132 million. For the year in 2018, total revenues were $655 million, including ADCETRIS net sales of $477 million.The 55% increase in 2018 primarily reflects the label expansion in front-line Hodgkin lymphoma. Royalty revenues in the fourth quarter increased to $25 million compared to $20 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. For the year in 2018, royalty revenues increased to $83 million compared to $66 million for 2017. These increases reflect higher sales like Takeda in its territory.Collaboration revenues were $18 million in the fourth quarter and $94 million for the full year in 2018. These revenues are primarily driven by amounts earned under our ADCETRIS collaboration with Takeda and our ADC deals. The decreases in 2018 collaboration revenues reflect reduced product supply sales to Takeda as they transition to their own primary supply chain. Collaboration revenues also reflect milestone payments earned from our partners who continue to make progress with ADCs that utilize our technology.These included Genentech/Roche, GSK and AbbVie, who each have programs in late-stage development. In addition to milestones under these deals, we are entitled to receive royalties on future product sales in the mid-single-digit range. R&D expenses were $150 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 and $565 million for the year in 2018. The increases over 2017 primarily reflect higher investment across our pipeline, notably, our late-stage programs EV, tucatinib and TV.2018 expenses also include technology licensing activities in the first quarter of the year. SG&A expenses were $79 million in the fourth quarter and $261 million for the year in 2018. The increase in SG&A in the fourth quarter reflects the rapid approval and launch of ADCETRIS in front-line PTCL. For the full year in 2018, expenses included costs associated with the acquisition of Cascadian and the commercial launch of ADCETRIS in front-line Hodgkin lymphoma.We ended 2018 with $460 million in cash and investments. This is in addition to approximately $110 million in common stock holdings in Immunomedics at the end of the year. These shares are mark-to-market, which causes variability in our financial results and is not core to our operations. Of note, this contributed to an investment net loss for the quarter of $53 million and a gain for the year of $14 million.Regarding our financial guidance for 2019, we anticipate total revenues to increase to a range of $790 million to $840 million. There are three main components to our revenues: first, we expect ADCETRIS net sales in the U.S. and Canada to be in the range of $610 million to $640 million. This reflects our expectations for growth within our current labels, including front-line Hodgkin lymphoma and front-line PTCL.Second, we expect royalty revenues to be in the range of $85 million to $90 million, based upon -- based primarily on anticipated sales of ADCETRIS by Takeda in its territory. As a reminder, royalty rates under the collaboration escalate from the mid-teens to the mid-20s based on sales and reset at the beginning of each year. Also note that Takeda has different approval in reimbursement time lines than what we see here in the U.S. And third, we expect revenues from collaboration and license agreements to be in the range of $95 million to $110 million.Turning now to expenses, we expect R&D expenses to be in the range of $600 million to $650 million. The increase from last year reflects planned investment in EV, tucatinib, TV, LV and our pipeline programs. SG&A expenses are expected to be in the range of $280 million to $310 million. This reflects commercial activities for ADCETRIS across the 6 labeled indications, as well as additional headcount to support our growth.This also includes preparatory work as we approach top-line data readouts for EV this quarter and tucatinib later this year. We expect cost of sales to be in the range of 5% to 6% of sales. Aside from the $18 million charge that we took in the fourth quarter in process inventory that did not meet our release specifications, the improvement in gross margin for ADCETRIS reflects some reduction in royalty obligations related to licensed technologies. As a reminder, cost of royalty revenues reflects the third-party royalty obligation that is owed on sales by Takeda in this territory.This will decrease to a low single-digit percentage on ADCETRIS -- on Takeda sale. As we've discussed today, we expect significant progress with our late-stage programs this year. As a result, we anticipate that we'll provide updates to our financial guidance in subsequent calls based on pivotal trial data and any resulting regulatory interactions. Now I'll turn the call over to Roger. -- Thanks, Todd, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll comment on recent upcoming development activities with the pipeline. First, there were more than 30 ADCETRIS-containing data presentations at the American Society of Hematology's Annual Meeting in December. Notably, the ECHELON-2 trial was featured in an oral presentation and simultaneously published in The Lancet.The data demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in both progression-free and overall survival of A+CHP compared to CHOP and PTCL patients. All other key endpoints also achieved the statistical significance. This was an unprecedented and practiced change in result. Also presented were important data with 18 more months of follow-up on ECHELON-1 in front-line Hodgkin lymphoma.Showing that the PFS benefit for ADCETRIS plus CHP was maintained at three years. An updated analysis was also presented, which showed for the resolution. These data are key to understanding the long-term benefits of ADCETRIS, and we will continue to report on the E1 trial at appropriate time points in the future. Beyond the two successful front-line trials of E1 and E2, where ADCETRIS was combined with standard chemotherapy, we are evaluating further development opportunities for ADCETRIS in combination with either fewer chemotherapy agents and/or the PD-1 inhibitor such as nivolumab.Support for using less chemotherapy comes from investigator trial results presented at ASH by Dr. Abramson, where a three-drug combination of ADCETRIS with adriamycin and dacarbazine produced a 100% response rate in 34 early stage Hodgkin lymphoma patients with no progressions or deaths after a median follow-up of 15 months. This regimen produced intriguing activity without the use of bleomycin and vinblastine, thus avoiding pulmonary toxicity and reducing neutropenia and peripheral neuropathy rates. For ADCETRIS and a PD-1 inhibitor, we now collaborate with Bristol-Myers Squibb showed that the combination of ADCETRIS and nivolumab produced a 93% overall response rate and an 80% complete response rate in second-line relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma patients, and a 70% objective response rate in relapsed primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma patients.I'll now move on to enfortumab vedotin. Our current focus with EV is in metastatic urothelial cancer. Several PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors have been approved in the second-line phasing, yet many patients do not directly respond to treatment of checkpoint inhibitors and need new treatment options. Data from the phase one study EV-101 supported the FDA Breakthrough Therapy designation, and results from this trial will be updated next week at the ASCO GU meeting in San Francisco.The pivotal trial, EV-201, is currently being conducted in locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer patients, who previously received platinum therapy and a PD-1 or a PDL-1 inhibitor. As Clay mentioned earlier, we are on track to report the top-line data this quarter, which could result in a regulatory submission in the U.S. during 2019. Beyond previously treated metastatic urothelial cancer, we believe EV has the potential to provide benefit to patients with this cancer in a number of different clinical settings and in combination with other therapies.To this end, we are conducting the EV-103 trial in combination with pembrolizumab, which is standard of care in second-line treatment, and in combination with a platinum agent, which are the current first-line standard of care. Data generated from these combinations, along with the results from front-line trials incorporating PD-1, PD-L1 agents, will inform our first-line registration strategy. We also believe EV has potential in other solid tumor types, given the expression profile of Nectin-4 and are considering future developments. Next in our late-stage pipeline is tucatininb.Tucatinib has the potential to be a best-in-class RO HER2 TKI. It has high selectivity and affinity for HER2 without meaningful inhibition of EGFR, which reduces the rate of toxicities, such as rash and diarrhea, that make less-selective HER2 TKI treatment difficult for patients to tolerate. In this program, our highest priority is the pivotal trial called HER2CLIMB, which is evaluating tucatinib or placebo in combination with capecitabine and trastuzumab in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who previously received other HER2-targeted therapies. Enrollment in this trial continues to be brisk, and we plan to report data later this year on the primary endpoint of PFS in 480 patients.In addition, we are continuing to enroll HER2CLIMB up to a total of 600 patients to support analysis of the secondary endpoints of overall survival as well as PFS in patients with brain metastases. We anticipate completing accrual by mid-2019. Assuming positive data from HER2CLIMB, we see multiple opportunities to develop tucatinib further in earlier lines of breast cancer and other tumor, such as HER2 gastric cancer. Initial efforts are already under way with tucatinib now included in the I-SPY trial for HER2-positive patients.This is in combination with standard treatments in the near adjutant breast cancer setting. For HER2-positive colorectal cancer, there's an ongoing investigator-led trial evaluating tucatinib together with trastuzumab in third-line patients with data likely in 2019. In closing, 2018 was a year of substantial clinical and regulatory progress with two ADCETRIS front-line approvals. We see additional opportunities to put ADCETRIS in lymphoma, and we are preparing for another busy year in 2019 with twopivotal trial readouts that may lead to important regulatory submissions when new drug approvals in solid tumors.It is a potentially transformative time for Seattle Genetics. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Clay. -- Thanks, Roger. In the year ahead, we expect to grow the ADCETRIS brand globally and to make significant progress toward becoming a multiproduct oncology company. Key activities expected in 2019 for ADCETRIS and our pivotal state programs include, first, continue to establish ADCETRIS as the standard of care in front-line Hodgkin lymphoma and front-line PTCL; second, reporting top-line data from EV pivotal trial in urothelial cancer in the first quarter potentially enabling a BLA submission later this year; third, reporting top-line data from the tucatinib pivotal trial, HER2CLIMB; and lastly, completing enrollment in the pivotal trial innovaTV in cervical cancer by midyear. At this point, we'll open the line for Q&A.Operator, please open the call for questions.[Operator instructions] We will take our first question from Kennen McKay of RBC Capital Markets. -- Maybe hoping for a little bit more color around the guidance, given the sort of $5 million quarter-over-quarter increase, wondering sort of, if we run-rate Q4, we get to around $528 million. And so to where we're going to get the additional $82 million to $112 million in sales to meet the guidance that you issued? Is that coming from sort of the E2 population? Or where we -- we should be thinking about that coming from versus, again, the incremental quarter-over-quarter sales we saw in Q4? -- Yes. Thanks, Kennen. So the incremental or the guidance, I should say, of $610 million to $640 million, includes the E2 launch, and it includes continuing to increase penetration into the E1 population. Keep in mind that with the E2 regimen, it uses less cycles of drugs then the E1 regimen, and so it's going really great.And ADCETRIS is a -- is an awesome drug. But this will take time and persistence to continue to build this market, and that's what we're doing in 2019. We're up for the challenge, and we're making great progress. -- Maybe a quick follow-up. There have been some changes, at least in guidelines in terms of how in the relapse/refractory setting, checkpoints previously had been recommended versus sort of the current recommendations previously being behind brentuximab vedotin and now sort of being three or more prior therapies. Is there any color you can give us in terms of how that is sort of affecting the dynamic in the relapse/refractory setting? -- Sure. I'll turn it over to Roger to address that. -- Sure. So as you point out, PD-1 inhibitors certainly have a role in Hodgkin lymphoma. I think our view of ADCETRIS, as Clay indicates, it's a great drug. It has approvals all the way from front line to relapsed/refractory Hodgkin lymphoma and literally has a role to play almost at every stage of the disease.And so yes, it's good that there other therapies available. We remain confident that ADCETRIS will be used broadly in Hodgkin lymphoma from front to all the way to the end. -- Gotcha. And maybe just one follow-up then on the pipeline. I noticed at after GU, we're going to get mature data from the phase one cohort of enfortumab vedotin in bladder cancer. Wondering if there's any kind of color around what kind of maturity that can imply if that's referring to duration response or survival data and very much looking forward to that. -- It's from the phase one study. So it's really the responses, the duration, the safety and all things like that. It's premature to talk about survival at this point.Our next question will come from Geoff Meacham of Barclays. -- Just on ADCETRIS commercially, I'm curious if there's any metrics you can give on utilization in the E1 population among community docs? I guess, I'm trying to figure out what percent haven't adopted it, and of the ones that have, maybe what the new start trends are? And then any ability you can give us on the PTCL adoption will be helpful? I know it's early on that. -- Right. More and more community docs are taking this on, so we see that. We're not providing the specific numbers for you on that, but we continue to see more community docs using the E1 regimen, and that's really good. We're increasing our market share with increased new accounts.We're increasing the market penetration, increasing the connection we have with docs using ADCETRIS. And it's going in the right direction. It's just we're facing a regimen that was out there for 41 years before we got approved. And there's docs that take it on right away, and then there's other docs that need to be convinced, and we're doing that.And there's still some docs that just say ""hey, no, I've been using ABVD for decades. This is what I want to do."" But we are not giving up, and we're working with them. And we're showing them the benefits of using the E1 regimen, and the data is with us. It's better data.It's better for the patients. And so we think that if we continue up and continue our efforts, we'll get everybody. It's just going to take a little bit of time. You asked also about PTCL.PTCL is just a little different than Hodgkin lymphoma. In PTCL, we are going after patients that have good results, not great results with chemotherapy. ABVD gave pretty great results. It was a chemotherapy success story.With PTCL, CHOP chemotherapy gave pretty good responses, I mean, way more than half the patients. I don't know what it was but more than half the patients had very nice responses immediately to CHOP therapy. Now some of them relapsed, but the data -- so the data is good, not great, which is what ABVD was thought of initially that we had to go against. So there's more upside there as far as treating the patients and more patients declining faster with PTCL, and we hear great stuff from docs.We hear the docs want to use this. They're using it, using it more and more. But keep in mind, it's an incident population. So when we get approval toward the end of the year, first that have to happen is docs have to identify patients with T-cell lymphomas and then start to put them on to the protocol, and then when we charge per each time we send that vial, so we don't charge for the whole regimen all at once.So you can only get so much at a time. And we're building this, and just to place it so that you totally understand it. An average patient with -- on the E1 regimen, it's about $125,000. Please keep in mind, it could be higher or lower, based on how much they weigh.The average regimen with the E2 -- or the average cost, excuse me, for the E2 regimen, is more like about $90,000 to $100,000. So it's just they get less drug because it's less number of cycles there. So there is a difference there that if we had even the equal number of patients, we're going to have less dollars from the E2 regimen, but that's something we always knew, and I've discussed for a long time. -- OK. And just a follow-up to the earlier question on 201. The language seems pretty good on filing an ultimate approval ahead of top-line data. I'm just curious if you guys can take a stab at what you view as clinically meaningful in urothelial, either PFS or OS or duration of therapy? -- In our pivotal trial for EV you're talking about, the primary endpoint is ORR. And I'll make one comment and see if Roger wants to add any color to that. The last approvals in urothelial cancer were for different checkpoints, and the approvals were based on response rates between 14% and 21%. So when we came in with our data from our lead-in trial at 40%, 41% or so objective response, we have a lot of room from their phase one trial.Now we don't have the data yet. We haven'  ed the data on our pivotal trial, but we feel very strongly about our data. We got Breakthrough Therapy designation. And you'll hear this quarter what the data is.So we feel really good about that. Roger? -- Sure. Just to add one comment. And the initial signal in the phase one trial is based over 100 patients. So it's a robust number of patients the results, as Clay said, in the context of bladder cancer, the response rates for that outcome was excellent.And so the drug really -- if we recapitulate even close to what we saw in phase one, I think we would be confident we could make an argument to regulators that this is something that should be seriously considered for use. -- But just to be clear, though, the PFS and OS weren't considered in the FDA discussions. It's still about ORR? -- That's right. This is an accelerated approval approach, and the two key outcomes are overall response and duration of response.Our next question will be coming from Mr. Michael Schmidt of the Guggenheim Security. -- Thanks for taking my questions. I had a few on tucatinib. And we've seen a couple of positive trials here recently in the metastatic HER2+ breast cancer space. And I was just wondering if you could share with us maybe the baseline assumptions that were used for PFS and OS to power the HER2CLIMB study? And then the follow-up would be whether you're planning to file already this on the initial PFS data at the... -- OK, Michael, you kind of phased out there at the end. And I think we got the question before you phased out. You were asking about PFS and OS and HER2CLIMB. And would we be able to submit based on the 480 patients? I think it was something like that. -- That is correct, yes. -- So. OK. Thank you. You're back.I can hear you now. So absolutely, we -- our primary endpoint is at 480, and it's PFS. So we are fully enrolled in that 480. Data comes this year, and we're really excited and looking forward to that.We think that tucatinib is a really exciting drug because of the activity we've seen in the lead-in trial and other trials that had used tucatinib historically. We also are excited with the safety profile, and it's very different. It's a totally differentiated, potentially best-in-class tyrosine kind of because of that very clear interaction with HER2 but not with EGFR. And so it's certainly a one of a kind there that we hope to take this and prove, with the data from HER2CLIMB, that it's best in class.And that's going to come out -- the first dataset is really the 480 patients with the primary endpoint of PFS. -- Anything specific you can share maybe on the specific assumption for PFS for powering the HER2CLIMB study in the treatment and control arm? -- We don't normally talk about the specifics of how we power the study and what our underlying assumptions are. In this case, there's a lot of other data that was available on treating HER2-positive patients. But there's never perfect datasets to make all the assumptions by. That's why they call them assumptions and not facts.And so I think we've used all of the available data to help us look at what is best, how to power it. It's something that would be meaningful to doctors and patients, and I think that's really how you do it. It's not just to have the most minor, minor, minor differences in a drug. it's really to make something that docs are going to want to use and patients are going to want to take.And we think that the trial was designed for that. Roger, do you want to add anything to the trial design? Or... -- No, I agree. And just to add to Clay's commentary, this is a -- it's a well-thought-out design. The control arm is commonly used, and it's simple add-on design, where we're adding a TKI on top of a HER2 antibody plus chemotherapy. So we should be able to -- if tucatinib has the treatment effect that we believe it does, this trial should be able to really demonstrate that.Not only in a general population but also in a population of patients with brain metastases, which is an area of high unmet need.[Operator instructions] Our next question comes from Salveen Richter of Goldman Sachs. -- With regard to the first-line HL setting, there appeared to be pent-up demand for ADCETRIS, just curious whether we should expect that same trend for PTCL in the front line, just given the existing regimen? -- For front-line Hodgkin lymphoma, there wasn't really a pent-up demand. Remember, this is an incident population. What there was, was we had a few people that transferred over from the existing ABVD protocol, and they were on that regimen, and then they didn't finish it and transferred over. If that's what you meant by pent-up demand, we've talked about that.But it is an incident population. With PTCL, there's going to be less of that, and that's because the CHOP regimen for PTCL is not as toxic as the bleomycin-containing ABVD regimen, where some docs just want us to get away from it. I think there might have been a very little bit of that but really nothing to mention. -- And then with regard to tucatinib, I know the core study is 480 patients and you're adding another 120 for the secondary endpoints and OS. Do you need data from those 120 to file the NDA? -- We decided that we wanted to have more data since we had the time between when we finished the 480 and the data was going to come out and the enrollment being so brisk. That -- so we went to FDA, and we said, look, we'd to enroll to 600 so we can have a bigger dataset to look at two things -- not the primary endpoint, to look at two secondary endpoints: one being OS, which we always want more patients to look at OS; and the other one was really the brain mets. And the reason why we wanted to look at more with brain mets is because brain mets are only in half off of the patients. So it gets us additional patients to look at a little bit of a bigger pool.So no with the primary endpoints. It's really going based on that 480. -- And just maybe one last question. With regard to your comments earlier about PD-1 use in HL. Do you expect an impact here from Merck's KEYNOTE-204 study. I'm just curious how you think about that read in the context of the drug having HL on its label. -- OK. The KEYNOTE-204 study, initially, it was our understanding, they said it would readout in the fourth quarter, and we're now in February. It hasn't read out. So we don't know the data, first and foremost, so I can't really comment on the specifics of their data.Clearly, I want the best for patients, and I want different options for patients with Hodgkin lymphoma and other lymphomas. So I hope it can help patients. What I would say is we have data with ADCETRIS and bendamustine showing more than a 90% ORR in the relapse setting, and we have a very high response rate of ADCETRIS plus PD-1 in nivolumab with a very high ORR. And both these have very high CR rates.And to us, this is the way you really treat the relapse patients the best. And I think that when we get into relapse setting, using single agent is probably not best for the patient. So I don't think that doctors are going to make necessarily strong decisions based on more single-agent data at this point when so much combination data and such strong data is available. I will add one other thing that the use of ADCETRIS in combination with different drugs, including bendamustine, is in guidelines right now and reimbursed.Our next question comes from Andrew Berens of SVB Leerink. -- Can you hear me? -- Yes. -- Yes. -- I just had a question. During the Q3 call, you guys mentioned a couple of things that impacted the numbers, one of which was the seasonality in the diagnosis rate of Hodgkin's. I was wondering, has that returned to what it was previously? Or is it still well within yet expected? -- When you look back over a 10-year period with Hodgkin lymphoma, it kind of -- it does go up and down, and these things happen in the demographics of the patients, and I'm talking about the United States numbers. And over the last few years, it's slightly gone down each year, and we don't know exactly the rationale for why that is. I mean, it's obviously good for patients in the -- or people in the U.S. that there's less Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosed.It's not diagnosed on a -- it's not a huge decline, but it has declined a few years. Whether next year it starts raising back up, it is very hard to know, and you've just seen the ups and downs over the years. So that's one thing on the diagnostic rate. And on the seasonality, there are some quarters where you see more diagnosed and other quarters a little less.It depends on when patients want to go in to get therapy and how it relates to different holiday periods and things like that. So sure, there's seasonality of how many patients come in. We hear that from the docs. So I hope that goes and addresses your question. -- OK. And then I just -- I had a question on EV since it's coming imminently. We've heard from some of the competitors or eventual competitors that actually have compounds that the bar is probably much lower than what you guys have seen in the phase one. I was just wondering -- I know somebody already asked the question, but I'd like to just, I guess, get a sense of how much headroom do you think there is between what you saw in phase one and what the FDA bar might be for an accelerated approval on response rates? -- In our work with FDA and getting BTD, we didn't see any line in the sand from regulators. I think they're interested in two things: one is -- well, three things, I should say for this: one is clearly the safety of the drug. But we have a lot of information on that. And one is the response rate, the ORR that you get.And the last one, Roger mentioned briefly, was the duration. I think that's really important. If you have a very high response rate and a tiny duration, docs, the FDA, patients won't care as much if the drug you're using doesn't have a good duration. We've seen good duration with this drug in our lead-in trial.So we just want to see what our response rate is, what our duration we think that what we saw in the lead-in trial of approximately 40% ORR with a duration, I think that was between -- it was close to six months or something like that. I don't remember exactly. And some of the patients were on a long time. I mean, that is well in excess of what we think the bottom line is for the FDA in this setting of the relapsed patients.So we think we have a lot of headroom. I just don't know -- I don't want to give you a number of the bottom FDA number because I don't know what they haven't told us what it is. So I don't know that they established something like that. They want to see the whole package.I will also say with EV that we have other studies going on, most notably in combination with KEYTRUDA, and that's something we've been enrolling well, and we look forward to presenting data on that because we think that, that is a really interesting approach to getting up earlier in lines of therapy. -- OK. And then just one quick housekeeping question. You had a writedown, it was $18.1 million of ADCETRIS, I assume. And I was just wondering, is that a onetime event.Or is it something that could continue? Can you give us some more color on it? -- Yes, Todd? -- Yes, sure. So it's actually a very infrequent thing for us. This is, I think, the first time we've had this. It related to some in-process manufacturing of ADCETRIS.They were lots that didn't need our release specifications. So we basically took them out of inventory, wrote them off. This, I would add, was product that never got into the supply chain. It was in process.So it didn't impact our ability to make sure that drug got to patients, and again, it's, I think, the first time it's happened to us, but I didn't want to call it out today because it was about an $18 million charge that is included in COGS.Our next question comes from Cory Kasimov of JPMorgan. -- First of all, for the 4Q results, are you able to break out kind of relative sales contribution at least roughly from front-line PTCL or perhaps within PTCL? Anything you can say about the different subsegments of disease where the drug is currently or initially being used? -- I will say that we study that very closely as best as we can pick. It's hard to be precise. It's really hard to look at it, but that's not something that we intend to report. But we try to track as best we can, just to understand the dynamics of the marketplace and what the docs are saying. -- OK, good. PTCL was a contributor to the fourth quarter in terms of sales? -- Yes, let me jump in. The approval came mid-November, so it likely had a very modest contribution to Q4 but certainly is included in our 2019 guidance. -- OK. Yes, the reason I was asking, you had like -- that was like three or four selling days for E1, and you've done a good job talking about the differences between those markets. But that's what I was wondering for the one and a half months, even with the holidays and stuff like that -- and ASH, what that relative contribution might have been. -- Yes, Cory, it's Darren. You're exactly right. I think, we got the indication, we had 20-some selling days. And to Clay's point, we will look at it, but it's just too early in the launch at this point. -- OK. And then question maybe for Roger. I'm curious about next steps for potentially testing ADCETRIS in early stage Hodgkin lymphoma. What kind of endpoints could you potentially use in a study like that? -- Yes. It's a great question. Thank you. So we are still walking the square on what that could potentially look like.One of the obvious concerns with a very large early stage Hodgkin lymphoma trial powered for a traditional outcome could take a very long time. And so we are thinking through are there other ways potentially of generating data that will be meaningful for various audiences, but we are certainly compiled by the information that was presented at ASH. It looks like a pretty appealing proposition, but we have no plans to share with you. We're still thinking it through. -- OK. Last one for Todd, a modeling question on that cost of goods guidance. So 5% to 6% this year, when historically I believe, it's been north of 10%. Is that all a result of this royalty falling off? Or is there something else changing as well? -- No, that's -- if you take the write-off out of the equation, we've been running sort of in the 10%, 11% range. That comes down to 5% or 6%. And that's largely the result of some royalty obligation on in-license technology that's now sort of run it's term. So we're no longer paying those royalties.[Operator instructions] Our next question comes from Boris Peaker of Cowen and Company. -- Maybe first question on Hodgkin's lymphoma. You've talked about the commercial strategies for community docs and kind of the variability of community docs based on their prior history and the lack of approved agents over four decades. I'm just curious what fraction of patients of Hodgkin's lymphoma are treated by community docs versus academic docs? -- Darren? -- Boris, about 70% of front-line de novo Hodgkin lymphoma patients are both diagnosed and treated in the community versus the academic setting. -- Gotcha. My second question on PTCL. I'm just curious how long you anticipate the patient to be on treatment? Or how many cycle cover, best to describe it. -- In the trial, I think there was up to six to eight cycles in the trial that were used. -- Most did six. -- Most did six. -- Yes, most of the patients, they were allowed up to eight but most had six. -- And how do you expect that to translate to the real world? Would it be a little shorter? Or do you think will be consistent? -- It's hard to know exactly how to translate it. I would say it's never identical, but I think when you have potentially curative therapy, patients tend to stay on. -- Gotcha. My last question, I don't know if this is for Clay or Todd, but with all the discussion around drug pricing, I'm just curious how should we think about price increases going forward relative to the historicals? -- I'll start by saying we don't normally discuss our thoughts on exactly what our prices are and how we do it. We've been very reasonable, and what we've looked at and for the value that ADCETRIS brings, we think ADCETRIS is a very reasonably priced drug. Todd, do you want to add anything to that? -- No, I think that says it well. Obviously, the pricing environment is something that we and many others stare at constantly. So we do take that into consideration. I think Clay's right, in a world of pricing pressure, having a drug like ADCETRIS that really provides profound patient benefit is where you want to be.So we feel gratified that we've got such a good drug in a tough pricing environment.Our next question comes from Sylvan Turken of Oppenheimer Farms.First along the lines of a earlier question. What would you say is the split of the additional 8,000 patients for in front-line Hodgkin's lymphoma and PTCL in terms of community setting and academic centers? -- With Hodgkin lymphoma, there's a larger percentage, probably more like 60% of patients come in the community. Whereas, in PTCL, it's probably the other way around just because it's not -- the outcome is not as strong with PTCL.Thank you. And a quick question on the HER2CLIMB trial. The additional patients that you're enrolling post the 480 patients, are they enriched in patients with brain mets? Or does that not adjust as they show up? -- It's half of them, roughly, are the this stratification or patients that have preexisting brain metastasis.Great. And in terms of filing after the EV-101 top line -- I know you have Breakthrough Therapy designation, but when can we expect an update on your discussions with the FDA and their sign-off on allowing you to file an order? Would you give any guidance on that? -- We've had a lot of discussions with regulators, and we continue to have discussions with regulators on EV and specifics of those are, obviously, confidential. So as soon as we have the top-line data, which is we've guided to this quarter, so sometime soon, we'll have data. And then usually at some point -- no, not that distance from then, we start to give guidance on other aspects like when will timing to submit. And then as far as filing goes, filing is usually within 60 days of submission unless there's an issue as you know.So that's what we would start talking about the ability to submit based on the data we have. Now we have said that we plan to submit this year. We haven't given a specific month, but our goal is to submit on EV in 2019.Our last question for today comes from Andy Hsieh of William Blair. -- Maybe a longer-term question -- strategy question for Roger. Front line, you see there's different pieces probably different segments. And you can probably stratify them by PD-L1 statuses eligibility. Just wondering if you could remind us, for EV, is there any particular area where it has shown strength and how that would inform your strategy in earlier lines going forward? -- Thanks. Great question. Just a couple of observations. Obviously, EV is based on -- in Nectin-4 expression, however, we don't see any need for a biomarker, so EV can be broadly used.Certainly, the data's been generated from a post-PD-1 exposed population, potentially shows that EV is effective in both a PD-1 exposed and a PD-1 naive population that helps us a little bit in understanding what the role of a PD-1 inhibitor together with EV would be, and then as we have done -- ADCETRIS is a great example. We can combine, at least in the BV construct, we can combine a vedotin-based antibody ADC with chemotherapy. So we have a number of options. And I've mentioned it a couple times.We've designed our trials such that we will hopefully be configured to be able to choose what looks like the best-possible available option to move into front line, if that's appropriate.Speakers, that concludes today's Q&A. -- Thank you, operator, and thanks, everybody, for joining us this afternoon. Have a good evening.[Operator signoff]Please make sure you've selected a ticker.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Seattle Genetics (SGEN) Q4 2018 Earnings Conference Call Transcript@2019-02-08@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/seattle-genetics-sgen-q4-2018-earnings-conference-call-transcript-2019-02-08

" is scheduled to report fourth-quarter and full-year 2018 results on Feb 6, before market open. In the las  ed quarter, the company delivered a negative surprise of 3.49%.Shares of Glaxo have underperformed the  in the past six months. The stock has lost 4.2% against the industry's increase of 1.2%.Glaxo's earnings performance has been mixed so far. The company's earnings surpassed estimates in two of the trailing four quarters and missed the same twice with the average beat being 1.61%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this quarter.The company's Pharmaceuticals segment is expected to be driven by solid sales of new HIV products, Tivicay and Triumeq. However, sales of another HIV drug, Epzicom/Kivexa are likely to decline due to more severe generic competition, particularly affecting the European market. Notably, the company's latest product from the HIV portfolio, Juluca, had a strong uptake in the first nine months of 2018. Approval of Juluca in EU in May also boosted third-quarter sales. The same momentum is expected in the fourth quarter. The impact of approval for Juluca in Japan in late November remains to be seen.Sales of its new respiratory drugs, Ellipta products and Nucala are likely to offset the declines in sales of older respiratory products, namely Seretide, Advair and Avodart. In August, Nucala was approved in Europe for pediatric patients with severe asthma. The approval is likely to have a positive impact on sales. However, competition is rising with the launch of AstraZeneca's Fasenra and Dupixent in the United States. Glaxo expects sales growth for Nucala to be sluggish.In November, the company received approval for Trelegy Ellipta's label expansion to include patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (""COPD"") in Europe. However, we expect minimal impact on the drug's sales in the soon-to-be reported quarter.Glaxo's immuno-inflammation drugs like Benlysta are expected to perform well in the fourth quarter.The Vaccines segment is likely to consistently benefit from a sustained uptake of Shingrix and Hepatitis vaccines. Meningitis vaccines like Bexsero and Menveo, acquired from Novartis AG  , enjoyed strong demand. However, supply constraints for Menveo in European and International markets pulled down sales growth lower in the third quarter. We expect demand for these vaccines to remain strong while supply constraints may partially offset the strong growth.In Consumer Healthcare segment, sales are likely to be driven by Oral health, Wellness and Nutrition products. However, rising competition in Europe and declining sales of the Skin health category will have a negative impact. In December, Glaxo along with Pfizer formed a new joint venture, merging their consumer healthcare units and creating the world's largest consumer healthcare business. However, synergies expected from this venture are unlikely to be seen in the fourth quarter. The company also announced divestiture of its Horlicks and other nutrition products business in India and Bangladesh to London-based consumer giant Unilever in the same month.In January, the company completed its acquisition of TESARO, adding the latter's PARP inhibitor, Zejula, to its oncology portfolio. Late last month, the FDA approved the first generic version of Advair developed by Mylan for asthma and COPD.We expect Glaxo to provide updates on Zejula's integration into the company's portfolio and the impact of the launch of Advair generic on its fourth-quarter  . Investors may ask questions on the company's path to offset any unfavorable impact of generics on Advair sales.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Glaxo is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.

xpected Earnings Release: 02/07/2019, After-hoursAvg. Extended-Hours Dollar Volume: $3,902,405Seattle Genetics Inc. (  ) is due to issue its quarterly earnings report in the upcoming extended-hours session. Given its history, traders can expect light trading in the issue immediately following its quarterly earnings announcement. Historical earnings event related premarket and after-hours trading activity in SGEN indicates that the price change in the extended hours is likely to be of limited value in forecasting additional price movement by the following regular session close.Last 12 Qtrs Positive Only Price ReactionsPercent of time added to extended-hours gains: 66.7%Average next regular session additional gain: 2.7%Over the prior three fiscal years (12 quarters), when shares of SGEN rose in the extended-hours session in reaction to its earnings announcement, history shows that 66.7% of the time (2 events) the stock posted additional gains in the following regular session by an average of 2.7%.Last 12 Qtrs Negative Only Price ReactionsPercent of time added to extended-hours losses: 50%Average next regular session additional loss: 3.9%Over that same historical period, when shares of SGEN dropped in the extended-hours in reaction to its earnings announcement, history shows that 50.0% of the time (1 event) the stock dropped further, adding to the extended-hours losses by an average of 3.9% by the following regular session close.Data provided by the MT Pro service at MTNewswires.com.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Earnings Reaction History: Seattle Genetics Inc., 60.0% Follow-Through Indicator, 5.0% Sensitive@2019-02-07@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/earnings-reaction-history-seattle-genetics-inc-600-follow-through-indicator-50-sensitive
all Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Seattle Genetics (SGEN) reports results for the quarter ended December 2018. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 7, 2019, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the  , it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.This biotechnology company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.39 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +4.9%.Revenues are expected to be $165.79 million, up 27.9% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 13.21% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks  (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce  , and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).For Seattle Genetics, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +12.82%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that Seattle Genetics will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the las  ed quarter, it was expected that Seattle Genetics would post a loss of $0.27 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.27, delivering no surprise.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to bea  expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our  to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Seattle Genetics appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"Biotech stocks are already making some big waves this year. That's because M&A activity is already surging. Drawn by some big-time values, some of the world's biggest pharmaceutical firms have gone shopping for beaten-down biotech bargains.Already, we've seen  (NYSE:  ) score  (NASDAQ:  ) for a cool $74 billion in a game-changing  . More recently,  (NYSE:  ) announced that it was pushing harder into cancer treatments with an  for  (NASDAQ:  ).The question on everyone's minds is ""who is next?""With plenty of biotech stocks still trading for peanuts and coffers overflowing at the major pharma's, more M&A activity is guaranteed. And while betting on a buyout may be a fool's errand, there are plenty of biotech stocks out there are on my best stocks to invest in list anyway. A buyout would be icing on the cake.But which ones have the potential to snagged up because they are so good? Here are five biotech stocks that could be buy-out candidates.Source: Shutterstock With oncology and cancer on the minds of many of the biggest names pharma, biotech stock  (NASDAQ:  ) could once again be in play.SGEN has one drug available for patients - Adcetris - which is used to treat Stage III/IV classical Hodgkin lymphoma. Sales of Adcetris continue to grow rapidly.  , revenues for the drug jumped by over 60% year-over-year. Even better is that number of indications, combinations and other uses for Adcetris have grown like weeds. SGEN continue to rack up more approvals and ""breakthrough"" designations for the drug. All of this has only made the medicine more lucrative for the biotech stock.As if that wasn't enough for big pharma to be salivating at the firm, Seattle Genetics has been able to pivot its technology towards other forms of cancer. The firm has  targeting urothelial, cervical, breast and multiple myeloma cancer varieties. Here again, SGEN has been quite successful in moving its drugs through the FDA's hoops.Given growing sales of Adcetris and its heavy-duty cancer-focused pipeline, any biopharma looking to make a splash in oncology would seriously be considering SGEN stock. With a market cap of just over $11 billion, Seattle Genetics could one of the next biotech stocks to be bought out.Source: Shutterstock Keeping with the cancer buy-out theme,  (NASDAQ:  ) makes an intriguing biotech buyout candidate.AGIO has two cancer therapies on the market. Its latest, Tibsovo, has been approved for those acute myeloid leukemia patients with an IDH1 mutation. The other - Idhifa - is for acute myeloid leukemia patients who also test positive for an IDH2 mutation. The firm basically has a one-two punch for this specific variety of leukemia. And while the drugs are new, prescriptions are growing, with Tibsovo seeing a  increase in its short life span. That makes it a buyout candidate alone.Tibsovo is wholly owned by Agios. However, the real kicker is that Idhifa came via a partnership with Celgene. Celgene - soon to be Bristol Meyers - must continue to pay royalties on sales from the drug via a tiered structure that gets into the mid-teens. Given its buyout of CELG, BMY may just want to control the whole pie, and with AGIO's market cap sitting at just over $3 billion, it's an easy pill to swallow.And with the two medicines, BMY would be getting a healthy  of additional cancer therapies as well as some rare disease work for a song.Given that, there's a good chance that AGIO gets the nod. No wonder why shares have jumped higher since both CELG's and LOXO's buyout bids.Source: Shutterstock It's very rare to find biotech stocks trading for bargain-basement valuations. But that's just what is happening at  (NASDAQ:  ). Today, you can snag JAZZ stock for forward P/E of under 10.JAZZ has  , with narcolepsy drug Xyrem being a blockbuster. Sales of Xyrem continue to grow and are expected to surpass $1.4 billion this year. At the same time, its portfolio of hematology/oncology drugs are proven to be winners as well and are helping JAZZ realize a double-digit EPS growth rate. Acute myeloid leukemia treatment Vyxeos, which only launched last year, is set to pull in roughly $100 million in sales for the full year 2018 and more than $200 million this year.Adding to this is JAZZ's pending  for its new drug covering excessive daytime sleepiness associated with narcolepsy or obstructive sleep apnea. Another late-stage candidate for cataplexy in narcolepsy should hit regulatory approval at the end of the year.With a rich drug portfolio and pipeline, JAZZ is a rarity among biotech stocks. It's profitable - so much so that the firm has authorized a $400 million buyback program. That's after it already repurchased over $600 million in shares. Analysts estimate that a dividend could even be coming next.Featuring a market cap of less than $8 billion, JAZZ would be an easy and profitable tuck-in for almost any big pharma stock.Source: Shutterstock A rare miss for  (NASDAQ:  ) sent shares crashing this year and left the firm with a $7.5 billion market cap. But NBIX's pain could end up being  (NASDAQ:  ) gain.Over the summer, NBIX and ABBV received an FDA  , which is used in the treatment of pain associated with endometriosis. The drug is currently wrapping up trials for the treatment of uterine fibroids. Analysts think the drug has blockbuster potential with annual sales of around $1 billion.On its own, NBIX has a blockbuster in Ingrezza. The drug is used to treat tardive dyskinesia - which is marked by jerky movements of the face and body out of a patient's control. The problem is tardive dyskinesia is a side effect of many depression, schizophrenia and other mental health drugs. This is a huge market, and Ingrezza sales are taking off.  that they'll be able to pull in over $400 million in Ingrezza sales in 2018. And NBIX has a full pipeline of other drugs in various stages of trials.With a buyout, ABBV gets full access to Orilissa without royalty and milestone fees for future indications. Secondly, Ingrezza is quickly becoming a major money marker for NBIX. That would fill a nice hole in AbbVie's revenue stream and would help pay for the deal over the long haul.All in all, given its low market cap, hefty cash balance and marketed drugs, AbbVie may end up swallowing NBIX whole.Source: Shutterstock When politicians and pundits often talk about the high price of drugs and mention therapies costing more than $400,000 per year, odds are, they are talking about rare and orphan diseases. For biotech stocks, targeting these diseases - which sometimes can affect very small population sizes - it can mean plenty of long-term revenues down the road. Given the research required to crack these afflictions, the high drug prices are more than justified. (NASDAQ:  ) is one biotech stock that has made rare diseases its specialty.The firm has  on the market targeting illnesses such as phenylketonuria and Batten disease. Rare disease medications come with longer exclusivity rights and by focusing here, BMRN basically ensures patient protection versus generic competition. At the same time, these drugs pull in some big-time revenues. For example, this year, BioMarin expects to make more than  with its top five drugs.Meanwhile, the biotech stocks pipeline is rich as well with drugs for hemophilia and sanfilippo in late-stage trials.Because of its focus, profitability and rich rare disease pipeline, BioMarin has long been considered a buy candidate. With big pharma finally starting to spend some dough, that takeover may finally happen.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@5 Biotech Stocks That Could Face M&A Next!@2019-01-10@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/5-biotech-stocks-could-face-ma-next-2019-01-10

"nvestors in Seattle Genetics Inc (Symbol: SGEN) saw new options become available this week, for the September 20th expiration. One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 239 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the SGEN options chain for the new September 20th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $70.00 strike price has a current bid of $8.20. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $70.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $61.80 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of SGEN, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $71.51/share today.Because the $70.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 61%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of SGEN stock at the current price level of $71.51/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $75.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 15.65% if the stock gets called away at the September 20th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if SGEN shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Seattle Genetics Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing SGEN's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $75.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $75.00 strike represents an approximate 5% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

(CHOP and ABVD are acronyms for chemotherapy cocktails.)""The difference there being that with E-2 and CHOP, CHOP is nowhere near as effective as ABVD is, so that's something I think doctors will see really fast because they know they're not getting a high cure rate like they were with ABVD,"" Siegall said.Management guided for fourth-quarter Adcetris sales in the U.S. and Canada to be in the range of $128 million to $133 million, which isn't much more than the $127 million in the recently completed quarter. Hopefully management is sandbagging a little after missing guidance this quarter.Seattle Genetics is shooting for submitting the data from Echelon-2 to the Food and Drug Administration in November, and investors will get to see the full data set at the American Society of Hematology meeting in December.Beyond Adcetris, Seattle Genetics' pipeline is moving along. The most advanced drug, enfortumab vedotin for urothelial cancer, is scheduled to read out data from a pivotal trial in the first quarter of next year, which could put it on track for an approval in late 2019 or early 2020.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"Shares of  (NASDAQ: SGEN) are down 19% at 11:40 a.m. EDT after the biotech reported third-quarter results that didn't live up to expectations. Sales of Seattle Genetics' only drug, Adcetris, were up 60% year over year, but the $127 million in sales was shy of management's  of $130 million to $135 million.Adcetris was approved by the FDA as a frontline treatment for stage III and IV Hodgkin lymphoma in the first quarter, which drove the year-over-year growth, but it appears the trajectory may have stalled, with a quarter-over-quarter sales increase of just 3.7%, which was largely due to a price increase taken at the end of the second quarter.While it was a small miss of management's guidance, it seemed like management might be sandbagging its guidance a bit. The jump from the first quarter to the second quarter was the largest sequential quarter-over-quarter growth rate Adcetris had ever experienced.In hindsight, that was wishful thinking, and investors should have heeded CEO Clay Siegall's cautious statements about how sales would be ""stepwise moves.""Apparently they were baby steps.Image source: Getty Images.While Seattle Genetics is having trouble further breaking into a market where the standard of care hasn't grown in 40 years, it doesn't mean it can't eventually capture most of the front-line stage III and IV Hodgkin lymphoma patients. Doctors often try out a new treatment on a few patients to gain experience before prescribing it more broadly. The Adcetris cocktail has  than the cocktail of chemotherapy drugs that are currently used, so it should eventually become the new standard of care.Equally important is the fact that front-line Hodgkin lymphoma isn't Seattle Genetics' only option to expand sales of Adcertis. The company and its partner, Takeda Pharmaceutical, recently announced that Adcetris helped patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma live longer when used as a front-line treatment. Seattle Genetics plans to submit an application for that indication in November, putting a likely approval in mid to late 2019.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

For ADCETRIS, we received approval and launched in Frontline Hodgkin Lymphoma where we are providing a new treatment option to replace a 40-year old Standard of Care.In addition, we've reported top-line results from our Phase 3 ECHELON-2 trial in frontline peripheral T-cell lymphoma, showing a 34% reduction in the risk of death in the ADCETRIS-containing arm. E-2 is the sixth consecutive ADCETRIS pivotal trial to produce positive results. In our late stage portfolio, we made significant progress toward our goal of becoming a multi-product oncology company.We completed enrollment ahead of expectations in the pivotal trial of Enfortumab Vedotin in Urothelial Cancer. We're rapidly enrolling the Tucatinib pivotal trial for HER2-positive breast cancer. We've advanced Tisotumab Vedotin into a pivotal trial for cervical cancer, and we're making progress in multiple trials of Ladiratuzumab Vedotin.In our earlier-stage pipeline, we were advancing several programs in clinical trials as we continue to bring multiple novel agents into the clinic each year.Today, we'll update you on our key recent and upcoming activities. For the third quarter and year-to-date, we reported record ADCETRIS net sales in the US and Canada, up more than 50% compared to the same periods last year. We've grown ADCETRIS revenue sequentially in each quarter of 2018.This included a particularly strong second quarter during which we saw rapid uptake by early adopters of ADCETRIS plus AVD in Frontline Advanced Hodgkin Lymphoma following approval in March. For many physicians treating advanced Hodgkin Lymphoma patients, this is a paradigm shift from an entrenched standard of care that will take time.We remain confident in the long-term growth trajectory of ADCETRIS toward becoming a blockbuster brand in the United States. Darren will provide more specifics on our commercial activities during his remarks.We project fourth quarter ADCETRIS sales in the US and Canada to be $128 million to $133 million, which would result in 2018 net sales in the range of $473 million to $478 million. This is an increase of approximately 50% over 2017. One key component of future growth is frontline PTCL; and earlier this month, we reported positive top-line data from our Phase 3 ECHELON-2 trial.We believe the data are ground-breaking based on the statistically significant and clinically meaningful benefit achieved for patients treated with the ADCETRIS-containing regimen over standard of care for progression-free survival and importantly, overall survival. We are excited to share the full E-2 results at ASH.Given the strength of the data, we've had discussions with FDA and we plan and we expect to submit the supplemental BLA in November. In addition, our partner Takeda plans to submit these data to regulatory authorities in its territories.Recently, Takeda received approval in Japan for ADCETRIS as a Frontline treatment option for CD30-positive Hodgkin Lymphoma patients based on the E-1 trial. This triggered a $10 million milestone payment to us. In addition, Takeda submitted applications for approval of ADCETRIS in combination with AVD in previously untreated Hodgkin Lymphoma to several other authorities, including the EMA.There are more than 100 ongoing or completed trials involving ADCETRIS including both Company and investigator-sponsored trials around the globe. These trials are evaluating ADCETRIS as monotherapy and as part of combination regimens, mostly focused on earlier-stage Frontline Hodgkin lymphoma, relapsed Hodgkin Lymphoma and B-cell lymphomas.For example, we published earlier this year strong data from a trial of ADCETRIS plus bendamustine in relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma which showed a 93% objective response rate, including 74% complete remissions.We're reviewing data such as these for potential regulatory interactions which could further support our goal to establish ADCETRIS as the foundation of therapy in CD30-expressing lymphomas.In parallel, with building the ADCETRIS franchise, we are advancing and expanding our pipeline. Our most advanced program is enfortumab vedotin, or EV, for locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer. We're developing EV in collaboration with Astellas. In July, we completed enrollment in the EV-201 pivotal trial cohorts of patients who received both a platinum-based chemotherapy agent and a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor.Based on progress to date, we now expect to report top line data from the pivotal trial in the first quarter of 2019. This could support a regulatory submission in 2019 under the FDA's accelerated approval pathway.In anticipation of potential FDA approval and launch of EV, we have aligned with Astellas on the specifics of how we will govern its global commercialization. As you know, the companies contemplates a 50-50 profit share worldwide and the companies working jointly on global commercialization plans.In the Americas, Seattle Genetics will book sales, while Astellas will book sales in the rest of the world. The United States, EU5, and Canada are profit share territories. Other parts of the world are royalty territories, with individual rates designed to approximate a 50-50 profit share.We believe this structure utilizes the strengths of each organization, and once approved, will best position EV in the marketplace and help ensure that we can bring EV to appropriate patients in need.The next most advanced program in our portfolio is Tucatinib. This is an oral small molecule HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor that we believe could be best-in-class. Tucatinib is differentiated from other TKIs given its high affinity for HER2 without significant inhibition of EGFR, which may reduce the rate of clinically meaningful toxicities.Our primary focus with tucatinib is the ongoing pivotal HER2CLIMB trial in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, including patients with or without brain metastasis. HER2CLIMB is enrolling rapidly, and we expect to complete the enrollment target of 480 patients in early 2019. This supports the analysis of the primary endpoint of PFS.In addition, after communicating with the FDA, we now plan to continue enrollment up to 600 patients. This change strengthens the analysis of the key secondary endpoints which are overall survival and PFS in patients with brain metastasis. This is the result of our evaluation of the trial following our acquisition of Cascadian earlier this year.Given how rapidly HER2CLIMB is enrolling, we anticipate completing accrual of 600 patients by mid-2019. HER2CLIMB is intended to support global regulatory submissions. We also plan to expand the Tucatinib program into earlier lines of metastatic breast cancer, as well as in other HER2-expressing solid tumors, such as colorectal and gastric cancers.At this point, I'll turn the call over to Darren to discuss our commercial activities. After that, Roger will provide an update on our clinical programs, and then Todd will discuss our third quarter financial results. Darren? -- Thanks, Clay. ADCETRIS net sales were $127 million in the third quarter, a 4% increase over the second quarter of 2018. We are pleased with our overall progress in launching ADCETRIS in Stage III and IV classical Hodgkin lymphoma or HL.In the frontline setting, we're displacing a 40-year-old standard of care. We're six months into the launch and have a good understanding of the market dynamics.First, we saw rapid adoption among physicians who appreciated the benefit of the ADCETRIS plus AVD regimen. We believe this contributed to the greater than 50% growth in year-over-year sales and was particularly noticeable in Q2. Now we're entering the second phase of the launch which is focused on broader use.This involves continuing to connect with the physician community and patients, talking about the benefit that ADCETRIS can provide, publishing our data and supporting integration of ADCETRIS into treatment pathways. Our guidance for the fourth quarter reflects this stage of the launch. The commercial team is focused on three key priorities. First, our field team is working to ensure that physicians are familiar with the E-1 data, particularly those in the community settings where we estimate the majority of Frontline HL patients are diagnosed and treated.We recently started promoting the North American subset data which were presented at ASCO in June and is expected to be published in the near future. These data are compelling to many physicians and provide additional evidence that dosing ADCETRIS plus AVD with prophylactic growth factor support can provide patients with superior efficacy outcomes without sacrificing safety in newly diagnosed Stage III and IV HL patients.Market research and Advisory Boards continue to indicate a strong desire to use a bleomycin free regimen in the frontline setting.Second, we've increased our efforts around patient engagement and continue to see an uptick in traffic to our website. The average age of diagnosis for HL is approximately 40 years. These patients and their caregivers seek out information online. We want to ensure that newly diagnosed patients are familiar with the advances in HL treatment and they ask physicians about ADCETRIS.And lastly, we want to ensure that ADCETRIS plus AVD in the Frontline setting is appropriately included in pathways and guidelines. This is important because some physician groups and academic centers utilize guidelines and pathways to apply consistent patient care. The commercial team, along with our medical affairs colleagues, continue to educate physicians on our data.We remain confident that ADCETRIS plus AVD will replace the 40-year-old standard of care in advanced HL patients and we look forward to keeping you updated on our progress.Looking ahead, launch preparations are under way for the potential approval of ADCETRIS in CD30 expressing Frontline PTCL based on the strong results from our E-2 trial. Market research confirms there is a high unmet need in Frontline PTCL and where the current standard of care treatment, CHOP chemotherapy, is suboptimal.We estimate an addressable patient population of approximately 4,000 newly diagnosed CD30 expressing PTCL patients in the US annually. We believe that, if approved, ADCETRIS plus CHP chemotherapy will represent a significant benefit to these patients and a substantial commercial opportunity.ADCETRIS provides benefit to patients across many lines of therapy and indications. Our vision is to build ADCETRIS into a blockbuster brand. Our continued launch execution in the Frontline HL setting and potential approval in the Frontline PTCL setting will be the major drivers of achieving our vision.I'll now turn the call over to Roger to discuss our clinical activities. -- Thanks, Darren. And good afternoon, everyone. Today I'll summarize some of our recent clinical development activities as well as highlight a few important events on the horizon. First for ADCETRIS, as Clay mentioned, we reported positive results from the Phase 3 ECHELON-2 trial in frontline PTCL.PTCL comprises a number of T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas including systemic ALCL, PTCL not otherwise specified in other less common subtypes. The E-2 trial, which enrolled 452 patients, compared ADCETRIS plus CHP to the standard CHOP chemotherapy regimen. The ADCETRIS containing arm produced a statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint of PFS with a hazard ratio of 0.71, representing a 29% reduction in the risk of progression events.Importantly, we also observed a statistically significant overall survival benefit with ADCETRIS plus CHP. The hazard ratio for this outcome was 0.66 which equates to a 34% reduction in the risk of death.E-2 is the first randomized Phase 3 trial to show an OS improvement in frontline PTCL. All other key secondary endpoints were statistically significant in favor of the ADCETRIS plus CHP arm. These included PFS in patients with systemic ALCL, as well as complete remission rates and overall response rates in the entire population.The safety profile of ADCETRIS plus CHP was comparable to CHOP and consistent with the established safety profile of ADCETRIS in combination with chemotherapy. We view these data as potentially practice changing.As Clay mentioned, we're working diligently to get the E-2 data under FDA review as quickly as possible.ECHELON-2 data is one of more than 30 ADCETRIS containing abstracts that we expect will be presented at ASH in December. The presentations will include data from both company and investigator-initiated clinical trials in a variety of CD-30 expressing tumor types and settings, and we look forward to a strong showing for ADCETRIS in San Diego.ADCETRIS clinical data are also being presented in this upcoming weekend in Germany during several sessions at the International Symposium on Hodgkin Lymphoma meeting. Notable abstracts include the positive five-year PFS outcomes for high risk patients treated with ADCETRIS following Autologous Transplant, as well as promising data from a combination of ADCETRIS and nivolumab in both frontline and relapsed Hodgkin Lymphoma.Lastly with ADCETRIS, we are initiating a Phase 4 trial this year to assist the use of G-CSF primary prophylaxis for Stage III or IV Hodgkin lymphoma patients treated with ADCETRIS plus AVD. The trial will generate clinically important safety and efficacy data expanding on our findings from the E-1 trial in which the subset of patients who received G-CSF primary prophylaxis achieved improved outcomes with a better safety profile.I'll now move on to enfortumab vedotin or EV. As Clay indicated, our highest priority with EV is the ongoing pivotal trial in locally advanced metastatic urothelial cancer. I'd like to comment on our other EV development activities.First, the Phase 3 randomized trial called EV-301 in patients with metastatic urothelial cancer who have previously been treated with a platinum containing regimen and either a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor is ongoing. This is an important trial because it's intended to support global regulatory submissions for EV, as well as serve as the confirmative trial to EV-201 in the United States.The first line treatment landscape of metastatic urothelial cancer is evolving rapidly. We believe that EV has a role in the setting and so we plan to expand our ongoing first line EV-103 trial to evaluate EV in multiple combinations beyond pembrolizumab.An example of this combination approach is to evaluate EV together with the platinum agent, Cisplatin or carboplatin, which were part of the current standard of care. Data from this expanded trial exploring combinations more broadly together with results from frontline trials of other companies incorporating PD-1, PD-L1 agents will inform our first line registration strategy going forward.Now I'll turn to Tisotumab Vedotin or TV which we're developing with Genmab. TV targets tissue factor which is expressed in a wide array of solid tumors. We are currently enrolling a pivotal trial of TV in cervical cancer that is designed to support a regulatory submission on to the FDA's accelerated approval pathway.We're also enrolling a Phase 2 basket trial evaluating TV and other solid tumors where tissue factor is expressed. These include colorectal, pancreatic, non-small cell lung cancer and head and neck cancer, and we also plan to initiate a trial focused on ovarian cancer.Next, I'd like to briefly highlight Ladiratuzumab Vedotin or LV which is an ADC targeting LIV1 and is being evaluated in several ongoing trials for triple negative breast cancer. We've previously reported encouraging single agent activity in patients with metastatic TNBC who are heavily pretreated, and we are continuing to explore LV as monotherapy in patients who failed one or more lines of therapy, but we're also evaluating LV in the near adjuvant breast cancer setting as part of the I-SPY 2 trial.From a combination perspective, we are evaluating LV together with pembrolizumab, and in addition, LV is been combined with Atezolizumab as part of the MORPHEUS trial. We look forward to keeping you updated on the LV program and its potential to address the unmet medical need in triple negative breast cancer.Now, I'll turn the call over Todd who will review the financial results. Todd? -- Great. Thanks, Roger, and thanks to everyone for joining us on the call this afternoon. Today I'll summarize our financial results for the third quarter and year-to-date, as well as provide some updates to our financial outlook for the year.Total revenues in the third quarter were $169 million and were $480 million for the year-to-date in 2018. This included the ADCETRIS net sales in the US and Canada of $127 million in the third quarter and $345 million for the first nine months of the year.Growth in 2018 reflects the recent label expansions in CTCL and Frontline Hodgkin Lymphoma. As Clay mentioned, we are guiding for fourth quarter ADCETRIS net sales in the US and Canada of $128 million to $133 million.Royalty revenues in the third quarter increased to $23 million compared to $17 million in the third quarter of 2017. For the first nine months of 2018, royalty revenues were $59 million compared to $46 million for the same period last year. Based on strong sales by Takeda, we are increasing our expectations for 2018 royalty revenues to a range of $78 million to $82 million.Collaboration revenues were $20 million in the third quarter which includes amounts earned under our ADCETRIS collaboration with Takeda and our ADC deals. This included the earned portion of a $10 million milestone from Takeda, triggered by the approval of ADCETRIS in Japan for Frontline Hodgkin lymphoma.As a result, we are increasing our expectation for 2018 collaboration revenues to a range of $80 million to $90 million. R&D expenses were $140 million in the third quarter of 2018 and $416 million for the year to-date. The increases over 2017 reflect higher investment across our portfolio.Based on our year-to-date results, we are narrowing our expectations for R&D expenses to a range of $555 million to $575 million.SG&A expenses were $57 million in the third quarter and $182 million in the first nine months of this year. Expenses in 2018 reflect the acquisition of Cascadian in the first quarter and costs to support the commercial launch of ADCETRIS in frontline Hodgkin Lymphoma.Given our continuing investments during 2018 to support our portfolio, we are slightly increasing our guidance for SG&A expenses for the year to be in the range of $240 million to $250 million.We ended the third quarter with $486 million in cash and investments. This is in addition to approximately $160 million in common stock holdings in Immunomedics. These shares are mark to market which causes variability in our financial results and is not core to our operations.Of note, this contributed to an investment net loss for the quarter of $22 million and a gain for the year of $67 million.And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Clay. -- Thanks, Todd. I'll close with a short summary of key milestones expected in the next several months. They include, first, in frontline PTCL, submitting the supplemental BLA to FDA in November and reporting data from the E-2 trial at ASH.Second, reporting top line data from the EV pivotal trial, EV-201, in urothelial cancer in the first quarter of 2019. Third, completing enrollment of 480 patients in the tucatinib pivotal trial HER2CLIMB and HER-2 positive metastatic breast cancer in early 2019.And lastly, advancing the pivotal trial of TV in cervical cancer. By continuing to grow the ADCETRIS brand which is approaching $0.5 billion in US revenues in 2018 and advancing our late-stage pipeline, we have the potential to realize our vision of transforming Seattle Genetics into a multi-product global oncology company.At this point, we'll open the line for Q&A. Operator, please open the call for questions.(Operator Instructions). Our first question will come from Michael Schmidt with Guggenheim Partners. -- Thanks for taking my questions. I had a couple. Maybe one first on ADCETRIS, Clay. Could you just comment a little bit more on the sales dynamics in Hodgkin Lymphoma? Where has the uptake been strongest so far of ADCETRIS in the first line setting? And could you help us understand what percent of market share you have in the Stage III/IV patient population at this point? And then I had a quick follow-up. -- Sure. Thanks for the question. So overall, Michael, as we look at ADCETRIS, this brand is doing very well. And like I said in prepared remarks, approaching $0.5 billion in US and starting to get closer to $1 billion globally. And it's a great product, it's an important product, doctors really depend on it.Now from year-to-date standpoint we're up 50%, and from a E-1 regimen or frontline Hodgkin Lymphoma regimen, we had a rapid uptake into the market. Clearly there are quarter-to-quarter variabilities in Hodgkin Lymphoma diagnosis, but we continue to grow to market share.We got the early adopters, now the hard work begins, and Darren, do you want to make any comments about the hard work that we're doing to get out there? -- Sure, Michael. Thanks for the question. Yeah, you asked about the rapid adoption and we really see kind of two camps that really took to the regimen quickly. It was those that physicians that had a bleomycin pulmonary toxicity issue with one of their patients.And we knew that going in that market research and all our discussions that docs were looking for a bleomycin-free frontline regimen. The second were just physicians that just took to the data. This is the disease that has curative intent and ADCETRIS plus AVD and the ECHELON-1 trial showed that benefit. And so those are the physicians that quickly pivoted to the product.Now as Clay mentioned now, now we kind of pivot to changing a 40-year standard of care take some times. And let me remind you, majority of these patients are diagnosed in the community where these physicians see 3 to 4 patients a year. So our sales force of roughly 90 representatives continue to educate physicians, highlight our data, particularly the North American data which highlights a really nice treatment effect in the North American experience.So we're super optimistic moving forward, a lot of hard work to do. You did ask about share. It's a little early for us to kind of determine where that share is, but as we get farther away from shore, we'll update you on our progress there. -- Great. Thanks. And then just a quick one on HER2CLIMB, you mentioned the protocol change, the enrollment change, and I was just wondering if the primary PFS analysis is that triggered based on the first 480 patients overall that now will be done on the larger trial side? -- Yeah, the PFS is still triggered off of the 480 patients, and that's scheduled for early 2019 as we have mentioned on the call. So still at 480. -- Perfect. Great. Thank you, Clay.Thank you. Our next question will come from Kennen MacKay with RBC Capital Market. -- Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe one for Darren on the commercial trajectory of ADCETRIS. It seems like excluding the price increase, sales seem kind of flat quarter-over-quarter. I was wondering if you can maybe just give us a little bit more understanding of the dynamic that's going on here between Q2 and Q3, especially given a sense of inventory not really factoring into the question here.Also wondering if you can help us understand what duration is looking like in Hodgkins? Is it sort of coming out in the clinic through the 46 cycles that we saw in ECHELON-1? And then a final question, just hoping for a little bit of color on, Clay, your comment referring to seasonality of Hodgkins diagnoses.Hoping you could maybe elaborate on that or wondering perhaps when ADCETRIS did launch in the frontline Hodgkins, maybe there were some warehouse patients that were getting seen in Q1 and Q2.I know that was a lot so thanks for taking these. -- Yeah. Darren, why don't you start and I'll hop in afterwards. -- So Kennen, thanks for the question. I got the dynamics duration. So yeah, as I mentioned earlier, I think we saw really rapid uptake in the first half of the year but most notably in the second quarter, and those were physicians that really, as I noted, really took to the therapy, and which is typical in some launches.And you did note that ADCETRIS is not a therapy that there is any stocking. As you know, it's a just-in-time delivery of ADCETRIS from Seattle Genetics. Physicians or clinics order it and they receive it the next day. So the dynamic was really just out of the gate, physicians are latched onto it, and now we kind of pivot to that entrenched area of a 40-year standard of care in which our 90 representatives continue to educate physicians around.We're really optimistic about the North American data. All our market research that we do indicates that it's compelling data, particularly for those physicians that have not adopted ADCETRIS plus AVD in the frontline setting.So, we're excited to get out there and continue to educate them around that dataset. Regarding duration, it is much like shared too early. We're just several months into the launch and so we really need to understand what that duration is, and at the appropriate time we'll update you on what that duration of therapy is.But I will say that unlike our previous labels and relapse refractory in AETHERA, this is a curative intent and docs do want to cure these patients in the frontline setting. And with prophylactic growth factor, all our indications are docs want to get as much therapy into patients as possible. -- So I'd add that when we first came out with this regimen, we did get some crossover to patients that were already on ABVD for a cycle or two and then crossed over into ADCETRIS AVD, and I think that partially added to the big burst that we had. We had 2 great quarters in a row. And so that settled down because you're not getting the crossover as well.So we did see some of that, and Darren answered the question of duration, we think it's great, because of the curative intent. We think duration is going to be strong. And this is something -- it really is -- this is a 40-year regimen that doctors are using and it just takes time to get there.Doctors don't see this is not lung cancer, so some of the doctors, there's thousands of hem-onc doctors and a lot of them out in the community will see 3 or 4 Hodgkin lymphoma patients in a year.And so this just has to get into their mindset, because they're used to using ABVD. And ABVD is, and has been a chemotherapy success story, it's been a good thing, but bleomycin is quite toxic, and if you look at our North American data, we're increasing the long-term disease free survival rate by 10% without bleomycin.So our data are very strong. And as we -- Darren canvass doctors and talk to doctors, they see our data, I think that they are starting to use it, and even though doctors that are set in their ways will start to take it up and use it. So we feel good about the future. -- Got you. Thanks, Clay. And maybe 1 additional follow-up if I could, just hoping for a little bit more color on the changes to the HER2CLIMB study. I was wondering sort of specifically what you were initially seeing in sort of the event rates that led to this decision?If you could just help us understand that a little bit more, is it related to PFS or OS events cumulating? -- Sure. It really wasn't related to events. Let me just step back for a second. We acquired Cascadian. It was a very strong acquisition. The integration went increasing and incredibly well. We really like Tucatinib for a lot of reasons, strong interaction with HER2, relatively none if any interaction with EGFR so we can get rid of the toxicities that are connected with this type of drug.And so we were able to come in, we were able to review the trial. And the trial is great and we really like the trial, and the 480 patients to go to PFS, that's not changing at all. But keep in mind that up to half of the patients can have brain mets, OK? And we're very interested in OS.So we just, to us it's really important to make sure that we have an opportunity to continue treating patients. And due to that, the enrollment is so fast, OK, I mean, this has been really -- this is exciting to doctors and we hear from them all the time.It takes barely more time, a few extra months and we'll have the enrollment done to 600, and it'll increase the sample size, increase our statistical power for something like an OS which -- and potentially on OS, even getting an earlier OS data time by having more patients.So this is to us, this made total sense. We spoke with regulators and regulators were totally fine with it and so to us this just made sense. And Roger, do you have any additional color? -- No. I think, Clay, you're exactly right. This strengthens the trial. It's already a well-designed trial, because on its primary end points, and this move to increase the sample size to the secondary end points just increases the value and the potential for producing significant outcomes for those 2 events. -- Yeah. And I'll mention one more thing is that we're now stating, because we were stating that the 480 patients will be hit in the middle of the year or something, and now we're saying early 2019.The enrollment has done so well we're shortening the time-frame to getting that 480 patients, so the data on the overall data is going to come in earlier than initially thought. -- Got you. Thank you for the questions and the additional color.All right. Thank you. Our next question will come from Andrew Berens with Leerink Partners. -- Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Was wondering if you can give us some color maybe on the unique prescriber dynamics that is contributing to what appears to be a slowdown quarter-over-quarter? And then what could be done to return acceleration of the growth going forward? -- Sure. Well, we've made similar comments already. We think that this is this 40-year regimen that doctors have been using with a fairly high cure rate. We came in, we have even a higher long term disease free survival.I hesitate to say cure because it's usually a five-year follow up to call it a defined cure and we'll be tracking to that for sure. So it most likely represents an enhanced cure rate. We'll just have to wait a little longer to use that word.But it is something where our data are strong, OK? There is no doubt about it that this can benefit patients and without bleomycin. For the first time in decades of doctors trying, we were able to do that. And so a bunch of doctors went on really quick and put it on there, and then there's other doctors that just -- it's not that they're against this, it's they don't see that many Hodgkin Lymphoma patients.They're used to using the same thing, and there is -- this thing needs to get into the practices and in their pathways and just become a regular thing for them. And certainly, getting out the E-2 data and hopefully approval at some point would only help because once again, PTCL is also not a -- it's not lung cancer.But these are similar doctors if not the same doctors that treat these diseases, and the thing we want the doctors to think about is that they think about ADCETRIS and we get E-2 approval in the future, they think ADCETRIS frontline and it goes together, ADCETRIS frontline Hodgkin, ADCETRIS frontline PTCL.And getting that out there will help the mindset of these docs that are used to decades old regimens. Certainly, decades old regimen in ABVD and for E-2 -- for E-2 its CHOP which is also decades old. The difference there being that with E-2 and CHOP, CHOP is nowhere near as effective as ABVD is, so that's something I think doctors will see really fast because they know they're not getting a high cure rate like they were with ABVD.And so I think having both of them out there will really impact both and get the mindset more into ADCETRIS to the frontline and connecting those two.Darren, do you have any additional comments? -- Yeah. Andy, I think on just the accelerating it to your, Clay outlined it exactly right. But when I look at our execution metrics and when we think about physicians and patients, all of our metrics are looking extremely well, our share of voice, our time on detail, our intent to prescribe, the different sales force metrics we look at.When you look at the digital knowing that patients and caregivers are so an important part of this therapy, our traffic to book-to-book, ACP and patients are increasing, downloads are increasing. And then our market research around the North American data which really shows that treatment impact that some were looking for in the double digits, all that market research is telling us that this is compelling to physicians to get them to adopt ADCETRIS plus AVD in the frontline setting.So those are the things that we're excited about moving into the fourth quarter and early next year. And also, as Clay pointed out, with the potential of E-2, you really see a frontline ADCETRIS approach in both frontline Hodgkin, Stage III/IV patients and frontline PTCL. -- Okay. Is there any other payers? Is there any pushback from the payers on reimbursement? Are they restricting it to Stage III and IV? -- Our label is in Stage III and IV, so certainly that's our label. We don't promote off-label. We have not heard of payer pushback at all. So that's not, that hasn't been an issue. I think our labels at the payers, Andy, both in monotherapy and ADCETRIS plus AVD reflect no payer issues across any of those labels, the 5 that we currently have. -- Okay. And then just one last one, please. Just any thoughts on HHS proposals, the drug pricing changes, how that could affect ADCETRIS. -- I don't want to comment on specific HHS proposals or anything like that. We have -- as you know, taken price increases and kept them, they are very modest, and made sure that we never put a healthcare professional underwater as a termite (ph). So we've kept them really modest, and we will never comment on whether we will or not take price increases in the future, but if we do, we will keep them like we've always done, which is modest. -- Okay. But there's also a proposal to remove the ASP-based pricing. Does that potentially have an impact on ADCETRIS in the community? -- Well, we're not -- and I'll just -- I'll take it, Andy. We don't, there's no discounting contracting currently with ADCETRIS, Andy. So I think that will impact those that have contracts and what have you. But it is something we'll continue to evaluate, all these different changes in potential pricing policy, something we will continue to consider and evaluate. -- Okay. Thank you for the questions.All right. Thank you. Our next question comes from Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. -- Yes, hi. Thanks for taking the question. This is Maryana Breitman for Salveen. I have a quick one. I just wanted to ask about the 4Q guidance. Do you guys expect some kind of seasonality effect going forward? And another question that I had was, do you think the PTCL is going to have the similar type of launch dynamic that you will have basically like early adopters and then it's going to be that sort of paradigm shifting phenomenon that you've seen before? Thank you. -- Yeah, thanks for the questions. We mentioned in the prepared remarks, seasonality. Our share, we've done work on this and it's hard to completely be 100% sure, but our share is good and we liked our share, and it seemed like in the quarter there was a little bit less Frontline Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosed, and it's hard to fully 100% know that because we don't have every single patient with their details, but we said the word seasonality for that reason.And if we're still having a good share, but there's less Hodgkin Lymphoma diagnosed in frontline, that could be something we're looking at. And we just wanted to put that out there because it's something that we have looked at and considered because the number of frontline patients was a little low in the quarter. And so that's just something we put out there.Second of all, in PTCL, you asked about early adopters and will we see the same. I think that while we don't know for sure, so I don't want to commit to something. This is a little different because doctors know that PTCL patients are treated less well and there's a bigger unmet medical need for the E-2 regimen. CHOP does not provide for, in the mid-70s, of a cure rate like ABVD does.Now, we're in the mid-80s when you look at our North American data, we're very excited with that, to have that long of a disease-free survival rate, multi-year disease-free survival rate we're excited with, but with PTCL historically, you're more like 50%, it's not in the mid-70s.So there's a lot of patients that are not treated very well, and even the patients that respond, a lot of them ended up relapsing with PTCL. So there's not just a 50% cure rate that's an immediate CR rate. So I think it's going to be different there.Darren, do you want to add any color to that? -- Yeah. I think you're right, Clay, and while it's hard to predict, if you look at our deployment of our sales force, there's a lot of overlap between the treating physicians between Hodgkin and frontline PTCL, both in the community setting and the academic setting.I do think that overall survival is, in it with ADCETRIS and CHP is a tremendous benefit that I think physicians will really latch on to. And whether we'll see some of the dynamic of some patients and physicians making the particular switch mid-cycle remains to be seen.But I think once the -- we're approved and we're out there promoting it, I think docs will be excited to surprise us as a treatment option for their patients. -- Thank you.All right. Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our next question will come from Tazeen Ahmad with Bank of America. -- Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Clay, I just wanted to get your thoughts about a study that Merck is doing, it's called the KEYNOTE-204 study. They're looking at using PD-1 plus ADCETRIS versus PD-1 alone, and I realize this is not your study, but in general what are your thoughts about combo therapies with ADCETRIS, and depending on the outcome of the KEYNOTE study, how do you think that could impact ADCETRIS sales? -- We're very aware of all the studies in Hodgkin lymphoma, whether they use ADCETRIS or not, first of all, so we track on those. And you asked a general question, which I think is actually the best way to address this. The general question is, what do I think and what do we think (inaudible) about combinations with ADCETRIS?Well, first of all, both E-1 and E-2 are combinations, so we, and those are in frontline, and so we see that ADCETRIS combines very well with the standard old school chemotherapy. We know that. The fact, we're now approved with E-1. We have great data, groundbreaking data with E-2; we're planning to submit that. And I may add, really hustling. We didn't make that in our prepared remarks, but getting that submission done in November is, I mean, that's working morning, noon, night and weekends.And because the data is so groundbreaking, we are cranking fast, in our regulatory group and clinical group and medical writing group. We are working hard to get this to patients because it -- quite frankly, it's the right thing to do for patients.Yes, it's good for the company, but it's the right thing to get this regimen out to patients pretty darn fast. Now, as far as combinations with biologics like PD-1s, absolutely, we're excited about that, and we previously presented data showing a really dramatic impact of combining a PD-1, in this case it was nivolumab, but likely most of the PD-1s, if not all, could be used in combination.And we had data that was really spectacular. We presented it at ASH, and that's the kind of data -- we talked -- we mentioned on the trial that we have a lot of data from trials. We gave you an example of ADCETRIS plus bendamustine with over a 90% ORR and over a 70% CR rate. I mean, very compelling data in a pretty big population of patients.This wasn't like 5 or 10 patients. This is substantive populations. And we have, I think, it's over 80 patients worth of data with ADCETRIS plus PD-1 inhibitors showing very strong activity.And so we mentioned on the call something about how we've been putting together all our data, and that is something of subject that perhaps we could consider talking to regulators about. And to me, when you look ultimately how Hodgkin Lymphoma is treated, this will be treated with an ADCETRIS regimen, AVD upfront; then an ADCETRIS regimen in second line for any patient who goes through, past there and whether it's an ADCETRIS-PD-1 or ADCETRIS-bendamustine or something; and then you go to a third-line, we have single agent ADCETRIS with a very strong activity that was actually our first approval in Hodgkin Lymphoma.And also, the checkpoints are there, which is good. I mean that's an option. If you failed multiple different things, it's great that the checkpoints were approved largely in Frontline after ADCETRIS, but I think that using ADCETRIS in combination regimens in a couple of different lines will make it so that there are so few patients left that aren't well treated and aren't put into complete remission that I think we're going to be changing and we are already starting to change the life history of Hodgkin Lymphoma, and we're focused mainly on Stage III and Stage IV here in the Hodgkin lymphoma frontline.I may add that there's a lot of work going on in using ADCETRIS regimens in the earlier stage, in Stage I and Stage II, and not just in Stage III and Stage IV, and you'll see some of that presented at conferences like the ASH Conference. There was actually one presentation done last year at ASH about data which was spectacular, but didn't have the duration yet because it was too early to see the duration.But you'll see because there's quite a few studies going on using ADCETRIS with earlier stage -- with earlier patients, and not just ADCETRIS-AVD, but ADCETRIS with less letters, so even less chemo. So you have ADCETRIS, and I think that with different chemos, and I'll point you to ASH to start to take a look at that, because we're pretty excited about trying to eliminate letters in earlier-stage patients, especially because a lot of them are kids, they're young people, they're 23 years old, and the less chemotherapy letters they get, the better. And so we're pretty excited about that. -- Okay. Thanks for all that color, Clay. And maybe just one follow-up to one thing you said about use in Stage I and Stage II. Because ABVD traditionally has a very high cure rate in the patient population, what kind of improvement would you think would make doctors feel like it's clinically meaningful? -- Clearly, you are correct. In Stage I and Stage II, ABVD has a pretty good outcome, even better than Stage III and Stage IV. But I will point you to ASH, and it's hard for me, I can't yet talk about specific data. But if you could start getting a significantly less toxic approach and you could get a very high CR rate, and try to get even approaching 100% CR rate, get every patient into CR, and use less chemotherapy, that's a pretty good deal.And so that's what we're trying to do. And I can't give you all the data now, I apologize, but ASH is not that far in the distance. -- Okay. Thanks, Clay.And thank you. Our next question will come from Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. -- Hey, guys. This is Sean, on for Cory. Thanks for taking my question. Just curious, in the current center practice, how common is CD30 testing done for PTCL patients? And do you anticipate the need for testing to be a hurdle in terms of adoption?And then given that ADCETRIS is already on treatment guidelines for PTCL, do you guys have a sense of what sort of sales are already being generated for this indication and how that might actually affect the speed of the ramp once officially approved? Thank you. -- Okay. I heard the first and the third question, and the middle one I'm going to have to ask someone for. So, the first one, maybe I'll just turn the second one over. Is it your question Darren? -- Well, I thought I heard testing and then treatment. -- Yeah. -- So, I think, yeah, so the testing for PTCL and, quite frankly, most lymphomas, there is a CD30 test run. And so for PTCL in particular, we do think that depending on what the FDA label indicates, we do anticipate though that physicians will test for CD30.We have engaged with pathologists, quite frankly, since approval, around educating around CD30 and now that there was a treatment for ADCETRIS. And so we'll continue those initiatives, and where we are able to continue to educate pathologists that there's now a treatment, an indication for PTCL, also physicians, and make sure that the tests, the diagnoses, the report back to the physician all indicates what the diagnosis is and should ADCETRIS be part of the patient's therapy. -- Yeah, it was -- and I might add on the testing. This is very commonly done. This is standard at clinical centers across the globe, that CD30 is one of the few just key tests that are done to look at potential lymphomas and determine if they're Hodgkin, if they're non-Hodgkin, if they're T-cell, B-cell, other things.The other thing is, we -- this happened, we were looking at this in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. So it's just a guidance to think about. And so we obviously screen patients in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, whereas in Hodgkin lymphoma, it's on everybody.In cutaneous T-cell lymphomas, it's on a high percentage, but not everybody, and we screen them, and our label says CD30 expressing, which allows doctors to use their own center, CD30 screening, in deciding whether they have it or not. So I don't know what's going to be an E-2 label and it may be the same, but it may not, but that's what it says in CTCL, CD30-expressing.The second question -- -- PTCL, I think you said existing guideline and do we think we're seeing some use now? We don't break down the use, but I think some physicians, over the past, but I think for this frontline setting for peripheral T-cell lymphoma we'll be, when we get the label, we all will be promoting to. -- Yeah. I would just say on the sales now, I think you asked about, are there sales now in PTCL, and we don't think there are. When we put out the E-1 top line data, we didn't see sales until the off-label set, until our data was presented at ASH.And so I think that's really the time where we may see some, because doctors don't like to respond. I mean, the top-line data is more of a -- it's material, it goes out to investors in Wall Street, but doctors don't really look at the top-line data too much. They'd like to see the full data set.And so, that's where I think that your question could come into play after ASH, but right now, we don't think so. -- Okay. Perfect. Thanks, guys.All right. Thank you. Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham with Barclays. -- Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. Clay, I joined the call late so sorry if this has been asked. But on the E-1 impact, what do you think is a tipping point in the community setting? I guess, I'm thinking about the lessons that you've learned and new prescribers that are higher volume, could you implement that more broadly? And then I have a follow-up on E-2. -- We are out there and, yeah, we did get quite a few questions early on, as you can imagine. We are out there in force talking to docs, talking about our North American data. We have great data, there is no doubt, and we feel that we are getting docs to convert to this from their 40-year regimen of ABVD that they're just so used to. And you're out in the community, and a lot of the docs see a few Hodgkin Lymphoma patients a year, and it's not uncommon at all.And bringing ADCETRIS and frontline together into their mindset, and like I said that will be when you have E-2 approval at some point based on our groundbreaking data.The more we could bring ADCETRIS into frontline and the more doctors could think ADCETRIS connected is with frontline, it will help, because I think we're not facing something where we have sketchy data at all. Our data is very strong. It's really just a matter of getting out there, getting into the mindset, and getting docs to think about ADCETRIS and frontline and, yes, we had the early adopters.It's really the hard work now we're doing on these other docs that just they're busy, these docs are busy, they're treating patients with different diseases, they don't get up in the morning and think about ADCETRIS, they think about their patients and doing what's right in their patients.And we just got to get out there and get the North American data out there, talk to them, and we feel very good about the future. It's just, it's a little bit of the hard work beginning now. -- Okay. And then you characterized, prior to the E-1 rollout, just the differences between the academia and the community setting, maybe just help us with this same view, updated view for PTCL. It seems like obviously the ECHELON-2 pitch will be easier either way in the back of OS and unmet need, but I just want to get a better context for the practice setting. -- Sure. I could start this, and maybe Darren has some color for it. But PTCL is a little bit different. T-cell lymphoma is slightly harder to diagnose than Hodgkin lymphoma. Hodgkin lymphoma has the Reed-Sternberg cells and the big ugly cells, every doctor could see them really quickly.And over the years, some T-cell lymphoma has been diagnosed initially as B-cell lymphoma, and then they realized, wait a minute, this is different. But having a specific drug for frontline T-cell lymphoma will certainly cause doctors to take a close look at this.There's nothing like having a drug to treat a disease that changes practice. And so what I think is going to happen is we're going to see a little bit more in the academic setting, just because of sometimes the community says; hey, can you help us, tell us what this is because we're not sure it's B-cell lymphoma. And so sometimes they get help from academics.So I think, as opposed to Hodgkin, we'll see a little bit more there. But on the same token, the academic docs, they really know that this is a bigger unmet medical need. So I think it's not the identical dynamics. I hope that helps.And Darren, do you have any more color? -- Yeah. Geoff, I think Clay hit the nail on the head. Tougher diagnosis, typically treated historically in the academic setting. When we think about execution around our sales force and getting the messages out upon approval, when we expanded after the E-1 results, we had E-2 in mind, so we will have overlap on our call points with our physicians. And we're excited, I mean this is a great opportunity for us to get this information to those physicians, and ultimately I do think there'll be comfort, now that you have the E-1 results and the ECHELON-2 result, of docs in the community feeling confident they can diagnose the frontline PTCL patient, they've got a great regimen in ADCETRIS plus CHP, so you could see some gravitation back to the community both for diagnosis and treatment versus historical norms. -- Got you. Okay. Thanks, guys.Thank you. Our next question comes from Andy Hsieh with William Blair & Company. -- Hi. Thanks for taking my question and squeezing me in. So I have one for Darren, I think you talked about adding about 150 new accounts during the first quarter, and so in terms of the dynamics this quarter are -- for the growth, are you seeing it mostly from return customers, are the growth generated by new accounts? Just wondering if you can break that down for us. -- Yeah. We continue to see new accounts added, Andy, over time, predominantly in the community. And we see the split now. If you look at treatment, it's about 60% community, 40% academic. So we continue to make inroads, as we've talked about during the call. And again, we're starting to, as we get the North American data out, get to every specific or potential community physician out there and find patients. -- And just a follow-up on that. Am I correct in assuming academic doctors are usually high volume, whereas community is basically, the strategy there is to really detail across a large number of physicians because they're low volumes? Is that correct way to think about Hodgkin lymphoma? -- Well, I think if you think about diagnosis, about 70% of all frontline Stage III and Stage IV are diagnosed in the community. So unlike other relapse where most of them, when we launched seven years ago were in the academic center, yeah, I mean our focus is not only the academics which we've been focused on for many years, but in the community.And that's where we need to continue to promote the North American data, and again, just a reminder, this is -- there's 3 or 4 patients typically that community oncologists see per year. So we need to be in there continually to educate them around the data.And then when a patient comes in, they're ready to treat. -- Got it. And just one quick question on EV. In terms of the frontline, this planned trial EV in combination with Keytruda, are you looking at the PD-L1 positive population in UC? -- So, first of all, thank you very much for the EV question. As a company, while we get mainly ADCETRIS questions, we're positioned with both EV and tucatinib data next year. I mean, this is an exciting time for us. The trials being finished and really becoming a multi-drug company, so I appreciate the question on EV.Roger, would you like to comment on the frontline trial? -- Sure. So thanks for the question. So understanding that the landscape around PD-1, PD-L1 has been impacted somewhat by the biomarker based on stuff that's been reported around competitor data, we are taking the approach that in combination we basically take all comers. We obviously need to account for the biomarkers, and there will be measurement, but the focus is on an all-comer approach rather than on a PD-1 selected. -- I see. All right. Maybe last question on TV If I can. I think the plan is to expand into ovarian cancer. So, Clay, would you mind reminding me the expression level among ovarian cancer patients? I think I saw a paper that said about 96%. So I don't know if that's just one single paper, I don't know if that's the consensus across the field. And do you foresee that you would need biomarker testing in a new indication for TV? -- TV -- and I appreciate the question on it. TV is in a registration trial, to hope to get a registration in cervical cancer, and that's our first one. We've also opened up what we call a basket trial and we're going to go further into ovarian cancer, so you are correct. So we're actually looking not just in ovarian, it's actually quite a few solid tumors that have tissue factor expression.And without locking on a specific number, tissue factor is expressed very, very high density in many solid tumors. 96%, I think, might be a little high, but it is quite high. So you're not that far off in ovarian cancer, but I wouldn't be quoted as saying 96%. And histology is kind of a blunt tool, so it doesn't -- one person's histology may say 90%, the other person's may say 96%. I would say it's got very high density, would be what I would say, after 30 years of studying antibody binding into cancer cells.It's very high density in ovarian cancer. And we're really excited about looking at ovarian cancer, but also a few other solid tumors as part of our basket trial as we're calling it. -- Perhaps just to add one comment if I may, is TV is being evaluated independent of any biomarker; it's an old comer approach. -- Okay, cool. Thank you very much for answering all my questions.All right. Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Peggy Pinkston for closing remarks. -- Okay. Thank you, operator. That's everything for today. Appreciate you joining us.

"nvestors in Seattle Genetics Inc (Symbol: SGEN) saw new options begin trading this week, for the November 16th expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the SGEN options chain for the new November 16th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $80.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.60. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $80.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $76.40 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of SGEN, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $81.48/share today.Because the $80.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 59%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.50% return on the cash commitment, or 32.18% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Seattle Genetics Inc, and highlighting in green where the $80.00 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $85.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.45. If an investor was to purchase shares of SGEN stock at the current price level of $81.48/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $85.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 7.33% if the stock gets called away at the November 16th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if SGEN shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Seattle Genetics Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing SGEN's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $85.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $85.00 strike represents an approximate 4% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the First Trust Health Care AlphaDEX Fund ETF (Symbol: FXH), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $89.20 per unit.With FXH trading at a recent price near $81.02 per unit, that means that analysts see 10.10% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of FXH's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Hill-Rom Holdings, Inc. (Symbol: HRC), Seattle Genetics Inc (Symbol: SGEN), and ABIOMED, Inc. (Symbol: ABMD). Although HRC has traded at a recent price of $88.15/share, the average analyst target is 14.15% higher at $100.62/share. Similarly, SGEN has 13.53% upside from the recent share price of $77.07 if the average analyst target price of $87.50/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting ABMD to reach a target price of $452.14/share, which is 13.32% above the recent price of $399.01. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of HRC, SGEN, and ABMD:Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
  
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past.

"n recent trading, shares of Seattle Genetics Inc (Symbol: SGEN) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $80.90, changing hands for $81.16/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 10 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Seattle Genetics Inc, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $64.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $101.00. The standard deviation is $12.493.But the whole reason to look at the  SGEN price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with SGEN crossing above that average target price of $80.90/share, investors in SGEN have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $80.90 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

" incurred a loss of 43 cents per share in the second quarter of 2018, narrower than the year-ago loss of 48 cents and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 47 cents.Sarepta's Exondys 51, the first duchenne muscular dystrophy (""DMD"") treatment to gain approval in the United States in 2016, continued its strong performance. Sarepta recorded revenues of $73.5 million, up 13.8% sequentially, primarily attributable to increasing demand for Exondys 51. Revenues also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $71.0 million. In the prior-year quarter, Sarepta had earned revenues of $35.0 million.Following the earnings release, shares of Sarepta were up 2.5% in after-hours trading. So far this year, Sarepta's shares have rallied 117.5% against a 3.6% decrease registered by the  .Exondys 51 is currently under review in the EU. In June, the company received a negative CHMP opinion on its marketing approval application, seeking approval of Exondys 51 in Europe. This is likely to delay the approval of the drug in EU. A final decision is expected by year end.DMD is a rare muscular degenerative disease that mostly affects boys and can be fatal before patients turn 30.Research and development (R&D) expenses were $57 million in the second quarter, up 67.2% year over year. The rise was attributable to increased patient enrollment in late-stage studies, higher shared collaboration cost related to utrophin platform and higher costs due to pipeline expansion and ramp-up of manufacturing activities.Selling, general & administrative (SG&A) expenses were $37.3 million, up 54.1% year over year due to higher costs related to commercial expansion.Along with the earnings results, Sarepta announced that it has signed a long-term strategic investment and license and option agreement with AAV-based gene therapy company Lacerta Therapeutics, which can add three gene therapy programs to Sarepta's pipeline. Per the deal, Sarepta has bought exclusive rights to Lacerta's CNS-targeted gene therapy candidate for Pompe Disease. In addition, Sarepta has an option to license up to two new CNS-targeted gene therapy programs of Lacerta. In addition, Sarepta will make an equity investment of $30 million in Lacerta. While Lacerta will be responsible for management of the majority of the pre-clinical activities, Sarepta will take charge of clinical development and commercialization.In 2018, Sarepta expects to record revenues of $295 million to $305 millionSarepta is building its DMD pipeline, which will enhance its approved drug portfolio. The pipeline candidates, upon approval, will be eligible to treat a larger patient population than Exondys 51. The company has about eight exon-skipping pipeline candidates, which can treat 75-80% of DMD patients.Sarepta's most advanced pipeline candidate, golodirsen, demonstrated encouraging results in a mid-stage clinical study evaluating it in DMD patients. The candidate has also shown better efficacy than Exondys 51. Sarepta is planning to file regulatory application seeking golodirsen's approval in the United States by the end of this year with a potential approval in 2019.Apart from exon-skipping candidates, Sarepta is also focusing on developing gene therapies for treating DMD.In June, Sarepta announced promising results from an early-stage study, evaluating its gene therapy as a treatment for patients with DMD.The preliminary data from the first three patients dosed in the phase I/IIa study showed that treatment with the gene therapy, AAVrh74.MHCK7.micro-dystrophin led to a significant increase in dystrophin protein production. Micro-dystrophin is a muscle protein, which is needed for muscles to function properly. The absence of this protein causes DMD. Meanwhile, the data also showed that AAVrh74.MHCK7.micro-dystrophi dramatically reduced creatine kinase levels, a measure of abnormal muscle damage caused by DMD.In July, however, the company said the FDA has placed an early-stage gene therapy program under clinical hold. The hold was placed due to presence of out-of-specification research material supplied by a third party. Sarepta is confident that it can respond to the letter before the end of August.In June, Sarepta also announced that it has entered into a long-term strategic manufacturing partnership with privately-held Brammer Bio for the manufacturing and commercial supply of its potential micro-dystrophin gene therapy and other neuromuscular pipeline products. | Sarepta currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

"n recent trading, shares of Seattle Genetics Inc (Symbol: SGEN) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $74.30, changing hands for $74.64/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 10 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Seattle Genetics Inc, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $55.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $98.00. The standard deviation is $11.294.But the whole reason to look at the  SGEN price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with SGEN crossing above that average target price of $74.30/share, investors in SGEN have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $74.30 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

hares of  went down almost 11% after its newly acquired subsidiary Monsanto was ordered by the California state jury to pay $289 million in damages over alleged links between its Roundup weedkiller and cancer.The lawsuit began when a school groundskeeper, who was diagnosed with terminal cancer, stated that the cause of his cancer was Monsanto's herbicide Roundup. This was just the first verdict amid thousands of cases that claimed that Roundup causes cancer. Jurors in California superior court agreed that the product contributed to the groundskeeper's cancer and the company should have provided a label warning of the potential health hazard.Monsanto stated that Glyphosate, the main ingredient in Roundup was completely safe to use and did not cause cancer. The company added that decades of scientific studies have shown the chemical to be safe for human use.However, there have been debates by the environmentalists, regulators, researchers and lawyers about whether Roundup causes cancer.Monsanto stated that it would appeal against the jury's verdict in California.

However, it marginally beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.7 million.

The stock's performance has been disappointing so far this year. It has declined 83.2% compared with the  's 4.6% decrease.Research and development expenses were down 14.4% year over year to $21.4 million during the quarter mainly due to lower personnel costs and decline in clinical study related expenses.

The biotech company's weakened cash position was due to higher operating expense including costs related to discontinuation of glembatumumab vedotin development, partially offset by net proceeds raised from sales of its common stock under a contract with Cantor.Celldex expects that its cash position as of the end of June plus anticipated net proceeds from future sales of its common stock under the agreement with Cantor will be adequate to fund working capital requirements as well as planned operations through 2020.In April 2018, the company announced the failure of its antibody drug conjugate (""ADC"") candidate, glembatumumab vedotin in phase IIb METRIC study, evaluating it in breast cancer.

" reported second-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings of $1.22 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.21. Earnings growth was flat year over year.Net sales in the reported quarter decreased 4.2% year over year to $1.19 billion, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.23 billion. The decline was mainly due to loss of sales from discontinued products.Perrigo's shares were down 7.1% in  on Thursday presumably as the company lowered its revenue guidance for 2018. The company's shares have declined 10.1% against the  's rally of 11%.Effective Jan 1, 2017, the company's reporting segments are: Consumer Health Care Americas (""CHCA""), Consumer Healthcare International (""CHCI""), Prescription Pharmaceuticals (""RX"") and Other Segment. CHCA net sales in the second quarter of 2018 came in at $597 million, down 1.3% year over year. This downside can be attributed to lower net sales in the animal health business and smoking cessation category. However, strong performance of infant nutrition and cough cold categories partially offset the decline in CHCA net sales. While new product sales of $15 million contributed to the top line, the company lost sales of $4 million from discontinued products. CHCI segment reported net sales of $381 million, up 1.2% from the year-ago period. However, sales declined 4.1% excluding the favorable currency movement. Excluding the exited Russian and unprofitable distribution businesses in 2017, and favorable foreign currency movements of $20 million, net revenues fell 2.2% due to lower sales of anti-parasite, lifestyle and analgesics categories in addition to lost sales from discontinued products of $8 million.However, this was partially offset by new product sales of $20 million and higher net sales in the diagnostics business. This segment's net sales declined 13.2% to $209 million on a reported basis as well as on a constant-currency basis. New product sales of $8 million were more than offset by lower net revenues of existing products primarily due to price erosion. Lost sales due to discontinued products were $5 million. The company also had a shortfall in new product launches during the quarter.Perrigo lowered its full-year revenue guidance and now expects it to be in the range of $4.8-$4.9 billion in 2018 compared with the previous expectation of $5.0-$5.1 billion. This includes the impact of reduced RX segment sales outlook and unfavorable foreign currency movement expectation of $65 millionThe company also reduced its adjusted earnings guidance to the band of $4.75 to $4.95 per share from the previously announced $5.05 to $5.45 per share.In a separate release, Perrigo announced the approval from its board of directors for separation of the RX segment to unlock shareholder value. The company anticipates that divesting the RX segment will allow the segment to better capitalize its differentiated generic pharmaceutical products and help Perrigo to focus on expanding its leading consumer business.In a separate press release, the company announced a new growth strategy for its CHCA segment. The company is looking for non-prescription, over-the-counter (""OTC"") regulatory approvals for prescription drugs. The OTC availability of prescription drugs is likely boost sales of the drugs, driving the company's topline. In August, the company signed its first such agreement with Merck  to gain exclusive rights to pursue regulatory approval of OTC Nasonex nasal spray. | Perrigo currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the biotech sector are Vertex Pharmaceuticals  and Seattle Genetics  .

However, earnings declined from 93 cents recorded in the year-ago quarter.Revenues came in at $714.7 million in the quarter, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $685.05 million. However, the top line was down 18% year over year, primarily due to the loss of marketing exclusivity in the first half of 2017 for the first-to-file ezetimibe tablets, the generic version of Zetia (ezetimibe tablets).Moreover, product discontinuation in the generic pharmaceuticals segment, pricing pressure from increased competition primarily impacting the generics base business, divestiture of Litha and Somar, and the cessation of Opana ER shipments to customers by Sep 1, 2017 accounted for the decline.The results and increase in guidance come as a silver lining for the distressed investors. Endo's stock has gained 109.5% in the year so far as against the  's 1.9% growth.Endo now has four reportable business segments: (1) U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals, (2) U.S. Branded - Specialty & Established Pharmaceuticals, (3) U.S. Branded - Sterile Injectables and (4) International Pharmaceuticals. recorded sales of $241 million in the quarter, down 37% due to the loss of marketing exclusivity for the first-to-file Zetia tablets.

In July 2018, the segment launched colchicine tablets, the authorized generic of Colcrys. sales were down 13% to $212.6 million due to cessation of product shipments of Opana ER in the third-quarter of 2017. Specialty Products revenues increased 9%, driven by strong performance of Xiaflex. Xiaflex sales increased 27% year over year reflecting strong volume growth of the product for the indication of Dupuytren's Contracture and Peyronie's Disease.During the second quarter, Endo advanced its cellulite treatment development program. The company initiated two phase III clinical trials of collagenase clostridium histolyticum (""CCH"") for the treatment of cellulite. Recruitment has been accelerated in both the trials and top-line results from these trials are now expected in the fourth quarter of 2018 (previous projection: first quarter of 2019). sales of $217.8 million was up 21%, driven by strong growth of Adrenalin and Vasostrict. In April, Endo entered into definitive agreements to acquire Somerset Therapeutics, LLC, a specialty pharmaceutical company that develops and markets sterile injectable and ophthalmic drugs for the U.S. market, and the business of its affiliate Wintac Limited, which operates as Somerset Therapeutics' contract developer and manufacturer. The company acquired these businesses for approximately $190 million. The acquisition will be closed by the end of 2018.

The company anticipates earnings from continuing operations in the range of $2.50-$2.60 per share (earlier estimate: $2.15-$2.55).Endo's second-quarter results were driven by continued growth momentum in Xiaflex and sterile injectables. Xiaflex's performance was outstanding, propelled by demand. The increase in annual guidance was impressive as well. The company is in the process of redefining its business, given the persistent decline in the Generic business, which is expected to face challenges.

Sales were driven by a 9% rise in bottle volume growth. The average number of active Xyrem patients increased 7% in the second quarter.After lower-than-expected sales in 2017, Xyrem witnessed improved volume trends in the first half of 2018, supported by the company's disease awareness efforts, which led to increased diagnosis rate of new narcolepsy patients.Erwinaze/Erwinase (acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL]) revenues were $58.7 million, up 20% year over year.Jazz has been facing challenges in building sufficient inventory levels for Erwinaze due to constrained manufacturing capacity. This has resulted in supply disruptions and the company has warned of supply challenges through the rest of the year.Prialt (non-opioid pain) revenues rose almost 58% year over year to $8.92 million. In June, Jazz entered into a definitive agreement to sell Prialt to small drugmaker, TerSera Therapeutics for $80 million in cash upon closing.

Please note that Defitelio product sales vary from quarter to quarter in both in the U.S. and EU markets because Defitelio treats an ultra-rare acute condition -hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD).Vyxeos generated sales of $28.0 million in the United States compared with $26.2 million in the previous quarter. Vyxeos sales were lower than management's expectation due to softer demand in academic centers, which account for majority of the drug's volumes.The acute myeloid leukemia (AML)drug was launched in the United States in August last year. The drug is under accelerated assessment in the EU for the same indication with an approval expected in early September. In June, the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) issued a positive opinion recommending marketing authorization for Vyxeos.Other product sales declined 40.3% to $4.0 million.Adjusted selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses rose 23.6% to $137.7 million due to higher expenses related to business expansion, including costs related to continued launch of Vyxeos in the United States and potential launch of Vyxeos in the EU and its lead pipeline candidate, JZP-110, in the United States.Adjusted research and development (R&D) expenses increased 45.7% to $51.4 million, mainly due to escalated expenses related to the company's pipeline and regulatory activities.Jazz is striving to expand Xyrem's label and has filed a supplemental new drug application (sNDA) for the same to include the pediatric indication. The FDA granted the sNDA a priority review designation in June with a decision expected on Oct 27.JZP-110 is under review in the United States for the treatment of excessive sleepiness (""ES"") in adult patients with narcolepsy or obstructive sleep apnea (""OSA"").A response from the FDA is awaited on Dec 20.Jazz expects to launch the candidate in early 2019. In the EU, Jazz expects to file a regulatory application by the end of this year.Also, the company is conducting a phase II clinical study evaluating JZP-110 for the treatment of excessive sleepiness associated with Parkinson's disease. Top-line results from the study are expected in early 2019.Other than JZP-110, Jazz is also studying JZP-258 (a low sodium formulation and a Xyrem follow-on product) in phase III studies for EDS and cataplexy in narcolepsy patients with a NDA filing expected by 2019. JZP-258 is also being studied for Idiopathic hypersomnia, or IH, for which a phase III study is expected to begin in the second half of 2018.Despite the better-than-expected second-quarter results, Jazz maintained its earnings and sales guidance for 2018. Though the guidance range for Xyrem's sales was slightly raised, the company lowered its full-year expectations from its newest drug, Vyxeos.This probably hurt investor sentiment and sent shares of the company down in after-hours trading.Jazz expects earnings in the range of $12.75-$13.25 per share. Total revenues are expected in the range of $1.88-$1.93 billion.Total product sales are predicted in the range of $1.87-$1.91 billion in 2018.

 reported a loss of 12 cents per share for the second quarter of 2018, narrower than a loss of 13 cents in the year-ago period but wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 11 cents. Quarterly revenues increased 33.3% from the year-ago period to $14.7 million mainly due to higher Qsymia sales and additional sales of recently acquired drug, Pancreaze.So far this year, VIVUS shares have increased 32.5%, while the  witnessed a decrease of 3.5%.The company's weight management drug Qsymia generated net product sales of $11.1 million, up 30.7% from the year-ago period due to increase in shipments of the drug.However, supply and royalty revenues from Stendra/Spedra were down 36.9% to $1.7 million in this quarter.Pancreaze brought in sales of $2.1 million during the quarter. The exocrine pancreatic insufficiency drug was acquired on Jun 8 from Janssen, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson  .Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense was $11.7 million, almost flat year over year. The increase in expense related to acquisition of Pancreaze, debt restructuring and addition of new members to senior leadership team were almost offset by the cost control initiatives for Qsymia.Research and development expense more than doubled to $2 million in the reported quarter on continued development cost of tacrolimus.On Aug 6, the company announced the appointment of Ken Suh as its new president. Previously, he served as president and chief executive officer of Willow Biopharma, a wholly-owned subsidiary of VIVUS.VIVUS' obesity drug, Qsymia, showed strong performance during the quarter as sales grew year over year as well as sequentially. The company's efforts, including realigning its sales force and refining its marketing and promotional programs, had a positive impact on Qsymia sales and also lowered marketing expense. The company's efforts to lower its debt are likely to bring down interest expense. These factors will boost the bottom line, going forward.

The number of potential patients with mature T-cell lymphoma is about the same as frontline Hodgkin lymphoma, but the current treatment isn't particularly good.

Also, the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.58 million. This downside in the quarter was mainly attributable to lower sales of the company's marketed drug, Angiomax, which faces generic competition in the United States.Notably, in January 2018, The Medicines Company completed the sale of its infectious disease business unit to Melinta Therapeutics, an antibiotics company. With this divestiture, the former sold the worldwide rights of Orbactiv, Minocin and Vabomere. This deal was executed for $270 million in upfront consideration and guaranteed payments.

Revenues comprised royalty and license fee revenues received under various non-imetelstat license agreements.Shares were down 5% in  on Aug 1, presumably due to lack of clarity on Janssen's, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson  , decision to pursue imetelstat development. However, so far this year, Geron's shares have significantly outperformed the industry, rising 99.5%, against the  's decline of 4.4%.Research and development (R&D) expenses increased 28% to $3.2 million. The rise was due to variation in costs for the proportionate share of clinical development of imetelstat under collaboration with Janssen. General and administrative (G&A) expenses fell 4.5% to $4.2 million.The company ended the quarter with $181.4 million in cash and investments compared with $103.2 million at the end of the first quarter. The increase in cash was due to $87 million net of proceeds raised through sale of its common stock under At Market Issuance Sales Agreements.Geron's sole pipeline candidate, imetelstat, is being evaluated in two mid-stage studies - IMerge and IMbark - in myelodysplastic syndromes (""MDS"") and myelofibrosis (""MF""), respectively. Geron is conducting the studies in collaboration with J&J.Janssen stopped enrollment in the IMbark study in March. Moreover, during the second quarter, a protocol-specified primary analysis of IMbark was initiated by Janssen. Following the completion of this analysis, Janssen will decide on continued development of imetelstat in this indication. The decision is expected by the end of the third quarter.In December 2017, Geron presented preliminary data from part I of phase II/III IMerge study. Data showed that imetelstat achieved RBC transfusion-independence (RBC-TI - reduced or no requirement of RBC transfusion over a certain interval) in 54% of the patient population, who have not received prior treatment with either lenalidomide or a hypomethylating agent for at least eight weeks. RBC-TI was achieved in 31% of the patients in the above subset for at least 24 weeks.Based on this data, J&J expanded part I of the study and enrolled 25 more patients in a refined MDS indication to confirm the clinical benefit and safety observed earlier. | Geron currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A couple of better-ranked stocks to consider in the biotech sector are Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc.  and Seattle Genetics, Inc.  .

"n recent trading, shares of Seattle Genetics Inc (Symbol: SGEN) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $68.50, changing hands for $70.52/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 10 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Seattle Genetics Inc, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $54.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $80.00. The standard deviation is $9.046.But the whole reason to look at the  SGEN price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with SGEN crossing above that average target price of $68.50/share, investors in SGEN have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $68.50 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Seattle Genetics Inc:

t has been about a month since the last earnings report for  . Shares have added about 13.3% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is SGEN due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Seattle Genetics reported a loss of 61 cents per share for the first quarter of 2018, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 40 cents and the year-ago quarter loss of 42 cents.Revenues came in at $140.6 million, up 28.8% year over year, primarily driven by strong sales of Adcetris. Revenues also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $112.06 million.Seattle Genetics' top line comprises product revenues, collaboration and license agreement revenues and royalties.The company's only marketed product, Adcetris, generated product sales of $95.4 million, up a significant 36% year over year.Collaboration and license agreement revenues increased 35.4% to almost $29.6 million, mainly driven by strong demand for Adcetris in the international market. Collaboration revenues include fees earned from the company's agreement with Japan-based Takeda Pharmaceutical for Adcetris and other ADC collaborations.Royalty revenues decreased 7.7% year over year to $15.7 million due to adoption of the new accounting standards for revenue recognition.Research and development (R&D) expenses were $152.5 million, up 29% year over year, primarily attributable to tucatinib development activities and upfront costs related to technology licensing with Pieris and PharmaMar. Also, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 72.4% to $66.2 million, mainly due to costs related to the acquisition of Cascadian Therapeutics and launch of Adcetris in frontline Hodgkin lymphoma.With the launch of Adcetris in the new indication, the company withdrew its revenue expectation for 2018. Currently, Shire expects second-quarter sales to be in the range of $105 million to $110 million.The company increased its outlook for R&D expense to the range of $530 million to $580 million from $460 million to $500 million. SG&A expense is expected in the range of $220 million to $240 million (previously $200 million to $220 million). The rise in R&D will likely be due to increased investments in development of tisotumab vedotin, ladiratuzumab vedotin and the company's pipeline programs.It turns out, fresh estimates have trended upward during the past month.

"ancer. The mere mention of the word can drudge up discomfort, as most everyone knows it's second only to heart disease when it comes to claiming lives. Unlike heart disease, though, cancer is difficult to prevent and similarly difficult to fight.The battle against the myriad forms of cancer, however, also is an opportunity for investors - namely, in health care stocks.Sales of drugs used to fight the disease are expected to exceed $160 billion by 2021. But because there are so many different types of cancer, that revenue has been and will continue to be widely distributed among the pharmaceutical makers of superior cancer-fighting solutions.Here's a rundown of the market's top cancer-fighting health care stocks. They come in all shapes and sizes. Some are tightly focused - perhaps only making one drug - while some are arguably overly diversified. In all cases, however, a cancer treatment has the potential to be a game-changer - not just for investors, but for cancer patients as well.The past 12 months have been nothing less than miserable for Incyte (  , $70.11) shareholders. Shares have fallen roughly 50% from their July 2017 peak, and the stock's suffered a couple of downgrades just recently. RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams downgraded Incyte in June, for instance, lamenting the lack of near-term revenue clarity.Don't let the stock's poor performance or downgrades mislead you. Incyte has a powerful cancer-fighting drug called Jakafi in its portfolio, and it's growing quite nicely, even if not growing at breakneck speed.Jakafi, in simplest terms, regulates the production of red blood cells in bone marrow. It's a treatment for polycythemia vera, which is the production of too many red blood cells. Yet it's also a treatment for myelofibrosis, which is a form of cancer that prevents enough red blood cells from being made. They're both relatively uncommon forms of cancer, but that has worked to Incyte's advantage because competition is minimal.The numbers speak for themselves. Last quarter, Jakafi's net revenue of $313.7 million was 25% better than the year-ago figure. And the company has only scratched the surface with this drug; Jakafi still is in three more unfinished trials.Bolstering the bullish argument is a pipeline that will not only deepen its oncology bench, but widen its reach to rheumatology, immunology and dermatology markets. All told, Incyte has 17 molecular targets in the hopper, and this year's expected swing to a profit on the back of Jakafi's sales means the company can afford to keep that pipeline moving.Pharmaceutical giant AbbVie (  , $89.95) recently was forced to dish out some disappointing news. Its oncology drug Imbruvica, when combined with ibrutinib as a therapy for large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), didn't perform well enough to continue its trials.Don't read the headline in a vacuum. Imbruvica still is approved in the United States as a treatment for five other forms of blood cancer and has earned the FDA's green light for a total of eight specific ailments. Marc Lichtenfeld, Chief Income Strategist for the Oxford Club, points out that ""AbbVie's Imbruvica is being studied in more than 130 clinical trials,"" which includes some testing as a treatment for solid tumors.Point being, AbbVie's future hardly hinged on that one trial.Imbruvica sales still were up 38.5% year-over-year last quarter, reaching $762 million. Annualized, that's still not close to the peak yearly sales of $7 billion that AbbVie expects the drug to eventually reach once more trials start to pan out.""All that plus a robust pipeline and a 4% dividend yield make AbbVie not only my top cancer stock but my top pick in the healthcare sector,"" Lichtenfeld says.Seattle Genetics (  , $70.52) may be a one-trick pony among cancer stocks, but the cancer-treating platform Adcetris is a pretty solid trick.Adcetris is an antibody-drug conjugate, meaning it attaches to another chemotherapy and then helps guide that drug to specific kinds of cancer cells. In this case, Seattle Genetics is targeting CD30, which is a protein found only on the cell membrane of cancerous cells, and then introducing anti-cancer agent monomethyl auristatin to those diseased cells. The drug has been approved as a means of treating Hodgkin lymphoma as well as several types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.The one-two-punch combination works well enough to drive a 36% increase in sales of the drug during the first quarter of 2018.Seattle Genetics is hardly resting on Adcetris' laurels. Not only is the company working on new uses of Adcetris, but it's also developing other drugs including enfortumab vedotin, tisotumab vedotin, tucatinib and ladiratuzumab vedotin. Don't let the tongue-tying names intimidate you. They're all like Adcetris in that they ""find"" proteins unique to cancerous cells and deliver a cancer-fighting payload to them. The potential of this drug-delivery approach is virtually unlimited.Pharmaceutical outfit Celgene (  , $85.34) does a little of everything, from psoriasis to multiple sclerosis to beta thalassemia, a disorder that prevents a body from producing enough hemoglobin.Its heavy hitter, however, is cancer, on the back of Revlimid.Revlimid is a therapy for myelodysplastic syndrome, multiple myeloma, and mantle cell lymphoma, and it takes a multi-pronged approach at combatting each. Not only does it tweak the immune system and reduce the blood flow to cancerous cells, it helps reprogram myeloma cells to die on their own. The company sold $2.2 billion worth of the drug in the first quarter alone, as Revlimid has proven a potent option. It's by far Celgene's biggest seller.Those who know the Celgene story well will know Revlimid's patent protection is nearing an end (by drug standards, anyway). The end begins in 2022, and the end of the end - assuming it can't extend its patent protection - arrives in 2027. Argus analyst David Toung explained of his downgrade in May, ""While (Celgene's) pipeline assets are promising, their combined potential revenue is not enough to completely replace Revlimid, in our view.""That's still plenty of time for Celgene to develop or acquire something else, as most good biopharma names are always doing. Indeed, the company bought Juno Therapeutics earlier this year to bolster its oncology portfolio. Meanwhile, drug development partnerships with outfits like Acceleron (  ) and Bluebird Bio (  ) look quite promising as potential profit centers.If you think its partnership with Celgene is the only reason Bluebird Bio (  , $178.95) is one of the noteworthy healthcare stocks with a strong cancer bent, think again. While partnerships are a key part of its business strategy and it's looking well beyond oncology drugs, its immuno-oncology program is the one turning heads.Bluebird Bio is building a cancer pipeline largely on the potential of CAR-T, or chimeric antigen receptor T-cells. This essentially is a means of tweaking a patient's own immune system in a way that makes it more capable of fighting cancer for itself. In short, T-cells are genetically altered to find a protein that's unique to cancer cells.Its lead CAR-T drug, bb2121, is being co-developed with Celgene as a treatment for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. Although it's only in phase 1 trials right now, it holds great promise. Last month, an update on that trial indicated patients involved in the test were able to stave off progression of the disease for a median timeframe of 11.8 months.That's only the beginning. The approach could be used to address all sort of cancers and is ready to be tapped by new partners. The company's other pipeline items could help keep it afloat, or attract a suitor. Evercore ISI analyst Josh Schimmer recently lauded the company's commercialization potential of not just bb2121, but also Bluebird's investigational sickle cell disease drug LentiGlobin.Merck & Co. (  , $62.51) may be one of the world's most, if not the most, prolific healthcare stocks. It has been around forever and does a little bit of everything.That diversity can be a two-edged sword. It takes the rough edges off the inherently volatile results of pharmaceutical sales, but it dampens the positive impact of a true blockbuster drug.It's a double-edged sword, but one that doesn't appear to be cutting Merck this time around. Its Keytruda has proven revolutionary ... despite almost being dumped back in 2009 as a prospect not even worth developing. By a subtle stroke of luck, the drug's cultivation got just enough funding. The rest, as they say, is history. Keytruda is the company's best-selling drug, driving nearly $1.5 billion worth of revenue during the first quarter. That was 142% better than the year-earlier tally, with that sales explosion reflecting incredible efficacy and a string of new approved uses.Citi analyst Andrew Baum raised the bar on Keytruda last year, writing, ""Merck's success with Keytruda has clearly outperformed our initial expectations which were based on Merck's historic absence as a major oncology player."" That optimism was underscored by Baum's much-improved peak annual sales outlook for the oncology drug, from $9 billion to $16 billion.With a name like Clovis Oncology (  , $47.04), it's difficult to argue it's worthy of a spot on a list of cancer stocks. But the merits of Clovis' portfolio - regardless of the company's moniker - would have earned a spot on the list anyway.Like Seattle Genetics, Clovis is currently a one-trick pony ... but what a pony! Its rucaparib is a polymerase (PARP) 1, 2 and 3 and inhibitor in trials as a narrowly focused treatment for ovarian cancer as well as prostate cancer. Both arenas are competitive, but neither disease has a proverbial show-stopper that oncologists regard as a one-stop solution. The drug also is in trials as a treatment for breast, gastroesophageal, pancreatic, lung and bladder cancers.In the meantime, the drug is driving some revenue. Rucaparib generated $18.5 million in sales during the first quarter as a third-line therapy for BRCA-mutant ovarian cancer, up from a top line of $7 million in the comparable quarter a year earlier.That particular usage of the drug points to a nuanced but important detail about Clovis Oncology: It's not trying to save the world from all types of cancer. It's taking a low-risk, low-cost approach to developing drugs that address relatively narrow categories of cancer, where it can dominate a niche market.By picking battles it knows it has good odds of winning, Clovis is serving investors better in the long run.Most investors likely haven't heard of Tesaro (  , $40.23), and most investors probably haven't heard of Zejula. Both are worthy of a closer look.The latter is a cancer drug made by the latter. And the $49 million in first-quarter sales is a great start for the newly approved ovarian cancer therapy. Zejula was only given the FDA's green light early last year.The presence of PARP in healthy cells can be a good thing, as it causes broken or damaged DNA to repair itself. PARP, however, also can cause cancerous cells to repair their DNA, allowing the disease to continue spreading. Zejula is an inhibitor of certain kinds of PARP, aiming at cancerous cells' DNA. If that errant DNA can't be repaired, that cell is programmed to die on its own, thus ridding the body of the diseased cell (and preventing it from replicating).Tesaro has been and will continue to lose money for the foreseeable future. But this year's expected sales growth of more than 35% followed by next year's projected top-line growth of more than 50% may be more than enough to draw a bullish crowd.The company continues to develop a promising pipeline. Niraparib, for instance, is in several anti-cancer trials. Tesaro believes niraparib's annual revenue could reach $5 billion, once all of its potential applications are confirmed and approved.Empliciti, Yervoy and Sprycel are all cancer drugs made by Bristol-Myers Squibb (  , $56.54). Its leading oncology treatment and best-selling drug, however, is a much more familiar name: Opdivo. Its $1.5 billion in first-quarter revenues was up 34% from Q1 2017's tally and accounted for nearly 29% of overall sales.Both numbers (Opdivo's total sales and its importance to Bristol-Myers) still are growing.Opdivo is another immunology drug. It works by inducing a patient's own cancer-fighting T cells to recognize and then attack diseased cells by inhibiting the activity of a protein called PD-1. The presence of this particular protein can ""trick"" the immune system into thinking a cancerous cell is a normal, healthy cell that can be ignored, so by suppressing PD-1's function a patient's immune system can effectively fight the disease on its own.So far the drug is approved to treat several forms of melanoma, lung cancer and carcinoma, as well as certain Hodgkin lymphoma cases, but new indications are being approved on a regular basis.It's also long-lasting. In March, for instance, Opdivo was given the FDA's green light as the only PD-1 inhibitor that can be administered as infrequently as once every four weeks, underscoring its efficacy.Last but not least among the top healthcare stocks that would make for good cancer plays, AstraZeneca (  , $37.03) hasn't historically been a name that comes to mind.But this isn't your father's AstraZeneca.The cancer road taken by relatively new CEO Pascal Soriot hasn't been easy. Last July, AZN shares plunged after a ballyhooed lung cancer trial didn't drive the hoped-for results, calling into question the company's new and sweeping oncology ambitions. But cancer research is a hit-or-miss business, and it only takes one or two hits to turn a normal biopharma company into an oncology powerhouse.Tagrisso, a recently approved first-line lung cancer treatment, may well be that kind of drug for AstraZeneca. The company had been suggesting potential annual sales on the order of $3 billion, but some analysts see much more in store. UBS analyst Jack Scannell recently wrote, ""It has relatively low incremental selling costs given Astra's other lung cancer products, use in a very well defined patient population, and low competitive intensity plus good efficacy and tolerability among eligible patients,"" leading Scannell to estimate peak annual sales of $5.8 billion.AstraZeneca's pipeline isn't too shabby either. Lynparza - co-developed with Merck and approved for some second-line cases of ovarian cancer, also shows strong results as a first-option therapy. Meanwhile, its moxetumomab pasudotox is showing promise as a first-line treatment for certain leukaemias (HCL) in its phase 3 trial.It's not always been pretty, but AstraZeneca us undeniably back in the oncology game, and ranks among the market's most compelling cancer stocks.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@10 Cancer-Fighting Health Care Stocks to Buy@2018-07-20@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/10-cancer-fighting-health-care-stocks-buy-2018-07-20
"nvestors in Seattle Genetics Inc (Symbol: SGEN) saw new options become available this week, for the March 2019 expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 233 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the SGEN options chain for the new March 2019 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $70.00 strike price has a current bid of $7.40. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $70.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $62.60 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of SGEN, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $71.19/share today.Because the $70.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 60%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of SGEN stock at the current price level of $71.19/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $75.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 15.47% if the stock gets called away at the March 2019 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if SGEN shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Seattle Genetics Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing SGEN's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $75.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $75.00 strike represents an approximate 5% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

taging a turnaround, the biotech sector registered a rise in the past month after coping with a difficult preceding year. In the recent past, the sector witnessed some encouraging news in the form of positive data read outs on key pipeline drugs as well as favorable regulatory updates.The biotech  has gained 3.5% in the past month, outperforming the S& P 500 index's gain of 1.9%.The industry, however, declined 1.8% in the period from January to mid-June.Particularly, the positive data read out from Biogen's  mid-stage Alzheimer's study on BAN2401, added an impetus to the stock. Data from the study showed that BAN2401 led to a statistically significant slowdown in disease progression and reduction of amyloid beta accumulation in the brain. The positive results gave investors much reason to cheer for as Alzheimer's Disease (AD) has always been a challenging market given the spate of study failures of late. So, the outcomes are deemed an important breakthrough by Biogen and Eisai in the AD market, thus raising hopes for a possible cure.Further, the biotech sector also gained a boost when Celgene Corporation  and its partner Acceleron Pharma Inc. (XLRN) reported positive findings from a second randomized, double-blind, multi-center clinical phase III study, BELIEVE, on pipeline candidate luspatercept. The results show that luspatercept achieved a highly statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint of erythroid response as compared to placebo.Generally, it is widely expected that the biotech/drug sector will rebound as the year progresses. We believe that successful innovation, strong clinical study results, frequent FDA nods, growing demand for drugs especially for rare-to-treat diseases, an aging population and increased health care spending are a few key factors that should keep the sector on track. A faster drug approval process and the proposed removal of outdated regulations that escalate costs and slow down innovation should also provide benefits.Importantly, mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity is ramping up with the tax reform in place. The new tax law, which cuts corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and encourages companies to bring back huge cash held overseas at a one-time tax rate of 10%, is spurring merger activity this year.Taking these factors into account, we can easily consider some stocks to be added to investors' portfolio from the biotech industry. We will thus highlight four biotech stocks, worth picking with a bullish Zacks Rank #1(Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a share price surge over the past month.You can see This Foster City, CA-based company has a Zacks Rank #2. Theearningsper share estimates have been revised upward from $6.10 to $6.12 for 2018 and from $6.34 to $6.36 for 2019 over the past 30 days. In the past month, the stock has grown 7.8%.This New York-based company carries a Zacks Rank of 2. Theloss per share estimates have been narrowed from $11.43 to $11.15 for 2018 and from $8.17 to $7.79 for 2019 over the past 30 days. In the past month, the stock has rallied 13.9%.The Bothell, WA-based company is a Zacks #2 Ranked stock and its share price has climbed 5.9% in the past month.This Zacks Rank #1 player has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings per share moving north to 20 cents from 18 cents and from 77 cents to 80 cents for next year over the past 30 days. The stock has gained 10.6% in the past month.Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge. With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.

" (NASDAQ: SGEN) posted solid revenue gains in the first quarter of the year, but it was guidance for the second quarter that had investors excited about how the biotech's lead drug, Adcetris, is finally reaching its potential.Data source: Seattle Genetics.Image source: Getty Images.Clay Siegall, Seattle Genetics' president and CEO, pointed out the challenges of converting doctors from using adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD) to using Adcetris plus AVD in the Echelon-1 setting: ""Doctors have been using ABVD for a long time -- over four decades. And so they don't all just on day one change and say OK, we're just going to drop everything. That's not the way docs work.""But, Siegall added, the newly diagnosed Hodgkin lymphoma patients tend to be younger and more likely to do research on their own, which could help convert stogy doctors, ""We really heard that from our salespeople that patients come in and say, hey, I am diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma. I read about this. What about this? And they talk about the options.""On the potential to become profitable, Siegall noted that Seattle Genetics could be profitable now if it wasn't funding late-stage trials for its other drugs, but he thinks ""it doesn't feel like it's the right time to pull off the gas pedal and make being profitable our top priority even though we want to be profitable at the earliest possible time.""Seattle Genetics pulled back  , which wasn't unexpected since the old guidance didn't take into account the Adcetris approval for newly diagnosed patients. Rather than issue new guidance for the year, management elected to go quarter by quarter for now, which seems reasonable given the uncertainty of the new Adcertis launch. For the second quarter, management thinks Adcetris sales will fall in the range of $105 million to $110 million, which would be roaring 10% to 15% quarter-over-quarter growth.On the clinical trial front, Seattle Genetics is expecting data this year from the Echelon-2 trial in newly diagnosed patients with peripheral T-cell lymphomas, potentially allowing for further expansion of the diseases Adcetris is approved to treat. A little further down the line, the pivotal trial for enfortumab vedotin in patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who have failed other treatments is expected to complete enrolment in the third quarter and readout in the first half of 2019, setting up a potential late 2019 or early 2020 approval.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

 (NASDAQ: SGEN) is up 9.5% as of 11:27 a.m. EDT today after releasing first quarter earnings after the bell yesterday and offering up strong second-quarter guidance.Sales of Seattle Genetics' only drug, Adcetris, jumped 36% year over year to $95.4 million. Royalties, which are primarily from sales of Adcetris outside the U.S. and Canada by its global partner Takeda, came in at $15.7 million, down a little compared to the year-ago quarter, but that was just due to the new accounting standards for revenue recognition.Adcetris sales growth in the U.S. is coming from an expanded approval in late March for use of Adcetris in newly diagnosed patients with Hodgkin lymphoma based on data from the  . The drug had been approved for use later in the treatment paradigm for Hodgkin lymphoma patients, but an approval for earlier use results in more potential patients.The year-over-year growth also benefited from an FDA approval last November for patients with two subtypes of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). Some CTCL patients were already getting the drug off-label, but management still noted that it's adding some additional sales.Management wasn't willing to give new 2018 guidance, which seems reasonable given the expanded approval, but did give guidance for Adcetris sales in the second quarter of $105 million to $110 million, which would be a solid 11% to 16% growth over the first quarter.Image source: Getty Images.Seattle Genetics just needs to keep firing along, capturing patients in these new indications.The next large potential approval for Adcetris will come from the phase 3 Echelon-2 trial in newly diagnosed patients with peripheral T-cell lymphomas, which is due out sometime this year.And of course, investors will eventually want to see that the company isn't just a one-trick pony.

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the PowerShares PureBeta MSCI USA Portfolio ETF (Symbol: PBUS), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $30.01 per unit.With PBUS trading at a recent price near $27.14 per unit, that means that analysts see 10.59% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of PBUS's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (Symbol: MLM), Seattle Genetics Inc (Symbol: SGEN), and Arista Networks Inc (Symbol: ANET). Although MLM has traded at a recent price of $213.51/share, the average analyst target is 12.76% higher at $240.75/share. Similarly, SGEN has 12.74% upside from the recent share price of $57.33 if the average analyst target price of $64.64/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting ANET to reach a target price of $274.33/share, which is 10.86% above the recent price of $247.47. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of MLM, SGEN, and ANET:Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
  
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments?

Revenues also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $143 million.Shares of Seattle Genetics have surged 33.2% so far this year against the  decline of 1.5%.Seattle Genetics' top line comprises product revenues, collaboration and license agreement revenues and royalties.The company's only marketed product, Adcetris, generated net sales of $122.4 million in the United States and Canada, up 65% year over year. The improved sales of the drug were owing to continued label expansions with increase in patient population.Collaboration and license agreement revenues rose 26.4% to almost $27.2 million, mainly driven by strong demand for Adcetris in the ex U.S. market. Collaboration revenues include $17.0 million as milestone payments achieved under the company's ADC collaborations.Royalty revenues soared 66%year over year to $20.6 million owing to high demand and sales of Adcetris outside the United States and Canada by Takeda.Research and development (R&D) expenses were $122.9 million, up 7.4% year over year, primarily attributable to higher investment across the late-stage and earlier stage pipeline programs of the company.Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 43.2% to $58.3 million, mainly due to costs related to the acquisition of Cascadian Therapeutics and the launch of Adcetris in frontline Hodgkin lymphoma (HL).Propelled by the label expansion of Adcetris in frontline Stage III or IV classical Hodgkin lymphoma, the company increased its revenue expectation for 2018. Currently, Seattle Genetics expects third-quarter sales for Adcetris in the range of $130-$135 million compared with its previous guidance of $105-$110 million.In March, based on positive results from the phase III ECHELON-1 study, the FDA approved Adcetris in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of stage III or IV classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) in patients with no previous treatment history.The company raised its collaborative revenue guidance to $65-$75 million compared with its past projection of $55-$65 million. The increase was due to milestone achievements and other events, occurred in the first half of 2018.The company expects to report data from the ECHELON-2 trial, which is evaluating Adcetris plus CHP compared with the standard of care of CHOP chemotherapy in newly diagnosed peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL), by earliest in the fourth quarter of 2018.

"When it comes to biotech stocks, a company is only as good as its pipeline. No drug can remain profitable forever. Patents expire and (much cheaper) competition arises. New, more effective drugs are developed to treat the same diseases better or with fewer side effects.So for a biotech stock to remain strong in the long term, drug companies need to consistently put out new, cutting-edge therapies. But developing a new drug takes years - that's why the most profitable companies have strong pipelines, or a series of drugs in various stages of development.As important (if not more important) is how novel these new drugs are. If a new drug is developed to treat a disease that is already well-managed by a series of pre-existing therapies, then many will not opt for a new, often more expensive, treatment. And it's usually difficult for investors to know what drugs will fill a need.So here are five biotech stocks with promising pipelines. All of these companies have drugs that should be receiving Food and Drug Administration approval soon and that appear to fill a strong need. What's more, each company on this list has treatments further up the pipeline to follow those that will enter the market soon. (NASDAQ:  ) is a leading biotech company with 16 drugs currently on the market and 38 drugs and biosimilars in development. Of the whopping eleven drugs currently in phase 3 trials, two are close to FDA approval.Aimovig is a treatment for the prevention of episodic migraines. Amgen has submitted Aimovig to the FDA for review. And the FDA has set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA)  Meaning that the FDA aims to complete its approval by this date (unless more information is needed from Amgen).Aimovig is a fully-human monoclonal antibody. Monocolonal antibodies are laboratory created cells designed to attach to specific receptors within the body. Aimovig was specifically designed to block the CGRP receptor - which plays a critical role in migraine activation.Other preventative migraine medications are often stopped due to lack of efficacy or intolerable side effects. Topamax, the top migraine prevention drug currently available has a long list of disruptive  .Aimovig, meanwhile, has shown much  .Blincyto, Amgen's other drug with a PDUFA date (  ), is already on the market. However, Amgen is seeking approval for Blincyto to treat a different type of cancer. Minimal residual disease-positive B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (or MRD positive ALL) does not currently have any treatments specified to treat it specifically. So as early as this week, Amgen could be approved to fill what is  (NASDAQ:  ) creates targeted, specialized cancer therapies and has a pipeline focused on addressing  . Seattle Genetics does this using two unique technologies, ADC and SEA.ADC, or antibody-drug conjugates, technology combines the specificity of monoclonal antibodies with the power of  . Monoclonal antibodies cut down on the widespread cell destruction that happens with many chemotherapies by targeting markers found only on cancer cells. Once the monoclonal antibodies bind to the cancer cells, the cytotoxic agents disrupt cell processes in order to kill the cells.SEA, or sugar-engineered antibody, technology increases the potency of monoclonal antibodies. The SEA technology also helps trigger the body's own immune response. Seattle Genetics' SEA technology is simpler and more cost-effective than previous methods used.Seattle Genetics combines these technologies in order to develop specified treatments. It's next drug, ADCETRIS, has a PDUFA date of May 1, 2018 and treats Hodgkin lymphoma with more specificity than current treatments (cutting down on chemotherapy risk and side effects). (NASDAQ:  ) currently has six cancer products on the market and six more in the pipeline.Rolontis has met targets for stage 3 trials and a final phase 3 study is underway. The company plans to file a biologics license application (BLA) in the  . A BLA is a request for permission to  into interstate commerce.Rolontis is a drug that treats chemotherapy-induced neutropenia, which is a common, dangerous side effect for many cancer treatments. Neutropenia is low levels of white blood cells that make cancer patients more susceptible to infections and less able to fight them when they happen. These infections can kill patients or delay their chemotherapy treatments - making them less effective.Rolontis stimulates the production of white blood cells in the bone marrow of these patients. Spectrum calls the need for Rolontis a ""multibillion dollar worldwide market.""Spectrum has a second drug, Qapzola, also in Stage 3 clinical trials. Quapzola is a treatment for bladder cancer which has thus far shown promising results. (NASDAQ:  ) has multiple drugs in phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical trials. Their pipeline is diversified in terms of disease as well. Gilead has phase 3 trials for drugs that treat HIV/AIDS, liver disease, different cancers and a range of respiratory and autoimmune diseases.Gilead's newest HIV drug, Biktarvy was recently  . Biktarvy is a combination of several antiretroviral drugs which inhibit the replication of HIV within the body  . Biktarvy is a single tablet regimen for the treatment of HIV - a disease that often requires multiple drugs and doses a day to manage.Gilead expects Biktarvy to bring in  in sales this year, and that's just one drug. Gilead has many more in the pipeline. (NASDAQ:  ) is a smaller, more focused biotech company. BioMarin is BioMarin has one drug, Pegvaliase, awaiting FDA approval (with a PDUFA date of  ) and two more in phase 3 clinical trials.Pegvaliase treats Phenylketonuria, a rare genetic disease in which patients lack the enzyme PAH. PAH breaks down the amino acid Phenylalanine, which is in many foods, including chicken, other meat, eggs, dairy, nuts, grains and legumes. Without the ability to break Phe down, it builds up in the blood and causes a variety of physical, behavioral, neurological and mental symptoms. Pegvaliase introduces a substitute for PAH and will treat those who have trouble maintaining their Phe levels through other methods.Many have probably only seen the word Phenylketonuria on Diet Coke bottles. Only 50,000 people under 40 in developed nations are reported Phenylketonurics. Because of this, Pegvaliase has designated  status in the U.S. and E.U. (The FDA gives this designation to drugs which affect fewer than  in the U.S.) Along with this designation comes tax reductions and the exclusive rights to develop the cure for a period of seven years.So yes, the market for Pegvaliase is small but BioMarin has exclusive rights in that market. Pegvaliase was also given priority review designation by the FDA which means that its approval ""will provide a  of the treatment, prevention, or diagnosis of a serious condition.""The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@5 Biotech Stocks With Amazing Pipelines@2018-03-27@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/5-biotech-stocks-amazing-pipelines-2018-03-27
he cancer space saw label expansion of two major drugs this week. Seattle Genetics, Inc.'s  , Adcetris label was expanded to include treatment naive patients with advanced Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL). Novartis'  Tasigna received approval for use in pediatric patients, one year of age or older.Meanwhile, the FDA granted priority review to Pfizer's  regulatory application seeking label expansion of Xtandi to include an early-stage patient population. Roche Holding AG's  PD-L1 inhibitor, Tecentriq, met primary endpoint in a phase III lung cancer combination study. However, AbbVie  announced disappointing results from a mid-stage study evaluating its lung cancer candidate, Rovalpituzumab Tesirine (Rova-T).Let's see the news in details. The FDA approved a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) seeking label expansion of Seattle Genetics' Adcetris in treatment-naive stage III or IV cHL patients. The drug was approved in combination with a chemotherapy regimen, AVD (Adriamycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine), based on statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival data from phase III ECHELON-1 study. The study compared Adcetris combination regimen with the current standard of care. (Read more  ). |  Novartis announced that the FDA has approved a line extension of its leukemia drug, Tasigna, in pediatric patients one year of age or older with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia in the chronic phase. The drug received approval in first- and second-line setting in this patient population. The drug is already available for adults in this indication.The approval was based on data from two studies evaluating Tasigna in patients in the age group of 2 years to 18 years. Data showed that the major molecular response (MMR) rate was 60% and 40.9% in newly diagnosed patients and patients resistant to prior therapy, respectively. |  The FDA granted priority review to a sBLA for Pfizer's prostate cancer drug, Xtandi. Pfizer is looking to include the non-metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer indication in the drug's label. The regulatory status was granted based on data from the phase III PROSPER study. A decision from the FDA is expected in July this year.

The study was evaluating the combo regimen in patients with advanced squamous non-small cell lung cancer. However, the study will be continued as statistically significant overall survival benefit was not achieved.

The study evaluated the candidate in SCLC patients with high expression of the protein DLL3 and who have received at least two previous treatment regimens, including at least one platinum-based regimen.The results did not meet expectations and were not significant enough for the candidate to be prioritized for accelerated approval. However, two phase III studies evaluating Rova-T in first- and second-line settings for the SCLC are ongoing.

"t was a week that saw Protagonist stock crashing on news of discontinuation of a phase IIb study, Amgen's Reptha getting a positive CHMP opinion, Verona Pharma stock rallying on positive top-line data from COPD study and the FDA accepting sBLA for Bristol-Myers' Opdivo. : Shares of Protagonist Therapeutics  plummeted on announcement of the discontinuation of phase IIb study - PROPEL - on its ulcerative colitis (""UC"") candidate, PTG-100. The company decided to discontinue the study as a planned interim analysis of PROPEL study by an independent Data Monitoring Committee determined that the study will not be able to achieve its primary endpoint of clinical remission.The interim analysis was done on data from first 65 patients who had completed the 12-week treatment with PTG-100. The total patient population of the study was 240. The company has notified that it will stop further treatment of patients currently in the study. Protagonist has also postponed its decision to initiate a phase II/III on PTG-100 in patients with chronic pouchitis, as it awaits full review of the interim data from the PROPEL study (Read more:  ) : Amgen  announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (""CHMP"") of the European Medicines Agency (""EMA"") rendered a positive opinion on the company's regulatory application seeking approval to include data from the cardiovascular outcomes study, FOURIER, on the European label of its PCSK9 inhibitor, Repatha.The application seeks for a new indication in the Repatha label for adults with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, stroke or peripheral arterial disease) to reduce cardiovascular risk by lowering LDL-C levels. Concurrently, the CHMP gave a positive opinion for the marketing authorization to Amgen and Allergan's  , ABP 980, a biosimilar of Roche's oncology drug Herceptin.The biosimilar has been recommended for approval for the treatment of the same three types of cancer - HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, HER2-positive early breast cancer and HER2-positive metastatic adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastroesophageal junction.

RPL554, a first-in-class, inhaled, dual inhibitor is being evaluated as a maintenance treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (""COPD""). The study met its primary endpoint as RPL554 demonstrated clinically and statistically significant improvements in lung function at all dose levels.Additionally, secondary endpoints were also met and support the potential clinical benefits of RPL554 for the treatment of COPD. The positive results from the study support the progression of RPL554 into later stage development as an inhaled treatment for COPD patients. Verona Pharma doesn't have any approved product in its portfolio and the successful development and commercialization of the drug will significantly boost results. : The FDA accepted Bristol-Myers Squibb Company's  supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for blockbuster drug Opdivo in combination with Yervoy for the treatment of adults with microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) that has progressed following treatment with a fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan. The agency has also granted the application priority review and set an action date of Jul 10, 2018. The combination is already approved for a variety of oncology indications. : Seattle Genetics, Inc.  and partner Astellas Pharma Inc. announced that the FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to antibody-drug conjugate (""ADC"") enfortumab vedotin, for the treatment of patients suffering from locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who were previously treated with checkpoint inhibitors (""CPI""). The candidate is being studied in a pivotal clinical trial, EV-201 (NCT03219333), as monotherapy in this patient setting and in an early-phase clinical trial in combination with CPI therapy, EV-103 (NCT03288545). Both companies are also evaluating enfortumab vedotin in other solid tumors, including ovarian and non-small cell lung carcinoma. : Biohaven Pharmaceutical Holding Company Ltd. 's  shares plunged significantly despite the company announcing positive top-line results from two phase III trials (BHV3000-301 and BHV3000-302) on migraine candidate rimegepant (formerly known as BHV-3000). Rimegepant is an oral CGRP receptor antagonist which is being evaluated for the acute treatment of migraine. CGRP receptor antagonists represent a novel class of drug candidates for the treatment of migraine.The results were statistically significant and clinically meaningful across multiple outcome measures as the candidate met the co-primary efficacy endpoints of superiority to placebo, at two hours post-dose, on pain freedom and freedom from the most bothersome symptom. The company is on schedule to submit an NDA for rimegepant in 2019. However, the investors were not much impressed with the data when compared to rival Allergan's migraine candidate ubrogepant.The NASDAQ Biotechnology Index lost 4.98% over the last five trading sessions.

Revenues also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $112.06 million.However, Seattle Genetics' shares have lost 8.7% so far this year, compared with the  's decline of 8.3% in the same period.Seattle Genetics' top line comprises product revenues, collaboration and license agreement revenues and royalties.The company's only marketed product, Adcetris, generated product sales of $95.4 million, up a significant 36% year over year.Collaboration and license agreement revenues increased 35.4% to almost $29.6 million, mainly driven by strong demand for Adcetris in the international market. Collaboration revenues include fees earned from the company's agreement with Japan-based Takeda Pharmaceutical for Adcetris and other ADC collaborations.Royalty revenues decreased 7.7% year over year to $15.7 million due to adoption of the new accounting standards for revenue recognition.Research and development (R&D) expenses were $152.5 million, up 29% year over year, primarily attributable to tucatinib development activities and upfront costs related to technology licensing with Pieris and PharmaMar. Also, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 72.4% to $66.2 million, mainly due to costs related to acquisition of Cascadian Therapeutics and launch of Adcetris in frontline Hodgkin lymphoma.With the launch of Adcetris in the new indication, the company withdrew its revenue expectation for 2018. Currently, Shire expects second-quarter sales to be in the range of $105 million to $110 million.The company increased its outlook for R&D expense to the range of $530 million to $580 million from $460 million to $500 million. SG&A expense is expected in the range of $220 million to $240 million (previously $200 million to $220 million). The rise in R&D will likely be due to increased investments in development of tisotumab vedotin, ladiratuzumab vedotin and the company's pipeline programs.During the quarter, label expansion of Adcetris in combination with chemotherapy in patients with previously untreated Stage III or IV classical Hodgkin lymphoma was approved in the United States. In January 2018, the drug was approved for treatment cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in Europe following an approval in the United States in November last year.Moreover, top-line data from the ECHELON-2 study (frontline CD30-expressing mature T-cell lymphoma) should be out in 2018.

" announced that the FDA has approved its supplemental Biologics License Application seeking label expansion of Adcetris to include treatment of treatment-naive stage III or IV classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), in combination with chemotherapy. The decision comes more than one month earlier than expected.The FDA also approved the conversion of accelerated approval of Adcetris to regular approval for treatment of systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (sALCL) in patients who have failed at least one multi-agent chemotherapy regimen therapy.The approvals came on the basis of a head-to-head study, ECHELON-1, of Adcetris plus chemotherapy compared to current standard of care.Seattle Genetics' shares have returned 2.5% so far this year against the  's decline of 0.9% in the period.The phase III ECHELON-1 study evaluated Adcetris in combination with a chemotherapy regimen, AVD (Adriamycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine), against ABVD (Adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine), the current standard of care chemotherapy regimen for treatment of newly diagnosed advanced cHL.Data from the study showed that Adcetris combination therapy achieved statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (""PFS"") compared to ABVD. The combination therapy reduced the risk of progression, death or need for additional anticancer therapy by 23% in patients who did not achieve complete remission.The overall survival (""OS"") rate was favorable for the Adcetris regimen. However, it did not show significant difference. Complete remission was achieved in 73% of the patients treated with Adcetris regimen compared with 70% for ABVD therapy.Per the American Cancer Society, approximately half of 8,500 newly diagnosed patients with Hodgkin lymphoma in the United States will have Stage III/IV disease.Adcetris was already approved in four indications including second or later line treatment for cHL. The drug is the only marketed drug of the company and a major revenue generator. The label expansion will certainly boost its prospects going forward.However, the drug has several competitors including Bristol-Myers Squibb's  Opdivo and Merck's  Keytruda, which are approved for relapsed or refractory cHL. | Seattle Genetics currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Horizon Pharma Public Limited Company  is a better-ranked stock in the pharma sector, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

 month has gone by since the last earnings report for  . Shares have added about 8.4% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is SGEN due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Seattle Genetics reported a loss of 41 cents per share for the fourth quarter of 2017, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of loss of 43 cents but wider than the year-ago quarter loss of 39 cents per share.Revenues came in at $129.6 million, up 23.1% year over year, primarily on the back of strong sales of Adcetris. Revenues also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $112.06 million.Seattle Genetics' top line comprises product revenues, collaboration and license agreement revenues and royalties.The company's only marketed product, Adcetris, generated product sales of $83.7 million, up a significant 18% year over year.Collaboration and license agreement revenues increased 24.5% to almost $25.9 million, mainly driven by strong demand for Adcetris in the international market. Collaboration revenues include fees earned from the company's agreement with Japan-based Takeda Pharmaceutical for Adcetris and other ADC collaborations.Royalty revenues increased almost 46% year over year to $20 million, attributable to higher international sales of Adcetris by Takeda Pharmaceutical Co.Research and development (R&D) expenses were $110.5 million, up 2.1% year over year. Also, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 17.1% to $48.5 million. Costs were high, primarily due to investment in development of Adcetris in other indications.The company provided its outlook for total revenues in the range of $470 million to $505 million. It expects collaboration and license agreement revenues to be in the range of $55 million to $65 million. Royalties are expected in the range of $75 million to $80 million. Net sales of Adcetris are expected in the range of $340 million to $360 million. The company has not included the impact of a potential line extension of the drug in frontline advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma, for which approval is expected in May 2018.The company anticipates R&D expense to be $460 million to $500 million while SG&A expense is expected in the range of $200 million to $220 million. The rise in SG&A will likely be due to the inclusion of expanded commercial activities related to potential line extension of Adcetris.In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimate.

After the company revealed the pricing details of its recently announced common stock offering, shares of  (NASDAQ: PIRS) , a clinical-stage biotech focused on cancer and other diseases, fell 12% as of 11:15 a.m. EST on Wednesday.On Tuesday, Pieris made known its intention to raise capital from a secondary common stock offering. That decision makes sense since the company's share price  after it announced a new collaboration deal with  (NASDAQ: SGEN) . What's more, Pieris' stock  in 2017, so right now seems like a great time to tap shareholders for cash.However, investors learned today that the company succeeded in selling 5.5 million shares to the public, but the $8-per-share price represents a sharp markdown from Tuesday's closing price of $9.45. That hints that Pieris had to offer a discount in order to attract enough interest from the market.Image source: Getty Images.As usual, the underwriters of the deal were granted the option to purchase an additional 825,000 shares at the $8 offering price. In total, this deal could add another $50.5 million to Pieris' bank account before subtracting underwriting discounts and commissions. The deal is expected to close on Feb. 16, 2018.Given the pricing news, it isn't hard to figure out why Pieris' stock took a step back today.While dilution is never fun, it's hard for me to blame Pieris' management team for wanting to pad its balance sheet while it can do so at advantageous prices. When adding this capital raise to the $30 million up-front payment that it just received from Seattle Genetics, Pieris' should have plenty of capital on hand to fund itself for at least several more years. I think that fact provides risk-loving investors with yet another reason to give Pieris' stock a closer look.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

In response to the company's new collaboration deal, shares of  (NASDAQ: PIRS) , a clinical-stage biotech focused on cancer and other diseases, jumped as much as 16% in early morning trading on Friday. As of 12:15 p.m. EST, the stock was up 9%.Pieris Pharmaceuticals stated that it has signed a new collaboration deal with  (NASDAQ: SGEN) , a biotechnology company that is also focused on cancer. The aim of this new partnership is to leverage both companies' expertise and technology to develop new immuno-oncology treatments for solid tumors and blood cancers.This deal provides Pieris with an up-front payment of $30 million and the ability to earn up to $1.2 billion in milestone payments, plus double-digit royalties on any potential product sales.Image source: Getty Images.While the companies will produce multiple compounds together, Seattle Genetics retains the option to select up to three products for further development. What's more, if the companies get to the pivotal-trial stage with a compound, then Pieris has the option to pick one compound and can share in global costs and profits on a 50-50 basis.This deal represents yet another  for Pieris' technology, so it's easy to understand why investors are bidding up shares today.Pieris has a knack for getting deep-pocketed biopharma companies to help fund its growth. Last year, it successfully signed lucrative deals that featured up-front payments with a French pharma company called Servier and pharma giant  . In prior years, the company also earned payments from the likes of  ,  ,  , and Daiichi Sankyo.My ears always perk up when I see a small-cap biotech with an interesting technology that grabs the attention of the industry giants. Today's announcement only enhances my interest in this company's future so I plan to follow Pieris' progress with great interest from here on out.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"fter years of being a one-trick pony with Adcetris,  (NASDAQ: SGEN) is moving toward being a full-fledged oncology company as progress over the last few months shows. Nevertheless, investors need to keep a keen eye on Adcetris since, for the near future, it'll still be the only drug contributing sales.Data source: Seattle Genetics.Image source: Getty Images.There's been a lot of discussion about how doctors will respond to the Echelon-1 data that compared Adcetris in combination with older chemotherapy drugs -- adriamycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine (AVD) -- to the standard of care that includes those three drugs plus bleomycin (AVBD), but Darren Cline, VP of commercial, said market research suggests doctors are receptive to the change given the better efficacy and lack of side effects from bleomycin:Typically patients are treated for fewer cycles in the real-world setting than they are in clinical trials, but Cline pointed out that since this is a potential cure, that trend might not be the case for newly diagnosed advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma patients. He said, ""I think, in this setting with a curative intent that physicians have -- again in these patients, the overall feedback that we've gotten is they intend to use the full regimen to get the results that they saw in the trial, in the ECHELON-1 trial.""Management gave 2018 guidance for revenue, but it's largely useless since it doesn't include the potential for increased sales after an approval for patients with newly diagnosed advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma. Given the moving parts -- some of the newly diagnosed patients will be cured and therefore won't be treated in the later-line settings where Adcetris is approved now -- it might have been smarter to just forgo guidance altogether as  with its pending approval in cystic fibrosis.In addition to the potential approval based on Echelon-1 data, investors can expect data from a second phase 3 trial called Echelon-2 testing Adcetris in patients with mature T-cell lymphoma, which is due out sometime this year, although management wasn't willing to be more specific.At the other end of the pipeline, Seattle Genetics is looking to bring three drugs for multiple myeloma into the clinic: SGN-CD48A, SEA-BCMA, and an antibody-coupled T-cell receptor therapy being developed with Unum Therapeutics.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"arch has been a good month so far for  (NASDAQ: CLDX) shareholders. The stock is up more than 20% this month, including  that stemmed primarily from investor anticipation of the release of pivotal results for glembatumumab vedotin (glemba) in the second quarter.However, to keep things in perspective, this ""spring forward"" for Celldex only resulted in the stock price returning to close to the level at which it started 2018. But those results from the Metric study of glemba will soon be announced. Is Celldex stock about to truly skyrocket?Image source: Getty Images.What we know about glemba is encouraging. In the phase 2 Emerge clinical trial, the fully human monoclonal antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) produced impressive results. Glemba matched up well against investigators' choice drugs, which included several leading chemotherapies used in treating breast cancer, in treating all patients.However, the big news was that patients with triple-negative breast cancer -- where cells test negative for estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, and HER2 -- and high expressions of glycoprotein NMB (gpNMB) who received glemba experienced significantly higher median overall survival and progression-free survival rates. In particular, patients with 25% or more of cancer cells expressing gpNMB did especially better by taking glemba.Based on these phase 2 results, Celldex designed its pivotal Metric clinical study to target only patients with triple-negative breast cancer meeting the 25% gpNMB threshold. In the Metric study, glemba is going head-to-head against  's Xeloda, one of the most powerful chemotherapies available for treating breast cancer.We also know that glemba is built on a good foundation. For ADCs, the linker between the antibody and anti-cancer toxin is critical. A stable linker improves the safety profile of the drug and helps ensure that more of the anti-cancer payload is delivered to the cancer cell. Celldex licensed the linker and toxin used in glemba from  (NASDAQ: SGEN) . Similar linker and toxin technology is used in Seattle Genetics' Adcetris.There's also no question that a huge unmet need exists in treating triple-negative breast cancer. While some forms of breast cancer, particularly HER+ breast cancer, have very effective therapies available, that's not the case with triple-negative breast cancer. Current chemotherapies are highly toxic and have limited effectiveness in controlling disease progression.The problem for investors considering buying the stock of a clinical-stage biotech like Celldex, however, is that there's a lot that remains unknown. Good results from a smaller clinical trial don't always translate to good results in a larger study.Celldex experienced this firsthand with its former lead candidate Rintega. Despite positive phase 2 results, the cancer immunotherapy  after failing to increase overall survival.Although the Emerge study for glemba included 124 patients, the impressive results for the drug came from only 10 patients with triple-negative breast cancer and high gpNMB expression. And the comparisons were against multiple therapies chosen by investigators. The Metric study enrolled 327 patients, two-thirds of whom received glemba with the other third receiving Xeloda. It's entirely possible that glemba doesn't perform nearly as well in a larger study against this single established therapy.There's also another scenario for failure. Even if glemba proves to be more successful from an efficacy standpoint, safety issues in the Metric study could derail the drug's chances for regulatory approval. Using Seattle Genetics' linker and toxin technology employed with Adcetris should reduce the likelihood of safety issues, but there's no guarantee.So will Celldex Therapeutics skyrocket soon? Maybe, but maybe not.I think that the market is pricing in a failure for the Metric study. Why? If glemba is successful, the drug should be able to generate peak annual sales of $500 million or more based on the number of patients with triple-negative breast cancer and the unmet need. However, even after the stock's nice run in March, Celldex's market cap is only around $400 million.The probability of success from a pivotal study of a cancer drug is a little over 40%, according to an analysis published by the Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO). The chances of a cancer drug in a pivotal study ultimately winning regulatory approval are only 33%. Statistically speaking, the odds are against glemba.However, let's look at things in a different way. If glemba proves to be successful, Celldex should be able to claim a market cap of $2 billion or more. (This assumes four times peak annual sales of around $500 million.) Using a 33% probability of winning approval from the BIO study, Celldex should be valued close to $660 million -- but it isn't. Instead, the stock is trading well below that level.Could glemba's prospects be better than the historical probabilities from the BIO analysis? I think so. Celldex is stacking the deck a little by only targeting patients with 25% or higher gpNMB expression levels. The Seattle Genetics linker and toxin could also improve its odds somewhat compared to the broader group of experimental cancer drugs in the BIO report.Still, though, buying a stock like Celldex is a gamble. You definitely wouldn't want to bet the ranch on the biotech. Glemba could follow in Rintega's footsteps. On the other hand, this stock could easily double or more in 2018 if the Metric results are positive. With Celldex's valuation reflecting a discount to where it probably should be trading from a probabilistic perspective, I think betting a few cows from the ranch might not be a bad idea at all.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Seattle Genetics also announced its intention to acquire Cascadian Therapeutics for about $614 million. Meanwhile, earnings results were in focus with AbbVie reporting a strong quarter and providing an upbeat outlook for 2018. Companies like Celgene, AbbVie, Biogen and Vertex reported fourth quarter results over the last five trading sessions. Celgene (Read more:  ) and Vertex topped earnings as well as revenue estimates while Biogen topped revenues but missed on earnings (Read more:  ). Vertex also announced that it has selected two next-generation correctors, VX-659 and VX-445, to move into late-stage development as part of two different triple combination regimens for people with cystic fibrosis (""CF""). Over the last one year, Vertex's shares are up 93.5% compared to the 6.8% gain recorded by the  it belongs to.AbbVie's shares jumped following the release of better-than-expected fourth quarter 2017 results and an upbeat outlook for 2018. Results were driven by the performance of Humira, Imbruvica and Mavyret (Read more:  ). AbbVie is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock - you can see  . Belgium-based biopharma company Ablynx has agreed to be acquired by French pharma giant, Sanofi, at a price of €45 per share in cash, or approximately €3.9 billion. The announcement comes just a few weeks after Novo Nordisk had announced its interest in acquiring Ablynx in a deal valued at approximately €2.6 billion. Ablynx had rejected Novo Nordisk's offer with the company's Board saying that the proposal fundamentally undervalued Ablynx and its growth prospects.A look at Ablynx's pipeline shows that the company could well be in a position to launch its first product, caplacizumab (anti-vWF; acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura - aTTP), this year. Caplacizumab is currently under review in the EU while a regulatory application will be filed in the United States in the first half of 2018. The estimated annual market opportunity for aTTP, a life-threatening blood clotting disease, is expected to be about €1.2 billion.The company also has a broad range of partnerships with the potential to generate more than €10.6 billion in milestones plus royalties. Other pipeline candidates also address significant market opportunities. The company has more than 45 programs in its pipeline and eight Nanobodies in clinical development. The acquisition is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2018 (Read more:  ). Bellicum Pharmaceuticals's shares are down almost 30% following the company's announcement that the FDA has placed a clinical hold on U.S. studies being conducted on BPX-501. The hold was placed after three cases of encephalopathy were deemed as possibly connected to BPX-501. The company said that the cases were complex with certain factors like prior failed transplants, prior history of immunodeficiency, concurrent infection, and administration of rimiducid in combination with other medications.Bellicum is now waiting to receive a formal notice from the FDA as to the steps needed to be taken for the resumption of the studies. The clinical hold will not impact an ongoing registration study in Europe. Seattle Genetics announced that it will be acquiring Cascadian Therapeutics for $10 per share in cash, or about $614 million. With this acquisition, slated to close in the first quarter of 2018, Seattle will be adding tucatinib to its pipeline. Tucatinib is an investigational oral, small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (""TKI"") that is highly selective for HER2, a growth factor receptor that is overexpressed in several cancers, including breast, colorectal, ovarian and gastric. The candidate is currently in a pivotal phase II program for HER2+ metastatic breast cancer and complements Seattle's existing pipeline.Join us on Facebook: Zacks  is under common control with affiliated entities (including a broker-dealer and an investment adviser), which may engage in transactions involving the foregoing securities for the clients of such affiliates.Media ContactZacks 800-767-3771 ext. 9339Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

"iotech stocks can enjoy solid gains for lots of reasons. Acquisitions activity, pipeline progress, rivals' problems, regulatory approvals, and even a good old  are several factors that can light a fire beneath a biotech stock. For three biotech stocks, the fires burned really hot over the last week. (NASDAQ: CASC) ,  (NASDAQ: GERN) , and  (NASDAQ: MDGL) ranked as three of the best-performing biotech stocks this week. Here's what sent the stocks soaring -- and whether any of these biotech stocks are good picks for investors now.Image source: Getty Images.Cascadian Therapeutics was by far the biggest biotech winner of the week. Its  more than 90% after the company announced that  (NASDAQ: SGEN) is buying it for $614 million.Seattle Genetics liked what it saw in Cascadian's lead candidate, tucatinib. Cascadian is evaluating the tyrosine kinase inhibitor in a pivotal phase 2 clinical study for treatment of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. Seattle Genetics CEO Clay Siegall said that he thinks ""there may be opportunities for tucatinib in other tumor types, such as HER2-positive metastatic colorectal cancer."" In addition to tucatinib, Cascadian has a checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) inhibitor in pre-clinical testing.The acquisition by Seattle Genetics was unexpected. However, Cascadian stock had risen more than 50% in January before the announcement of the deal. Seattle Genetics plans to commence a tender offer for shares of Cascadian on Feb. 8. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of this year.Geron stock jumped close to 25% this week. But Geron didn't announce an acquisition as Cascadian did. The biotech didn't report a clinical update, either. In fact, the last press release from Geron was on Dec. 12. So what was the catalyst driving Geron stock higher?I suspect my colleague George Budwell hit the nail on the head  . Geron's lead candidate is imetelstat, which is licensed to  (NYSE: JNJ) . In October, Geron stated in its quarterly regulatory filing that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration requested additional efficacy and safety data for imetelstat. That news caused Geron stock to fall -- and for short-sellers to pounce on the stock.However, J&J's latest pipeline update from Jan. 23 still shows that the big pharma company plans to file for approval for imetelstat for treating myelofibrosis in the not-too-distant future. It's likely that short-sellers rushed to cover their short positions, leading to a short squeeze that sent Geron stock higher this week.Madrigal Pharmaceuticals stock gained over 20% this week. The stock received a boost from Madrigal's announcement on Jan. 30 that it would present phase 2 results for MGL-3196 at the International Liver Congress meeting in France on April 13.The announcement from Madrigal didn't provide any additional results from the phase 2 study that the company hasn't already reported. However, investors are very excited about the potential for MGL-3196 in treating non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Madrigal's announcement reminded them of just how effective the drug could be. The company also noted that results from 36-week endpoints should be available in the second quarter of 2018.NASH presents a huge potential market. There are currently no FDA-approved treatments for the liver disease. Great expectations for MGL-3196, based on earlier reports of positive results in the phase 2 NASH study, have caused Madrigal stock to explode, rising more than 800% in just the past six months.Are any of these hot biotech stocks smart picks for investors after this week's big gains?The answer is a definite ""no"" for Cascadian Therapeutics. With the Seattle Genetics acquisition unlikely to be derailed, there's no reason to expect any significant movement in Cascadian stock's price now.What about Geron? Assuming a short squeeze is truly under way, the stock could go higher. And if imetelstat wins FDA approval, Geron should be a big winner. However, Geron remains a very speculative play. I don't recommend buying it at this point, but Geron is a small biotech stock to watch.Madrigal is also still a risky stock. However, I think the risk-reward proposition continues to be favorable for the biotech. Thanks to its huge run over the past six months, Madrigal's market cap now stands around $2 billion. But if MGL-3196 delivers on its potential, Madrigal should be worth considerably more. In my view, there are probably quite a few big drugmakers that are  .

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the Vanguard Large-Cap ETF (Symbol: VV), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $136.59 per unit.With VV trading at a recent price near $123.69 per unit, that means that analysts see 10.43% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of VV's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are LogMeIn Inc (Symbol: LOGM), Wabtec Corp (Symbol: WAB), and Seattle Genetics Inc (Symbol: SGEN). Although LOGM has traded at a recent price of $121.60/share, the average analyst target is 21.30% higher at $147.50/share. Similarly, WAB has 20.95% upside from the recent share price of $72.84 if the average analyst target price of $88.10/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting SGEN to reach a target price of $64.00/share, which is 17.99% above the recent price of $54.24. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of LOGM, WAB, and SGEN:Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
  
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Implied VV Analyst Target Price: $137@2018-02-07@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/implied-vv-analyst-target-price-137-2018-02-07

nvestors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and  may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Seattle Genetics is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings - with the most up-to-date information possible - is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for SGEN in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at a loss of 40 cents per share for SGEN, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 44 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for SGEN, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +8.06% heading into earnings season. | A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more  ).Given that SGEN has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Seattle Genetics, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over.

he U.S. stock market has bounced back from a two-day shellacking with shares of Boeing (  ) and upbeat U.S. economic data driving the Dow Jones Industrial Average up by more than 100 points.And while healthcare shares continue to lose ground after Tuesday's announcement by JP Morgan (  ), Amazon (  ) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) to form a joint healthcare company and President Donald Trump's pledge to lower drug prices, losses have been offset by solid gains in industrial, financial and technology shares.Wall Street's major averages were gaining ground in premarket trade on Tuesday night's State of the Union address in which the president called on Congress to approve at least $1.5 trillion in infrastructure spending, and made assurances to orchestrate U.S.-friendly trade deals.Gains accelerated after Boeing crushed Wall Street's expectations thanks to a lower tax rate and stellar deliveries of its 737 aircraft, and private payrolls increased to a significantly higher-than-expected 234,000 in January.The Dow surged to a 250-point gain at the open, but scaled back by 100 points as investors nervously eyed the meteoric rise in the yield of the 10-year Treasury note -- which set a near 4-year high of 2.739% at the open -- and the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee statement at 2pm ET.

 reported a loss of 41 cents per share for the fourth quarter of 2017, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 43 cents but wider than the year-ago quarter loss of 39 cents per share.Revenues came in at $129.6 million, up 23.1% year over year, primarily on the back of strong sales of Adcetris. Revenues also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $112.06 million.However, Seattle Genetics' shares have lost 11.8% in the past year compared with the  's decline of 0.7% in the same period.Seattle Genetics' top line comprises product revenues, collaboration and license agreement revenues and royalties.The company's only marketed product, Adcetris, generated product sales of $83.7 million, up a significant 18% year over year.Collaboration and license agreement revenues increased 24.5% to almost $25.9 million, mainly driven by strong demand for Adcetris in the international market. Collaboration revenues include fees earned from the company's agreement with Japan-based Takeda Pharmaceutical for Adcetris and other ADC collaborations.Royalty revenues increased almost 46% year over year to $20 million, attributable to higher international sales of Adcetris by Takeda Pharmaceutical Co.Research and development (R&D) expenses were $110.5 million, up 2.1% year over year. Also, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 17.1% to $48.5 million. Costs were high, primarily due to investment in development of Adcetris in other indications.The company provided its outlook for total revenues in the range of $470 million to $505 million. It expects collaboration and license agreement revenues to be in the range of $55 million to $65 million. The royalties are expected in the range of $75 million to $80 million. Net sales of Adcetris are expected in the range of $340 million to $360 million. The company has not included the impact of a potential line extension of the drug in frontline advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma, for which approval is expected in May 2018.The company anticipates R&D expense to be $460 million to $500 million while SG&A expense is expected in the range of $200 million to $220 million. The rise in SG&A will likely be due to the inclusion of expanded commercial activities related to potential line extension of Adcetris.Seattle Genetics continues to work on expanding Adcetris' label further through three phase III studies.In November 2017, the FDA approved the expansion of Adcetris' label to include cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. In January 2018, the drugwas also approved in similar indication in Europe. Moreover, the FDA has granted priority review for a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) seeking approval to include frontline advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma in its label. The sBLA was filed based on data from phase III study, ECHELON-1, which showed that Adcetris achieved statistically significant improvement in modified progression-free survival. A decision is expected in May 2018.Moreover, top-line data from the ECHELON-2 study (frontline CD30-expressing mature T-cell lymphoma) should be out in 2018. A separate study is also evaluating Adcetris in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb's  Opdivo in relapsed/refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma.In addition, the company is evaluating enfortumab vedotin in a pivotal phase II study in patients with metastatic urothelial cancer patients. Moreover, in November 2017, Seattle Genetics and Astellas Pharma initiated a phase Ib study to evaluate the candidate in combination with CPI therapies, including Merck's  Keytruda (pembrolizumab), in patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer, in first- or second-line setting. The companies are planning to initiate a phase III study in 2018.Seattle Genetics and Germany-based Genmab are planning to initiate three phase II studies to evaluate tisotumab vedotin in recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer, metastatic cervical cancer in treatment-naïve women and in a range of other solid tumor types.The company is evaluating another pipeline candidate, polatuzumab vedotin, in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The study is being conducted in collaboration with Genentech, a member of Roche Holding AG  .In a bid to boost its pipeline, the company entered into a definitive merger agreement last month to acquire Cascadian Therapeutics for $614 million. The acquisition will add pivotal-stage HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer candidate, tucatinib, to its pipeline.The company's fourth-quarter loss was narrower than estimated and sales also beat expectations. Given the positive developments for Adcetris, investors should focus on updates of its label expansion. Approval for the Hodgkin lymphoma indication his year will boost sales further. Data from clinical studies from other pipeline candidates are also expected during the year. | Seattle Genetics carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see  .In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017  portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

The stock has lost 9.8% against an increase of 9.6% for the broader industry.Adcetris has been performing well since the beginning of 2017, which prompted the company to raise the guidance for the drug's sales in the year. Moreover, the prospect of the drug received a boost with line extension in primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (pcALCL) and CD30-expressing mycosis fungoides (""MF"") in November 2017.Moreover, the collaboration with Takeda Pharmaceutical for global development and commercialization of Adcetris is also encouraging as Seattle Genetics earns royalty payments and is entitled to milestone payments of up to $165 million.In June 2017, the company announced encouraging data from a phase III study, ECHELON-1, evaluating Adcetris in front-line classical Hodgkin lymphoma. Data from the study showed that Adcetris achieved statistically significant improvement in modified progression free survival versus standard of care. A supplemental Biologics License Application was submitted to the FDA based on this data in November 2017.Another phase III study, ECHELON-2, is evaluating the drug in front-line CD30-expressing mature T-cell lymphoma. Data is expected from the study this year.Apart from Adcetris, the company has six ADC candidates and one novel immuno-oncology candidate, which are being evaluated in early to mid-stage studies. A phase Ib study is evaluating pipeline candidate, enfortumab vedotin, in combination with Bristol-Myers'  Opdivo and Roche Holding AG's  Tecentriq.However, dependence on a single product is a concern for the company. Any decline in sales or unfavorable response in label expansion studies will affect the stock.Moreover, label expansion of Merck & Co., Inc.'s  Keytruda in the lymphoma indication in March 2017 has increased competition for Adcetris.Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

Shares of development-stage biopharma  (NASDAQ: CASC) soared more than 73% Wednesday after the company announced it was being acquired by  (NASDAQ: SGEN) . The move is a bit of a surprise. After all, the tiny biopharma was valued at just $300 million on Tuesday.But while the acquisition is great news for the relatively unknown Cascadian Therapeutics, Wall Street isn't exactly signaling that it approves of the deal: Seattle Genetics shares are down about 6.5%. The reasons for disappointment are understandable after considering the bigger picture.As of 2:05 p.m. EST, Cascadian Therapeutics stock had settled to a 70.6% gain, while Seattle Genetics shares were down 5.9%.Image source: Getty Images.The $614 million buyout provides Seattle Genetics with the tiny biopharma's lead drug candidate, tucatinib, an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor being investigated in a phase 2 trial as a potential treatment for HER2 breast cancers. While the market is a bit crowded for that specific indication (  's Herceptin is one of the best-selling drugs of all-time but is threatened by the encroachment of biosimilars), tucatinib is viewed as a potentially best-in-class oral therapy. It will soon be investigated as a treatment in other HER2 cancers.What's not to like about the deal? Well, Seattle Genetics  from  for $2 billion last year, which would have given the company a potential blockbuster treatment for lung and breast cancer. It turned into quite a mess with the company's founder and CEO being pushed out in the end. Separately, the company also jettisoned its lead drug candidate after preliminary analysis of phase 3 data revealed unacceptable patient deaths.Essentially, after an awful 2017 there's a lot of pressure on Seattle Genetics to make a big move to bolster its pipeline. Wall Street doesn't think the acquisition of relatively unknown Cascadian Therapeutics goes far enough to alleviate concerns about the company's pipeline.Whether or not the acquisition was a move of desperation on the part of Seattle Genetics, the $614 million deal could pay off handsomely if tucatinib delivers on its lofty potential. It's still too early to say, given the drug is only in phase 2 trials, but expectations are high. There are several important data readouts expected in 2018, so investors could get answers soon.As for Cascadian Therapeutics investors, congratulations, you'll receive $10 per share the deal closes.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average was propped up by strong earnings from airplane maker Boeing (  ) while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite also turned around late in the session.Markets were jolted after the Fed kept rates on hold as widely expected, but raised expectations on inflation for this year, prompting a jump in US bond yields. Still, the positive tone was regained late in the session, and the markets closed out January in the green.For the month, the Dow was up 5.8%, the S&P 500 gained 5.7% and the Nasdaq jumped 7.4% as investors cheered strong company earnings and tax reform approved by lawmakers late last month.In Janet Yellen's final meeting as Federal Open Market Committee chair, the target range on the benchmark rate was held at 1.25% to 1.5%. But the Fed said it sees inflation moving up this year and signaled that ""further gradual"" increases in the rate will be warranted.RBC's Tom Porcelli said this might be a sign the FOMC is considering four hikes this year instead of the three currently projected. Higher interest rates can dent stock markets as investors have less money to spend and businesses pay more to borrow.Equities ended off their peaks of the day, but still above water. The Dow performed the best as Boeing reported a surge in revenue for 2017 and a record number of commercial airplane deliveries while offering guidance for this year that would see both figures increase further. The stock ended 5% higher.The focus will likely be back on earnings on Thursday, with Apple (  ), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), DowDuPont (  ) all on the calendar.

"all Street thinks that the clinical-stage biotech  (NASDAQ: CLDX) could be a top-performing stock this year. The average 12-month price target on the stock, after all, implies a noteworthy 260% upside potential from current levels.Why are some analysts so excited about this small-cap biotech stock? The big ticket item, if you will, is the upcoming top-line data readout for the company's experimental breast cancer drug,  , or ""glemba"" for short. The heart of the matter is that a successful trial result here has the potential to transform Celldex into a cash flow positive operation within a few short years.Image source: Getty Images.As clinical trials are inherently risky endeavors, however, investors need to carefully weigh the benefits of a positive outcome in this trial, versus the downside risk that would come with a failure. So, with this binary outcome in mind, let's consider Celldex's chances of breaking out in 2018.Celldex's glemba belongs to a class of targeted therapies known as  , or ADCs. The core concept is that ADCs link a cytotoxic payload to an antibody that targets specific cell surface proteins that are overexpressed in cancer cells.In this case, glemba is indicated for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients whose tumor cells make a transmembrane protein called glycoprotein NMB (GPNMB). When present, GPNMB is associated with higher rates of metastases across a number of solid tumors including TNBC -- leading to demonstrably lower periods of disease-free and overall survival.Turning to the numbers, the American Cancer Society estimates that approximately 15% to 20% of all breast cancer cases are triple negative -- patients where estrogen, progesterone, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 are not overexpressed (aka ""TNBC""). Of these TNBC cases, Celldex has stated that around 40% of these patients also overexpress GPNMB, making them potential beneficiaries of glemba. There are currently no FDA-approved therapies for this particular TNBC sub-group, after all.What these facts and figures really boil down to is that glemba has the very real potential of generating upwards of half a billion in peak annual sales for this niche indication -- even if it's only prescribed as a later-line therapy.How is such a monstrous sales figure even possible for a niche cancer drug? It all comes down to price.  and  (NASDAQOTH: RHHBY) , for example, have been pricing their FDA-approved ADCs in the range of $100,000 to $120,000 per patient per year. Celldex, therefore, would likely follow suit with glemba if the drug pans out -- especially since glemba may be only suitable for, say, 3,000 to 4,000 TNBC patients in total for its first indication.Glemba's pivotal Phase 2b trial is on track to readout by the middle of this year. The study's primary endpoint is glemba's ability to extend progress-free survival (PFS), compared to patients receiving Roche's Xelodea.The good news is that PFS has historically been an easier hurdle to overcome than overall survival in oncology trials. The bad news is that Xelodea has been shown to be a fairly potent drug in TNBC in general. So, glemba isn't exactly being pitted against a straw man in this trial. And this fact is probably why Celldex's shares are still trading under $3 less than five months from this major clinical readout.Will Celldex prevail and surge to new heights? Unfortunately, there is no reliable way to handicap glemba's chances of success in TNBC, but an interesting trend has been developing for Celldex's short interest over the past few months. Namely, short-sellers have been steadily shying away from Celldex since last May: data by Although short-interest is in no way a good predictor of a given clinical outcome, this negative trend does suggest that at least some of Wall Street's most savvy investors think that glemba has a realistic shot in TNBC.From a pure risk-to-reward standpoint, Celldex is arguably an intriguing, albeit speculative, buy during the early part of 2018. If glemba fails, the company does have other  that should keep its shares from becoming worthless. So it might be worthwhile to take a chance on this speculative biotech in light of its eye-popping upside potential. That said, this stock isn't for the faint of heart, as a clinical setback could take years to recover from.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

 and partner Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, announced that the European Commission has extended the current conditional marketing authorization for an expanded indication for its lymphoma drug Adcetris (brentuximab vedotin). The marketing authorization is extended for the treatment of adult patients with CD30-positive cutaneous T-cell lymphoma after at least one prior systemic therapy.The decision was based on the positive opinion issued by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use on Nov 9, 2017.We note that Adcetris is the only marketed product at Seattle Genetics. The drug is approved for relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma and relapsed systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma, and for patients suffering from classical Hodgkin lymphoma, who are at high risk of relapse or progression as post-autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT) consolidation.Over a year, shares of Seattle Genetics have declined 8.6% as against the  's gain of 5.8%.The marketing aurthorization is mainly based on positive data from the phase III trial, ALCANZA study in patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL).Interestingly, the ALCANZA study achieved both the primary and secondary endpoints. The study showed that CTCL patients treated with Adcetris had superior outcomes across all primary and secondary endpoints compared with patients in the control arm, who were treated with either methotrexate or bexarotene standard of care agents.The marketing authorization for Adcetris is valid in 28 countries of the European Union.In November 2017, the FDA has approved Adcetris for the treatment of primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma and CD30-expressing mycosis fungoides that have received prior systemic therapy. The approval was was based on positive data from the phase III trial, ALCANZA and two phase II investigator-sponsored trials in patients CTCL.The label expansion is expected to boost the sales of the drug further. Evidently, sales of the drug in the third quarter grew 13% year over year to $79.2 million.Furthermore, Seattle Genetics is developing the drug in more than 70 clinical studies with key studies including evaluation of T-cell lymphomas and Hodgkin lymphoma. Another phase III study is also evaluating Adcetris in frontline mature T-cell lymphomas. Again, the drug is being studied in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company's  Opdivo in relapsed/refractory Hodgkin lymphoma.However, Adcetris faces competition from other drugs that include Merck & Co., Inc.'s  Keytruda, which is also approved for the lymphoma indication. | Seattle Genetics carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock from the health care space is Exelixis, Inc.  , carriying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).You can see Exelixis' earnings per share estimates have moved up from 72 cents to 73 cents for 2018 in the last 60 days.

"nvestors in Seattle Genetics Inc (Symbol: SGEN) saw new options begin trading this week, for the February 2018 expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the SGEN options chain for the new February 2018 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $50.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.25. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $50.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $47.75 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of SGEN, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $52.16/share today.Because the $50.00 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 63%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of SGEN stock at the current price level of $52.16/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $55.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 9.57% if the stock gets called away at the February 2018 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if SGEN shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Seattle Genetics Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing SGEN's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $55.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $55.00 strike represents an approximate 5% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

 (NASDAQ: SGEN) is down 5.9% as of this writing, having been down as much as 10.5% Monday following a weekend of presentations at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) meeting.The biotech has issued four press releases containing data from the meeting so far today, including a midmorning release, which might be helping reverse the weak opening.Two of the data reports over the weekend probably aren't moving the stock. One was five-year survival data from a phase 1 trial testing Adcetris in newly diagnosed patients with mature T-cell lymphoma. The trial only had 26 patients, and there were no progression events or deaths in the trial since the three-year follow-up was reported. Essentially that's the best investors could hope for.The other non-event came from updated data from the phase 3 ALCANZA trial testing Adcetris in patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). The data from the trial was originally presented at ASH last year and has already been submitted to the FDA to expand Adcetris' label. The extra data shouldn't affect its approvability, which appeared likely based on the initial data presentation.Image source: Getty Images.What appears to be driving shares lower is the presentation of the phase 3 ECHELON-1 trial in newly diagnosed patients with advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma. Investors already knew  , with Adcetris plus older chemotherapy drugs -- adriamycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine (AVD) -- working better than the control, AVD plus bleomycin (ABVD).The full data presented at ASH were also published in the  They showed that while Adcetris+AVD passed its primary endpoint, increasing modified progression-free survival -- defined as progression, death, or patients getting an additional anticancer therapy because they didn't have a complete response -- compared to the control treatment, Adcetris+AVD wasn't positive on a couple of key secondary endpoints, although they were trending in the right direction. Adcetris+AVD reduced the risk of death by 28%, but that wasn't statistically significant. The complete response rate was 73% versus 70% for patients treated with the control drug, and the objective response rate was also only slightly better at 86% for Adcetris+AVD compared to 83% for the control.Bleomycin is pretty toxic, so doctors would be happy to swap it out for something that works only slightly better with less toxicity. Unfortunately, while Adcetris+AVD had less pulmonary toxicity than ABVD, Adcetris causes problems with lowering white blood cells, which led to more infections. Seattle Genetics has some data showing treatments with drugs that boost the immune system can counteract that, so the toxicities for Adcetris+AVD may be more manageable than AVBD, but it isn't going to be a cakewalk for Seattle Genetics to get doctors to change their current standard practice.The conversion of newly diagnosed Hodgkin lymphoma patients to Adcetris+AVD may not matter much in the long term because Seattle Genetics and  (NYSE: BMY) presented data today from a phase 1/2 trial showing that Adcetris plus Bristol-Myers' Opdivo produced an 83% objective response rate with a 62% complete response rate. The companies are testing the combination in the phase 3 CHECKMATE 812 trial, which is in relapsed patients, but if it works there, the companies would presumably test it in newly diagnosed patients, potentially replacing Adcetris+AVD.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

 announced today that the FDA has accepted for filing a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for the label expansion of its lymphoma drugAdcetris (brentuximab vedotin) and granted priority review. The sBLA is filed for Adcetris in combination with chemotherapy for the frontline treatment of patients with advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma. The FDA also set an action date of May 1, 2018.Generally, a priority review designation from the FDA is granted to drugs that have potential to provide significant improvements in the safety and effectiveness of treatment, prevention or diagnosis of a serious disease.Adcetris is the only marketed product at Seattle Genetics. The drug is approved for relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma and relapsed systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (sALCL), and for those suffering from classical Hodgkin lymphoma, who are at high risk of relapse or progression as post-autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT) consolidation.In 2017, shares of Seattle Genetics have increased 5.9% compared with the  's gain of 4.9%.The submission of the sBLA is based on positive results from a phase II study called ECHELON-1. In June 2017, the company had announced positive top-line data from the ECHELON-1 study, which demonstrated that Adcetris achieved improvement in modified progression-free survival of statistical significance compared to standard of care chemotherapy. In fact, the ECHELON-1 study evaluated Adcetris in addition to Adriamycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine in patients with advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma with no prior treatment.In November, the FDA approved an expanded indication for this lymphoma drug. Seattle Geneticsannounced that the FDA has approved Adcetris for the treatment of primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (pcALCL) and CD30-expressing mycosis fungoides (MF) that have received prior systemic therapy. Notably, the approval was received a month before the action date set by the FDA (Dec 16, 2017).Furthermore, Seattle Genetics is developing Adcetris in more than 70 clinical studies with the key studies including evaluation in T-cell lymphomas and Hodgkin lymphoma. Another phase III study is also evaluating Adcetris in frontline mature T-cell lymphomas. This drug is being studied in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company's  Opdivo in relapsed/refractory Hodgkin lymphoma as well.However, Adcetris faces competition from the other drugs that include Merck & Co., Inc.'s  Keytruda, which was approved for the lymphoma indication in March 2017. | Seattle Genetics carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked health care stock is Sucampo Pharmaceuticals  carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

" ' (NASDAQ: SGEN) deal to license  '  (NASDAQ: IMMU) sacituzumab govitecan, a breast cancer drug, was  earlier this year when activist investor venBio Select Advisors, LLC objected, claiming Immunomedics' board of directors was ""giving away its crown jewel.""Losing out on its opportunity to market sacituzumab govitecan is especially disappointing to Seattle Genetics, following positive mid-stage trial results that sent Immunomedics shares soaring recently. However, Seattle Genetics won't miss out entirely if sacituzumab govitecan is a success. That's because it still owns a lot of Immunomedics stock that it acquired before its licensing deal fell apart.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Sacituzumab govitecan is an anti-TROP-2 antibody that can  , including breast cancer, lung cancer, and colorectal cancers, all of which overexpress the TROP-2 protein.Immunomedics' evaluation of sacituzumab govitecan is furthest along in advanced triple-negative breast cancer, a tough-to-treat indication with limited treatment options. Triple-negative breast cancer represents 15% of breast cancer cases, and the National Cancer Institute says there are 246,660 new cases of breast cancer diagnosed annually in the U.S., resulting in 40,450 deaths per year.According to a new central review of Immunomedics'  , sacituzumab govitecan could offer newfound hope to pretreated breast cancer patients. In trials, the objective response rate to sacituzumab govitecan was 31% or about double the historical rate for the standard of care in these patients. The median duration of response was 9.1 months, which is also a substantial improvement from what we've seen historically in this indication.Given the big need for new treatment options for these patients and the positive trial results, Immunomedics plans to file for an accelerated FDA approval early next year for sacituzumab govitecan's use as a third-line treatment.Investors flocked to Immunomedics on the news, causing shares in the company to soar, but Immunomedics investors aren't the only ones who are cheering the company's success.When Seattle Genetics tried to license the drug, it acquired 3 million shares of Immunomedics at $4.90 per share. It also secured three-year warrants allowing it to acquire an additional 8,655,804 shares at $4.90 each.On Dec. 5, Seattle Genetics  that it forked out $42.4 million to fully execute those warrants, increasing its stake in Immunomedics to 11,655,804 shares, or 7.3% of the company, and making it the second largest owner of Immunomedics behind venBio.Seattle Genetics hasn't said if it will sell its shares and record a big gain or hold on to them. If they sell, it will certainly provide a nice boost to Seattle Genetics' cash position, but it's not like the company has to sell its shares.Unlike Immunomedics, Seattle Genetics is already a commercial-stage company. It markets the lymphoma drug Adcetris, which is FDA approved for treating Hodgkin lymphoma patients whose disease has progressed after autologous stem-cell transplant or after two prior chemotherapy treatments, if ineligible for transplant.Adcetris is also used to treat patients with systemic anaplastic large-cell lymphoma whose disease has progressed after one prior chemotherapy treatment, and in November, the FDA approved it for use in primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma and CD30-expressing mycosis fungoides.The company is  at the American Society of Hematology conference this weekend that may lend support to the thinking that Adcetris will win FDA approval next year for use as a front-line drug in Hodgkin lymphoma patients, too.Adcetris' growing addressable market and six-figure price tag have turned it into a nine-figure drug, and a front-line approval could put it on a path to blockbuster status. That gives Seattle Genetics a little financial wiggle room to consider holding on to its Immunomedics stake.It might want to keep its shares, given that industry watchers have rosy expectations for sacituzumab govitecan. Last year, Immunomedics commissioned an independent analysis of sacituzumab govitecan's market potential, and that study estimates it could produce $3 billion in annual sales in 2025, if it gets approvals in triple-negative breast cancer, urothelial cancer, and lung cancer.Sacituzumab govitecan's opportunity is intriguing, but there's no guarantee that it will win FDA approval and go on to achieve that lofty sales target, so there's still enough risk associated with owning Immunomedics shares that Seattle Genetics might decide to sell. Regardless of what it decides to do with its shares, Seattle Genetics appears to be in an enviable position because of them.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

After  (NASDAQ: IMMU) shared some positive clinical data with investors, shares of the clinical-stage biotech focused on cancer rose 17% as of 3:10 p.m. EST on Wednesday.Immunomedics announced data from a phase 2 study that tested its lead compound sacituzumab govitecan as a potential treatment for metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC). Data from the 110 patient study showed that sacituzumab govitecan elicited an objective response rate of 31%, with a median duration of response of 9.1 months. That's much better than the 10% to 15% response rate that current standard-of-care therapies provide.Here's what Immunomedics'  CEO Michael Pehl had to say about the data:CEO Pehl later went on to say that the company will use this data to seek an accelerated approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The company plans to submit this data for regulatory review starting in the first quarter of 2018.Given the news, it is easy to understand why shares are flying high today.Image source: Getty Images.Today's news likely serves as some vindication to venBio Select Advisor, which is an activist investment firm that pressured Immunomedics to terminate its licensing deal with  (NASDAQ: SGEN) earlier this year. venBio felt that the deal undervalued sacituzumab govitecan as an asset, which is quite a statement considering that the original deal provided Immunomedics with a  upfront payment and the ability to earn $1.7 billion in milestone payments.With this strong data in hand and a former  executive in the corner office, the future is certainly looking up for Immunomedics' shareholders.

ales of  's (NASDAQ: SGEN) Adcetris in the U.S. and Canada jumped 13% year over year in the third quarter, but it's still a relatively small seller for a cancer drug, especially considering that Adcetris has been on the market for six years.

The FDA is scheduled to make a decision about the approval of Adcetris to treat cutaneous T-cell lymphoma on or before Dec. 16.

 (NASDAQ: SGEN) Adcetris is already a successful drug with global sales of about $600 million, but sales could climb even higher if the Food and Drug Administration approves its use in frontline Hodgkin's lymphoma. The company recently filed for a label expansion in that indication, and it will unveil comprehensive data from the pivotal study supporting its application soon. If the data is positive, it could add confidence that the FDA will give it a green light. Is now a good time to buy this biotech stock in portfolios?The opportunity associated with an approval in frontline Hodgkin lymphoma is big, so investors should pay attention when Seattle Genetics trial investigators explain their findings at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) conference on Dec. 10.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.If the data is solid, then an eventual FDA approval could mark the first significant change to frontline advanced Hodgkin lymphoma treatment in nearly forty years. Currently, treatment consists of four chemotherapies, including bleomycin, which can cause life-threatening lung damage.We don't have all the study data yet, but the data we've seen so far is encouraging. Replacing bleomycin with Adcetris reduced the risk of worsening cancer, death, or need for additional cancer treatment by 23%, and it improved disease-free survival by about 5% at the two-year mark. As long as the full data set doesn't raise any concerns, this top-line data suggests Adcetris could eventually become part of the standard-of-care regimen in stage 3 and 4 patients.An approval in the frontline setting could significantly boost Adcetris' addressable patient pool because it's only currently approved for use in advanced Hodgkin's lymphoma patients who are refractory or relapsing following other treatments. Overall, there are about 62,000 new cases of Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosed per year globally and roughly 30% don't respond to initial treatment or they relapse within the first two years.The financial tailwind from an approval depends on prescription volume, but because Adcetris is a pricey drug, it may not take a lot of new patients to make an impact. The actual cost per patient will depend on each patient's weight, but estimates are that it will fetch between $100,000 to $120,000 per patient in the frontline setting.Seattle Genetics is already calling on doctors who treat advanced Hodgkin lymphoma patients, so selling it as a frontline therapy should be pretty simple. The FDA hasn't said when a decision could be made and there's no guarantee of an OK, but we should have a better idea of the likelihood of a green light following the ASH presentation.If sales begin to roll in from the frontline indication, it would be welcome news for investors because Seattle Genetics is still losing money. It commercializes Adcetris in the U.S., but it only collects royalties on sales overseas by its collaboration partner,  . Between U.S. sales, collaboration revenue, and royalties, Seattle Genetics brought in $353 million in revenue during the first nine months, but its operating costs for the period total $503 million.Winning approval in the frontline setting could finally put the company in a position to close the gap and get into the black but, again, a lot will depend on what the company says at ASH. The potential for disappointing data makes buying Seattle Genetics right now a bit risky, but given the opportunity and Adcetris' success so far, it might make sense for risk-tolerant growth investors.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The drug is approved for relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma and relapsed systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (sALCL), and for patients suffering from classical Hodgkin lymphoma, who are at high risk of relapse or progression as post-autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT) consolidation.So far this year, shares of Seattle Genetics have increased 9.8% compared with the  's gain of 2.3%.The latest approval was mainly based on positive data from the phase III trial, ALCANZA and two phase II investigator-sponsored trials in patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). Interestingly, the ALCANZA study achieved both the primary and secondary endpoints. The study showed that CTCL patients treated with Adcetris had superior outcomes across all primary and secondary endpoints compared with patients in the control arm, who were treated with either methotrexate or bexarotene standard of care agents.Going forward, the expanded label should further boost the sales of the drug. Evidently, sales of the drug in the third quarter grew 13% year over year to $79.2 million.Furthermore, Seattle Genetics is developing the drug in more than 70 clinical studies with key studies including evaluation in T-cell lymphomas and Hodgkin lymphoma. Another phase III study is also evaluating Adcetris in frontline mature T-cell lymphomas.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@XBI, ALNY, PBYI, SGEN: ETF Inflow Alert@2017-10-31@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/xbi-alny-pbyi-sgen-etf-inflow-alert-2017-10-31

Agenus' Zacks Rank #2 when combined with a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement.Agenus is an immuno-oncology company focused on the discovery and development of checkpoint modulators, vaccines and adjuvants for the treatment of cancer. It earns revenues only through fees received under collaboration and license agreements.Currently, the company is evaluating AGEN1884 in a phase I study and INCAGN01876 in a phase I/II study, for the treatment of solid tumors. In fact, Agenus has initiated phase I study for anti-OX40 agonist antibody - INCAGN1949 - in a phase I/II study in collaboration with Incyte. It expects to begin combination studies on AGEN2034 and AGEN1884 in the second half of 2017.In its third-quarter conference call, investors are likely to remain focused on the company's update on the initiation of combination studies on these antibodies. They are expected to focus on the advancement of additional checkpoint modulator antibodies and vaccines into the clinic in the coming quarters.In January 2017, Agenus entered into a clinical trial collaboration with the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to evaluate Prophage (HSPPC-96) in conjunction with Merck & Co., Inc.'s  PD-1 therapy, Keytruda. A phase II study will evaluate the effect of Prophage, in conjunction with Keytruda, on the overall survival rate of patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma (ndGBM).Agenus recently announced that the FDA granted marketing authorization to GlaxoSmithKline's herpes zoster vaccine, Shingrix, containing Agenus' proprietary immune adjuvant QS-21 Stimulon.

 announced two clinical collaborations to evaluate SGN-LIV1A in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC).SGN-LIV1A is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that being developed for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients whose tumors express the LIV-1 protein.Seattle Genetics' shares have outperformed the industry year to date. While the stock has been up 16.5%, the  gained 13.7%.The company will test SGN-LIV1A in combination with Merck and Co.'s  Keytruda in a phase Ib/II study as first line treatment for locally advanced and metastatic TNBC. The study is expected to enroll up to 72 patients. Per the agreement, Seattle Genetics will retain global development and commercialization rights to SGN-LIV1A and will hold the investigational new drug (IND) for the study.Additionally, SGN-LIV1A will be evaluated in combination with standard chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment in the phase II, I-SPY 2 study for newly diagnosed Stage 2 or 3 human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative breast cancer. The study is sponsored by Quantum Leap Health Care Collaborative (Quantum Leap) and is expected to enroll up to 75 patients in the SGN-LIV1A treatment arm. In fact, the study is designed in a way so that it can screen the potential treatments for the specific patient subgroups based on molecular characteristics.Furthermore, four clinical studies are planned for SGN-LIV1A in breast cancer with a focus on TNBC. Apart from this, SGN-LIV1A monotherapy is being evaluated in an ongoing phase 1 trial for patients with metastatic breast cancer including patients heavily pre-treated for TNBC.In fact, breast cancer is the most common form of cancer in women and TNBC. Also, it is very aggressive form and associated with poor patient outcomes. Therefore, a lot of companies are developing products in this space.Last month, Infinity Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  expanded its existing clinical collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb  for evaluating IPI-549 in combination with latter's checkpoint inhibitor Opdivo. The collaboration will include patients with TNBC, who have not been previously exposed to anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy.Notably, very few patients with triple negative breast cancer respond to checkpoint inhibitors alone and so they are left with very limited therapeutic options. This, in turn, expands the collaboration to include patients with TNBC, who have not been previously exposed to anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy. This in turn will enable Infinity to test whether IPI-549 in combination with Opdivo can increase the number of patients who respond to checkpoint inhibition. | Seattle Genetics carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).You can see Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

 reported a loss of 19 cents per share for the third quarter of 2017, significantly narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 40 cents and the year-ago quarter loss of 23 cents per share.However, including a gain of $78.7 million from the exercise of the warrant granted during termination of license transaction with Immunomedics, the company reported earnings of 34 cents per share.Revenues came in at $135.3 million, up 27.3% year over year, primarily on the back of strong sales of Adcetris. Revenues also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $113 million.Seattle Genetics' shares were up 3.8% in after-market trading on Thursday. In fact the company's share price has gained 15.9% year to date compared with the  's rise of 3.6% in the same period.Seattle Genetics' top line comprises product revenues, collaboration and license agreement revenues and royalties.The company's only marketed product, Adcetris, generated product sales of $79.2 million, up 12.9% year over year.Collaboration and license agreement revenues increased 64.5% to almost $39.4 million, mainly driven by strong demand for Adcetris in the international market. Collaboration revenues include fees earned from the company's agreement with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd. for Adcetris and other ADC collaborations.Royalty revenues increased 36.9% year over year to $16.7 million, attributable to international sales of Adcetris by Takeda Pharmaceutical Co.Research and development (R&D) expenses were $113.6 million, up 22.5% year over year. Also, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 13.9% to $34.8 million. Costs were high primarily due to investment in vadastuximab talirine, enfortumab vedotin, Adcetris and other pipeline development.The company raised its outlook for collaboration and license agreement revenues to the range of $90 million to $100 million (previously $75 million to $90 million). The royalties are expected in the range of $60 million to $65 million (previously $50 million to $55 million). Net sales of Adcetris are expected in the range of $290 million to $310 million.The company lowered the upper limit of the expected R&D expense projection. It is currently expected to be $460 million to $480 million compared with the previous expectation of $460 million to $500 million.Seattle Genetics continues to work on expanding Adcetris' label further through three phase III studies. We note that the FDA has granted priority review for a supplemental Biologics License Application in August to include cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in its label. A decision is expected in December.Meanwhile, the FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to Adcetris based on data from the phase III ECHELON-1 study (frontline classical Hodgkin lymphoma) on Adcetris showing a statistically significant improvement in modified progression-free survival. Seattle Generics and Takeda are planning to submit applications for regulatory approval by the year end.Moreover, top-line data from the ECHELON-2 study (frontline CD30-expressing mature T-cell lymphoma) should be out in 2018. The company is also evaluating Adcetris in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb's  Opdivo in relapsed/refractoryclassical Hodgkin lymphoma.In addition, the company initiated a pivotal phase II study on enfortumab vedotin in patients with metastatic urothelial cancer patients in late 2017. Moreover, Seattle Genetics and Astellas Pharma are planning to initiate a phase Ib study to evaluate the candidate in combination with CPI therapies, including pembrolizumab, in patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer.In July, Seattle Genetics collaborated with Genentech, a member of Roche Holding AG  , to evaluate the combination of Roche's immunotherapy Tecentriq and Seattle Genetics' antibody-drug conjugate SGN-LIV1A in patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer.The company's third-quarter loss was narrower than estimated and sales also beat expectations. Given the positive developments for Adcetris, investors should focus on updates of its label expansion. Approval for T-cell lymphoma indication will boost sales further.Seattle Genetics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stocks in the health care sector includes Adaptimmune Therapeutics PLC  which carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see  .Adaptimmune's loss estimates narrowed from $1.03 to 95 cents for 2017 and from 95 cents to 90 for 2018 over the last 60 days.

nvestors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and  may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Seattle Geneticsis seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings - with the most up-to-date information possible - is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for SGEN in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at a loss of 39 cents per share for SGEN, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 41 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for SGEN, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +5.74% heading into earnings season. | A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market.

" announced that the FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation status to its lymphoma drug, Adcetris, as frontline treatment for advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma. The company recently completed a phase III study - ECHELON-1 - on the drug for this indication.We remind investors that Adcetris is currently approved as second or third-line treatment for classical Hodgkin lymphoma and systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma after at least one failed multi-agent chemotherapy regimen in the United States as well as Europe.The Breakthrough Therapy designation was granted to speed up the development and review of drugs that target serious or life-threatening conditions.The company's shares closed 7.9% higher on Monday, following the news. Shares of Seattle Genetics have risen 11.3% so far this year, underperforming the  's gain of 15.4% in that period.In June 2017, the company announced positive top-line data from the ECHELON-1 study, which demonstrated that Adcetris achieved improvement in modified progression-free survival of statistical significance compared to standard of care chemotherapy. The ECHELON-1 study evaluated Adcetris in addition to Adriamycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine in patients with advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma with no prior treatment. The designation was granted based on the above data.The company expects to submit a supplemental biologics license application (""sBLA"") by the end of 2017.Seattle Genetics is developing the drug in more than 70 clinical studies with key studies including evaluation in T-cell lymphomas and Hodgkin lymphoma. The company has completed ALCANZA phase III study and submitted a sBLA last month to expand its label to include cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. A decision is expected in December 2017. Another phase III study is currently evaluating Adcetris in frontline mature T-cell lymphomas and a recently initiated study is evaluating the drug in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company's  Opdivo in relapsed/refractory Hodgkin lymphoma.Adcetris is the only marketed product of Seattle Genetics and generated sales of $144.7 million in the first half of 2017, up almost 16% from the year-ago period. Further label expansion in new indications should boost the sales numbers.However, Adcetris faces competition from other drugs, which include Merck & Co., Inc.'s  Keytruda that was recently approved in the lymphoma indication. | Seattle Genetics carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

 is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, the company's earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Also, Alexion's track record is excellent as it has consistently beaten expectations in the last four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 11.12% over the trailing four quarters.Moreover, a Alexion's shares have outperformed the industry year to date. The stock has been up 13.7% compared with the  's gain of 9.1%.Our proven model shows that Alexion is likely to beat earnings in the to-be-reported quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients - a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) - which have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. Alexion has an Earnings ESP of +0.44% as the Most Accurate estimate is $1.34 and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.33. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . Alexion's Zacks Rank #3, when combined with a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat. You can see  .Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Alexion's blockbuster drug, Soliris, continues to perform well. Alexion continues to identify and treat a consistently high number of new patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) with Soliris, across its 50-country operating platform.In order to further increase the commercial potential of the drug, Alexion is also working on expanding Soliris' label into additional indications. Label expansion into additional indications would give Soliris access to a higher patient population and increase the commercial potential of the drug significantly.In August 2017, the European Commission expanded the indication for Soliris to include the treatment of refractory generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) in adults who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody-positive. In October, the FDA approved Soliris for the same. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Soliris indicates the drug sales to increase 4.9% from the year-ago quarter to $765 million.Meanwhile, Strensiq continues to perform well with revenues benefiting from a growing number of patients (both children as well as adults with pediatric onset disease) owing to hypophosphatasia (HPP) disease awareness and diagnostic initiatives. Going forward, the company expects Strensiq to be a strong additional growth driver. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Strensiq indicates the drug sales to increase about 41% from the year-ago quarter to $86 million.Furthermore, the company announced some restructuring initiatives. In this context, Alexion plans to focus on rare diseases businesses in core areas of hematology, nephrology, neurology and metabolic disorders to enhance productivity.Notably, the company is expected to reduce spending and headcount associated with the previously announced de-prioritized pipeline programs as well as optimizing additional R&D expenses. Alexion also deprioritized ALXN1101 (cPMP replacement therapy) and ALXN6000 (samalizumab) as well as partnerships with Moderna Therapeutics, Blueprint Medicines and Arbutus Biopharma.Consequently, the company will reduce its global workforce by approximately 20% and expects that the increased financial flexibility will allow it to reinvest approximately $100 million annually into R&D.While, Alexion anticipates pre-tax savings of approximately $250 million by 2019, the total pre-tax restructuring and related expenses associated with the plan will be in the range of $340- $440 million. The company targets non-GAAP operating margin of 50% by the same year. Approximately 50% of the restructuring and related expenses will result in cash outlays while the same of approximately $240 million to $300 million are expected to be recorded in 2017.In the meantime, the company's efforts to develop its pipeline are impressive, particularly in case of ALXN1210. Currently, it is evaluating ALXN1210 (a longer-acting anti-C5 antibody that inhibits terminal complement) in phase III studies for both PNH and aHUS.In fact, the company initiated a phase III PNH switch study of ALXN1210 administered intravenously every eight weeks compared to patients currently treated with Soliris. Therefore, we expect investors to focus on updates from ALXN1210 as the successful development and commercialization of the drug will boost growth prospects.However, Soliris' quarter-to-quarter revenue growth will be impacted by the enrollment ramp-up of trials on ALXN1210 (by $70 million-$110 million), particularly in the second half of 2017. | Here are some pharma stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Seattle Genetics, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +6.18% and a Zacks Rank #3.

 and Astellas Pharma Inc announced the initiation of a phase II study-EV-201 of enfortumab vedotin. The study will evaluate patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who have been previously treated with checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) therapy.Enfortumab vedotin is an investigational antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) to target Nectin-4, a cell adhesion molecule which is expressed on many solid tumors.Seattle Genetics' shares have underperformed the industry year to date. The stock has surged 9.4% compared with the  's gain of 14.3%.The study will evaluate the antitumor activity and safety of enfortumab vedotin in order to get the approval of the FDA. The study will enroll about 120 patients and enfortumab vedotin will be administered three of every four weeks for the duration of treatment. The primary endpoint of the study is confirmed objective response rate (ORR), per independent review. The secondary endpoints include assessments of overall survival, progression free-survival, safety and tolerability.The company will move ahead with the EV-201 study based on the results of its ongoing phase I study. The ongoing phase I study is assessing the safety and anti-tumor activity of enfortumab vedotin at escalating doses of 0.5 to 1.25 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg), weekly for three of every four week cycles. The company in June 2017 announced updated data from 81 patients who were diagnosed with mUC and with a median age of 67 years. Of these patients, 46% were previously treated with checkpoint inhibitor (CPIs) and 95% had undergone treatment with a platinum-based chemotherapy. The results showed positive antitumor activity and a well-tolerated safety profile in patients with heavily pretreated metastatic urothelial cancer.The treatment options for metastatic urothelial cancers are limited for those patients who do not respond to chemotherapy and checkpoint inhibitors. There are no therapies approved by the FDA for patients who progress following CPI treatment. Thus, we see that there are a number of companies evaluating candidates for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer.Last month, Merck & Co., Inc  announced that its anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda received approval from the European Commission (EC) for the first- and second-line treatment of certain patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma, a type of bladder cancer.Keytruda has been approved as a first-line therapy for patients who cannot receive standard of care chemotherapy containing cisplatin. Keytruda was also approved as a second-line treatment for patients who have been previously treated with platinum-containing chemotherapy.In May 2017, Eli Lilly and Company  also announced positive results from a phase III study, RANGE, evaluating its oncology drug, Cyramza (ramucirumab), for expanded use in combination with docetaxel in patients with locally advanced or unresectable or metastatic urothelial carcinoma. The study met its primary end-points and demonstrated an improved progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with the given indication. | Currently, Seattle Genetics carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Another top-ranked stock in the health care sector includes Bayer Aktiengesellschaft  . You can see Bayer's earnings per share estimates have moved up from $2.17 to $2.24 for 2017 and from $2.37 to $2.39 for 2018, in the last 60 days.

"n recent trading, shares of Seattle Genetics Inc (Symbol: SGEN) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $57.30, changing hands for $58.72/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 10 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Seattle Genetics Inc, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $45.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $75.00. The standard deviation is $9.214.But the whole reason to look at the  SGEN price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with SGEN crossing above that average target price of $57.30/share, investors in SGEN have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $57.30 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

 announced that the FDA has approved immuno-oncology drug Opdivo for intravenous use for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have been previously treated with Nexavar.The approval for this indication was granted under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response.However, continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.Per estimates, HCC is the most common type of liver cancer and the fastest-growing cause of cancer death in the U.S.We note that Opdivo became the first PD-1 inhibitor to be approved for a hematological malignancy - classic Hodgkin lymphoma in both the United States (May 2016) and the EU (November 2016). In November 2016, Opdivo gained the FDA approval for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck with disease progression on or after platinum-based therapy.Bristol-Myers' stock has rallied 10.7% year to date compared with the  's 20.0% gain.Label expansion into additional indications might give the product access to more patients and increase the commercial potential of the drug.Additionally, the company entered into a collaboration agreement with Seattle Genetics, Inc.  in June 2017. Per the deal, Bristol-Myers will evaluate the combination of Opdivo and Seattle Genetics' antibody drug conjugate (ADC)Adcetris in a phase III trial as a potential treatment option for patients with relapsed/refractory or transplant-ineligible advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma (HL).However, Bristol-Myers suffered a setback in January 2017 when it decided not to pursue the accelerated regulatory pathway for the regimen of Opdivo plus Yervoy in first-line lung cancer in the United States based on a review of available data.Currently, Opdivo is facing competitive challenges in the United States. With the FDA approving Merck & Co.'s  Keytruda, for the first-line treatment of metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC, the company is expected to suffer further loss of market share.Meanwhile, the FDA put a partial clinical hold on three clinical trials - CA209602 (CheckMate-602), CA209039 (CheckMate-039) and CA204142. The trials are investigating Opdivo-based combinations in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.

 announced that the FDA has granted approval to Mylotarg for adult patients with newly diagnosed CD33-positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The drug also received approval to treat relapsed or refractory CD33-positive AML in adults as well as children (2 years and older).The approval was expected as the FDA's Oncologic Drug Advisory Committee had voted in favor of Mylotarg's approval in July 2017.However, it should be noted that the U.S. label of the drug will include a boxed warning for hepatotoxicity including severe or fatal hepatic veno-occlusive disease.Pfizer's shares have gained 4.6% so far this year, underperforming the  's increase of 12.3%.The approval was granted based on data from multiple investigator-led clinical trials, including ALFA-0701, AML-19 and MyloFrance-1.The ALFA-0701 phase III study evaluated Mylotarg in combination with chemotherapy in newly diagnosed AML patients. The drug showed significant improvement in event-free survival (EFS), achieving 17.3 months compared to 9.5 months for chemotherapy.The phase III AML-19 study compared Mylotarg as monotherapy with best supportive care in elderly AML patients who are intolerant to other therapies. Mylotarg achieved a better median overall survival period of 4.9 months versus 3.6 months for best supportive care.MyloFrance-1, a phase II study, evaluated single agent Mylotarg in relapsing AML patients. The study showed that almost 26% of patients achieved complete remission and the median relapse-free survival achieved was 11.6 months.It is evident from the above studies that Mylotarg's achievements support its risk benefit profile in AML patients.We remind investors that Mylotarg was granted accelerated approval by the FDA in 2000 as a single agent for treating CD33-positive AML in patients who had experienced their first relapse and were 60 years or older. However, 10 years later, Pfizer voluntarily removed Mylotarg from the market as data from a post approval phase III study, SWOG S0106, showed no clinical benefit and rate of fatalities due to treatment-related toxicity was significantly higher.Per the press release, CD33 antigen occurs in nearly 90% of AML patients. In fact, AML occurs in nearly 80% of acute leukemia patients. Moreover, Mylotarg is the first approved therapy for pediatric AML, which will give Mylotarg first-mover advantage. An estimated 21,380 patients in the United States are expected to be diagnosed with AML in 2017 including 500 children, as per the data published in the press release.Chemotherapy is the current preferred therapy for treating AML.

The biotech reported second-quarter earnings on Friday, but without any revenue-generating drugs on the market, the focus is on the biotech's pipeline rather than the earnings number.Data source: ImmunoGen.Image source: Getty Images.Based on the aforementioned Forward II trial, ImmunoGen's chief medical officer, Anna Berkenblit, hinted during the  at future plans for testing mirvetuximab soravtansine in combination with other drugs: ""So we are considering options to move mirvetuximab as a doublet with carboplatin, or potentially as a triplet with Avastin or even Keytruda into earlier lines of therapy. We're currently assessing the options, and we'll keep you posted as we solidify our development plan.""Berkenblit also provided an update on plans for IMGN779, which have changed after  (NASDAQ: SGEN) stopped phase 3 development of vadastuximab talirine in patients with AML and a regulatory decision by the FDA's Oncology Drug Advisory Committee (ODAC) for  's Mylotarg:Data from Forward I is the most important event for ImmunoGen, but it's still a few years away, although there will be a futility analysis in the first half of next year to ensure the trial is worth continuing.In the meantime, investors can look forward to additional data from the phase 1 trial for IMGN779 later this year and more data from Forward II for patients treated with mirvetuximab soravtansine and  's Keytruda in the first half of next year.The company is also continuing to develop new drugs with plans to file an application in the third quarter to start clinical trials for IMGN632, which targets blood cancers expressing CD 123.And hopefully ImmunoGen will do more cash-generating deals with its pipeline drugs, because its current stockpile will only fund operations into the second half of 2018.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

This continues the recent uptrend for the company for the company-as the stock is now up 3.5% in the past one-month time frame.The move came after the company's announcement that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to Adcetris (brentuximab vedotin) in combination with chemotherapy for the frontline treatment of patients with advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma.The company has seen three positive estimate revisions in the past few weeks, while its Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter has also moved higher over the past few weeks, suggesting that more solid trading could be ahead for Seattle Genetics.

"nvestors in Seattle Genetics Inc (Symbol: SGEN) saw new options become available this week, for the October 20th expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the SGEN options chain for the new October 20th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $45.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.60. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $45.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $43.40 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of SGEN, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $46.80/share today.Because the $45.00 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 62%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.56% return on the cash commitment, or 22.00% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Seattle Genetics Inc, and highlighting in green where the $45.00 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $50.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.25. If an investor was to purchase shares of SGEN stock at the current price level of $46.80/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $50.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 9.51% if the stock gets called away at the October 20th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if SGEN shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Seattle Genetics Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing SGEN's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $50.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $50.00 strike represents an approximate 7% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 60%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the First Trust NYSE Arca Biotechnology Index Fund ETF (Symbol: FBT), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $135.56 per unit.With FBT trading at a recent price near $120.95 per unit, that means that analysts see 12.08% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of FBT's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Intercept Pharmaceuticals Inc (Symbol: ICPT), Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc (Symbol: RARE), and Seattle Genetics Inc (Symbol: SGEN). Although ICPT has traded at a recent price of $114.10/share, the average analyst target is 71.78% higher at $196.00/share. Similarly, RARE has 28.85% upside from the recent share price of $56.24 if the average analyst target price of $72.47/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting SGEN to reach a target price of $58.70/share, which is 17.92% above the recent price of $49.78. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of ICPT, RARE, and SGEN:Combined, ICPT, RARE, and SGEN represent 8.50% of the First Trust NYSE Arca Biotechnology Index Fund ETF. Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
  
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Analysts Predict 12% Gains Ahead For FBT@2017-08-31@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/analysts-predict-12-gains-ahead-fbt-2017-08-31
hares of  gained about 5% after the company ended its phase III combination study, CheckMate-214, earlier than expected after it met its co- primary endpoint.The phase III study evaluated Opdivo plus Yervoy in patients with previously untreated advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and met its co-primary endpoint. The study showed superior overall survival (OS) compared to current standard of care sunitinib (marketed as Sutent by Pfizer  ) in intermediate- and poor-risk patients.In fact, the combination of Opdivo and Yervoy also met the secondary endpoint of improved overall survival in all randomized patients. Based on a planned interim analysis, an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) recommended that the study be stopped early. But the safety and tolerability of the combination treatment observed in the study was consistent with previous reports of this dosing schedule and similar across subgroups.In August 2017, Bristol-Myers announced top-line results from CheckMate-214 study, where the study met the co-primary endpoint of objective response rate (ORR). Markedly, the co-primary endpoint of progression-free survival favored the combination of Opdivo and Yervoy versus sunitinib but did not reach statistical significance.Bristol-Myers' shares have underperformed the industry year to date. The stock has been down 7.5% compared with the  's gain of 10.2% in the same time frame.We note that Opdivo became the first PD-1 inhibitor to be approved for a hematological malignancy - classic Hodgkin lymphoma - in the United States (May 2016) and the EU (November 2016).In November 2016, Opdivo gained the FDA approval for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck with disease progression on or after platinum-based therapy.In fact, renal cell carcinoma is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults and has a huge unmet medical need. Thus, label expansion into additional indications would give the product access to a higher patient population and increase the commercial potential of the drug.Additionally, the company entered into a collaboration agreement with Seattle Genetics, Inc.  in June 2017. Per the deal, Bristol-Myers will evaluate the combination of Opdivo and Seattle Genetics' antibody drug conjugate (ADC) Adcetris in a phase III trial as a potential treatment option for patients with relapsed/refractory or transplant-ineligible advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma (HL).However, Bristol-Myers suffered a setback in January 2017 when it decided not to pursue the accelerated regulatory pathway for the regimen of Opdivo plus Yervoy in first-line lung cancer in the United States based on a review of available data.Currently, Opdivo is facing competitive challenges in the United States. With the FDA approving Merck's  Keytruda, for the first-line treatment of metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC, the company is expected to suffer further loss of market share. | Bristol-Myers currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

"Chicago, IL - July 14, 2017 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include  (NYSE:  ),  n (NASDAQ:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations. The pharma/biotech sector has picked up this year after being battered by the drug pricing controversy in 2016. The first half has been pretty strong for companies in the space.The NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index has risen almost 9.8% year to date (YTD) after declining almost 10% last year. NASDAQ Biotechnology Index is up 17.7% YTD after sliding 19.1% in 2016.The sector does have its share of challenges in the form of rising competition, high profile pipeline setbacks, slowdown in growth of mature products and the loss of exclusivity for certain key drugs. Though the drug pricing issue still prevails, investors, lately, are hoping that steep pricing will not be as damaging as feared previously.Nonetheless, strong performance of newer drugs, evolving pipelines, impressive clinical trial results, new drug approvals, continued strong performance of legacy products and rising demand are some of the factors that promise a sustained recovery in the sector.Meanwhile, there have been many more FDA drug approvals so far this year than in 2016. A total of 23 drugs have gained FDA approval YTD, beating the total of 22 for the whole of 2016. With acceleration in the drug approval process, more innovation and a surge in new drug approvals are expected.Though M&A activities and collaborations/deals have slowed down this year, chances are that they will pick up in the second half. With President Trump promising a major tax reform that will allow companies to bring back cash held overseas, acquisition activities are expected to pick up pace. Then again, the number of deals will still be less than the pharma industry, as it has been for many years.Finally, the Republican administration's vow to ""repeal and replace"" Obamacare bodes well for the sector's growth.Given the enormity of the healthcare space, selecting stocks that have the potential to beat estimates could appear to be quite daunting. But our proprietary methodology makes it fairly simple. One way to narrow down the list of choices this earnings season is by looking at stocks that have the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank - Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) - and a positive  .

The company has consistently topped earnings expectations. In fact, Merck's earnings surpassed expectations in each of the last four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 4.36%.Merck is scheduled to report results on Jul 28.Our next choice is biotech major,  n (NASDAQ:  ). Carrying a Zacks Rank #3, the stock has an Earnings ESP of +1.86%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter is pegged at $1.61 per share. This Summit, NJ-based company has a pretty impressive earnings surprise track record. The average earnings surprise over the four trailing quarters is 3.01%.Celgene is scheduled to announce results on Jul 27. (NASDAQ:  ) too has an impressive track record with the company consistently beating earnings expectations. The company's earnings surpassed estimates in three of the last four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 3.52%. It looks poised to beat expectations in the second quarter as well. This Foster City, CA, based company carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of +1.45%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $2.07 per share.Gilead is scheduled to report results on Jul 26. (NASDAQ:  ), a biotechnology company is another solid bet. This Zacks Rank #3 stock has an Earnings ESP of +9.30%. This Bothell, WA-based company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 8.46% over the trailing four quarters.Seattle Genetics is scheduled to release results on Jul 27, with the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter pegged at a loss of 43 cents per share.A small biopharmaceutical company,  (NASDAQ:  ) makes it to our list of likely outperformers in the second quarter by virtue of its Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +30.0%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of 20 cents per share. Vanda is expected to report its results on Jul 26.Challenges in the form of competitive and pricing pressure will remain in the healthcare sector. However, a number of companies in the space have fared well. Picking some outperformers from the space, backed by a solid Zacks Rank and a positive Earnings ESP, could lead investors to gain this earnings season.Many are little publicized and fly under the Wall Street radar. They're virtually unknown to the general public. Yet today's 220 Zacks Rank #1 ""Strong Buys"" were generated by the stock-picking system that has nearly tripled the market from 1988 through 2015.

" reported a loss of 39 cents per share for the second quarter of 2017, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 43 cents but wider than the year-ago loss of 23 cents per share.Revenues came in at $108.2 million, up 13.4% year over year, primarily on the back of strong sales of Adcetris. Revenues also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $107.2 million.Seattle Genetics' share price has gained 0.3% year to date compared with the  's rise of 11.9% in the same period.Seattle Genetics' top line comprises product revenues, collaboration and license agreement revenues and royalties.The company's only marketed product, Adcetris, generated revenues of $74.3 million, up 12.3% year over year.Collaboration and license agreement revenues increased 7.5% to almost $21.5 million. Collaboration revenues included fees earned from the company's agreement with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd. for Adcetris and other ADC collaborations.Royalty revenues increased 34.7% year over year to $12.4 million attributable to international sales of Adcetris by Takeda Pharmaceutical Co.  .Research and development (R&D) expenses were $114.4 million, up 33.7% year over year. Also, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 22.3% to $40.7 million. Costs were high primarily due to investment in vadastuximab talirine, enfortumab vedotin, Adcetris and other pipeline development.The company raised its outlook for net sales of Adectris in the U.S. and Canada to the range of $290 million to $310 million (previously $280 million to $300 million).Seattle Genetics continues to work on expanding Adcetris' label further through three phase III trials. We note that the company reported positive data from ALCANZA phase III study recently and submitted a supplemental Biologics License Application (BLA) in June for including cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in its label.The company announced top-line data in Jun 2017 from the phase III ECHELON-1 study (frontline classical Hodgkin lymphoma) on Adcetris showing a statistically significant improvement in modified progression-free survival (PFS). Seattle Generics and Takeda are planning to submit applications for regulatory approval in their territories.Moreover, top-line data from the ECHELON-2 study (frontline CD30-expressing mature T-cell lymphoma) should be out in 2018. The company is also evaluating Adcetris in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb's  Opdivo in relapsed/refractoryclassical Hodgkin lymphoma. Adcetris received a non-conditional approval in Canada for Hodgkin lymphoma with high risk of relapse.In addition, the company expects to initiate a pivotal phase II study on enfortumab vedotin in patients with metastatic urothelial cancer patients in late 2017. Also, in the quarter, the diffuse large B-cell lymphoma candidate, polatuzumab vedotin, received PRIME designation in Europe, which is being evaluated in combination with Roche Holding AG's  Rituxan.However, the company discontinued the phase III CASCADE study on vadastuximab talirinein frontline older patients with acute myeloid leukemia in Jun 2017 based on higher rates of death observed in the study.The company's second-quarter loss was narrower than estimated and sales also beat expectations. With positive news announced from Adcetris studies, investors should focus on updates on Adcetris' label expansion. The increase of the net sales guidance for Adcetris is also encouraging. | Seattle Genetics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see  .Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

 (NASDAQ: SGEN) reported second-quarter revenue and earnings numbers, but the conference call focused mostly on potential near-term revenue growth for the biotech's one approved drug, Adcetris, with one expanded indication under review at the FDA and another to be there shortly.Data source: Seattle Genetics.Image source: Getty Images.There are a lot of terms in that quote, so let's break them down: : The company doesn't know which drug the patients in the trial were treated with. : Progression-free survival, a measure of efficacy based on how long it takes a patient to progress or die -- whichever comes first -- while being treated. : ECHELON-2, a clinical trial testing Adcetris in patients with mature T-cell lymphoma who haven't been previously been treated.So to translate: Patients aren't progressing or dying as fast as expected, which is good news for patients and hopefully good news for Seattle Genetics if it's the patients being treated with Adcetris who are the ones responding better than expected, but we don't know for sure since the company is blinded. Since the trial is set up to end when a certain number of progression/deaths occur in both treatment arms combined, the trial is taking longer to complete than expected, so management plans to ask the FDA for permission to look at the data earlier.Management increased 2017 guidance for ADCETRIS sales in the U.S. and Canada to a range of $290 million to $310 million. Not bad, but far from a blockbuster, which will only come from successful approval based on the ECHELON-1 trial. Investors will get a full look at that data at the American Society of Hematology meeting in December.Beyond the aforementioned plan to get ECHELON-2 data earlier, Seattle Genetics has other clinical trial data coming. It recently started a phase 3 trial with  testing Adcetris plus Bristol's Opdivo in relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma patients. And enfortumab vedotin, which is partnered with  , will enter a phase 2 trial in metastatic urothelial cancer that management thinks should be enough to gain accelerated approval from the FDA if the trial is successful.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

 announced that a phase III study, CheckMate-238, evaluating Opdivo 3 mg/kg versus Yervoy 10 mg/kg met its primary endpoint at a planned interim analysis. The study evaluated patients with stage IIIb/c or stage IV melanoma who are at high risk of recurrence following complete surgical resection.The trial randomized 906 patients to receive either Opdivo 3 mg/kg intravenously every two weeks or Yervoy 10 mg/kg IV every three weeks for four doses and then every 12 weeks until documented disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, up to maximum treatment duration of one year. The results from the study showed superior recurrence-free survival (RFS) in patients receiving Opdivo compared to Yervoy.The data from the study will be presented at an upcoming medical conference.We note that Opdivo became the first PD-1 inhibitor to be approved for a hematological malignancy - classic Hodgkin lymphoma in both the U.S. (May 2016) and the EU (Nov 2016). In Nov 2016, Opdivo gained the FDA approval for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck with disease progression on or after platinum-based therapy.Label expansion into additional indications would give the product access to a higher patient population and increase the commercial potential of the drug.The company entered into a collaboration agreement with Seattle Genetics, Inc.  . Per the deal, Bristol-Myers will evaluate the combination of Opdivo and Seattle Genetics' antibody drug conjugate (ADC) Adcetris in a phase III trial as a potential treatment option for patients with relapsed/refractory or transplant-ineligible advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). The trial will being in mid-2017.However, the company suffered a setback in Jan 2017 when it decided not to pursue the accelerated regulatory pathway for the regimen of Opdivo plus Yervoy in first-line lung cancer in the U.S. based on a review of available data.Opdivo is facing competitive challenges in the U.S. With the FDA approving Merck's  Keytruda, for the first-line treatment of metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC, the company is expected to suffer further loss of market share.While Bristol-Myers' share price has decreased 3.6% in the year-to-date, the Zacks classified industry gained 12.1%.While Bristol-Myers' share price has decreased 3.6% in the year-to-date, the Zacks classified  industry gained 12.1%.Bristol-Myers currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in healthcare sector is Bayer AG  , sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

 announced that the FDA's Oncologic Drug Advisory Committee (ODAC) voted in favor of Mylotarg for the treatment of patients with newly-diagnosed CD33-positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML).The committee believes that the ALFA-0701 study investigating Mylotarg provides significant evidence supporting the risk benefit profile of Mylotarg in AML. A biologics license application (BLA) was submitted based on data from this study. A FDA decision is expected by Sep 2017.The ALFA-0701 evaluated the safety and efficacy of Mylotarg, an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), in addition to chemotherapy in AML. Mylotarg was administered to patients on the first, fourth and seventh day of the treatment.Shares of Pfizer have risen 2.1% since the beginning of this year, underperforming the Zacks classified  industry, which increased 10.4% in the same period.We remind investors that Mylotarg was granted accelerated approval by the FDA in 2000 as a single agent for treating CD33-positive AML in patients who had experienced their first relapse and were 60 years or older. However, 10 years later, Pfizer voluntarily removed Mylotarg from the market as data from a post approval phase III study, SWOG S0106, showed no clinical benefit and rate of fatalities due to treatment-related toxicity was significantly higher.The currently submitted BLA seeks approval for Mylotarg in two indications, for treating newly-diagnosed CD33-positive AML in combination with standard chemotherapy, and as monotherapy in patients aged over 60 who had first relapse and are not eligible for other cytotoxic chemotherapy. The BLA also includes data from five phase III studies including ALFA-0701, which contains 10 years of research data from 4,300 patients.Per the press release, AML occurs in nearly 80% of acute leukemia patients and about 21,380 people are estimated to be affected by AML in the U.S. in 2017. Several companies are developing therapies for treating AML. The therapies include Seattle Genetics, Inc.'s  SGN-CD33A and Intrexon Corporation's  CD33-specific CAR+ T therapy, in collaboration with ZIOPHARM Oncology, Inc.  .

 and partner Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited announced positive results from phase III study, ECHLEON 1 study evaluating Adcetris (brentuximab vedotin) as part of a frontline combination chemotherapy regimen in patients with previously untreated advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma (HL).Notably, the ECHLEON 1 study met its primary endpoint. Patients in the study were randomized to receive either ABVD (Adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine), a recognized standard of care for frontline HL, or a novel combination consisting of Adcetris+AVD (Adriamycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine), which removes bleomycin from the regimen. The results showed that combination treatment with Adcetris resulted in a statistically significant improvement in modified progression-free survival (PFS) versus the control arm. The two-year modified PFS rate for patients in the Adcetris arm was 82.1% compared to 77.2% in the control arm. The study also met the secondary endpoint.Despite the positive results, the share price of the company went down by about 8%. This could be due the investors' reactions as an increased incidence of febrile neutropenia and peripheral neuropathy in the Adcetris+AVD arm was observed. The stock underperformed the Zacks classified  industry year to date. The stock was up almost 6.2%, while the industry gained 11.5%.Adcetris is the only marketed product at Seattle Genetics. The drug is approved for relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma and relapsed systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (sALCL) in the U.S., the EU and Japan. It is also approved in the U.S. for the treatment of patients suffering from classical Hodgkin lymphoma who are at high risk of relapse or progression as post-autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT) consolidation. Adcetris is currently not approved as a frontline therapy for Hodgkin lymphoma.Moving ahead, Seattle Genetics and Takeda plan to submit these results to regulatory authorities for approval in their respective territories.Few days ago, Seattle Genetics, also submitted a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) to the FDA for Adcetris (brentuximab vedotin) in patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). The submission of the supplemental BLA was mainly based on positive data from the phase III trial, ALCANZA in patients with CTCL.Adcetris generated revenues of $70.3 million in the first quarter of 2017, up 20% year over year and is expected to generate sale in the range of $280-$300 million in the U.S. and Canada in 2017.

One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.In trading on Monday, shares of Seattle Genetics Inc (Symbol: SGEN) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 29.0, after changing hands as low as $53.30 per share. By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) is 58.6.

Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so poorly.Frontier Communications stock fell 7%, adding to more extensive losses it posted over the past week. The telecommunications company has been working hard to try to get itself out of its precariously leveraged situation on its balance sheet, announcing today early tender offer results for several series of outstanding notes. The company has sought to buy back notes that mature between 2018 and 2021, in some cases paying well above par value to do so. Interest in the tender was strong, and Frontier ended up raising the amount of debt it bought back from $800 million to $1.15 billion. The net result was to dramatically reduce one debt issue carrying an interest rate of almost 9%. That will improve Frontier's cash flow, but many investors are still  the bad news it has received lately, including customer losses and other financial challenges.Image source: Frontier Communications.Shares of Seattle Genetics finished down more than 8% even though the biotech company had generally positive things to say about recent phase 3 trial data. The company has been investigating its already-approved  , hoping to add the option of having doctors use the drug as a first-line treatment rather than having to use it in conjunction with chemotherapy drugs and stem-cell transplantation procedures. The trial data showed clear and statistically significant improvements from adding Adcetris to existing therapy options, but the differences weren't as large as many had hoped. Without a more clearly compelling reason to make the shift, the worry among investors is that patients and doctors won't tolerate the added cost of Adcetris even if it does win approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.Finally, Arconic stock dropped 6%.

 (NASDAQ: SGEN) stock is down 8.7% as of 1:02 p.m. after the company announced positive phase 3 data from its ECHELON-1 trial testing Adcetris as a first-line treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma.You read that right: Shares are down on positive clinical trial results. Unfortunately, in biotech, sometimes it's the magnitude of the win that counts.Seattle Genetics' ECHELON-1 trial tested Adcetris, which is already approved as a treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma after stem cell transplantation, in combination with older chemotherapy drugs -- adriamycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine (AVD) -- compared to the standard of care that includes those three drugs plus bleomycin (AVBD). The group that got Adcetris+AVD had a 23% reduction in the risk of modified progression-free survival -- defined as progression, death, or patients getting an additional anticancer therapy because they didn't have a complete response -- compared to the patients that got AVBD. Looking specifically two years after the start of treatment, 82.1% of patients that got Adcetris+AVD hadn't triggered the modified progression-free survival criteria compared to 77.2% in the control arm.Image source: Getty Images.While there's a clear benefit from Adcetris+AVD over AVBD, the benefit isn't particularly large, with just an additional 5% of patients doing better after two years. That might cause pushback from insurers, as Adcetris is significantly more expensive than bleomycin, which is available as a generic. Keep in mind, though, that bleomycin is quite toxic and treating the side effects has costs associated with it, which insurers should take into account in their cost-benefit analysis.Investors will have to wait for until December at the American Society of Hematology meeting to see the full results from ECHELON-1, but the top-line data looks good enough for Seattle Genetics to be able to gain regulatory approval in the U.S. and elsewhere by its partner  . The bigger question now is how much additional drug the duo can sell, but we won't know the answer to that until Adcetris starts getting expanded regulatory approvals in a year or so.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Got Whacked Today@2017-06-26@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-shares-seattle-genetics-inc-got-whacked-today-2017-06-26
 announced that it has submitted a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) to the FDA for Adcetris (brentuximab vedotin) in patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL).In fact, Adcetris is the only marketed product at Seattle Genetics. The drug is approved for relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma and relapsed systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (sALCL) in the U.S., the EU and Japan. It is also approved in the U.S. for the treatment of patients suffering from classical Hodgkin lymphoma who are at high risk of relapse or progression as post-autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT) consolidation.Notably, Seattle Genetics outperformed the Zacks classified  industry year to date. The stock jumped almost 17.8%, while the industry gained 6.4%.The submission of the supplemental BLA was mainly based on positive data from the phase III trial, ALCANZA in patients with CTCL. We note that the ALCANZA study achieved both the primary and secondary endpoints. The study showed that CTCL patients treated with Adcetris had superior outcomes across all primary and secondary endpoints compared with patients in the control arm, who were treated with either methotrexate or bexarotene standard of care agents.We remind investors that the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) to Adcetris for the treatment of patients with CD30-expressing mycosis fungoides and primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma. who require systemic therapy and have received one prior systemic therapy in Nov 2016.In fact, Adcetris generated revenues of $70.3 million in the first quarter of 2017, up 20% year over year and is expected to generate sale in the range of $280-$300 million in the U.S. and Canada in 2017. Seattle Genetics is also working on expanding the drug's label which will be a further boost for the company's revenues.Recently, Seattle Genetics announced that it will discontinue the phase III study, CASCADE of its pipeline candidate vadastuximab talirine (SGN-CD33A) in frontline older acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. This is a setback for the company. Thus label expansion of its only marketed drug Adcetris plays an important role in the growth of the company's revenues. | Seattle Genetics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

 announced an extended follow-up data on immuno-oncology drug Opdivo.The data from ongoing phase II study CheckMate-205 evaluated adult patients with classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) who have failed autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT), irrespective of brentuximab vedotin (BV) therapy history.The study evaluated objective response rates (ORR), the primary endpoint, as well as duration of response rates (DOR) for each cohort (assessed by the Independent Radiology Review Committee).The data from the study showed that Opdivo demonstrated responses in adult patients with relapsed or progressed cHL after ASCT, irrespective of BV therapy history.The patients had an ORR of 65%, with a complete response (CR) in 29% of patients, in the BV-naïve group (Cohort A: n=63). They had a median follow-up of 19 months. The median DOR was 20 months and the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 18.3 months.The ORR was 68% in next group that had BV therapy after ASCT (Cohort B: n=80), with a median follow-up of 23 months. The CR was 13% in this cohort. The median DOR was 16 months and the median PFS was 14.7 months.Across cohorts, the median overall survival was not reached, and 40% of patients remained on treatment. The safety profile was consistent with the previously reported data in this tumor type.We note that Opdivo became the first PD-1 inhibitor to be approved for a hematological malignancy - classic Hodgkin lymphoma in both the U.S. (May 2016) and the EU (Nov 2016).The indication received accelerated approval based on overall response rate. The continued approval for this indication is contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.In Nov 2016, Opdivo gained the FDA approval for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck with disease progression on or after platinum-based therapy.Label expansion into additional indications would give the product access to a higher patient population and increase the commercial potential of the drug.However, the company suffered a setback in Jan 2017 when it decided not to pursue accelerated regulatory pathway for Opdivo plus Yervoy in first-line lung cancer in the U.S. based on a review of available data. The share price of the company declined significantly on the news.While Bristol-Myers' shares declined 6.8% in the last 12 months, the Zacks classified industry gained 11.4%.While Bristol-Myers' shares declined 6.8% in the last 12 months, the Zacks classified  industry gained 11.4%.Moreover, Opdivo is facing stiff competition in the U.S. With the FDA approving Merck's  Keytruda, for the first-line treatment of metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC, the company is expected to suffer further loss of market share.Bristol-Myers has entered into a collaboration agreement with Seattle Genetics, Inc.  to evaluate the combination of Opdivo and Seattle Genetics' antibody drug conjugate (ADC) Adcetris in a phase III trial as a potential treatment option for patients with relapsed/refractory or transplant-ineligible advanced cHL.Bristol-Myers currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the health care sector is VIVUS, Inc.  which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the First Trust NYSE Arca Biotechnology Index Fund ETF (Symbol: FBT), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $125.82 per unit.With FBT trading at a recent price near $113.77 per unit, that means that analysts see 10.59% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of FBT's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc (Symbol: RARE), Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Symbol: GILD), and Seattle Genetics Inc (Symbol: SGEN). Although RARE has traded at a recent price of $60.61/share, the average analyst target is 42.79% higher at $86.55/share. Similarly, GILD has 22.08% upside from the recent share price of $70.65 if the average analyst target price of $86.25/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting SGEN to reach a target price of $58.55/share, which is 13.92% above the recent price of $51.39. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of RARE, GILD, and SGEN:Combined, RARE, GILD, and SGEN represent 8.50% of the First Trust NYSE Arca Biotechnology Index Fund ETF. Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
  
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past.

"Shares of  (NASDAQ: IMMU) , a clinical-stage drug developer focused on proprietary monoclonal antibody-based therapies designed to fight cancer, surged as much as 12% on Monday following a business update on Friday that saw a controversial licensing come to a close. Shares of Immunomedics rose nearly 18% on Friday following the news.Normally when two companies scrap a licensing deal, the smaller one, or the one most perceived to need the capital associated with the up-front licensing fee, takes it on the chin. That's not been the case since Friday's announcement, which ended a licensing pact with  (NASDAQ: SGEN) over the rights to antibody-drug conjugate IMMU-132, also known as sacituzumab govitecan.Image source: Getty Images.In February, Seattle Genetics inked a deal that would have given $250 million in up-front cash to Immunomedics, as well as dangled a $1.7 billion carrot in various development, regulatory, and sales-based milestones. It was also to take a $57 million equity investment in the company at the time, which worked out to 9.9%.However, investment fund venBio Select Advisor and a number of investors felt that Immunomedics markedly undervalued its lead asset with the Seattle Genetics deal. Thus, the announcement on Friday that the two were mutually ending their licensing pact came as positive news to Wall Street. Under the termination agreement, all rights to sacituzumab govitecan will be returned to Immunomedics, and Seattle Genetics will hang on to 3 million Immunomedics shares, with warrants to acquire up to 8.7 million shares at $4.90 through the end of this year.Additionally, the press release notes that Immunomedics has agreed to sell 1 million shares of preferred stock in an effort to raise $125 million in gross proceeds, which will add to the $46 million in cash it had as of the end of the first quarter.And finally, Immunomedics announced that its CEO was stepping down, as well as its founder, from all current officer positions. Founder David Goldenberg will be sticking around on Immunomedics' board of directors.Image source: Getty Images.Talk about some very big changes afoot at Immunomedics.Perhaps the only downside to the company's late-week press release was the timeline for filing a biologic license application for sacituzumab govitecan. The company now anticipates a filing for approval in third-line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer in the fourth quarter of this year or perhaps first quarter of next year, compared to a prior timeline of mid-2017. Even with an accelerated approval process, it could be a good year or more before we have any real answers, and if approved before Immunomedics sees any recurring revenue.There's also a lot of wiggle room with regard to what the Food and Drug Administration will deem ""effective."" The company's confirmed overall response rate (ORR) in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer of 29% (for 85 patients) should be good enough to give sacituzumab govitecan a real shot at approval. On the other hand, a 43-patient ORR of 16% with a median progression-free survival of 3.7 months may not pass muster.Nonetheless, with a fresh round of capital and a new management team at the helm, investors are excited about the future. I'll need to see more definitive clinical evidence from IMMU-132, and perhaps other pipeline products, before I'm as excited as Wall Street appears to be.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

 (NASDAQ: IMGN) released first-quarter earnings on Friday, but with the lack of revenue from drugs on the market, the focus was on the company's pipeline.Data source: ImmunoGen. Quarter designations based on calendar year because ImmunoGen changed its fiscal year in 2016.Image source: Getty Images.Management is expecting the FORWARD I clinical trial to read out in early 2019, but the current cash in the bank will only fund company operations into the second quarter of 2018. Mark Enyedy, ImmunoGen's president and CEO, has a plan -- multiple plans, actually -- for raising additional capital:Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a competitive space, with  (NASDAQ: SGEN) having an antibody drug conjugate to treat the disease. But chief scientific officer and EVP Richard Gregory thinks ImmunoGen's antibody drug conjugate, IMGN779, has a distinct advantage:The next value-driving opportunity for ImmunoGen will come next month at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting. Investors will get to see pooled data from phase I trials using mirvetuximab soravtansine as a monotherapy, which will hopefully add to investors' confidence that FORWARD I will be successful. ImmunoGen will also present data from FORWARD II, a trial combining mirvetuximab soravtansine with other cancer drugs. If positive -- and some of the combinations likely are since management has already indicated that it's moving forward with them -- it will give some confidence that mirvetuximab soravtansine is active, and it'll also provide a backup plan if the monotherapy doesn't work.Beyond mirvetuximab soravtansine, investors can look forward to phase 1 data for IMGN779 in AML in the middle of this year. And in the third quarter, ImmunoGen plans to file an investigational new drug application for IMGN632, which will allow the company to start clinical trials in multiple blood cancers.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

nvestors eyeing a purchase of Seattle Genetics Inc (Symbol: SGEN) stock, but cautious about paying the going market price of $66.44/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the December put at the $50 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $2.95. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 5.9% return against the $50 commitment, or a 10.6% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to SGEN's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $50 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Seattle Genetics Inc sees its shares fall 24.8% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $47.05 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $2.95 from $50), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 10.6% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Seattle Genetics Inc, and highlighting in green where the $50 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the December put at the $50 strike for the 10.6% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Seattle Genetics Inc (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $66.44) to be 45%. For other put options contract ideas at the various different available expirations, visit the  page of StockOptionsChannel.com.In mid-afternoon trading on Friday, the put volume among S&P 500 components was 539,612 contracts, with call volume at 539,612, for a put:call ratio of 0.74 so far for the day, which is above normal compared to the long-term median put:call ratio of .65. In other words, if we look at the number of call buyers and then use the long-term median to project the number of put buyers we'd expect to see, we're actually seeing more put buyers than expected out there in  so far today.  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Commit To Purchase Seattle Genetics At $50, Earn 10.6% Annualized Using Options@2017-05-26@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/commit-purchase-seattle-genetics-50-earn-106-annualized-using-options-2017-05-26
 announced that it will discontinue the phase III study, CASCADE o vadastuximab talirine (SGN-CD33A) in frontline older acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. The company took this decision after consulting the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) and after the review of data on Jun 16, 2017.The data demonstrated higher number of deaths including fatal infections in vadastuximab talirine-containing arm versus control arm of trial. The company stated the safety concern in the trial did not appear related to hepatotoxicity. The company is discontinuing the patient enrollment and treatment in all of its vadastuximab talirine clinical trials. The company will closely review data and consult with FDA to determine future plans for vadastuximab talirine development program.The shares of the company fell about 4% following the news. Seattle Genetics outperformed the Zacks classified  industry year to date. The stock jumped almost 17.3% while the industry gained 6.4%.Earlier in Dec 2016, the FDA had placed a partial clinical hold on two phase I trials to evaluate the potential risk of liver toxicity in patients treated with vadastuximab talirine of vadastuximab talirine in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The clinical hold was initiated to evaluate a potential risk on patients who underwent a stem cell transplant either before or after the treatment. However, the FDA lifted the clinical hold in Mar 2017. The clinical hold on vadastuximab talirine was resolved through an analysis of the clinical data from over 300 patients treated to date and evaluated by an independent committee of clinical experts, collaborative interactions with the FDA and protocol amendments designed to further enhance patient safety.The discontinuation of the trial is a key pipeline setback for the company. Consequently, the company will focus on other pipeline candidates. The company remains on track to release data from the Adcetris' phase III ECHELON-1 trial in frontline Hodgkin lymphoma, and to advance enfortumab vedotin into a pivotal trial in metastatic urothelial cancer in the second half of 2017 under its collaboration with Astellas Pharma Inc.  . | Seattle Genetics currently carries a Zacks Rank#3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in health care sector include VIVUS, Inc.  and MEI Pharma, Inc.  sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

 reported a loss of 42 cents per share for the first quarter of 2017, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 41 cents and the year-ago loss of 15 cents per share.Revenues came in at $109.1 million, down 1.8% year over year, primarily due to lower royalty revenues from the sales of Adcetris. Revenues, however, beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $103.3 million.Seattle Genetics' share price has gained 29.1% year to date compared with the Zacks classified  industry's rise of 4.8% in the same period.Seattle Genetics' top line comprises product revenues, collaboration and license agreement revenues and royalties.The company's only marketed product, Adcetris, generated revenues of $70.3 million, up 20% year over year.Collaboration and license agreement revenues increased 8.2% to almost $21.8 million. Collaboration revenues included fees earned from the company's agreement with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd. for Adcetris and other ADC collaborations.Royalty revenues declined 47.5% year over year to $16.98 million. The decline was due to unfavorable year-over-year comparisons. The company had received a milestone payment of $20 million from Takeda in the first quarter of 2016 on international sales of Adcetris.Research and development (R&D) expenses were $118.2 million, up 27.3% year over year. Also, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 29.1% to $38.4 million. Costs were high primarily due to investment in vadastuximabtalirine, Adcetris collaboration activities for product supply to Takeda and pipeline development.In its call, the company asserted that there was no erosion of its share in the relapsed HL business despite the FDA approval for Merck & Co., Inc.'s  Keytruda as the second PD-1 inhibitor for the treatment of relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma in Mar 2017.The company reiterated its outlook for net sales of Adectris to be in the range of $280 million to $300 million. Although the company expects royalty revenues to decrease in the second quarter, it continues to expect it in the range of $50 million to $55 million for the full year.Seattle Genetics continues to work on expanding Adcetris' label further through 3 phase III trials. We note that the company reported positive data from ALCANZA phase III study recently and is planning to submit a supplemental Biologics License Application (BLA) by mid-2017.The company expects top-line data from the phase III ECHELON-1 study (frontline classical Hodgkin lymphoma) during 2017 while top-line data from the ECHELON-2 study (frontline CD30-expressing mature T-cell lymphoma) should be out in 2018 (previously expected in the 2017 to 2018 timeframe).In addition, the company continues to enroll patients in the phase III study on vadastuximabtalirine in combination with hypomethylating agents in older patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia. Also, the company plans to start a phase II study in younger patients with newly diagnosed AML in the second half of 2017.While the company missed bottom line expectations, sales came in ahead of estimates in the first quarter of 2017. With the approval of Keytruda, investors should focus on Adcetris sales in the upcoming quarters. However, the FDA has lifted the clinical hold on two phase I trials of its candidate, vadastuximabtalirine in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in March. | Seattle Genetics carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A couple of better-ranked stocks in the health care sector include Heska Corporation  and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  .

riday was a solid day on Wall Street, as major market benchmarks all posted modest advances to end the week on a positive note. Investors still had some worries, including this weekend's runoff election in France, but strong numbers on the U.S. employment front and a rebound in the oil sector helped improve market sentiment. Moreover, several key companies enjoyed favorable news, and  (NASDAQ: IMMU) ,  (NASDAQ: MELI) , and  (NYSE: PSO) were among the best performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so well.Shares of Immunomedics climbed 17.5% after the biopharmaceutical company announced a change in its core strategic vision going forward. The company said that it would terminate its previously announced licensing agreement with  (NASDAQ: SGEN) , which will result in Immunomedics regaining full control over its breast cancer candidate therapy sacituzumab govitecan, also known as IMMU-132. In addition, Immunomedics said it had raised $125 million from a private offering of preferred stock, and it presented a timeline for the future development of IMMU-132 to include submission of a biologics license application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration either toward the end of this year or the beginning of 2018. At the same time, a phase 3 study to confirm results will proceed, with expectations for a potential U.S. launch of the drug next year. Finally, CEO Cynthia Sullivan will step down, with CFO Michael Garone taking the role of interim CEO. Investors approve of the new strategy, and the move puts the onus on Immunomedics to make the most of its pipeline going forward.Image source: Getty Images.MercadoLibre stock climbed 16% in the wake of strong first-quarter financial results. The Latin American e-commerce giant reported revenue growth of 74%, which pushed net income up by three-fifths. Exceptional performance came from MercadoLibre's core marketplace business, as well as from ongoing explosive growth at its MercadoPago electronic payment service and its MercadoEnvios shipping services unit. Economic rebounds in Brazil and Mexico were highlights of the quarter, and the long-term story for MercadoLibre remains the same: Counting on a rising consumer middle class in Latin America to bolster the level of e-commerce traffic and confirm MercadoLibre's status as the top player in a budding new market.Finally, shares of Pearson finished up 13%. The British educational publishing company issued an update on its first-quarter performance that also included information on its ongoing restructuring efforts. Pearson reported that first-quarter sales were up 6%, led by its North American higher education business. Yet even though the company has already reaped about 650 million British pounds in costs from restructuring efforts, Pearson thinks it can get another 300 million pounds every year by the end of 2019. In addition, the publisher said that it will engage in a strategic review of its options with respect to its U.S. K-12 courseware publishing unit, which it said has seen sluggish adoption rates in a competitive environment. Investors liked the idea of further simplification for Pearson, which seems to be a trend in several sectors of the economy right now.

 (NASDAQ: SGEN) reported solid first-quarter earnings on Thursday, but the potential expansion of Adcetris into treating patients in other cancer settings and the development of the rest of the biotech's pipeline are what investors are mainly focused on.Data source: Seattle Genetics.Image source: Getty Images.Clay Siegall, Seattle Genetics' chairman, CEO, and president, explained why the company delayed filing for approval of Adcetris in patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) using the ALCANZA trial:In other words, the added data could result in more CTCL patients approved to take Adcetris, producing more sales in the long term that should more than make up for the short-term lost sales from the delayed approval.Adcetris has gotten more competition for patients with refractory Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) after the recent approvals of  's (NYSE: BMY) Opdivo and  's (NYSE: MRK) Keytruda, but Darren Cline, Seattle Genetics' EVP of commercial, doesn't see the new drugs as a threat:Seattle Genetics has a lot of potential, but investors are going to have to be patient this year, with most of the value-driving events happening in the latter half of the year.The application to treat CTCL patients with Adcetris won't come until the middle of this year, so an approval probably won't arrive until late 2017 or possibly even next year. The ECHELON-1 phase 3 trial in frontline Hodgkin lymphoma is supposed to wrap up this year, but management hasn't given any more specifics on timing -- suggesting that it's likely to come in the latter half of the year.Two pipeline drugs -- vadastuximab talirine and enfortumab vedotin -- are progressing nicely toward potential approvals. But vadastuximab talirine is still enrolling the phase 3 trial required to gain regulatory approval, and the registration trial for enfortumab vedotin won't start until the second half of this year.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

 (NASDAQ: IMMU) is up 18% at 1:11 p.m. EDT after announcing a new plan to develop sacituzumab govitecan on its own, a capital raise, and management stepping down.In February, Immunomedics licensed sacituzumab govitecan, which also goes by the codename IMMU-132, to  (NASDAQ: SGEN) . But activist investor venBio Select Advisor thought the deal undervalued the cancer drug and sued to stop the transaction from going through and won a temporary restraining order. venBio also gained four seats on the board, allowing it to proceed with its plans.Image source: Getty Images.Today, Immunomedics announced that it will terminate the deal with Seattle Genetics. The bigger biotech gets to hold onto the shares and warrants in Immunomedics that were part of the deal. The stock was purchased at $4.90 per share, so at today's share price, Seattle Genetics got a pretty good return on its investment. Nevertheless, shares of Seattle Genetics are down 3%, suggesting that investors thought Seattle Genetics was getting a good deal in licensing sacituzumab govitecan.Immunomedics thinks that it will be able to apply for accelerated approval from the Food and Drug Administration in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) at the end of this year or early next year based on the an ongoing phase 2 study of sacituzumab govitecan in third-line TNBC. The company plans to start a phase 3 trial in the third quarter, which will be used to gain full approval.To fund the new internal initiatives, Immunomedics sold $125 million in a private placement that valued the preferred stock at yesterday's closing price.Finally, President and CEO Cynthia Sullivan and David Goldenberg, who founded the company and acts as its chief scientific officer and chief patent officer, are stepping down, although Goldenberg will remain on the board. Immunomedics CFO Michael Garone will assume the role of interim CEO.Going it alone is a riskier move for Immunomedics' shareholders, but will benefit them more in the long run if the company can get accelerated approval based on the phase 2 data. If the FDA wants phase 3 data before approving the drug, the delay in getting a revenue stream and additional cost of the phase 3 program that Seattle Genetics would have paid for may result in further shareholder dilution to raise additional capital.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

 announced that the European Commission (EC) has approved immuno-oncology drug Opdivo for the treatment of locally advanced unresectable or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) in adults after failure of prior platinum-containing therapy.Opdivo is approved for varied indications around the world like metastatic melanoma, metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) among others. The FDA approved Opdivo for the treatment of patients with previously treated locally advanced or mUC in Feb 2017.Concurrently, Bristol-Myers entered into a collaboration agreement with Seattle Genetics, Inc.  to evaluate the combination of Opdivo and Seattle Genetics' antibody drug conjugate (ADC) Adcetris in a phase III trial as a potential treatment option for patients with relapsed/refractory or transplant-ineligible advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). The trial will being in mid-2017.Also, Bristol-Myers presented a series of data on Opdivo from various ongoing trials at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting 2017.The company announced data from a cohort of the phase I/II study, CheckMate-358 evaluating Opdivo for the treatment of patients with advanced cervical, vaginal and vulvar cancers, associated with infection by the human papillomavirus (HPV). The data showed an overall response rate of 26.3% in patients with cervical cancer regardless of PD-L1, HPV status and number of prior systemic therapies.Bristol-Myers also announced encouraging proof-of-concept data showing preliminary efficacy for BMS-986016, an investigational anti-lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG-3) therapy in combination with Opdivo in patients with advanced melanoma previously treated with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. The data demonstrated encouraging activity of BMS-986016 and Opdivo combination in heavily pretreated advanced melanoma patients who were relapsed or refractory on anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. The objective response rate (ORR) was 12.5% in evaluable patients in the ongoing expansion study of heavily pretreated patients who were refractory to or relapsed on anti-PD1/PDL1 therapy.Bristol-Myers also announced interim data from a phase II study, CheckMate-142, evaluating Opdivo monotherapy or in combination with Yervoy for the treatment of patients with DNA mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). The primary endpoint of investigator-assessed ORR was 54.8%. The median duration of response was not yet reached.The nine-month overall survival (OS) rate was 87.6% and median OS had not been reached at the time of analysis. We remind investors that Opdivo in combination with Yervoy is already approved for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma in the U.S.Efficacy and safety data from another phase II study, CheckMate-204, which is evaluating the combination of Opdivo plus Yervoy as a potential treatment for patients with melanoma metastatic to the brain showed anti-tumor activity. The data showed over half of patients (55%) experienced an intracranial objective response with 21% achieving a complete intracranial response.The company also announced results of an interim descriptive analysis from an ongoing National Cancer Institute (NCI) phase III randomized study evaluating Yervoy (ipilimumab) 3 mg/kg and Yervoy10 mg/kg in patients with stage III or resectable stage IV melanoma who are at high risk of recurrence following complete surgical resection. The data showed that relapse-free survival after three years was 56% for Yervoy 3 mg/kg and 54% for Yervoy 10 mg/kg.In a separate news, Bristol-Myers signed an agreement with Qiagen  to explore the use of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology to develop gene expression profiles (GEPs) as predictive or prognostic tools for use with its novel immuno-oncology (I-O) therapies in cancer treatment. Both the companies intend to develop GEPs for several Bristol-Myers' I-O molecules under the initial agreement. Per the terms of the deal, both the companies will also develop diagnostic products using the jointly developed GEPs and to expand the use of NGS technology with other Bristol-Myers' I-O therapies.We note that Opdivo became the first PD-1 inhibitor to be approved for a hematological malignancy - classic Hodgkin lymphoma in both the U.S. (May 2016) and the EU (Nov 2016).In Nov 2016, Opdivo gained the FDA approval for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck with disease progression on or after platinum-based therapy.Label expansion into additional indications would give the product access to a higher patient population and increase the commercial potential of the drug.However, the company suffered a setback in Jan 2017 when it decided not to pursue accelerated regulatory pathway for the regimen of Opdivo plus Yervoy in first-line lung cancer in the U.S. based on a review of available data.Opdivo is facing competitive challenges in the U.S. With the FDA approving Merck's  Keytruda, for the first-line treatment of metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC, the company is expected to suffer further loss of market share.While Bristol-Myers' share price decreased 29.4% in the last 12 months, the Zacks classified industry gained 2.4%.While Bristol-Myers' share price decreased 29.4% in the last 12 months, the Zacks classified  industry gained 2.4%.Bristol-Myers currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see  .Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

"hareholders of small-cap biotech  (NASDAQ: IMMU) have had an absolutely blowout 2017 with shares up over 89% in the first 4 months of this year alone. The combination of a shareholder activist along with a potential licensing deal has pushed share prices to highs unseen since 2013. So will the stock continue to skyrocket? I for one don't think so. But first, in order to divine this company's future, it's necessary to take a look back at what brought this company to where it is today.Immunomedics is a clinical-stage biotech developing what are called antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) for the treatment of various forms of cancer. ADCs are in essence chemotherapy attached to a targeting monoclonal antibody. Unlike traditional chemotherapy, which affects all cells (both normal and cancerous), by binding a chemotherapy agent to a highly targeted antibody, ADCs are able to differentiate between healthy and diseased tissue and thereby deliver their toxic payloads directly onto cancerous cells. In this way, ADCs have the potential to destroy cancerous tissue while leaving normal, healthy tissue intact.Image source: Getty Images.Immunomedics most advanced ADC is IMMU-132 or ""sacituzumab govitecan."" In early 2016, following a successful phase 2 trial of IMMU-132 in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), IMMU-132 was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for the treatment of patients with TNBC who have failed at least two prior therapies. This designation is designed to expedite the development and review of drugs which treat life-threatening diseases or conditions.TNBC is a serious disease which affects an estimated 40,000 people in the U.S. annually. This type of cancer is particularly aggressive, with a median overall survival (OS) time between 10 and 13 months and a median progression-free-survival (PFS) usually between 3 and 4 months. There is currently no single standard chemotherapy treatment for patients with relapsed TNBC.In a phase 2 study conducted in 69 TNBC patients, the company reported that IMMU-132 led to a PFS of 6 months and an OS of 16.6 months. On the backs of this strong phase 2 data, the company announced that they plan to submit an application to the FDA for IMMU-132 for the treatment of metastatic TNBC in mid-2017.The company is also planning to initiate a phase 3 confirmatory trial for IMMU-132 in TNBC this year.While IMMU-132 was successful in phase 2, phase 3 trials are expensive -- often costing in the hundreds of millions of dollars. With only $5 million in cash and cash equivalents, Immunomedics struck up a licensing deal with the larger  (NASDAQ: SGEN) . As terms of the deal, Seattle Genetics would pay Immunomedics $250 million upfront for rights to IMMU-132 and up to an additional $1.7 billion in milestone payments.While this deal may seem good on the surface, VenBio, a biotech-focused hedge fund which owns around 10% of Immunomedics does not seem to agree. VenBio has called the deal ""poorly constructed"" and not in the best interest of Immunomedics shareholders. Therefore, on March 9 th , it was announced that VenBio filed suit against the deal which resulted in a 30 day hold wherein the deal was halted. As shares of Immunomedics rose almost 20% on this announcement, it seems the market believes a higher bid may be coming.While IMMU-132 did show promising results in phase 2, it is important to remember that this was only a phase 2 trial of 69 patients. Though the FDA will most likely allow for Immunomedics (and possibly Seattle Genetics) to file for approval of IMMU-132 on the back of phase 2 data alone, should the phase 3 trial fail, this approval could potentially be rescinded. In addition, while a larger bid may come forth, Seattle Genetics may also take the opportunity to walk away from the table. For myself, I would say that there are too many unknowns with this investment. For now, I'd stay on the sidelines.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

 (NASDAQ: IMMU) fell 13% today, after The Fly reported that Immunomedics told an Jefferies analyst that the biotech won't report data for its cancer drug sacituzumab govitecan, which also goes by the code name IMMU-132, at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in June.Biotech investors often jump into stocks ahead of data releases and then move on, so it isn't particularly surprising that the lack of a binary event would cause shares to decline even if it doesn't change Immunomedics' underlying valuation.Sacituzumab govitecan is in a phase 2 trial that's testing the drug in different types of solid tumors. Just last month, the company presented data for the drug in patients with metastatic small-cell lung cancer. The drug produced an objective response rate of 14%, which isn't that great, but the rate was slightly better (17%) for patients taking the higher dose, and these are patients who have failed a median of 2 prior lines of therapy, so any benefit is promising.Image source: Getty Images.In breast cancer, sacituzumab govitecan looks even better with an objective response rate of 30% in heavily pretreated patients, according to data published in March.Nevertheless, biotech investors live in a what-will-you-do-for-me-tomorrow world.Today's drop offers an opportunity to get shares of Immunomedics at a discounted price, but investors should keep in mind that the company is still in a  with venBio Select Advisor over the terms of its licensing deal with  (NASDAQ: SGEN) for sacituzumab govitecan. Even with today's drop, shares are still higher than where they were before venBio stepped onto the scene, and presumably could return to that level if venBio doesn't get its way.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"hareholders of small-cap biotech  (NASDAQ: IMMU) have been through a rollercoaster ride so far in 2017. Activist hedge fund VenBio has been stirring the pot over a perceived ""shameful"" deal between Immunomedics and  (NASDAQ: SGEN) . So as the boardroom brawl continues, will this red hot biotech be able to climb higher? I for one, don't believe so, but let's dig deeper.Immunomedics is a clinical-stage biotech developing treatments for various forms of cancer. Immunomedics' most advanced product is IMMU-132 or sacituzumab govitecan. In early 2016, this product was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation on the back of strong phase 2 data for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).Following the release of highly positive phase 2 data, the company announced that they plan to submit a Biological License Application (BLA) for IMMU-132 to the FDA as a treatment for metastatic TNBC in mid-2017. In addition, while the company believes the phase 2 data alone should be sufficient for approval, the company is also planning to initiate a phase 3 confirmatory trial for IMMU-132 in TNBC later on this year.Image source: Getty Images.Unfortunately, phase 3 trials are expensive. Long-term cancer studies can often run into the hundreds of million of dollars to run. IMMU-132's breakthrough designation means that the FDA will allow Immunomedics to submit a BLA on phase 2 data alone, but the company will still need to run a phase 3 confirmatory trial. As Immunogen ended 2016 with only $5 million in cash and cash equivalents, the company has been looking for a licensing partnership in order to fund the continuing trials of this drug.Last month, it seems that partnership came in the form of  (NASDAQ: SGEN) , which agreed to pay $250 million upfront for the rights to IMMU-132 plus a series of milestone payments which could bring to total payout to $2 billion. This deal would put Seattle Genetics in the driver's seat in terms of progressing IMMU-132 through clinical trials for both TNBC as well as several other forms of cancer. If all goes well, IMMU-132 could be ready for commercialization within the next 12 months.Sounds like a great deal right? Apparently, VenBio, a biotech-focused hedge fund which owns roughly 10% of Immunomedics, does not think so.As part of the agreement between the two companies, Seattle Genetics has agreed to purchase a 2.8% share in Immunomedics. However, Seattle Genetics also has the option of increasing its stake to 9.9% at a cost basis of $4.90 per share. VenBio has calculated the intrinsic value of Immunomedics at around $9.40 per share, and shares currently trade at $6.90. Giving Seattle Genetics the option to purchase up to 9.9% of the company at $4.90 per share would represent a 52% discount to VenBio's intrinsic valuation of the company. This would have the net effect of destroying value for shareholders other than Seattle Genetics.As Dr. Aghazadeh, managing partner of VenBio, said in a press release, ""Immunomedics' announcement of a deal with Seattle Genetics is a blatant and shameful maneuver by the current Board and management to... entrench themselves at the expense of stockholders' best interests.""In order to combat this deal, on March 3, during Immunomedics' annual shareholder meeting, VenBio was able to successfully nominate and vote in four VenBio representatives onto the Immunomedic's board of advisors. At the time, it was the assumption that VenBio would use its newfound influence to unwind the agreement between Immunomedics and Seattle Genetics.It appeared VenBio was temporarily successful in their efforts when, on March 9, it was announced that VenBio brought a legal injunction in order to postpone the deal between Immunomedics and Seattle Genetics. On the day of the announcement, shares of Immunomedics jumped almost 20% -- suggesting that the market believes a higher bid may come in the future. As for the deal, according to the ruling, the partnership agreement between Immunomedics and Seattle Genetics cannot proceed for 30 days following the ruling.While Immunomedics has made it clear that they are looking to license out the rights to IMMU-132, and IMMU-132 did demonstrate promising results in phase 2, this is no guarantee that a higher bid will be coming for this product in the future. As of now, the market appears to believe that VenBio may be able to negotiate a higher bid. However, in the world of biotech, a bird in hand is always preferable to two in the bush. For me, I'd say there are too many unknowns to invest. I'd stay away from Immunomedics for now.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

illionaire investors didn't amass their fortunes by picking horrible stocks. While you wouldn't want to blindly copy these successful investors, it certainly doesn't hurt to watch which stocks they choose and how those stocks perform.I looked at the portfolios of several of the wealthiest investors in the country to see how their healthcare stock picks are faring in 2017. The billionaires' best healthcare stocks so far this year include  (NASDAQ: IMMU) ,  (NASDAQ: AKAO) ,  (NASDAQ: AVXS) ,  (NASDAQ: EXAS) , and  (NASDAQ: CLVS) . Here's why these healthcare stocks favored by the super-rich are performing so well.Image source: Getty Images.Steven Cohen's Point72 Asset Management fund owns shares of Immunomedics. Shares of the clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company have soared more than 70% since the beginning of 2017.There have been two primary factors driving Immunomedics stock recently. Immunomedics licensed IMMU-132 to  (NASDAQ: SGEN) . The agreement also allows Seattle Genetics to buy a 9.9% stake in Immunomedics.However, the other factor involves activist investor group venBio Select Advisor, LLC, which filed a lawsuit to block the Seattle Genetics deal and has made a play to get four slots on the company's board of directors. The continuing drama has Immunomedics investors contemplating an even more lucrative agreement with Seattle Genetics or perhaps a sale of the company.Achaogen is a healthcare favorite of three billionaire investors -- Steven Cohen, Paul Tudor Jones, and James Simons. The biotech's stock price has shot up more than 60% year to date and at one point more than doubled.Investors are still celebrating Achaogen's great late-stage clinical study results for plazomicin. In December, the company announced that primary endpoints were met in two phase 3 studies of the antibiotic.Achaogen expects to file for regulatory approval to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in the second half of 2017. Analysts project that plazomicin could reach peak annual sales of $340 million if approved.Cohen's Point72 Asset Management also owns another big winner so far this year -- Exact Sciences. The molecular diagnostics company's stock is up nearly 60% year to date.The big story for Exact Sciences has been wider acceptance for its Cologuard DNA test for colorectal cancer. In January, the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association released a positive review for Cologuard. That's great news, since the association represents 36 Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans that together cover one out of three Americans.Exact Sciences' fourth-quarter and full-year 2016 results announced in February added to investors' excitement. The company reported revenue growth in 2016 of 152%, with Cologuard test volume up 35%.Cohen scored yet again with AveXis. The clinical-stage biotech's stock has jumped nearly 70% so far this year.AveXis recently announced positive top-line results from its phase 1 study of AVXS-101 in treating spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type 1. AVXS-101 is the first gene therapy to be studied for the indication. (NASDAQ: BIIB) won approval for its SMA drug, Spinraza, in December. The big biotech has admitted that it's keeping a close watch on its smaller potential rival. The success for AVXS-101 is no doubt fueling speculation that Biogen might have an acquisition of AveXis in mind down the road.James Simons' Renaissance Technologies has a stake in Clovis Oncology. That investment has done well in 2017, with shares of the biotech up nearly 60%.Clovis' ovarian cancer drug Rubraca got off to a good start after winning FDA approval in December. The biotech expects an approval recommendation in Europe in the fourth quarter of this year.Good news for  (NYSE: AZN) also translated to a nice bump for Clovis. AstraZeneca reported positive late-stage results for its ovarian cancer drug, Lynparza, in March. Investors appeared to be anticipating that Clovis could get positive results from additional studies of Rubraca based on AstraZeneca's results.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

" (NASDAQ: IMMU) ended the day up 19.5% after a judge ruled that the biotech can't close its deal with  (NASDAQ: SGEN) quite yet.The stock price going up after the deal was temporarily blocked may seem counterintuitive considering the deal for IMMU-132 was pretty solid, with Immunomedics getting $250 million upfront plus other milestone payments that could make the deal worth about $2 billion. And Seattle Genetics is also on the hook for royalty payments if the drug is eventually approved.But investors are clearly betting that the judge pausing the deal for 30 days will ultimately result in a better deal -- or perhaps a full sale of the company at a higher price. venBio Select Advisor, which brought the lawsuit to stop the deal, claiming that it was a bad deal for shareholders, is moving to take over the board.Earlier this month, the activist investor announced that its four nominees had enough votes to be elected to the board. Immunomedics countered with claims that venBio had ""interfered with the voting franchise of Immunomedics' stockholders and has irreparably tainted the potential outcome of the company's 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.""Image source: Getty Images.Investors should be careful jumping into this board-fight soap opera. It seems like a bit of a gamble to bet on venBio being able to find another company willing to pay more to license IMMU-132 or an outright purchase of the company. If Seattle Genetics got such a good deal, you'd expect its share price to fall on the news, but the biotech ended the day down just 0.5%.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

hursday marked the eighth anniversary of the beginning of the current bull market in stocks. Back in 2009, investors thought that the financial crisis might result in the end of financial markets worldwide, but instead, stocks bounced back, and major market benchmarks have since tripled or more from their lows. Today, investors celebrated the market milestone in a relatively calm way, with only minor moves from popular indexes. But some stocks did much better, and  (NYSE: MRO) ,  (NYSE: SIG) , and  (NASDAQ: IMMU) were among the best performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so well.Shares of Marathon Oil climbed 8% after the oil and gas exploration and production company made some strategic moves to shift the focus of its business efforts. Marathon acquired 70,000 net surface acres in the Permian Basin, spending $1.1 billion to make the purchase from a privately held energy company. The acquisition includes more than 50,000 net acres in the northern Delaware Basin region of the Permian, and along with the deal, Marathon said that it had separately agreed to sell its Canadian oil sands stake to a venture composed of  (NYSE: RDS-A) and  (NYSE: CNQ) for $2.5 billion. In combination, the moves put Marathon more squarely into Texas and away from Canada, and investors seem to think that's the right play for the oil company going forward.Image source: Marathon Oil.Signet Jewelers stock rose 9% in the wake of the company's fourth-quarter financial report. The jeweler said that same-store sales fell 4.5% during the fourth quarter, but adjusted earnings of $4.03 per share were relatively strong. CEO Mark Light noted that the company has had to adapt to a tough environment in retail and poor mall traffic levels, but it believes that the integration of the Zale's chain has gone well. Separately, the company also said that it would create a new board committee aimed at supporting female employees, and an independent review of Signet's business practices will ensure equal opportunity and workplace expectations in line with correct practices. The moves are likely in response to allegations of sexual harassment that hit the jeweler recently, and with the stock having lost a third of its value just since the beginning of the year, some traders attributed the move more to short-covering than to any fundamental improvement in Signet's business.Finally, shares of Immunomedics jumped 19%. Investors were pleased about a Delaware court ruling that ordered a temporary injunction against a deal that the biopharmaceutical company made with  (NASDAQ: SGEN) , in which Immunomedics was to license cancer-fighting drug IMMU-132, currently in late-stage clinical trials. Opponents of the move had argued that the deal was too cheap, with Immunomedics to get just $250 million in cash and up to $1.7 billion in milestone payments and royalties from Seattle Genetics depending on what happens with IMMU-132 in the future. With activist investors at venBio Select Advisor having won a proxy contest to take control of Immunomedics' board, shareholders are hoping that a better deal could give the company more potential upside from IMMU-132 going forward.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"mmunomedics, Inc.  stock soared in midday trading Thursday following the stop on the company's deal with Seattle Genetics  after the lawsuit filed by Immunomedics' largest investor, venBio Select Advisor LLC,  by Immunomedics is up 16.4% at $5.85 per share.The deal with Seattle Genetics was announced on Feb. 10. The activist firm, venBio, claimed the deal provides little value to the IMMU shareholders. Seattle Genetics agreed to pay $250million in cash for the rights to IMMU-132, a cancer treatment drug. Besides the $250 million, Seattle Genetics also agreed to royalties on IMMU-132 sales and an additional $1.7 billion in back-end milestone payments to IMMU.Despite being the largest shareholder with 9.9% in IMMU, venBio just came into power after electing four venBio's nominees onto IMMU's board during their 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders last Friday.The annual meeting was delayed twice due to legal pursuit against venBio by IMMU on behalf of all stockholders. IMMU believed that venBio had unlawfully interfered with the voting process and sought for emergency relief. The Court denied IMMU's recent motion for emergency relief and said the meeting will go forward, and if IMMU can prove the result was tainted, then the court will exercise its right to void the result of the Annual Meeting.The biopharmaceutical company believes the partnership with Seattle Genetics will provide a low-risk environment to develop and market IMMU-132. The company also believes this is in the best interest of all stockholders.It looked like stockholders sided with venBios.""We are very pleased with the preliminary results of today's vote, which clearly show that stockholders agree that real change is needed at IMMU,"" said Dr. Behzad Aghazadeh, Managing Partner and portfolio manager at venBio, in press release.In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest tickers for the entirety of 2017?Who wouldn't?

 announced that the FDA has lifted the clinical hold on two phase I trials of its candidate, vadastuximab talirine (SGN-CD33A; 33A).Vadastuximab talirine is an early stage candidate that is being developed for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML).The partial clinical hold was implemented in Dec 2016 to evaluate the potential risk of liver toxicity in patients treated with vadastuximab talirine, who underwent a stem cell transplant either before or after the treatment.Seattle Genetics outperformed the Zacks classified  industry year to date. The stock jumped almost 27.1% during this period while the industry gained 6.9%.The clinical hold on vadastuximab talirine was resolved through an analysis of the clinical data from over 300 patients treated to date and evaluated by an independent committee of clinical experts, collaborative interactions with the FDA and protocol amendments designed to further enhance patient safety.Consequently, Seattle Genetics will resume two phase I trials of vadastuximab talirine. The first trial will be a combination treatment with standard of care, or 7+3, chemotherapy in newly diagnosed younger AML patients. The second is monotherapy and combination treatment with hypomethylating agents in both newly diagnosed and relapsed AML patients.Meanwhile, the company continues to enroll patients in the phase III CASCADE study in frontline older AML patients and in a phase I/II study in frontline high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). | Seattle Genetics currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

"he ability to develop game-changing new drugs that revolutionize patient care could cause shares in  (NYSE: AXON) ,  (NASDAQ: CLDX) , and  (NASDAQ: ESPR) to soar. However, success may be tough to come by, and that makes investing in these stocks a boom or bust proposition.Axovant is trying to do something that most biopharma companies have failed to accomplish: develop a new Alzheimer's disease drug. Alzheimer's disease is notoriously tough to tackle, and the success rate for developing drugs targeting it is absolutely disheartening. Historically, over 99% of Alzheimer's disease drugs entering clinical trials end up in the dustbin.Image source: Getty Images.Odds like that make investing in Alzheimer's disease drug developers like Axovant risky business, but there are two reasons why investors might want to lean optimistic. First, Axovant's C-suite includes Lawrence Friedhoff, who led the development of Aricept, one of the best-selling Alzheimer's disease drugs of all time. Second, Axovant's lead drug in development -- intepirdine -- is being studied for use  Aricept, rather than on its own.In trials, Friedhoff's team successfully proved that Aricept can prevent the breakdown of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that's lacking in Alzheimer's disease patients, and now he hopes his team can prove that intepirdine boosts acetycholine production. If successful, then a combination approach of these drugs that increases acetylcholine levels and allows acetylcholine to last longer in the brain could become standard care.According to ClinicalTrials.gov, the estimated completion date for this combination study is October, so we should have data to examine before the end of this year. To be considered a success, the approach will need to meet primary endpoints measuring the change in baseline at 24 weeks on two Alzheimer disease measurement scales: the ADAS-Cog-11 and the ADCS-ADL.Undeniably, the history of drug development in Alzheimer's disease suggests that Axovant's chances for success are small. However, the potential payoff could be tremendous. Axovant's market cap is only $1.1 billion, and prior to losing patent protection, Aricept's peak sales were $2.4 billion per year.Celldex is developing glembatumumab vedotin, or glemba, a drug that could offer new hope to patients with a tough-to-treat type of breast cancer known as triple negative.Triple negative breast cancer isn't the most common form of this cancer, but tens of thousands of patients are still diagnosed with it, and unfortunately, current treatments often fall short in tackling it.Glemba hopes to change that by delivering a toxic drug payload directly to cancer cells. It does that by targeting a protein commonly over-expressed by cancer cells, binding to it, and then releasing chemotherapy that can kill the cell. It works similarly to  ' Adcetris, a drug that's already won FDA approval for use in a rare form of blood cancer. Celldex acquired licensing rights to Seattle Genetics' intellectual property when it bought CuraGen for $94.5 million in 2009.Celldex hasn't said exactly when it expects to report data from its triple-negative breast cancer trial, but it has said that enrollment in its trial is continuing, and that results could be available this year.If glemba is proven to be effective and safe, then it could gain approval pretty quickly, and if so, it could become a commercial success. A win like that would be a nice change for Celldex investors, many of whom lost money when a trial evaluating another one of its drugs fell short in brain cancer last year. Guess-timating peak sales is probably a fool's errand, especially since glemba's being studied in other indications that could significantly alter any projections, but industry watchers have said they think glemba could be a billion-dollar blockbuster.Roger Newton isn't just Esperion Therapeutics' founder; he's also the person who developed Lipitor, the world's best selling cholesterol-busting drug, and the person behind the original Esperion Therapeutics, which got bought by  for $1.3 billion in 2003.Nowadays, Newton's reassembled a lot of the ""old"" Esperion team at the current Esperion Therapeutics to see if they can knock bad cholesterol levels lower. The company's only drug in development is bempedoic acid, a phase 3 stage oral drug that can be used alongside traditional statins, like Lipitor, to reduce bad cholesterol levels. In phase 2 studies, adding bempedoic acid to statin therapy lowered bad cholesterol by about an additional 20%.Esperion Therapeutics is conducting a large phase 3 efficacy trial to confirm the phase 2 findings, and it's also running a cardiovascular outcome study that it hopes will prove that bempedoic acid improves patient outcomes. Earlier this week, management told investors that enrollment in the efficacy trial was completed in January, and that suggests that it will be able to report data sometime in 2018. The company continues to enroll patients in its outcomes study.If the company delivers a win in its efficacy trial, its still a bit unclear whether or not FDA regulators will hold off on approval until the outcomes study is complete. In 2015, the FDA originally said bempedoic acid could win approval without the outcome data, however, the regulator later changed its tune, suggesting it would be required for it to win approval in anything but genetically caused cases of high cholesterol.Nevertheless, any eventual approval of bempedoic acid could make it the biggest seller of all three of the drugs I've highlighted. Over 70 million Americans have high cholesterol, and despite widespread use of statins in tens of millions of Americans, heart disease remains the most common cause of death in the United States. At its peak, Lipitor was hauling in about $13 billion in sales annually, and if bempedoic acid ends up being prescribed alongside statins in most patients, Esperion Therapeutics could end up with a megablockbuster on its hands.However, there's no guarantee that the efficacy and outcomes data will be strong enough to convince regulators to approve bempedoic acid, and an outright failure in these trials could prove disastrous to investors because it's the company's only clinical-stage drug. Because this stock is a long shot, risk-averse investors might be better off looking elsewhere.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Esperion Therapeutics wasn't one of them!

"Chicago, IL - February 27, 2017 -  highlights  (NYSE:  -  ) as the Bull of the Day  (NASDAQ:  -  ) as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on  (NASDAQ:  -  ),  (NASDAQ:  -  ) and  (NASDAQ:  -  ).Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Over the past 8 years, the coal industry has been hampered by massive regulations, and a not so friendly relationship with the presidential administration. But this is going to change, according to our new President Donald Trump. President Trump envisions a coal resurgence under his administration. Further, President Trump is in the process of eliminating some of the burdensome regulations imposed on the industry. And one coal company, that is poised to take advantage of these changes, is our Zacks Bull of the Day,  (NYSE:  -  ).This Zacks Ranked #1 (Strong Buy) company is engaged in the mining, processing and marketing of low-sulfur bituminous coal. The Company sells its coal primarily to electric utilities in the eastern United States. The Company also exports coal, primarily to European customers.Management announced Q4 16 earnings on February 8th where they absolutely destroyed the Zacks consensus earnings estimate; expectations were for $0.03, and they came in at $1.65, a +5,400% positive surprise. The company easily beat the Zacks consensus revenue estimate as well. Coming out of restructuring, management was able to eliminate nearly $4.8 billion of debt obligations, and reduced annual interest expenses by $330 million.According to John W. Eaves, Arch's chief executive officer, ""  .""Further, John T. Drexler, Arch's senior vice president and chief financial officer, stated, ""  ."" :At times a biomedical, pharma, or a medical company has one very strong drug or product that enables the company to research and develop other new drugs while their primary drug is bringing in the necessary revenues. But when your big drug starts to see a significant decline in expected sales, no matter how good your pipeline is, it begins to negatively impact other parts of the business. This issue is compounded if operating and R&D expenses increase at the same time. These are the issues facing our Zacks Bear of the Day,  (NASDAQ:  -  ).SGEN, a Zacks Ranked #5 (Strong Sell), is a biotechnology company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative antibody-based therapies for the treatment of cancer. Seattle Genetics is leading the field in developing antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), a technology designed to harness the targeting ability of antibodies to deliver cell-killing agents directly to cancer cells. The company's lead product, ADCETRIS® (brentuximab vedotin) is an ADC that, in collaboration with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, is commercially available for two indications in more than 45 countries, including the U.S., Canada, Japan and members of the European Union. Additionally, ADCETRIS is being evaluated broadly in more than 30 ongoing clinical trials.On February 9th, SGEN announced earnings where they missed both the Zacks consensus earnings and revenue estimates. During the announcement management stated that their primary drug ADCETRIS's annual sales would only show 9% annual sales growth in FY 17, half of what was achieved in 2016, and well below the previously expected 30% annual sales growth. Further, it was learned that one of their other key growth drivers CTCL will not get in the product label until 2018. This news caused analysts to cut their estimates through FY 2018.According to Clay Siegall, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer, ""  .""After a short period of post-election uncertainty, the technology sector rebounded with a strong fourth quarter earnings season. Within this broad sector, the semiconductor industry has been one of the best performers this year, and it is clear that demand for chips is high in a variety of different areas.While we are seeing strength throughout the semiconductor industry, it has been the traditional giants that have really impressed investors recently. Companies like Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:  -  ) have garnered impressive momentum, while behemoths like Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:  -  ) look poised to continue growing thanks to changing consumer behavior.By taking a look at what is driving the semiconductor industry right now and familiarizing ourselves with the recent performance of these stocks, we can make a more educated decision on whether Texas Instruments or Skyworks is the better fit for your portfolio.It is always important to consider the impact that mobile phones have on the semiconductor industry, as some companies-such as Skyworks-depend on supplying companies like Apple (NASDAQ:  -  ) for a solid chunk of their revenue.However, newer demands like the Internet of Things (IoT) and driverless vehicles have opened up growth areas for these semiconductor giants. Our world is becoming increasingly connected and semiconductor companies stand to benefit.IoT technology promises to connect our household and commercial items to a wireless network in order to make our lives easier. This could mean the remote operation of a house's security system, or it could mean manufacturers instantly tracking the performance of their machines. Either way, semiconductor companies are the ones making the electronic and sensor technologies (also read:  ).We are also seeing a similar situation play out within the car. Sure, fully autonomous cars are still a few years away from being commercially available, but the new ""connected car"" is very much a modern-day reality. Over the past few years, driving has evolved into an experience that now incorporates several new technologies to promote better comfort and safety. This has been another key growth area for semiconductors.Right now, the Semiconductor-General industry sits in the Top 6% of the Zacks Industry Rank, which really highlights the strength of this business.Every day, the analysts at Zacks Equity Research select two stocks that are likely to outperform (Bull) or underperform (Bear) the markets over the next 3-6 months.Zacks Equity Research provides the best of quantitative and qualitative analysis to help investors know what stocks to buy and which to sell for the long-term.Continuous analyst coverage is provided for a universe of 1,150 publicly traded stocks.

"ast week  (NASDAQ: SGEN) announced an agreement to license  '  (NASDAQ: IMMU) IMMU-132, a cancer drug that's already completed midstage phase 2 trials.The deal could be a big win for Seattle Genetics, but it doesn't have the full support of all of Immunomedics investors. After the closing market bell on Friday, venBio Select Advisors, LLC -- the beneficial owner of 9.9% of Immunomedics shares -- said Immunomedics' board of directors is ""giving away its crown jewel.""IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.If the deal closes, Seattle Genetics will take over development of IMMU-132, an anti-TROP-2 antibody that can target multiple tumor types. Breast cancer, lung cancer, and colorectal cancers all overexpress the TROP-2 protein and therefore could conceivably be treated by IMMU-132.In phase 2 trials of IMMU-132 in triple negative breast cancer, there was a 29% overall objective response rate in heavily pretreated patients. Historically, the duration of response in fifth-line triple negative breast cancer patients is measured in months, but IMMU-132 delivered a 10-month duration of response and a median overall survival rate of over 18 months.About 15% of breast cancer patients are triple negative, and patients with this type of breast cancer have a poor prognosis. According to the National Cancer Institute, 246,660 new cases of breast cancer are diagnosed annually, causing 40,450 deaths every year.There's a big need for new treatments, and that has Seattle Genetics thinking IMMU-132 could qualify for an accelerated FDA approval. If so, then IMMU-132 will become Seattle Genetics' second commercial-stage drug. Management didn't offer up a timeline for filing a new drug application with the FDA; however, it did say it's going to evaluate its options and update investors on a future conference call. Last fall, Immunomedics told investors it hoped to file for FDA accelerated approval in the middle of 2017.Seattle Genetics will pay Immunomedics $250 million in cash up front, plus an additional $50 million payment related to ex-U.S., Canada, and EU rights. If it wins an FDA green light, Immunomedics has an option to co-market IMMU-132 in America. Otherwise, Seattle Genetics will pay Immunomedics a tiered double-digit royalty that's based on sales.Seattle Genetics also agreed to pay Immunomedics up to $1.7 billion in regulatory and sales milestone payments on IMMU-132, and Seattle Genetics agreed to let Immunomedics continue negotiating with other companies on rights to IMMU-132 until Feb. 19. If a competing offer is made, Seattle Genetics can match it. If Immunomedics selects a competing offer, then it will pay Seattle Genetics a breakup fee.Separately, Seattle Genetics acquired 3 million shares of Immunomedics at $4.90 per share that aren't tied to the closing of this deal. Seattle Genetics also secured three-year warrants that allow it to acquire an additional 8,655,804 shares at $4.90 each.Seattle Genetics already markets the lymphoma drug Adcetris, which is FDA approved for treating Hodgkin lymphoma patients whose disease has progressed after autologous stem-cell transplant or after two prior chemotherapy treatments, if ineligible for transplant. Adcetris is also used to treat patients with systemic anaplastic large-cell lymphoma whose disease has progressed after one prior chemotherapy treatment. A trial evaluating Adcetris as a front-line Hodgkin lymphoma therapy is anticipated to read out data this year.With $265.8 million in sales last year, Adcetris is no slouch, but IMMU-132 has the potential to haul in far more in revenue than that. Immunomedics commissioned an independent analysis of IMMU-132's market potential last year, and that study estimates that IMMU-132 could generate annual sales of $3 billion in 2025, if it gets approved for use in triple negative breast cancer, urothelial cancer, and lung cancer.That's a big opportunity, but there's no guarantee that IMMU-132 will get an early OK from the FDA, and if it doesn't, then Seattle Genetics will have to conduct a confirmatory phase 3 study. While midstage trial results were solid, investors should remember that, historically, 30% to 40% of drugs that advance into phase 3 trials fail.Of course, for Seattle Genetics to benefit from IMMU-132 at all, this deal has to close, and based on venBio's comments, that might not be a given. Immunomedics is engaged in a proxy fight with venBio, and in its statement on Friday, venBio's Behzad Aghazadeh said, ""Immunomedics' announcement of a deal with Seattle Genetics is a blatant and shameful maneuver by the current board and management to manipulate the outcome of the upcoming annual meeting and entrench themselves at the expense of stockholders' best interests, and venBio is exploring all options to hold them accountable.""When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"nvestors in Seattle Genetics Inc (Symbol: SGEN) saw new options become available this week, for the April 21st expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the SGEN options chain for the new April 21st contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $60.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.50. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $60.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $58.50 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of SGEN, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $64.66/share today.Because the $60.00 strike represents an approximate 7% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 68%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.50% return on the cash commitment, or 15.74% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Seattle Genetics Inc, and highlighting in green where the $60.00 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $70.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.80. If an investor was to purchase shares of SGEN stock at the current price level of $64.66/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $70.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 11.04% if the stock gets called away at the April 21st expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if SGEN shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Seattle Genetics Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing SGEN's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $70.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $70.00 strike represents an approximate 8% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 61%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).

t has been about a month since the last earnings report for  . Shares have added about 8.2% in that time frame, outperforming the market.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers. reported a loss of $0.39 per share, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $0.34 and wider than the year-ago loss of $0.18.Revenues came in at $105.3 million, up 12.6% year over year, primarily on the back of strong sales of Adcetris. Revenues, however, missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $106.6 million.Seattle Genetics' top line comprises product revenues, collaboration and license agreement revenues and royalties.The company's only marketed product, Adcetris, generated revenues of $70.8 million, up 12% year over year.Collaboration and license agreement revenues increased 16.4% to almost $20.8 million. Collaboration revenues included fees earned from the company's agreement with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd. for Adcetris and other ADC collaborations.Royalty revenues surged 8.7% to $13.7 million driven by royalties from Takeda on international sales of Adcetris.Research and development (R&D) expenses were $108.2 million, up 45% year over year. Also, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 23% to $41.4 million. Costs were high primarily due to investment in vadastuximab talirine, Adcetris collaboration activities for product supply to Takeda and pipeline development.For the full year net loss came in at $1 per share compared with a loss of 93 cents in 2015 and wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 94 cents.For 2016, revenues came in at $418.1 million, up 24.2% year over year but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $419.69 million.Seattle Genetics expects total revenues in 2017 to be in the range of $405 million to $445 million. Net sales of Adectris is expected to be in the range of $280 million to $300 million. R&D expenses are expected to be in the range of $460 million to $500 million. SG&A expenses are expected to be in the range of $160 million to $170 million.Seattle Genetics continues to work on expanding Adcetris' label further. The company.Takeda released full data from the ALCANZA phase III study in patients with CD30-expressing cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) in Dec 2016. The study met its primary endpoint demonstrating that treatment with Adcetris resulted in a highly statistically significant improvement in the rate of objective response lasting at least four months (ORR4) versus the control arm as assessed by an independent review committee.Seattle Genetics plans to submit a supplemental biologics license application to the FDA for Adcetris in CTCL indication in mid-2017.The company expects top-line data from the phase III ECHELON-1 study (frontline classical Hodgkin lymphoma) during 2017 while top-line data from the ECHELON-2 study (frontline CD30-expressing mature T-cell lymphoma) should be out in 2018 (previously expected in the 2017 to 2018 timeframe).In addition, the company continues to enroll patients in the phase III study on vadastuximab talirine in combination with hypomethylating agents in older patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia.Following the release, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.

"onald Trump's taking aim at drug companies that have increasingly found themselves in the hot seat because of sky-high drug price increases in the past. Last week, Trump likened the industry's history of price hikes as akin to ""getting away with murder,"" and he hinted that significant changes to how government programs pay for medicine are afoot.If Trump follows through on plans to crimp runaway prices, it could have a big negative impact on the makers of the planet's most expensive drugs. Read on to find out why  (NYSE: LLY) ,  (NYSE: PFE) ,  (NASDAQ: SGEN) ,  (NASDAQ: ARIA) , and  (NASDAQ: NVLN) could stand to lose out under Trump.Image source: DonaldJTrump.comLast year, the insurance industry trade group America's Health Insurance Plans, or AHIP, put together a report that estimates the annual per patient costs associated with the country's priciest medicine. The report based annual price estimates on prices listed in the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS), which lists prices paid by government programs, including Veterans Affairs, and on REDBOOK prices, including average wholesale price, or the cost charged by wholesalers to retailers.Overall, the AHIP report finds that while 90% of U.S. prescriptions are filled with low-cost generic drugs, new and increasingly expensive drugs could push U.S. drug spending from $337 billion in 2015 to $560 billion or more in 2020.While the AHIP's report highlights spending on 150 high-priced drugs, these five drugs cost government programs over $100,000 per patient per year and thus could end up in Trump's crosshairs.If Trump's hard-nosed stance on drug prices results in greater negotiating power for Medicare, Eli Lilly's colorectal cancer and gastric cancer drug Cyramza could come under pressure.According to AHIP, the FSS annual patient expenditure for Cyramza is $183,600. That's nearly $70,000 higher than Avastin, which can be used in some of these patients, and it's substantially below Cyramza's average wholesale price of $220,320 per year.In Q3, Cyramza represented just $159 million of Eli Lilly's total $5.2 billion in global revenue, so any drag on sales tied to negotiations could be muted. Nevertheless, Eli Lilly's  to develop new drugs to spark growth, and since Cyramza's sales grew 43% between Q3 2015 and Q3 2016, any price concessions could create an unwanted obstacle to the company's goal of increasing revenue.One of Pfizer's fast-growing cancer drugs is Xalkori, a medicine that's used in patients with a specific genetic variation of non-small cell lung cancer, known as ALK+.Xalkori's per patient annual cost of $143,100 per year to the VA based on FSS is a bit below that of another competing ALK+ targeting drug, Zykadia, but Xalkori is undeniably pricey medicine given its average wholesale cost is $193,908.In Q3, Pfizer reported Xalkori sales of $140 million, up 14% year over year, and while that's chump change relative to Pfizer's $13 billion in quarterly, pushback on cancer drugs could have a wider-ranging impact on Pfizer's total cancer drug sales.In addition to Xalkori, Pfizer markets the $550 million per quarter cancer drug Ibrance, and, thanks to a recent acquisition, it also shares in sales of the multibillion-dollar prostate cancer drug Xtandi. The FSS for Ibrance, which is used to treat breast cancer, is $116,424, and the FSS for the commonly prescribed Xtandi is $61,032. The average wholesale cost of Ibrance and Xtandi is $141,840 and $127,416, respectively, so there could be room for prices to fall.Seattle Genetics' Adcetris is used to treat Hodgkin lymphoma, and lymphoma drugs are historically among some of the costliest available.Adcetris is used primarily in the tough-to-treat cases, but the average wholesale price of Adcetris is a stunning $337,632, which is far higher than the FSS price of $232,608. If Medicare can negotiate prices down to the FSS price point, then the company's top line could get dinged.Adcetris sales were $70.1 million in the third quarter, and while the company has some intriguing drugs in clinical-stage studies, Adcetris is currently its own commercial-stage drug. Therefore, any price cuts to Adcetris could pose a big headwind.On Jan. 9, Japanese drugmaker  agreed to buy Ariad Pharmaceuticals for $5.2 billion, and if that deal closes as expected, and price pushback increases, then Takeda could find itself struggling to justify the cost of Ariad Pharmaceuticals' Iclusig, a leukemia treatment.In October, Ariad Pharmaceuticals got  when reports surfaced that a series of drug price increases had lifted Iclusig's cost to $200,000 per year. At the time of AHIP's report, Iclusig's average wholesale price was already a heady $172,080 and its FSS cost was $136,044.Now, it would seem that Iclusig is even more expensive. Granted, drugs for life-threatening indications like this are tough to develop, but with a price tag that high, it wouldn't be too shocking if it attracts unwanted attention again.As a refresher, Novelion Therapeutics was formed in November when Aegerion Pharmaceuticals merged with QLT, a clinical-stage developer of opthalmic medicines.Juxtapid is used to treat people with a specific genetic mutation that elevates their bad cholesterol levels, and ahead of the merger, Juxtapid accounted for about 60% of Aegerion Pharmaceuticals' sales.According to AHIP, Juxtapid's annual average wholesale price is $415,944 and its FSS is $220,788.That's an incredibly wide spread that could raise eyebrows, especially since a new class of cholesterol-fighting drugs known as PCSK9 inhibitors launched last year. PCSK9 drugs are cheaper, and they've been proven to be effective in some of Juxtapid's addressable patient population. Repatha, for example, is one of two PCSK9 inhibitors that's currently available, and it costs $14,000 annually.The merger of Aegerion with QLT diversifies some of the risk of falling Juxtapid's prices, and Novelion does market another drug, Myalept, that could take away some of the sting if the FDA agrees to approve an important label expansion soon.Nevertheless, since 85% of Juxtapid's $22 million in Q3 sales came from the U.S., any negative pricing pressure will present a major headwind for this company that investors should not ignore.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

With modest growth for Adcetris, its only drug on the market, investors should be focused on Seattle Genetics' pipeline and clinical trials that could further expand sales of Adcetris.Data source: Seattle Genetics.Image source: Getty Images.Clay Siegall, Seattle Genetics' president and CEO, asked investors to look past 2017 guidance and see the bigger picture: ""What is really important with Adcetris is not the sales we have now. What's really important is going toward the big items of [ECHELON-1] and [ECHELON-2], and you can even include ALCANZA in there.""On the delay of submitting the application for CTCL patients, Siegall didn't even want to call it that. ""To me it's not a delay. To me it's taking advantage of an opportunity,"" he said. ""I think we have a really good opportunity to end up with a bigger market if we can get a bigger label.""Management guided for Adcetris sales of $280 million to $300 million this year, which is 5.3% to 12.9% higher than last year's sales. Royalty revenue is expected to be in the $50 million to $55 million range, down from the $67.5 million in 2016, but last year included a $20 million milestone payment.The difference between the bottom and top of guidance likely has to do with how many doctors prescribe Adcetris for CTCL off-label ahead of the FDA approval. But capturing those patients now versus next year isn't particularly important for Seattle Genetics' long-term value.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"any small-cap biotech stocks are super-risky, with no products on the market yet. Some big-cap biotech stocks, on the other hand, aren't growing like they used to. Mid-cap biotech stocks could meet Goldilocks' criteria of finding what is ""just right."" Three mid-cap biotechs, in particular, look like winners. Here's why it could pay off to buy shares of  (NASDAQ: CLVS) ,  (NASDAQ: EXEL) , and  (NASDAQ: SGEN) in February.Image source: Getty Images.Clovis Oncology scored a huge win in December when it gained U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for Rubraca as a third-line treatment for advanced ovarian cancer. Rubraca received this approval under the FDA's accelerate approval program based on objective response rate and duration of response results from two clinical studies.The biotech immediately kicked off the commercial launch of Rubraca following the FDA decision. Clovis already had a sales force of 85 representatives in the field and marketing programs ready to go. Its distribution channel was fully stocked with the drug within the first week of approval.Even better news could be on the way. Clovis expects to announce results from a late-stage study evaluating Rubraca as a maintenance therapy for ovarian cancer in mid-2017. Success with this additional indication would open the door to a significantly larger market for the drug.Exelixis' share price has nearly quadrupled over the past 12 months. This impressive performance stemmed from tremendous success for the biotech's kidney cancer drug Cabometyx. Can Exelixis go even higher? I think so.Currently, Cabometyx is approved as a second-line treatment and as a third-line treatment for kidney cancer. It appears likely, though, that the drug could win approval for the more lucrative first-line indication relatively soon. Exelixis reported great results in October 2016 from a phase 2 study of Cabometyx as a first-line treatment for kidney cancer. Those results were so positive that the biotech immediately got the ball rolling for regulatory submission.There's also a possibility that Cabometyx might be successful in treating other forms of cancer. Eleven mid-stage clinical studies are in progress evaluating the drug in treating several other indications, including non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, and endometrial cancer.Like Clovis Oncology and Exelixis, Seattle Genetics has a product on the market already with Adcetris. Also like the two other biotechs, Seattle Genetics hopes to add to the approved indications for the cancer drug in the not-too-distant future.Adcetris is currently approved as a treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma and systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma. The company reported positive results in 2016 from a late-stage study evaluating the drug in treating CD30-expressing cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Seattle Genetics plans to file for U.S. regulatory approval for the indication in the first half of this year.The biotech also expects to report on results from a late-stage study of Adcetris in treating newly diagnosed patients with Hodgkin lymphoma in 2017, probably in the second half of the year. There's a chance that Seattle Genetics could announce results from another late-stage study evaluating the drug as a front-line treatment of CD30-expressing mature T-cell lymphoma by the end of 2017, although it could be early 2018 before the results are available.Which is the best bet right now among these three mid-cap biotechs? It's not an easy call.Clovis Oncology's Rubraca could hit peak annual sales of up to $1 billion. The biotech's current market cap stands at $2.7 billion. Sales for Cabometyx could be at the same level or even higher. However, Exelixis' market cap is over $5.3 billion due to the stock's big run-up.Adcetris might be the biggest winner. At least one analyst thinks the drug could reach peak annual sales of around $2 billion. Seattle Genetics licensed marketing rights for the drug outside the U.S. and Canada to Takeda, though, so it won't receive all of the revenue Adcetris might make. The biotech claims the highest market cap of the three companies at $8.3 billion.My view is that the nod for best pick goes to Clovis Oncology. The biotech owns all of the rights for Rubraca, which is a big plus. With its relatively low market cap, I wouldn't be surprised if Clovis becomes an acquisition target in 2017. For that matter, so could Exelixis and Seattle Genetics. I suspect all three of these mid-cap biotech stocks will perform well this year.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"his year has been a little rocky for biotech stocks. In fact, it's on pace to be the first decline for the sector in quite a few years. But despite this year's decline for the sector, there are plenty of individual biotech stocks with potential catalysts to help them rocket higher in 2017.
  
Data source: Google Finance.Image source: Getty Images.A few cancer focused biotechs with drugs on the market, Seattle Genetics, Exelixis, and Clovis Oncology, are looking to expand sales by getting their drugs approved for different patient populations.Seattle Genetics' Adcetris produced sales of $195 million in the U.S. and Canada through the first nine months of 2016, but that could pale in comparison to future sales if the biotech can expand the market for Adcetris by getting it approved for other indications. In the first half of 2017, Seattle Genetics plans to ask the Food and Drug Administration for approval to treat patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, which should provide a small bump in sales.And then later in the year, a phase 3 trial called ECHELON-1 in patients with newly diagnosed Hodgkin lymphoma will read out. Seattle Genetics hasn't given any time frame beyond ""during 2017,"" but considering the previous guidance was for the ""2017 to mid-2018 timenframe,"" investors should probably expect the data in the latter half of the year. It's also possible investors might get data from another Adcetris phase 3 trial called ECHELON-2 in newly diagnosed patients with mature T-cell lymphomas, although the data may not be available until 2018.Exelixis' Cabometyx was approved earlier this year to treat kidney cancer, but the biotech could expand sales of the drug if a phase 3 clinical trial, CELESTIAL, testing Cabometyx in patients with a form of liver cancer, shows the drug keeps patients alive longer than a placebo. CELESTIAL is scheduled to read out ""in the 2017 time frame.""Exelixis also has the potential to expand sales in kidney cancer patients next year. Cabometyx is only approved as a second-line treatment, but has positive data showing the drug works better than  's Sutent, the drug that's currently used first to treat kidney cancer patients. Exelixis is currently working on the application, so depending on the timing of submission and whether it's given a priority review, the FDA may make its decision about expanding into first-line kidney cancer next year.Clovis Oncology gained  for Rubraca last week, but the drug is only indicated for advanced ovarian cancer patients who have been treated with two or more chemotherapies. Going after patients with few other options is a good way for a company to get on the market quickly -- Rubraca was approved based on phase 2 data -- but it limits the market size.To expand the potential market, Clovis had already started a phase 3 trial called ARIEL3 that is testing Rubraca as a maintenance therapy, which will read out in the second half of 2017. Rather than being given after a patient has failed a therapy, in the AREIL3 trial, Rubraca is given after a patient responds to therapy to try and extend the response. Treating patients earlier will increase the number of eligible patients and potentially increase the time those patients take the drug relative to those that have already relapsed.Kite is currently using the rolling submission process that's available for diseases with high unmet needs to submit its application for axicabtagene ciloleucel, which used to go by the code name KTE-C19. The treatment is Kite's first immunotherapy that uses a new technology called chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) in which a patient's T cells are pulled out, trained to attack a tumor cell -- in this case, cells expressing CD19 -- and then put back into the patient.In the phase 2 ZUMA-1 trial, axicabtagene ciloleucel produced a 76% response rate in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with 47% of the patients exhibiting a complete response and the remainder a partial response. The trial also enrolled some patients with primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma or transformed follicular lymphoma, which had a combined response rate of 91% with 73% of patients experiencing a complete response. The trial didn't have an active comparator, but considering these are patients with few other options, the high response rates are outstanding.Kite expects to complete its submission by the end of the first quarter of next year, and assuming it's given a priority review, axicabtagene ciloleucel should be approved by the end of the year.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

apanese drugmaker  (NASDAQOTH: TKPYY) announced yesterday that it's acquiring  (NASDAQ: ARIA) for $24 per share, or $5.2 billion. The deal removes yet another commercial-stage cancer drugmaker from the market, and the lofty price paid by Takeda, which represented a 75% premium to ARIAD Pharmaceuticals' prior closing price, suggests that the appetite to pay up for promising cancer drug companies remains healthy.Following ARIAD Pharmaceuticals' acquisition, I think pressure could mount for  (NASDAQ: ARRY) ,  (NASDAQ: SGEN) , and  (NASDAQ: EXEL) to put themselves up for sale. Should these cancer drug stocks be a part of your portfolio? Read on to find out.Image source: Getty Images.Array BioPharma filed for FDA approval of its melanoma drug binimetinib in June, and an FDA decision is expected sometime in the second quarter of this year.If approved, binimetinimb could offer new hope to patients with NRAS-mutant melanoma. A common cancer, there were 76,380 new cases and over 10,130 deaths because of melanoma last year, and about 20% of those patients have the NRAS-mutation.In trials, median progression-free survival for patients with advanced NRAS-mutant melanoma was 2.8 months on binimetinib versus 1.5 months for the chemotherapy dacarbazine. Patients with NRAS-mutant melanoma who had been previously treated with immunotherapy had progression-free survival of 5.5 months, compared to 1.6 months for dacarbazine.Making Array Biopharma even more attractive to a potential suitor, though, is the potential for binimetinib's use beyond NRAS-mutated patients. Phase 3 trial results suggest that using binimetinib alongside Array Biopharma's exploratory drug, encorafenib, can improve progression-free survival for melanoma patients with BRAF-mutations, too. The median progression-free survival for patients treated with bini/enco was 14.9 months versus 7.3 months for patients treated with dacarbazine, and since up to 50% of melanoma patients are BRAF-positive, that patient population represents a far bigger market opportunity. ' Adcetris is used to treat Hodgkin lymphoma patients whose disease has returned after a stem-cell transplant, or following at least two chemotherapy regimens, and last summer, the company reported results from a phase 3 trial that may pave the way for Adcetris' use in advanced mature T-cell lymphoma, too.Adcetris' third-quarter sales clocked in at $70.1 million in the U.S. and Canada, where Seattle Genetics maintains sole rights to market it, and the company pocketed another $12.2 million in royalty revenue from Takeda on Adcetris sales outside of those two markets. In both cases, sales were up nicely from a year ago. Adcetris' U.S. and Canada revenue was $59.1 million, and its royalty revenue was $9.7 million in the third quarter of 2015.Seattle Genetics is also evaluating Adcetris as a front-line therapy in Hodgkin lymphoma, and results are anticipated later this year. Assuming Adcetris' can continue to win use in its current approved setting, and results from the front-line trial pan out, it wouldn't surprise me if another company acquires this one.Perhaps the most intriguing acquisition target of these three is Exelixis. The company's advanced kidney cancer drug, Cabometyx, is off to a fast start, generating annualized sales of $120 million in Q3. However, that nine-figure run rate could be the tip of the iceberg.Afinitor, another second-line drug for advanced kidney cancer, is a billion-dollar blockbuster, and so far, Cabometyx has only captured 20% market share in the second-line setting and 35% market share in the third-line setting. Additionally, recent trials suggest Cabometyx could eventually displace Sutent as the go-to drug in the first-line setting.In head-to-head trials, Cabometyx patients experienced a 31% decrease in risk of death or cancer progression versus Sutent at a median 20.8 months. Progression-free survival was 8.2 months on Cabometyx and 5.6 months on Sutent. Further, Cabometyx outperformed Sutent on overall survival, too.If the FDA gives Cabometyx the OK for first-line patients, then its efficacy advantage over Sutent may be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Through the first nine months of 2016, Sutent's sales totaled $823 million.Cabometyx's potential undeniably makes this company intriguing, and while Exelixis won't come cheap, Takeda paid 22 times forward sales to buy ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, and that multiple suggests Exelixis' take-out valuation of could be as high as $7.1 billion.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"Image source: Getty Images. (NASDAQ: SGEN) is down 15% at 11:57 a.m. EST after announcing the Food and Drug Administration has put a clinical hold on multiple early stage clinical trials testing its cancer drug vadastuximab talirine, which used to go by its code name SGN-CD33A, in acute myeloid leukemia (AML).The FDA took the action after Seattle Genetics disclosed six patients taking vadastuximab talirine had signs of liver toxicity including several cases of veno-occlusive disease, where blood flow is blocked in the liver. Four of the patients died.Veno-occlusive disease most often occurs in patients undergoing blood cell transplantation, one of the treatments for AML, so it isn't clear if vadastuximab talirine is causing the problem. More than 300 patients have been treated with vadastuximab talirine to date, so it's a fairly rare problem.The FDA placed a full hold -- meaning no more treatments until it's lifted -- on a phase 1/2 trial testing vadastuximab talirine in pre- and post-allogeneic transplant AML patients. Two other phase 1 trials for vadastuximab talirine are only on a partial hold, so no new patients can be enrolled but existing patients can continue treatment if they want to.Interestingly, the FDA didn't place other clinical trials testing vadastuximab talirine on clinical hold, including the phase 3 CASCADE trial in older AML patients and a phase 1/2 trial in another blood cancer called myelodysplastic syndrome.Seattle Genetics said it's working with the FDA to identify whether vadastuximab talirine is the cause of the liver toxicity and hopes to ""identify appropriate protocol amendments for patient safety and to enable continuation of these trials.""The fact that the FDA didn't put all the clinical trials on hold is a good sign that the agency thinks, even if vadastuximab talirine is contributing to the liver toxicity, it's only likely to be a problem in a subset of AML patients. As a cancer treatment, side effects are more likely to be tolerated by the FDA compared to treatments for less-fatal diseases.Investors should also keep in mind that vadastuximab talirine isn't Seattle Genetics most important drug. While adding a second drug would be helpful to its revenue growth, sales of already-approved Adcetris and expanding the drug's market through ongoing clinical trials contribute more to Seattle Genetics valuation than vadastuximab talirine currently does.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

hares of  plunged 15.4% after the FDA placed a full clinical hold on a phase I/II study and a partial clinical hold on two phase I studies on vadastuximab talirine (SGN-CD33A) following the death of four patients.Note that Seattle Genetics' year-to-date share price movement shows that the company has outperformed the Zacks classified  industry. Specifically, the stock surged almost 60% during this period, while the industry lost 0.4%.SGN-CD33A is being developed for the treatment of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML).The partial clinical hold was implemented to evaluate the potential risk of liver toxicity in patients treated with the candidate, who underwent a stem cell transplant either before or after the treatment.Until the clinical holds are lifted, no new study on the candidate can be initiated.In its press release, the company mentioned that it is currently working with the FDA to determine if there is any association between hepatotoxicity and treatment with SGN-CD33A, and to identify appropriate protocol amendments for patient safety and aid continuation of the studies.Meanwhile, the company continues to enroll patients in the phase III CASCADE study in older AML patients and in a phase I/II study in myelodysplastic syndrome.Considering that Adcetris is the only approved product in Seattle Genetics' portfolio, clinical hold on as many as three early-stage studies on SGN-CD33A is disappointing. A successful development of pipeline candidates is essential for the company to reduce its dependence on Adcetris. | Seattle Genetics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the health care sector include Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc.  , Cambrex Corp.  and Heska Corp.  .

iogen  and Ionis  got an early Christmas gift with the FDA approving their spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) treatment Spinraza three months within the filing of the regulatory application. Meanwhile, Seattle Genetics  has been hit by clinical holds on several early-stage studies evaluating an experimental cancer treatment. Biogen and Ionis got a boost with the FDA approving their SMA treatment Spinraza just before Christmas. Spinraza has been approved to treat a broad range of SMA patients. With the drug being the first treatment to be approved for SMA, a leading genetic cause of death in infants and toddlers that is marked by progressive, debilitating muscle weakness, the market potential is huge.The approval, which came within three months of the regulatory filing, is important for both companies. While Ionis could well find itself on the path to profitability on Spinraza sales, Biogen needed this boost considering the challenges the company has been facing with growing its multiple sclerosis (MS) franchise sales and pipeline setbacks. The FDA has also granted a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher which can used later to get priority review for some other product (Read more:  ).Meanwhile, AveXis, which is developing an SMA treatment, saw its shares decline 5.9% on Spinraza's approval. Seattle Genetics' investors received a jolt with the company saying that the FDA has placed a clinical hold or partial clinical on several early stage studies on SGN-CD33A (vadastuximab talirine) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, other studies including a phase III study (CASCADE) in older AML patients and a phase I/II study in myelodysplastic syndrome, remain unaffected by the holds.The holds were put in place to evaluate the potential risk of hepatotoxicity in patients who were treated with SGN-CD33A and received allogeneic stem cell transplant either before or after treatment. While six patients were identified with hepatotoxicity, including several cases of veno-occlusive disease, there were four deaths. Seattle Genetics is working with the FDA to determine whether there is any link between hepatotoxicity and treatment with SGN-CD33A. Seattle Genetics' shares were down 15.4% on the news.

"Feeling good on the first day back from a major holiday weekend, and perhaps inspired by the strongest consumer confidence we've seen since 2001, the market managed to get the new week started on a bullish foot. The  ended the day at 2,268.88, up 0.22%. Not every stock was in step with the marketwide advance, however.  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ) were each doomed from the start today on the heels of bad news.Santa Claus wasn't kind to owners of drug maker Seattle Genetics the first day back following Monday's Christmas break. On Tuesday morning, the company announced one of its ballyhooed leukemia-drug development trials was being halted after its true dangers were discovered, sending SGEN into a tailspin.The drug in question is SGN-CD33A, or vadastuximab talirine, which is a treatment for acute myeloid leukemia. Although the drug showed measurably efficacy, the Food and Drug Administration has halted the early-stage trial on the heels of four deaths of patients involved in the trial.All four of the more than 300 patients involved the trial experienced blocked blood flow in the liver. SGN-CD33A has not been specifically identified as the cause of the liver problems and deaths, though it's likely to be the culprit. The FDA's halt is an indefinite one.SGEN ended the day down 15.4%.SGEN wasn't the only healthcare name to take one on the chin today. Endologix was hit even harder, with ELGX tumbling 26.7%.Endologix makes medical devices for the treatment of aortic disorders. The device called the AFX Endovascular AAA System though - the product line  - has stopped being shipped for the time being due to a potential manufacturing flaw in some versions of the device.Endologix doesn't expect the halt to be a long-lived one, but the announcement does ding the company's credibility.Finally, Amphastar Pharmaceuticals made the daily ""Worst 3"" list a healthcare trifecta, with AMPH losing 9.1% of its value on Tuesday after  regarding its Primatene Mist, which is an epinephrine inhalation aerosol.The complete response letter is not an outright rejection of the drug by the FDA. Indeed, a CLR is usually a specific roadmap a company can follow to ensure the revised request for the FDA's approval has better odds of success. Still, the FDA's failure to give the drug a green light on the first go-around doesn't bode especially well.Amphastar CEO Dr. Jack Zhang commented:""While we are disappointed to have not received approval at this time, we intend to continue to work with the FDA during the post-action phase to address their concerns in the CRL by the middle of 2017 and bring Primatene Mist back to the OTC market as soon as possible.""The post ), Endologix, Inc.

Image source: Getty Images.According to data from  , shares of cancer specialist  (NASDAQ: SGEN) rose by 16.3% last month, presumably as a direct result of Donald Trump's surprise win over Hillary Clinton.Although Seattle's flagship antibody-drug conjugate Adcetris continues to perform admirably, with its Q3 sales rising by a healthy 19% relative to a year ago, the company has used the occasional price increase to help boost the drug's growth. While regular price increases for novel cancer drugs like Adcetris are the industry norm, Trump's former opponent vowed to put an end to this practice in an effort to reduce prescription-drug costs across the board. So the market apparently took Trump's victory as a sign that the drug pricing controversy may be coming to an end, fueling a widespread rally among pharma stocks last month.The twist to this story, however, is that Trump recently announced that he actually plans to make sky-high drug prices a top priority moving forward. In other words, Seattle and its pharma peers are not out of the woods just yet.Having said that, Seattle does sport one of the most robust clinical pipelines among mid-cap biopharmas. Adcetris, for example, is currently being investigated as a treatment of a variety of cancers across more than 70 clinical trials. The drugmaker also has a second late-stage product candidate called SGN-CD33A that's being assessed as a therapy for older patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia.All in all, Seattle does potentially have the clinical assets to withstand a full-blown drug pricing war with the Federal government, which simply can't be said for many of its peers. That's why this pharma stock could push higher, even during these uncertain times for the pharmaceutical industry as a whole.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

mage source: Getty Images. (NASDAQ: IMGN) ,  (NASDAQ: SGEN) ,  (NASDAQ: EXEL) ,  (NASDAQ: ALNY) ,  (NASDAQ: MNTA) , and  (NASDAQ: BLUE) are all up at least 10% as of 1:32 p.m. EST following Donald Trump's presidential election win.Hillary Clinton had taken a tough stance against drug prices, and as it looked more likely that she was going to win, investors factored the potential for new laws that might limit drug pricing and increase competition into their valuations. Now that's she's lost, it's only natural that investors would re-evaluate drugmakers' valuations.What's interesting is that a few of these companies -- ImmunoGen, Alnylam, and Bluebird -- aren't generating any revenue from drugs on the market, so it'll be awhile before any new laws would affect them. And Momenta makes generic drugs, which you'd think would benefit from hypothetical new laws designed to spur competition. Exelixis and Seattle Genetics have drugs on the market, so the move higher makes a little more sense.While biotech investors can revel in the moves today -- and if they're lucky, the party will continue for a little while longer -- eventually further gains will be determined by how productive the biotechs are in selling their current drugs and developing new ones.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Here are 4 bullish charts in the medical and biotech arena, which is starting to heat up again.Exelixis, Inc. (), which has been in a declining wedge off its September top, made a new low for the move intraday on Tuesday before snapping back to close up 39 cents, or 3.68%, to 10.98, on 4.6 million shares. That’s the best volume in two weeks. Watch for a pop out of the falling wedge towards next resistance in the 12 range.Lantheus Holdings, Inc. (), in a steep up-trend off the May 31 low at 1.95, recently broke out of a 6-week wedge pattern, before pulling back towards the apex of the wedge and the rising channel bottom. However, the stock bounced on Monday and again Tuesday, up 40 cents, or 4.6%, to 9.05, on 503,900 shares, outperforming other medical stocks. A break of its double-top at 10.25-.30 could lead to 12.50-13.Seattle Genetics, Inc. (), in a beautiful uptrend for much of this year, pulled back recently with the biotechs, but had a nice reversal three days ago, bouncing off its rising channel bottom. On Tuesday it had an excellent follow-through, up 4.04, or 7.8%, to 55.74, on 1.9 million shares, the biggest volume on an up-day since May. Closing near the high for the day, the stock may continue higher to retest recent highs just under 58. Beyond that, watch for a run towards the channel top in the 62-63 range.Tesaro, Inc. () may be the best biotech stock out there right now. After its big up-gap on major news in late June, in which it more than doubled from the 37 level, the stock stair-stepped its way higher, getting as high as 123.45 intraday on Tuesday. The stock has been consolidating for the last three weeks, narrowing more recently in a wedge-type pattern, and looks poised to break out.

"Image source: Getty Images. (NASDAQ: SGEN) reported third-quarter earnings on Thursday, but while the biotech's lead drug has been on the market for half a decade, it still remains largely a pipeline story. You have to skim down to the fourth subhead of the press release to get to the quarterly sales numbers.Data source: Company press release. YOY = year over year.Jonathan Drachman, Seattle Genetics' chief medical officer and EVP of R&D, said the following on the conference call:While some investors will see this as a negative, the fact that Seattle Genetics has so many opportunities that it can shelve a drug with a modest effect should be viewed as a good thing. Many small biotechs have taken less-than-stellar drugs into mid-stage trials simply because the other option was to shut down and go home.The use of Adcetris in patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma is already in the NCCN guidelines based on earlier clinical trials, but Darren Cline, Seattle Genetics EVP of commercial, pointed out thatIn other words, after Adcetris is officially approved for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, the marketing team can go to work driving sales beyond the current off-label sales.Management tightened its revenue guidance for Adcetris sales in the U.S. and Canada to $260 million to $270 million, shaving a little off of both sides of the $255 million to $275 million range given in February.Still, the current sales of Adcetris will have little bearing on Seattle Genetics' value in a few years. For that, investors have to look to the pipeline, and they won't have to wait too long since the American Society of Hematology (ASH) meeting is coming up in a little over a month.Seattle Genetics plans to present the full data for the aforementioned trial testing Adcetris in patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma at ASH as well as more than 10 other presentations of Adcetris data. Early phase 1 data combining Adcetris and Bristol-Myers Squibb's Opdivo should be interesting since Opdivo has also been shown to work in Hodgkin lymphoma.The combination of Adcetris and Opdivo opens up a lot of options for further approvals of Adcetris. Seattle Genetics and Bristol-Myers Squibb are also testing the combination in relapsed and refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma and recently starred a trial in front-line older Hodgkin lymphoma patients who can't tolerate chemotherapy.Most importantly, but still about a year away, investors will get data from the ECHELON-1 trial testing Adcetris plus chemotherapy as a treatment for newly diagnosed advanced Hodgkin lymphoma patients. Moving into the first-line setting could boost sales of Adcetris substantially. The guidance for the data release is technically ""during 2017,"" but since the previous guidance was ""2017 to mid-2018 time frame,"" it seems safe to assume the data will come in the later part of the year.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

 reported a loss of 23 cents per share, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 29 cents but wider than the year-ago loss of 21 cents.Revenues came in at $106.3 million, up 26.5% year over year, primarily on the back of strong sales of Adcetris. Revenues were also above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $102.3 million.Seattle Genetics' top line comprises product revenues, collaboration and license agreement revenues and royalties.The company's only marketed product, Adcetris, generated revenues of $70.1 million, up 18.7% year over year.Collaboration and license agreement revenues increased 56.6% to almost $24 million. Collaboration revenues included fees earned from the company's agreement with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd.  for Adcetris and other ADC collaborations.Royalty revenues surged 26% to $12.2 million driven by royalties from Takeda on international sales of Adcetris.Research and development (R&D) expenses were $92.7 million, up 31% year over year. Also, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 17.4% to $34.8 million. Costs were high primarily due to investment in vadastuximab talirine, Adcetris collaboration activities for product supply to Takeda and pipeline development.Seattle Genetics tightened its 2016 financial outlook based on the performance to date. Adcetris sales in the U.S. and Canada are now expected to be in the range of $260 million to $270 million (old guidance: $255 million to $275 million), while research and development expenses are projected in the range of $370 million to $390 million (old guidance: $360 million to $400 million).Meanwhile, Seattle Genetics continues to work on expanding Adcetris' label further. The company and its collaborator Takeda reported positive top-line data in Aug 2016 from the phase III study, ACLANZA, in patients with CD30-expressing cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). Seattle Genetics plans to submit a supplemental biologics license application to the FDA for CTCL during the first half of 2017.The company expects top-line data from the phase III ECHELON-1 study (frontline classical Hodgkin lymphoma) during 2017 (previously expected in the 2017 to mid-2018 timeframe) while top-line data from the ECHELON-2 study (frontline CD30-expressing mature T-cell lymphoma) should be out in the 2017 to 2018 timeframe.In addition, the company continues to enroll patients in the phase III study on vadastuximab talirine in combination with hypomethylating agents in older patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia.The company is also progressing with its early-stage pipeline candidates. | Seattle Genetics carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Image source: Getty Images.After  agreed to pay 14 times forecast sales for 2016 to acquire cancer drugmaking pure play  last month, shares in other cancer-focused biotech companies shot higher. While it doesn't make sense to buy shares in all the companies that have taken off, investors may want to consider owning these three, each of which has catalysts on deck that could make it attractive to a bidder.In May,  (NASDAQ: ARRY) announced it would file for FDA approval of binimetinib, to treat melanoma linked to mutations in the NRAS gene, and the company followed through on that plan at the end of June.If approved, binimetinib will become the first of Array BioPharma's drugs to cross the regulatory finish line and make it to market; given that there's a significant need for new treatment options in this indication, binimetinib could hit the ground running.Median progression-free survival for binimetinib patients with advanced NRAS-mutant melanoma was 2.8 months, versus 1.5 months for dacarbazine. Binimetinib patients with advanced NRAS-mutant melanoma who had also previously been treated with immunotherapy had progression-free survival of 5.5 months, versus 1.6 months for patients treated with dacarbazine.A decision on binimetinib isn't expected until next summer, but an acquirer could step up prior to that. If one does, it would also gain access to a host of other cancer drugs, including encorafenib, which is in phase 3 trials, and seven other cancer therapies that are in phase 2 studies.Shares in  (NASDAQ: SGEN) are rallying after the release of important trial data that could expand the addressable target market for its commercial drug, Adcetris: data by  .Adcetris is a CD30-targeting drug that's approved to treat Hodgkin lymphoma patients whose disease has returned after a stem-cell transplant, or following at least two chemotherapy regimens. In August, the company reported results from a phase 3 trial that could also allow Adcetris' use in advanced mature T-cell lymphoma.Overall response rate at four weeks for Adcetris patients in this indication was 56.3%, compared to 12.5% in the control arm of the study. Secondary endpoints, including complete response rate, progression-free survival, and reduction in the burden of symptoms during treatment, were all highly statistically significant in favor of Adcetris.Management plans to file for a label expansion to include this indication early next year, and if approved, it could further fuel Adcetris sales growth. In the second quarter, Adcetris U.S. sales jumped 20% year over year to a record $66.2 million; total revenue, which includes royalties paid to it by  on international sales, climbed 24% to $95.4 million.Trials are also underway to determine if Adcetris is effective as a frontline therapy in Hodgkin lymphoma and mature T-cell lymphomas, and results from those studies could be available as early as next year. Additionally, Seattle Genetics is enrolling patients in a phase 3 study of another drug, SGN-CD33A, for acute myeloid leukemia.Since Seattle Genetics has deep pockets (with $863 million in assets), it's already racking up solid sales, and it has multiple cancer drugs in late-stage studies, this could be a very intriguing company for an acquirer to get its hands on.Rumors are swirling that  (NASDAQ: CLVS) may be a mergers-and-acquisitions target ahead of a FDA decision on rucaparib, an ovarian-cancer drug that put up solid efficacy in trials. If those rumors are true, then it would mark an impressive turnaround for the company. Last year, management reported that data from a lung-cancer trial evaluating rociletinib wasn't as good as previously thought, prompting the FDA to shelve an accelerated approval of the drug earlier this year: data by  .So far, it looks like rucaparib will avoid rociletinib's fate, and become Clovis Oncology's first FDA-approved drug. In September, the FDA said it wouldn't conduct an advisory committee meeting to discuss rucaparib, a potentially bullish sign. An official go/no-go decision is anticipated from the FDA on Feb. 23, 2017.If approved, then rucaparib will become the second PARP inhibitor approved to treat advanced ovarian cancer patients with BRCA mutations. The first drug, Lynparza, costs $13,000 per month, and notched $100 million in sales through the first six months of this year. While Lynparza is approved for patients who have received  or more chemotherapy treatments, rucaparib could get the nod for use in patients who have been treated with  or more chemotherapies, an advantage that could give this drug nine-figure potential. If so, then I think this stock could be worth more than its current $1.4 billion market cap to a buyer.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

"nvestors in Seattle Genetics Inc (Symbol: SGEN) saw new options become available this week, for the June 2017 expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 233 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the SGEN options chain for the new June 2017 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $50.00 strike price has a current bid of $6.10. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $50.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $43.90 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of SGEN, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $50.50/share today.Because the $50.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 59%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 12.20% return on the cash commitment, or 19.11% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Seattle Genetics Inc, and highlighting in green where the $50.00 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $55.00 strike price has a current bid of $5.20. If an investor was to purchase shares of SGEN stock at the current price level of $50.50/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $55.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 19.21% if the stock gets called away at the June 2017 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if SGEN shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Seattle Genetics Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing SGEN's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $55.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $55.00 strike represents an approximate 9% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 50%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the Biotech ETF (Symbol: BBH), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $135.66 per unit.With BBH trading at a recent price near $114.47 per unit, that means that analysts see 18.51% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of BBH's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are bluebird bio Inc (Symbol: BLUE), Seattle Genetics Inc (Symbol: SGEN), and Intercept Pharmaceuticals Inc (Symbol: ICPT). Although BLUE has traded at a recent price of $49.97/share, the average analyst target is 57.09% higher at $78.50/share. Similarly, SGEN has 29.10% upside from the recent share price of $43.98 if the average analyst target price of $56.78/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting ICPT to reach a target price of $193.17/share, which is 25.73% above the recent price of $153.64. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of BLUE, SGEN, and ICPT:Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
  
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past.

Now that the company sold its rights to royalty on Roche's Kadcyla, ImmunoGen is like any other development-stage biotech, focused on its pipeline rather than revenue and earnings numbers.Data source: Company press release.ImmunoGen only has four drugs in the clinic, but Mark Enyedy, ImmunoGen's CEO, reminded investors that the biotech has licensed its antibody drug conjugate (ADC) technology to other drugmakers, giving it more shots on goal: ""Levering this platform we've entered into a number of high value partnerships with leading companies, such as Roche, Bayer,  and Takeda. Collectively, our partners are developing nine clinical candidates that deploy our technology.""IMGN779 is behind other drugs that target CD33, including  '(NASDAQ: SGEN) vadastuximab talirine, but ImmunoGen's chief development officer Charlie Morris highlighted reasons why it may come out on top: ""The key difference lies in our payload's ability to alkylate DNA without cross-linking it, which we believe will allow for an improved tolerability profile and ability to repeat dose.""ImmunoGen believes that its current cash can last for another two years, but it will need more capital before getting mirvetuximab soravtansine approved because the data from FORWARD I won't be available until 2019. The additional capital could come from licensing its drugs or its ADC technology. Or the company could raise capital through a secondary offering, although that would be best done at a higher share price to avoid further diluting shareholders.Fortunately, ImmunoGen has some value-creating events upcoming.

"Image source: Getty Images. (NASDAQ: SGEN) might only have one drug on the market for now, but it's making the most of it, with sales continuing to grow, and the losses continuing to grow smaller.Data source: Company press release.In addition to selling Adcetris to more patients, Seattle Genetics can increase Adcetris sales by having patients on the drug for longer. Clay Siegall, Seattle Genetics' president and CEO, noted that the new indication -- referred to as the ""AETHERA setting,"" after the clinical-trial name -- results in more cycles on Adcetris than the six cycles that late-stage patients typically take.""In the AETHERA setting -- consolidation setting -- our clinical trial averaged about 12 cycles, and it is too early yet for us to get real good numbers on this, but it is certainly longer than what we are seeing in the relapsed refractory state; but we just don't have numbers yet to provide specifics,"" Siegall said. 's(NYSE: BMY) Opdivo gained FDA approval for Hodgkin lymphoma in May, but Siegall said Bristol-Myers Squibb wasn't cutting into Seattle Genetics' sales because Opdivo was primarily being used after Adcetris. ""Together with our five-year data and the doctors being very comfortable with it -- and without any issues of warnings going on to transplant, which you have with PD1s -- I think we are in very good shape,"" Siegall said diplomatically, because Bristol-Myers Squibb is a partner, testing Opdivo in combination with Adcetris in multiple indications.In addition to further expansion into the consolidation setting, Seattle Genetics has opportunities to expand sales into other indications if ongoing clinical trials are successful. The first of those, called the ALCANZA trial, in patients with CD30-expressing cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), is scheduled to read out this quarter. It's not a huge opportunity because there are only about 1,000 patients diagnosed annually in the U.S., and some doctors are already using the drug to treat CTCL off label.The bigger opportunity will come when the phase 3 ECHELON-1 trial testing Adcetris as a first-line treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma reads out sometime between next year and the middle of 2018. The exact date isn't known yet, because it depends on how long it takes for patients to progress.Seattle Genetics is also running a trial called ECHELON-2 in frontline mature T-cell lymphoma (MTCL) that will complete enrollment this year, and should read out data in the 2017 to 2018 time frame.Let's not forget that Seattle Genetics isn't a one-trick pony; it has a pipeline, including vadastuximab talirine, which used to go by its code name SGN-CD33A, which is being tested in a phase 3 trial in patients with acute myeloid leukemia.

" data by  .The main reason behind the decline is that user growth was behind guidance last quarter. The company gained 1.7 million new members versus guidance for 2.5 million additions. Gross additions were on target, but Netflix lost more subscribers than expected as the company started ""un-grandfathering"" members locked in at the older, lower rates and implementing a price increase that affected new members two years ago.Interestingly, new customers are willing to pay the higher price, but long-tenured members don't take price increases well, even when facing the completion of two years of grandfathering as opposed to a new price increase. With this challenge, management should probably work on better ways to optimize its pricing strategy and communicate its value proposition to customers.On the other hand, the long-term growth story in Netflix stock is pretty much intact, and chances are that the company will recover from this new setback sooner rather than later. One company that I've bought recently that I plan to buy more of when I get the chance is  (NYSE: GE) . Many know it as the ubiquitous industrial manufacturer that makes everything from lightbulbs to locomotive engines, but I'm more interested in it because of the rather miraculous turnaround it has made in recent years and its big push into the next big thing in industrial equipment: the industrial Internet of Things.Right up until the financial collapse and the following recession, General Electric's management was probably suffering from a little too much hubris. It was venturing into so many outlets that were beyond its sphere of competency: It owned a media companies and had such a massive financial division that it was designated as a systemically important financial institution -- the ""too big to fail"" label. Now that the company has divested many of these ancillary segments to get back to its core competency of manufacturing, it can take all of that reserved capital to buy back shares and raise dividends.In the longer term, the company is also looking to dominate the next wave of industrial manufacturing with its Predix data platform.

"Among the countless ailments a person can be diagnosed with, cancer is arguably the scariest. Worse yet, the odds of developing cancer are probably higher than many realize. Data from the U.S. National Cancer Institute's Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results database between 2010 and 2012 shows that men have about a 42% chance of developing cancer throughout their lifetime and 38% for women. Tack on estimates from the World Health Organization that cancer incidence rates could rise nearly 60% over the next decade, and you have a very good picture of why there's such fear surrounding this disease.Clinical researchers, however, aren't standing idly by. Instead, billions of dollars are being invested annually by drugmakers and universities in an attempt to unlock the secrets of cancer, with the ultimate hope of one day bringing cures to a disease that once had no solutions.These ""solutions"" are primarily taking three shapes (although there are far more than three ways researchers are tackling cancer): monoclonal antibodies, checkpoint inhibitors, and cancer vaccines. Let's take a brief look at how each is combatting cancer.Image source: Getty Images.Antibodies are proteins that circulate throughout our bodies seeking an antigen, or foreign substance that elicits an immune response. Once the antibody has found the specific antigen it's seeking, it attaches, attracting the attention of the immune system, which will then destroy the cell. Unfortunately, cancer cells often have immunosuppressant qualities that allow them to avoid immune detection. Thus, researchers have been hard at work in the lab creating copies of antibodies that target very specific antigens that are believed to be important in cancer growth. These man-made, cancer-seeking antibodies are known as monoclonal antibodies.There are a number of exciting monoclonal antibodies already on pharmacy shelves, many of which refine the fight against cancer.Perhaps the best-known monoclonal antibody is  's(NASDAQOTH: RHHBY) Herceptin, which is used to treat breast cancer and gastric cancer patients whose tumors express HER2 (known as HER2+). When this protein is found on the outside of cancer cells and is activated, it can spur cancer growth. Herceptin works to inhibit the interaction of the HER2 protein by binding to it, thus stopping the interaction that leads to cancer growth. Herceptin has been around for well over a decade now, and it's probably no surprise that this effective inhibitor of HER2 brought in $6.6 billion in sales in 2015, a 10% jump from the previous year.An experimental cancer vaccine worth eyeing is  '(NASDAQ: INO) VGX-3100, which is being targeted at cervical dysplasia caused by HPV types 16 and 18. VGX-3100 is currently in late-stage studies, but it delivered exciting results in a previously released midstage readout. In that readout, VGX-3100 reduced the grade of disease from CIN 2 or CIN 3 to CIN 1 or no disease in 49.5% of patients, and it led to the clearance of HPV and a regression from CIN 2/3 to CIN 1 or no disease in 40.2% of patients. By comparison, only 30.6% of placebo patients saw a regression in disease to CIN 1 or no disease, and just 14.3% also had HPV clearance.There are a lot of exciting things going on with cancer research, and I personally look forward to seeing steady progress made in the fight against cancer.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

"Image source: Getty Images.Clinical-stage biotech  (NASDAQ: CLDX) is down about 70% year to date, after its first candidate to reach late-stage development failed in March. However, the company's pipeline is robust, and it just became a bit larger.Tibor Keler, the company's co-founder and chief scientific officer, presented the latest pipeline info at a recent healthcare investor conference. Despite being a relatively young biotech that just lost its lead candidate, its pipeline is bustling with activity. Here's what management wants you to know.Since its inception just over 10 years ago, Celldex has amassed an impressive array of targeted oncology candidates. Rather than put all its eggs in one basket, it has new drug candidates in early- and late-stage clinical studies that Keler describes as the following:Its first drug to enter phase 3, Rintega, was a cancer vaccine that targeted brain cancer cells with a specific mutation associated with tumor spreading. Adding it to a standard of care with Avastin from  produced significantly improved outcomes in a small phase 2 trial. When Celldex announced its failure in phase 3 -- as Rintega performed consistently, but patients receiving a standard chemotherapy, temozolomide, performed unusually well -- the stock took a beating under the assumption the rest of its candidates were useless.When Rintega failed, Celldex already had an entirely different candidate, Glemba, in a phase 2b trial designed to support an application.Clinical-stage pipeline. Image source: Celldex Therapeutics.Looking further ahead, Celldex is taking multiple shots on goal with immune-modulating candidate varlilumab in combination with the incredibly successful Opdivo from  and recently approved Tecentriq from Roche.Even further out are CDX-1401, CDX-301, and CDX-014, which are all aimed at their own specific targets, with the intention of destroying cancer cells in different ways. All of Celldex's candidates may be targeted cancer therapies, but aiming them at different targets makes ""differentiated"" seem like an understatement.Drug development isn't cheap, and far too many clinical-stage biotech investors see their slice of potential profits dwindle as companies sell more of their own shares to fund development of their pipeline. This isn't an immediate issue for Celldex, as Keler went on to describe the company as the following:While the company is in a relatively solid position financially, this might be a bit of a stretch. Celldex exited March debt-free with about $254 million in cash and marketable securities. During the first quarter, $27.5 million spent on R&D pushed total losses to $34.7 million for the three-month period.Glemba's registrational phase 2b trial was still taking on patients when the company last reported, and previous expectations to complete enrollment by the end of the year have been pushed back. Once all patients are enrolled, we can reasonably expect primary goal results within less than a year, but for the moment it's hard to put a timeline on Glemba data.At the rate Celldex has been burning through cash, it probably has enough to keep the lights on until we know if Glemba's a winner. If it succeeds, and the stock soars, selling a few shares to keep operations rolling wouldn't lead to heavy dilutions. Conversely, if Glemba fails, Celldex stock would probably receive another beating and require heavy share dilution, or debt, to fund development of  the candidates in its growing pipeline.Unlike Rintega, Glemba is a double-sided drug with a protein that recognizes a cancer target, gpNMB, on one side, connected to a lethal chemo-bomb that it releases after binding to its target and entering the cell. This is what Keler was referring to when he mentioned ""antibody-drug conjugates"" as an example of the biotech's varied approach.In the underserved population of breast cancer patients with tumors that don't express three common targets that existing therapies aim for, Glemba could become an important option. Referring to a small group of these ""triple-negative"" breast cancer patients within a larger trial, Keler said:What he's referring to is a previous study with 124 heavily pre-treated, advanced breast cancer patients. There were 16 patients in the trial with triple negative tumors that overexpress gpNMB. Among this group, patients receiving Glemba survived without disease progression for 3.5 months, as opposed to just 1.5 months for those receiving an investigator's choice of existing therapies.There are an estimated 170,000 breast cancer patients with triple negative tumors, but the number that also express gpNMB at high levels is unclear. Glemba's pivotal trial is measuring progression free survival against a single chemo drug, Roche's Xeloda, in these patients. If it performs as well in the 300-patient trial as it did among the 16 patient subgroup, I would expect Celldex stock to soar.Further out than Glemba is a protein that targets CD27, commonly found on the surface of tumor cells. It's supposed to promote an immune response when it binds its target, but with drugs like these, concern for overstimulation of the immune system are well justified. This doesn't seem to be an issue with varlilumab. Referring to phase 1 trial results, Keler said:While varlilumab accelerates an immune response on its own, that phase 1 trial paved the way for testing varlilumab in combination with several drugs that take the brakes off the immune system. Most notable is an ongoing trial with Bristol's Opdivo, a drug on pace to pass $3 billion in sales in its second full-year post approval.It's under study in combination with Opdivo in several tumor types. Which indication might move forward, if any, is unclear at this point. The good news is that in combination with Opdivo, its safety profile held up. This paves the way for further studies in combination with Opdivo and others in this incredibly important class of cancer therapies. Look for more data from varlilumab next year.In addition to Glemba, Celldex recently began a phase 1 trial with a similar drug aimed at a different target often expressed on kidney cancer cells. Called CDX-014, the protein side seeks TIM-1, and once inside releases a chemo-bomb. These double-sided drugs are called antibody drug conjugates (ADCs), and according to Keler:While chemotherapy drugs have long been associated with immune-system suppression, ADCs such as Glemba and CDX-014 may actually complement other immune system modulating therapies. It's early still, but some evidence suggests ADCs actually stimulate an immune response.There are several ways Celldex could act on this. It might initiate studies with its own ADCs, in combination with drugs such as Opdivo. Perhaps it will employ a commercial-stage ADC, such as Adcetris from  in combination with its immunotherapies.Just what form future combination studies might take is unclear, but we can certainly expect more data for Celldex candidates in the quarters ahead.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

 reported a loss of 23 cents per share, narrower than both the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 33 cents and the year-ago loss of 38 cents.Revenues came in at $95.4 million, up 23.7% year over year, primarily due to strong sales of Adcetris. Revenues were also above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $93.2 million.Seattle Genetics' top line comprises product revenues, collaboration and license agreement revenues, and royalties.The company's only marketed product, Adcetris, generated revenues of $66.2 million, up 20.2% year over year.Collaboration and license agreement revenues increased 39% to almost $20 million. Collaboration revenues include fees earned from the company's agreement with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd.  for Adcetris and other ADC collaborations.Royalty revenues surged 20.7% to $9.2 million driven by royalties from Takeda for international sales of Adcetris.Research and development (R&D) expenses were $85.6 million, down 0.2% year over year. On the other hand, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 9.7% to $33.3 million. | Seattle Genetics continues to progress with the candidates in its pipeline. The company expects to report data from a phase III study (ALCANZA) on Adcetris for relapsed CD30-expressing cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in the third quarter of 2016.In addition, the company has initiated a phase III study on vadastuximab talirine to evaluate 33A in combination with hypomethylating agents Vidaza (azacitidine) or Dacogen (decitabine) in older patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia.Seattle Genetics' second-quarter 2016 results were impressive with the company reporting a narrow-than-expected loss and revenues beating estimates. We are also impressed by robust sales of Adcetris in the U.S. and Canada. The company's efforts on expanding the products label are also encouraging. We note that earlier this month, Adcetris was approved in the EU for the treatment of adult patients with CD30+ Hodgkin lymphoma at increased risk of relapse or progression following autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). However, the company's sole dependence on Adcetris for growth remains a major concern.Going forward, we expect investor focus to remain on Adcetris' performance and pipeline updates at the company.Seattle Genetics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

"n recent trading, shares of Seattle Genetics Inc (Symbol: SGEN) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $57.00, changing hands for $57.25/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 11 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Seattle Genetics Inc, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $38.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $130.00. The standard deviation is $25.973.But the whole reason to look at the  SGEN price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with SGEN crossing above that average target price of $57.00/share, investors in SGEN have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $57.00 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Seattle Genetics Inc:

2 earnings season is picking up pace with 1,000 companies including 189 S&P 500 members scheduled to report this week.So far, about 126 S&P 500 members have reported results accounting for 32.7% of the index's total market capitalization. While total earnings for these 126 index members are down 1.1% from the year-ago quarter, revenues declined 2.6% year-over year, with 70.6% beating earnings estimates and 55.6% surpassing top-line expectations.The picture so far indicates a slight improvement from the results seen in the last two quarters. However, growth remains non-existent and Q2 is on track to be the 5th quarter in a row of earnings declines for the S&P 500 index.A look at our  report shows that as of Jul 21, 2016, 13.5% of Medical companies (within the S&P 500 index) reported results with earnings growing 6.9% from the year-ago period on revenue growth of 17.6%. Results of companies like Johnson & Johnson  and Biogen, Inc.  not only soared past expectations, guidance for the year was also raised. Abbott also surpassed expectations (Read more:  ).Once again, the Medical sector is expected to be among the better-performing sectors in Q2 with earnings expected to grow 1.7% on revenue growth of 7.7%.This week, several medical companies are scheduled to report results. Here's a look at how 5 biotech and diagnostic stocks, scheduled to report results on Jul 26, are placed ahead of the scheduled announcements.San Francisco, CA-based Medivation, Inc.  is a biopharmaceutical company that focuses on the development of novel small molecule drugs for the treatment of serious diseases for which there are limited treatment options. Medivation currently has one marketed product - Xtandi - in its portfolio. The company is expected to report second quarter results on Jul 26.Medivation's earnings track record is pretty disappointing, with the company reporting lower-than-expected earnings in three of the last four quarters with an average earnings surprise of -19.74%. Medivation currently has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and an  of 0.00%, which makes surprise prediction difficult. In fact, sell-rated stocks (#4 and #5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement. | Madison, WI-based Exact Sciences Corporation  is a molecular diagnostics company with a pretty good earnings track record. The company surpassed expectations in three of the last four quarters with an average earnings surprise of +5.95%. However, Exact's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction for Q2 difficult. Exact will be reporting second quarter results on Jul 26 before the market opens. | Fort Myers, FL-based NeoGenomics, Inc.  will also be reporting second quarter results on Jul 26. The company, which specializes in cancer genetics testing and information services, has a pretty impressive earnings track record with an average surprise of +113.33%. However, NeoGenomics' Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction for Q2 difficult. | Clinical-stage biopharma company, Alder BioPharmaceuticals, Inc.  , will report its second quarter 2016 financial results on Jul 26  . The Bothell, WA-based company is focused on the development of antibodies with the potential to meaningfully transform current treatment paradigms. The company's lead pipeline candidate is being developed for the prevention of migraine.Alder's earnings track record is pretty disappointing with the company missing expectations in three of the last four quarters with an average surprise of -5.39%. Moreover, Alder's Zacks Rank #2 and Earnings ESP of -4.00% make surprise prediction for Q2 difficult. | Seattle Genetics, Inc.  , another Bothell, WA-based biotechnology company, will be reporting second quarter results on Jul 26 after the market closes. Focused on the development and commercialization of targeted therapies for the treatment of cancer, Seattle Genetics has a marketed drug, Adcetris, in its portfolio.Seattle Genetics' earnings track record is quite dismal with the company missing expectations in each of the last four quarters with an average surprise of -28.12%.

 announced that its partner Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited  has received marketing authorization for the label expansion of its lymphoma drug, Adcetris.The European Commission (EC) has approved the drug for a third indication - for the treatment of adult patients with CD30+ Hodgkin lymphoma, who are at increased risk of relapse or progression following autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT).We note that the EC had granted conditional marketing authorization to Adcetris in 2012 for two indications in adult patients - relapsed or refractory CD30-positive Hodgkin lymphoma following ASCT, and relapsed or refractory systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (sALCL). Last month, the EC extended the current conditional approval of the drug. The drug is now approved for the treatment of adult patients with CD30+ Hodgkin lymphoma, who are at increased risk of relapse or progression following ASCT.This January, the EC approved a type II variation to include data on the retreatment of adult patients with Hodgkin lymphoma or sALCL, who had responded to Adcetris but which relapsed later.We remind investors that the drug is already approved in the U.S. for three indications related to lymphoma.Meanwhile, Adcetris is being evaluated in more than 70 ongoing clinical trials which include ALCANZA trial (phase III), ECHELON-1(front-line classical HL), ECHELON-2 (front-line mature T-cell lymphomas), along with additional types of CD30-expressing lymphomas, including B-cell lymphomas. | Both Seattle Genetics and Takeda are developing Adcetris under a collaboration agreement, under which Seattle Genetics owns the commercialization rights of the drug in the U.S. and Canada, while Takeda enjoys the same in the rest of the world. The companies are jointly funding the development costs equally, except in Japan where Takeda is solely responsible for development costs.We note that Adcetris is the growth engine for Seattle Genetics. Apart from Adcetris, the company is evaluating another antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) candidate, vadastuximab talirine (SGN-CD33A; 33A), in a phase III trial for acute myeloid leukemia.Seattle Genetics carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

 data by  .With this in mind, let's dig deeper and consider whether investors should buy these three beaten-down biopharma stocks right now.There's no denying that Astra's top line has taken a hit following the the loss of patent protection for key products like acid reflux medication Nexium. After all, the drugmaker's sales are expected to dip by 1.3% this year and another 2.5% in 2017. And with the pound sterling taking a massive hit on the Brexit vote, Britain-based Astra will almost certainly face unfavorable foreign exchange rates moving forward, perhaps forcing a reduction in its sky-high dividend yield of almost 7%.To mitigate these challenges, Astra is pivoting toward the emerging immuno-oncology space, with the goal of returning to growth by 2018 and increasing its annual revenues by a whopping 86% by 2023. The feasibility of Astra's lofty long-term guidance should get its first real test with the company's key regulatory filings for its programmed death-ligand 1, durvalumab, in head and neck cancer and lung cancer next year. Of course, experimental-stage drugs are never a sure bet, and durvalumab has run into some bumps along the way that may delay the drug's expected regulatory time frame.Because Seattle Genetics remains cash-flow negative nearly five years after the approval of its flagship antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), Adcetris, the drugmaker's stock has struggled mightily in this volatile market. The good news is that Seattle Genetics is close to releasing top-line data for Adcetris' pivotal-stage trial in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, and the company expects the drug's other late-stage trials for front-line classical Hodgkin lymphoma and front-line mature T-cell lymphoma to read out within the next two years. If things go as planned, Seattle Genetics will double the number of approved indications for its lead product in just a few short years.Beyond these late-stage trials for Adcetris, the biotech also sports a deep and diverse clinical pipeline of anti-cancer drugs based mainly on its ADC platform. As an example, the experimental ADC vadastuximab talirine (SGN-CD33A; 33A), indicated as a front-line treatment for patients with acute myeloid leukemia, has garnered a significant amount attention lately because of its 41% complete remission rate in a small, early-stage study that prompted the company to push the drug into a pivotal-stage trial.Seattle Genetics ended the most recent quarter with over $600 million in cash, meaning that it should be able to fund its robust clinical pipeline without having to dilute shareholders into oblivion.Investors have been waiting for nearly a year for Teva to formally buy  's(NYSE: AGN) massive generic-drug business, which sports over a thousand products. As Teva has now apparently cleared the deck in terms of meeting the Federal Trade Commission's antitrust requirements following multiple divestitures in the past month, this deal should be consummated within a matter of weeks, according to both Allergan and Teva. If so, Teva's top line is forecast to jump by 12.5% next year, implying that this generic-drug maker's shares are currently trading at a reasonable forward price-to-earnings ratio of 8.4.Having said that, there are still numerous unresolved issues surrounding Teva's forward-looking valuation once this deal goes through -- such as the sustainability of its revenues from flagship multiple-sclerosis drug Copaxone. To fill in the gaps, Teva is planning to provide some color on its long-term value proposition come September. So, while the details might be somewhat fuzzy at this stage, the main takeaway is that Teva should be in a much stronger position from a revenue standpoint after this deal closes, and the optimistic outlook suggests that Teva may even transform into one of the fastest-growing healthcare stocks as early as next year.Projecting future valuation scenarios is a tricky business, especially in the highly regulated world of biopharmaceuticals. One clinical or regulatory setback, after all, can change a company's outlook almost instantly. Nonetheless, my take is that Astra, Seattle Genetics, and Teva are all nearing an inflection point in terms of their core value propositions. Astra should be able to break into the high-growth immuno-oncology space with durvalumab soon, Seattle Genetics is barreling toward pivotal-stage data readouts for Adcetris, and Teva's deal with Allergan looks like a game-changer. As the market has seemingly already built in the worst case for each stock -- given how they have been trading so far in 2016 -- I think these three biopharma stocks are indeed compelling bargains right now.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

nvestors in Seattle Genetics Inc (Symbol: SGEN) saw new options begin trading today, for the July 15th expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the SGEN options chain for the new July 15th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $38.00 strike price has a current bid of 95 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $38.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $37.05 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of SGEN, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $40.00/share today.Because the $38.00 strike represents an approximate 5% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

 .  announced that it has initiated a phase III trial, CASCADE, on vadastuximab talirine (SGN-CD33A).The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial will evaluate if vadastuximab talirine, in combination with Vidaza or Dacogen, can extend overall survival compared to Vidaza or Dacogen alone in older patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML).We note that Vidaza and Dacogen are hypomethylating agents (HMAs) that are commonly used for the treatment of older AML patients.According to the American Cancer Society, AML will affect 20,000 people in the U.S. in 2016, and result in 10,500 deaths. Hence, there is significant need for treatments in this area.The trial will enroll 500 patients globally who will be randomized on a 1:1 ratio to be treated with an HMA plus 33A or an HMA plus placebo.Interim results from the ongoing phase I study, evaluating 33A in combination with HMAs in frontline AML and as monotherapy in primarily relapsed AML, were presented in 2015. Data from the phase I 33A combination trial showed that 15 out of 23 (65%) evaluable patients achieved complete remission and complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery (CR/Cri). Updated data from the ongoing phase I study on 33A in combination with HMAs will be presented in an oral presentation at the 2016 European Hematology Association Congress scheduled next month.Meanwhile, Seattle Genetics is evaluating 33A across multiple lines of therapy in patients with AML and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) in various trials.We note that Adcetris is the only marketed product in Seattle Genetics' portfolio, which has made the company highly dependent on the drug for growth. As a result, the development of pipeline candidates is essential for the company to reduce its dependence on Adectris. Successful development and commercialization of vadastuximab talirine will boost Seattle Genetics' top line significantly.Seattle Genetics carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

"The statistics of the effects of cancer in the U.S. are sobering. By the end of this year, there will be nearly 1.7 million new  , according to the  . Approximately 600,000 will succumb to the disease, making the research conducted by oncology therapeutic firms all the more critical. Source: Naturally, cancer-fighting stocks have both a humanitarian and profitability component, but their prospects have soured over the past year.However, recent data suggests that investors are opening their hearts and wallets to this life-saving sector.Much of the volatility experienced by cancer-fighting stocks can be traced to the underlining biotechnology industry. The benchmark exchange-traded fund  (  ) absorbed some ugly hits after peaking in the summer of 2015.Further scandals and charges of corruption, price gouging and financial chicanery have sadly cast a dark shadow on biotech as a whole. In the past 52 weeks, IBB is down 27%, while year-to-date, it's down 22%.Unfortunately, wherever there is money to be made, fraudulent behavior is sure to follow. Biotech and the broader healthcare industry are not immune to this fact. But regardless of the public relations damage that has been done, cancer-fighting stocks are making progress where it matters the most - delivering therapies.The number of people living beyond a cancer diagnosis is expected to rise from approximately 15 million in 2014 to 19 million by the year 2024. That is largely due to treatments that push the boundaries of scientific innovation.Here are three cancer-fighting stocks that may return handsome profits - and save lives in the process.Over the past five years, ECYT is down 70% - the worst such
performance among the cancer-fighting stocks on this list. Biopharmaceutical company  . (  ) has suffered quite a volatile ride.Over the past five years, ECYT is down 70% - the worst such performance among the cancer-fighting stocks on this list.Fortunately, there appears to be some light at the end of the tunnel. Since Feb. 22 of this year, ECYT has gained over 8%. In addition, shares appear to be forming a bullish trend channel, charting a series of higher highs and higher lows.ECYT shareholders got a fundamental boost thanks to narrower-than-expected losses put up by the company's first quarter of fiscal year 2016  . ECYT absorbed a loss of 24 cents per share, while consensus estimates pegged it at -26 cents.Click to Enlarge Helping the figures was a 1.3% year-over-year reduction in research and development costs, which primarily stemmed from a completed drug trial. Also, general and administrative costs were slashed by more than 12%, mostly due to cuts in legal and professional services.Moving forward, the market value of ECYT will depend largely on their cancer-fighting  . Of particular interest is EC1456 - a potential treatment for late-stage tumors - and their prostate cancer drug EC1169. ECYT has forecasted that R&D spending will noticeably rise in the second half of this year due to the testing of these drugs. In addition, efficacy data is expected from EC1169 by late 2016 or early 2017.While it's anybody's guess as to the trials' outcomes, investors will be encouraged that ECYT is putting effort into keeping their financials as stable as possible. . (  ) is the high-flyer among mid-tier cancer-fighting stocks. After taking a wicked hit in the month and a half following the new year, SGEN has gained a good chunk of it back.In the past three months, SGEN is up nearly 28%. Technically, the bulls are attempting to find some range of stability after SGEN failed to build off last year's high of nearly $52.Fortunately, recent developments look very encouraging. This week so far, SGEN is up 16%, and thing could look better still.Click to Enlarge The first piece of evidence is from the company's Q1 results. Although SGEN failed to deliver the goods on earnings - taking a 15 cent loss on expectations of losing only 9 cents - there was plenty to be optimistic about.  from international sales of Adcetris - the only commercial product of SGEN - nearly tripled to $32.3 million from $11.1 million in the year-ago quarter.Industry giant  (  ) sells Adcetris outside the U.S. and Canada.What has investors of cancer-fighting stocks really excited is Seattle Genetics' increased  . SGEN will research other derivative solutions from Adcetris, which is currently used to treat lymphomas. In addition, SGEN will conduct experiments on 12 new drugs, which are in various stages of clinical trials.Unlike other embattled cancer-fighting stocks, SGEN has a strong balance sheet with no debt. This gives the company the financial leverage necessary to pump the drug pipeline without making investors nervous.SGEN is clearly in it for the long haul, which should provide potential buyers with a lot of confidence in an otherwise shaky industry.The flagship of that pipeline is CD19 - a , and being tested in multiple phase-1 and phase-2 trials at this
time. As with other cancer-fighting stocks, 2016 didn't exactly start out the way the management team from  . (  ) imagined.JUNO opened up the first month of the year deep in the red, dropping 37% in the markets. Since then, however, JUNO stock has made significant strides. Over the past 90 days, shares are up double digits.Technically, JUNO has stabilized in an upward leaning trend channel. Now, all it needs is a fundamental catalyst.Click to Enlarge That catalyst by and large depends upon the clinical progress made by the company's  pipeline.Similar to many mid-tier cancer-fighting stocks, JUNO isn't exactly going to win over investors with its financials alone. Instead, it has to rely upon its scientific expertise, of which JUNO has plenty. The company specializes in genetic engineering to root out and fight cancer cells.If perfected, that would provide a focalized treatment as opposed to current methodologies like  , which can destroy healthy cells.Several Wall Street analysts have seen enough of the JUNO technology to jump onboard. Cowen and Co. recently started covering JUNO stock, giving it an ""outperform"" rating. Last February, two investment firms - Citigroup and Guggenheim Securities - issued a buy recommendation.The point of emphasis is that JUNO will live and die by its clinical trials. That said, it would appear that those in the know have bullish leanings.It is certainly on the speculative side of things, but should JUNO break new scientific ground, there's no telling how high the stock could go.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@3 Cancer-Fighting Stocks Making Waves in the Markets@2016-05-20@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-cancer-fighting-stocks-making-waves-in-the-markets-2016-05-20

Seattle's stock forged higher despite a lack of major catalysts -- except, perhaps, for the start of the company's pivotal trial for SGN-CD33A in older patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia. However, given that this news broke late in the month, and the initiation of a clinical trial isn't that big of a deal, it probably didn't play much of a role in Seattle's double-digit rise in May. data by  Seattle's stock has been getting hammered this year due, in part, to the wider pullback in the biotech and biopharma industries. The  ETF(NASDAQ: IBB) has dropped by more than 17% this year, primarily due to political rhetoric surrounding drug pricing schemes: data by As both Seattle's shares and the closely watched IBB ETF rallied in May, though, we may be seeing the beginning of a fundamental change in market sentiment toward the biotech industry. Of course, the underlying reason why Seattle's stock took such a beating during the recent biotech downturn is that the company remains cash-flow negative despite growing sales of its antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), Adcetris, as a later-line treatment for classical Hodgkin's lymphoma and systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma.The bottom line is that Adcetris' sales haven't lived up to expectations since the drug was approved back in 2011. To remedy this situation, the company is hoping to expand the drug's label to include cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in the near-term.The good news is that Adcetris' ongoing pivotal trial for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, known as ALCANZA, should produce top-line data by the third quarter of this year, according to the company's latest update. Beyond that, Seattle has two additional ongoing pivotal-stage trials for Adcetris in both front-line classical Hodgkin lymphoma and front-line mature T-cell lymphoma that are expected to read out over the course of 2017 to 2018.All told, Seattle does have several clinical catalysts on the horizon for its flagship product Adcetris, along with its other experimental ADCs, implying that its stock could recapture some of its former glory moving forward. Having said that, I'd rather stick to broader biotech plays like the IBB that don't depend so heavily on risky clinical trial readouts.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

nvestors eyeing a purchase of Seattle Genetics Inc (Symbol: SGEN) shares, but cautious about paying the going market price of $33.13/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the December put at the $25 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $1.30. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 5.2% return against the $25 commitment, or a 8.5% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to SGEN's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $25 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Seattle Genetics Inc sees its shares decline 24.6% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $23.70 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $1.30 from $25), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 8.5% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Seattle Genetics Inc, and highlighting in green where the $25 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the December put at the $25 strike for the 8.5% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Seattle Genetics Inc (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $33.13) to be 48%.

" released first-quarter earnings results on Thursday, and while sales of Adcetris continued to grow, they weren't quite as robust as investors were hoping for. 
  
What happened with Seattle GeneticsIMAGE SOURCE: SEATTLE GENETICS.Sales of Adcetris in the U.S. and Canada, where Seattle Genetics sells the drug, were up 20%, to $58.6 million. Adcetris is Seattle Genetics' most-important asset because it generates revenue. However, investors shouldn't forget about the biotech's pipeline, especially SGN-CD33A, because it's ready to be tested in a trial that can be used to gain regulatory approval. As president and CEO Clay Siegall explained, ""We are on track to advance 33A into a phase 3 registrational trial in frontline older patients with acute myeloid leukemia by the third quarter of this year.""There's also opportunity to expand Adcetris' sales substantially if the ongoing ECHELON-1 (E-1) trial is positive. ""So we think that if you look at E-1 and the opportunity in frontline Hodgkin lymphoma, it is well in excess of $1 billion,"" Siegall said. Management stuck by its guidance for Adcetris sales in U.S. and Canada between $255 million to $275 million. To hit that goal, sales will have to pick up from the $58.6 million in the first quarter. Presumably, factors like inventory drawdown won't be an issue in future quarters.To increase sales substantially from there, Seattle Genetics needs to expand into other patients, so positive data from the aforementioned ALCANZA trial are critical. Further behind, ECHELON-1 trial in frontline Hodgkin lymphoma is set to read out sometime in 2017 through mid-2018, and data from the ECHELON-2 trial in mature T-cell lymphoma is expected in 2017 or 2018, depending on when it finishes enrolling patients.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

fter a ho-hum fourth-quarter earnings season, investors are on the edge of their seats for the first quarter. The start of 2016 was mired by macroeconomic issues like wildly swinging  and a slowdown in China.The volatility which was sparked off in the second half of 2015 by Democratic Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's price gouging tweet continued to plague the biotech sector in 2016 as well. The NYSE ARCA Biotech Index (^BTK) and NASDAQ Biotechnology Index (^NBI) have declined 11.6% and 12.0%, respectively, so far this year.Notwithstanding the decline, things surely look far better now than they did a couple of months back. Last week, Biogen Inc. (BIIB) reported better-than-expected earnings for the first quarter of 2016 even though revenues fell short of expectations.It has been a busy year so far for the biotech sector. M&A and licensing deals continue to be a key area of focus with Shire (SHPG) announcing the acquisition of Baxalta Inc. (BXLT) for $32 billion right at the onset of 2016. The acquisition is expected to close by mid-year. And last week, rumors of AstraZeneca (AZN) making a bid for Xtandi maker Medivation (MDVN) surfaced.Meanwhile, new product approvals along with label expansion of existing drugs and regular pipeline updates for key drugs kept investors' attention glued to the sector. Earlier in the month, the FDA's Gastrointestinal Drugs Advisory Committee voted unanimously in favor of Intercept Pharmaceuticals' (ICPT) lead pipeline candidate, Ocaliva (obeticholic acid) while AbbVie along with partner Roche (RHHBY) received accelerated approval for oncology drug Venclexta (venetoclax) for previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia with a 17p deletion.On the other hand, BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (BMRN) was dealt a blow when the company received a Complete Response Letter for Kyndrisa for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) amenable to exon 51 skipping. Sucampo Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (SCMP) too slumped recently when a phase II study on pipeline candidate, cobiprostone, failed to meet the primary endpoint in a trial on patients with non-erosive reflux disease or symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease.Nevertheless, given the strong fundamentals, healthy pipelines and the drive to find innovative treatments for rare diseases, the happening biotech sector should be a good bet for investors. Here we help you to identify some companies in the biotech sector that have the potential to beat earnings in their upcoming releases. These stocks are well positioned in today's market environment, and could see considerable upside riding on the aforementioned trends. An earnings beat should help these stocks gain investor confidence and show a favorable price movement.Given a large number of industry participants, pinpointing stocks that have the potential to beat estimates could appear to be a daunting task. But our proprietary methodology makes it fairly simple. One way to narrow down the list of choices this earnings season is by looking at stocks that have the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank - Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) - and a positive  .Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising in their next earnings announcement. It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Our research shows that for stocks with this combination, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%.Below are five biotech stocks we believe are best positioned to stand out as we take a stand in the ongoing earnings season:Biotech bigwig,  (  ) carries a Zacks Rank #2 with an Earnings ESP of +1.65%. Gilead's key areas of focus include human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), liver diseases such as chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, cardiovascular, hematology/oncology and inflammation/respiratory. The company is a leader in the HCV market with key drugs like Sovaldi and Harvoni.The company has an excellent track record and registered positive earnings surprises in the last four quarters with an average beat of 7.8%. The company is expected to report first-quarter results on Apr 28. . (  ) is also looking up this season with a Zacks Rank #3 with an Earnings ESP of +63.64%. Seattle Genetics primarily focuses on the development and commercialization of therapies targeted for the treatment of cancer. The company's only marketed product, Adcetris, is approved for relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma and relapsed systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma. The company is expected to report first-quarter results on Apr 28. . (  ) carries a Zacks Rank #3 with an Earnings ESP of +22.35%. The company's product portfolio comprises five marketed products, namely, Aldurazyme, Naglazyme, Kuvan, Firdapse and Vimizim. The company is expected to report first-quarter results on Apr 28. (  ) carries a Zacks Rank #3 with an Earnings ESP of +1.77%. The company has a presence in the rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, HIV, HCV, testosterone, Parkinson's disease, ulcerative colitis, and chronic kidney disease markets. AbbVie's flagship product Humira is approved for several indications like rheumatoid arthritis (moderate to severe), Crohn's disease (moderate to severe) and ulcerative colitis (moderate to severe), among others. The company has an impressive track record with an average earnings beat of 4.85%. The company is expected to report first-quarter results on Apr 28. (  ) carries a Zacks Rank #3 with an Earnings ESP of +2.56%. Amgen has a strong presence in the supportive cancer care, nephrology and autoimmune disease markets with drugs like Enbrel, Neulasta, Epogen, and Neupogen among others. The company has an excellent track record and registered positive earnings surprises in the last four quarters with an average beat of 13.7%. The company is expected to report first-quarter results on Apr 28.Although hurdles remain in the form of biosimilars and currency headwinds, investors would do well to keep an eye on these potential outperformers given their solid Zacks Rank and positive Zacks Earnings ESP.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the PowerShares Russell Midcap Pure Growth Portfolio ETF (Symbol: PXMG), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $33.40 per unit.With PXMG trading at a recent price near $29.61 per unit, that means that analysts see 12.81% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of PXMG's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Wyndham Worldwide Corp (Symbol: WYN), Seattle Genetics Inc (Symbol: SGEN), and Polaris Industries Inc. (Symbol: PII). Although WYN has traded at a recent price of $70.39/share, the average analyst target is 16.49% higher at $82.00/share. Similarly, SGEN has 14.64% upside from the recent share price of $39.08 if the average analyst target price of $44.80/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting PII to reach a target price of $114.12/share, which is 12.96% above the recent price of $101.03. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of WYN, SGEN, and PII:Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
  
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Analysts Anticipate 13% Gains Ahead For The Holdings of PXMG@2016-04-27@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/analysts-anticipate-13-gains-ahead-holdings-pxmg-2016-04-27

 is expected to report first-quarter 2016 results on Apr 19. Perrigo has a pretty good track record with the company beating estimates in three of the last four quarters with an average earnings surprise of 1.84%. In the last reported quarter, Perrigo recorded a negative earnings surprise of 7.22%.Let's see how things are shaping up for the company this quarter.At the time of reporting fourth-quarter 2015 results, Perrigo guided 2016 earnings in the range of $9.50 to $9.80 per share (representing a year-over-year increase of 25-29%) and net sales in the range of $5.9-$6.2 billion (representing a year-over-year increase of 10-16%).On the fourth quarter call, the company mentioned that it expects about 40% of earnings to come in the first half of 2016 while 60% should be generated in the second half of the year. Specifically, the company projected earnings to grow in the low single digits in the first quarter of 2016. Moreover, the Mar 2015 Omega Pharma acquisition is expected to impact the year-over-year earnings per share comparison.As far as Perrigo's business segments are concerned, though seasonality factors could affect the performance of the Consumer HealthCare segment in the first quarter of 2016, the Rx Pharmaceuticals segment should continue to perform well on the back of new product launches.The Branded Consumer Healthcare (BCH) segment recorded lower-than-expected sales in the fourth quarter of 2015. The segment was impacted by market dynamics in certain geographic sales channels including Belgium, Germany and Spain. While the segment failed to realize the benefits of a normal cough/cold/flu season in Europe, advertising and promotion investments did not drive the segment's sales. Notably, this segment allocates approximately 27% to 30% of their annual advertising and promotion spending to the first quarter.The company announced an extensive plan along with its fourth quarter earnings results to improve the segment's performance including putting into place the matrix leadership model and exiting underperforming brands so as to reallocate these resources to higher growth products among others.On the first quarter call, investor focus will be on the company's performance as well as on the progress with its plans for the BCH segment.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Perrigo is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below. The Earnings ESP for Perrigo is 0.00% since the Most Accurate estimate stands at $1.92 per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Perrigo currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, makes a surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are a few health care stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Biogen Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +1.79% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is scheduled to release first-quarter results on Apr 21.The Earnings ESP for Seattle Genetics, Inc.  is +63.64% and it carries a Zacks Rank #3.

"Image source: Seattle Genetics, Shares of  , a biotechnology company developing targeted cancer therapies, gained 9.83% in March, according to data from  .The news flow last month was relatively minor and included a request for confidential treatment of its amended agreement with . Previously, the company disclosed a reduction to the already low-single-digit royalty rate it pays Bristol on net sales of Adcetris and noted that the two had specified the agreement's termination date.The news flow last month was relatively minor and included a request for confidential treatment of its amended agreement with  . Previously, the company disclosed a reduction to the already low-single-digit royalty rate it pays Bristol on net sales of Adcetris and noted that the two had specified the agreement's termination date.While we won't know the secret agreement's details, there were hints of positivity in the form of moderate insider buying. Baker Bros. Advisors upped its stake, from 26.7% as of Feb, 16 to 31.1% as of March 24.There's an old saying when it comes to insider transactions: ""There are a millions of reasons to sell, but only one to buy."" While insider buying is generally a positive signal, blindly following insider purchases is ill-advised. You should know that Felix Baker has served as a director since 2003, despite requiring reelection every three years. The second and third largest stakeholders each own about 12.2% of the company's shares. This may have been an attempt to consolidate control, or simply a larger investment in a company with bright-looking future.Although undisclosed, the amendment to the Bristol-Myers agreement is probably also positive. However, I expect the company's burgeoning pipeline was a larger motivator of insider purchases, and the stock's gain. Its lead product, Adcetris, for treatment of Hodgkin's lymphoma has been stuck in the second line setting since its approval in 2011. A recent expansion last year to post-stem-cell-transplant Hodgkin patients helped push the company's top line 17% higher last year to $336.8 million.It's a good thing, too, because the company is also pushing hard to expand the Adcetris label to the front-line setting in Hodgkin's and other lymphomas with three phase 3 trials. The first two expected to finish could expand the Adcetris label somewhat. However, the largest expansion would come from the ECHELON-1 trial with advanced-stage but untreated Hodgkin's patients. It's measuring the standard four-agent regimen, against the three of the same agents, swapping Adcetris for chemo drug bleomycin.I'm afraid we'll have to wait a long time for meaningful results from this trial. Even when patients are diagnosed in stage 3, five-year survival rates for Hodgkin's lymphoma is about 80%. However, it's well worth the wait. With over 9,000 new cases diagnosed each year, Adcetris' inclusion in the first-line standard of care might be necessary to fund its rapidly expanding pipeline.The company's R&D budget was bigger than ever last year: $294.5 million. The good news is, the amount of data to be created over the next several years is even larger.While Seattle Genetics' R&D budget is relatively modest by big pharma standards, it's getting more than its money's worth. With more than 70 ongoing trials sponsored by itself, its partners, and independent investigators, it will be throwing off more clinical data than most companies twice its size in the years ahead.

nvestors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and  may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Seattle Genetics is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings-with the most up-to-date information possible-is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for SGEN in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at a loss of 4 cents per share for SGEN, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 11 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for SGEN, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of 63.64% heading into earnings season.A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more  ).Given that SGEN has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Seattle Genetics, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The best biotech stocks are always difficult to identify. After all, development-stage drug companies are frequently unprofitable and will either explode higher when a big-name treatment gets approved by the FDA … or go to zero when that drug performs poorly. Source: But biotech stocks don't have to be a crap shoot. Investors looking for the best biotech investments right now can get a piece of all the highfliers with a diversified investment in the  (NYSEARCA:  ).There are a lot of other healthcare funds in the marketplace, but XBI is by far the most superior investment you can make right now. That's because it holds a piece of the best biotech stocks out there, and is formulated in a way that offers true diversification and a true focus on the smallest companies with the biggest upside potential.For starters, everyone should have a sizable exposure to healthcare in general and biotech stocks in specific.There is the built-in growth for healthcare companies at large thanks to the demographic push of baby boomers who need more care as they age in the U.S., and continued expansion of modern medicine into emerging markets. Also, there is built-in stability for recession-proof healthcare companies, since patients will cut back on just about any other spending before they forgo drugs or therapies that extend their lives and reduce their pain.As for why biotech is one of the best segments of healthcare, it's all about growth.Mature Big Pharma stocks are often lumbering giants struggling to offset expiring patents and simply throwing off dividends (for now) in place of any actual growth potential. Biotechnology companies, like small-cap tech stocks, have very high ceilings, and many have very bright futures.Given all that, it's hard to argue there is a better place to put your money than XBI right now.For starters, the XBI is much better diversified than other similar ETFs. Consider competing biotech fund  (NASDAQ:  ) that has almost 25% of its assets in its top three positions right now.That's in contrast to the XBI, which has an equal-weight methodology that, as a result, means no stock has no more than a 2.1% weighting right now.Equally compelling is that the XBI fund errs on smaller companies instead of mature biotechs that have their biggest growth behind them. Consider the top three holdings of XBI as of this writing -  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ) - combine for a market capitalization of less than $9 billion.Meanwhile, IBB's top position,  (NASDAQ:  ), is worth a whopping $120 billion and its No. 2,  (NASDAQ:  ), is worth $110 billion. If you want small biotechs instead of the big players, XBI is your best choice.To top it off, the SPDR Biotech ETF is also cheaper than the competing iShares biotech fund at just 0.35%, or $35 annually on $10,000 invested; IBB is 0.48%, or $48 annually on $10,000.If you want exposure to the growth in healthcare, this fund is perfect - even if it is a bit more aggressive than some others. The diversification of the XBI fund allows you to catch enough winners to offset any holdings that many crash, and the long-term performance speaks for itself.The post ) - The Best Biotech Investment Now appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@SPDR S&P Biotech (ETF) (XBI) – The Best Biotech Investment Now@2016-03-24@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/spdr-sp-biotech-etf-xbi-the-best-biotech-investment-now-2016-03-24

"Shutterstock photoThe most recent short interest data was recently released by the NASDAQ for the 01/29/2016 settlement date, and Seattle Genetics Inc (Symbol: SGEN) is one of the most shorted stocks of the Russell 3000, based on 13.53 ""days to cover"" versus the median component at 4.92. There are a number of ways to look at short data, but one metric that we find particularly useful is the ""days to cover"" because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares typically traded. The number of shares short is then divided by the average daily volume, to express the total number of trading days it would take to close out all of the open short positions if every share traded represented a short position being closed.In the case of Seattle Genetics Inc (Symbol: SGEN), the total short interest at the 01/29/2016 settlement date was 18,209,730 shares, which compares to the average daily trading volume of just 1,346,358 shares, for a ""days to cover"" ratio of 13.53.When short sellers eventually cover their positions, by definition there must be buying activity because a share that is currently sold short must be purchased to be covered. At the present levels of short interest, if from this point forward every single SGEN share traded represented a short position being closed, then at the average daily volume of 1,346,358 shares it would only be during the 14th trading day that every short position would be closed.So it would stand to reason that should some unexpectedly good news come out, and short sellers did not have 14 days of patience but instead wanted to cover their short positions very suddenly, that situation could result in sending the stock higher until the higher price produces enough sellers to generate the necessary volume to close out those positions quickly.Seattle Genetics Inc (Symbol: SGEN) has something relatively rare for a stock with this much short interest, that being insiders taking the other side of the trade. Looking back over the trailing six month period, SGEN has seen 2 different instances of insider buying, as summarized by the table below:
  
Below is a chart showing the ""days to cover"" for SGEN over time:And looking at the chart below, SGEN's low point in its 52 week range is $26.02 per share, with $52.33 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $29.97.In recent trading, shares of Seattle Genetics Inc (Symbol: SGEN) were changing hands at $29.97/share.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@SGEN: Insiders vs. Shorts@2016-02-18@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/sgen-insiders-vs-shorts-2016-02-18
 reported a loss of 18 cents per share, a penny wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 17 cents but narrower than the year ago loss of 22 cents.Revenues came in at $93.5 million, up 25.8% year over year, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $88 million. The increase in revenues was due to higher Adcetris sales, increased royalty revenues from international sales of Adcetris by Takeda  and the antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) collaborations.The company reported full year revenues of $336.8 million, up 17.4% while full year 2015 loss came in at 93 cents per share, wider than the 2014 loss of 62 cents per share.Total revenue comprised product revenues, collaboration and license agreement revenues, and royalties. Adcetris, the only marketed product at Seattle Genetics, generated revenues of $63.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, up 35.5% from the year ago quarter. The new indication in the AETHERA setting, added to the label in Aug 2015, for the treatment of patients with classical Hodgkin lymphoma at high risk of relapse following autologous transplants, drove sales.Collaboration and license agreement revenues increased 11.7% from the year ago quarter to $17.9 million. Collaboration revenues included revenues earned from the company's Adcetris collaboration with Takeda as well as other ADC collaborations.Royalty revenues came in at $12.6 million, up 6.4% from the year ago period, driven by royalties from Takeda for international sales of Adcetris.In the reported quarter, research and development (R&D) expenses were $75 million million, up 16.5% year over year. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 14.3% year over year to $33.6 million.Seattle Genetics expects 2016 revenues in the range of $390 million - $430 million including the Adcetris net product sales of $255 million - $275 million, and revenues from collaborations and license agreements of $75 million - $90 million. The company said that it expects Adcetris sales to reflect modest growth as it continues to work on label expansions in earlier lines of therapy and other CD30-expressing lymphomas three ongoing phase III studies.The company expects royalty revenues in the range of $60 million - $65 million, including a $20 million one-time milestone payment to be reflected in the first quarter of 2016.While R&D spend is in the range of $360 million - $400 million, SG&A spend is expected in the range of $135 million - $145 million.The company will continue focusing on the commercialization and development of Adcetris, the development of vadastuximab talirine (33A, phase III registrational study to commence by the third quarter evaluating 33A in combination with hypomethylating agents in older patients with acute myeloid leukemia) and continued investment in the pipeline.Seattle Genetics' fourth-quarter 2015 results were mixed with the company missing bottom-line estimates but beating on revenues. While pleased with the company's efforts on expanding Adcetris' label, we remain concerned about the company's dependence on Adcetris for growth.We expect investor focus to remain on Adcetris' performance and pipeline updates.Seattle Genetics carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the PowerShares Russell Midcap Pure Growth Portfolio ETF (Symbol: PXMG), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $33.26 per unit.With PXMG trading at a recent price near $27.49 per unit, that means that analysts see 20.97% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of PXMG's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Seattle Genetics Inc (Symbol: SGEN), CoStar Group, Inc. (Symbol: CSGP), and Extended Stay America Inc (Symbol: STAY). Although SGEN has traded at a recent price of $32.48/share, the average analyst target is 35.47% higher at $44.00/share. Similarly, CSGP has 26.53% upside from the recent share price of $177.66 if the average analyst target price of $224.80/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting STAY to reach a target price of $18.50/share, which is 26.11% above the recent price of $14.67. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of SGEN, CSGP, and STAY:Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
  
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past.

" reported earnings on Tuesday. Despite the solid growth in sales, shares opened down today, possibly due to conservative guidance for the year ahead.
  
 In August, the Food and Drug Administration approved an expanded label for Adcetris for its use in high-risk Hodgkin lymphoma patients after undergoing a transplant, called a consolidation therapy. As Darren Cline, SVP of commercial, said about the launch into the new indication: ""Awareness and knowledge of the data are very high, and consolidation has been integrated into the NCCN guidelines and treatment plans for many top transplant centers.""In addition to getting a one-time milestone payment for exceeding $200 million in sales of Adcetris by Takeda, the higher sales each year also come with a higher royalty rate. ""The royalty rate on the first $100 million in net sales is in the mid-teens, increases to the high-teens between $100 million and $200 million, and increases again to the low-20s above $200 million,"" said Seattle Genetics' CFO Todd Simpson.IMAGE SOURCE: SEATTLE GENETICS. Management is guiding for 2016 revenue in the range of $390 million to $430 million, including Adcetris sales of $255 million to $275 million. At the midpoint, the latter would be a 17% increase from 2015 Adcetris sales of $226 million.Keep in mind that management tends to be conservative with their guidance. This time last year, management was guiding for Adcetris sales in the range of $200 million to $210 million, which it blew past.Expanding sales of Adcetris much further is going to require additional approvals to treat more patients. In the second half of this year, we'll get a readout from the ALCANZA trial in patients with relapsed cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Two other trials testing Adcetris as a first-line therapy in combination with chemotherapy will read out in the 2017 through mid-2018 time frame.Further back, Seattle Genetics is running two early-stage clinical trials testing Adcetris in combination with  's Opdivo. The partnership with Bristol-Myers Squibb makes a potential competitor into an ally since Opdivo is approved for a few solid tumors, but it seems likely that Bristol-Myers Squibb would have tried to move it into blood cancers on its own if Seattle Genetics didn't partner up.Beyond Adcetris, Seattle Genetics is advancing its next drug, vadastuximab talirine, which used to be called SGN-CD33A, into phase 3 development that should start in the third quarter of the year.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Nonetheless, the stock eventually gained 4.3% after two trading sessions.As per the terms of the agreement, AFM13 will be evaluated in combination with Keytruda in a phase Ib study for the treatment of patients with Hodgkin lymphoma, whose disease has relapsed or is refractory to chemotherapy, including treatment with Seattle Genetics, Inc.'s  Adcetris (brentuximab vedotin). Affimed will fund and conduct the study, while Merck will supply Keytruda to Affimed. The study is expected to be initiated in the first half of 2016.In addition, the agreement includes a provision to expand the collaboration to include a phase III study on the combination. Other details of the transaction were not disclosed.We note that AFM13 is currently being evaluated as monotherapy in a phase II study for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory Hodgkin lymphoma. Affimed expects to present interim data in the second quarter of 2016 and full data by the year end.Meanwhile, Affimed continues to progress with other candidates in its pipeline.

 and Seattle Genetics, Inc.  announced the initiation of a phase I/II study on a combination of the former's immunotherapy, Opdivo and the latter's antibody-drug conjugate, Adcetris. The study will evaluate the combination for patients with CD30-expressing relapsed or refractory B-cell and T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, peripheral T-cell lymphoma and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.We note that this is the second of the two studies being conducted under a collaboration agreement between Bristol-Myers and Seattle Genetics, which was announced earlier this year. The first study is evaluating Adcetris plus Opdivo for the treatment of patients suffering from relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma.Given that Adcetris is the only marketed product at Seattle Genetics, approval for additional indications should help in increasing the eligible patient population. In the first nine months of 2015, Adcetris generated revenues of $163 million, up approximately 24% year over year.Meanwhile, Bristol-Myers has been aggressively inking deals with health care companies like Eli Lilly  and others to study its high-profile immuno-oncology drug, Opdivo, to be used either alone or in combination with other therapies in multiple tumor types. The drug generated revenues of $305 million in the third quarter of 2015 compared with $122 million in the previous quarter. Currently, the company continues to work on label expansion of the drug.With licensing agreements and acquisitions in the highly lucrative immuno-oncology space continuing to attract attention, we expect to see more such deals over the coming months.Bristol-Myers currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

"So what's going on inside the First Trust NYSE Arca Biotech Index ETF that allowed it to buck this week's downturn? The NYSE Arca Biotech Index invests its capital in a broad base of companies from the biotechnology industry. The fund holds positions in 30 different biotechnology companies of all different sizes, though the median market cap inside the fund is currently hovering around $8 billion.One unique characteristic of this fund is that it follows an equal-weighted strategy, meaning it initially invests the same amount of capital in all 30 of its holdings and rebalances its holdings quarterly. By following this strategy the fund protects itself from becoming overly concentrated in just a handful of names.The strategy seems to be working just fine, considering the fund has slammed past the returns of the S&P 500 over the past decade.Here's a snapshot of its current top 10 holdings:
  
Source: FTPortfolios.com. There wasn't a lot of news this week to trigger any strong movements in the fund's top holdings. Still, that didn't stop two of the top holdings,  and  , from moving higher on the week.Seattle Genetics' move capped off a tremendous year. This stock popped nearly 40% higher in 2015 as investors continue to be impressed its growth. Revenue from Adcetris, Seattle Genetics' one and only drug, used to treat lymphoma, continues to show  , but it's not yet producing enough to allow the company to show a profit.That shouldn't worry investors, though, since the company has a number of late-stage trials in process that could continue to expand Adcetris' labelling, which should allow it to continue to grow at a fast pace. The company also boasts a war chest of more than $736 million in cash, so financing the company's research and development efforts isn't a concern.Ionis Pharmaceuticals is a bit of a different story. For decades, the company was called ISIS Pharmaceuticals, but in light of current events, it began trading under its new name on Dec. 22. As Lynne Parshall, Ionis' chief operating officer, explained it, ""We decided to change our company name because, when people see or hear our name, we want them to think about the life-saving medicines we are developing.""The market appears to be applauding the new name. Shares are up more then 7% since the name change officially rolled out. With its long track record of success, it's clear that this fund has found a winning formula. If you're an investor looking for exposure to the biotechnology sector but you don't want to pick individual stocks, this ETF looks to be a great alternative.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Shutterstock photoLegendary investor Warren Buffett advises to be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful. One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.In trading on Monday, shares of Seattle Genetics Inc (Symbol: SGEN) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 27.5, after changing hands as low as $29.37 per share. By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) is 35.8. A bullish investor could look at SGEN's 27.5 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. The chart below shows the one year performance of SGEN shares:    Looking at the chart above, SGEN's low point in its 52 week range is $29.31 per share, with $52.33 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $29.44.According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, SGEN makes up 3.30% of the First Trust NYSE Arca Biotechnology Index Fund ETF (Symbol: FBT) which is trading relatively unchanged on the day Monday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Relative Strength Alert For Seattle Genetics@2016-02-08@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/relative-strength-alert-seattle-genetics-2016-02-08
ooking back to 61 days ago, Seattle Genetics Inc (Symbol: SGEN) priced a 11,707,318 share secondary stock offering at $41.00 per share. Buyers in that offering made a considerable investment into the company, expecting that their investment would go up over the course of time and based on early trading on Tuesday, the stock is now 7.2% higher than the offering price.Investors who did not participate in the offering but would be a buyer of SGEN at a cheaper price, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the June 2016 put at the $38 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $3.50. That would result in a cost basis of $34.50 per share before broker commissions in the scenario where the contract is exercised. If the contract is never exercised, the put seller would still keep the premium, which represents a 9.2% return against the $38.00 purchase commitment, or a 15.3% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Secondaries can often present buying opportunities for bullish investors interested in purchasing shares, because the sudden extra supply of stock tends to require that the offering be priced at an attractive discount to where the stock had previously been trading before the offering announcement. That can also introduce near-term volatility which improves the premiums a put seller can achieve. Selling a put does not give an investor access to SGEN's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. The chart below shows the one year performance of SGEN shares, versus its 200 day moving average:Looking at the chart above, SGEN's low point in its 52 week range is $30.05 per share, with $52.33 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $44.99.According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, SGEN makes up 3.55% of the First Trust NYSE Arca Biotechnology Index Fund ETF (Symbol: FBT) which is trading higher by about 0.1% on the day Tuesday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Use Options For a Chance To Buy SGEN at a 23% Discount@2015-11-10@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/use-options-chance-buy-sgen-23-discount-2015-11-10
" reported third-quarter earnings on Thursday. While the biotech does have one drug, Adcetris, on the market, sales aren't enough to offset the high research and development costs to expand Adcetris' label and develop the rest of its pipeline. However, Seattle Genetics isn't going to run out of money anytime soon.
  
Source: Company press release. ""With AETHERA and that newer label, it takes a little bit of time to get to the high market penetration rates -- and we are doing a good job -- and there's expansion there, but it takes some time. We're not up to the level of market penetration that we are at the present time with our first two labels -- it's too quick to get there so that's still growing,"" said Chairman, President, and CEO Clay Siegall.AETHERA was a clinical trial testing Adectris in patients with Hodgkin lymphoma at high risk of relapse or progression that have undergone an autologous stem cell transplant. The drug is used as a post-transplant consolidation, essentially betting that there might be cancer remaining after the transplant that Adcetris can kill. As Siegall points out, the launch there is going well, but Seattle Genetics still has a ways to go before it's capturing most of the patients in the new indication.Eric Dobmeier, Seattle Genetics' chief operating officer highlighted the cash that Seattle Genetics has received from its partners that have licensed its antibody-drug candidate technology, ""We received over $325 million under these collaborations with a potential for over $4 billion in milestones plus royalties under the deals."" In addition to the cash on hand and profits from Adcetris sales and royalties, Seattle Genetics can use the additional milestone payments to extend its runway to profitability. Management slightly raised 2015 guidance for sales of Adcetris in the U.S. and Canada to a range of $218 million to $223 million. That puts fourth-quarter estimate of at least $55 million, or about 19% higher than the year-ago quarter.On the pipeline front, investors will get data this quarter from multiple clinical trials at the American Society of Hematology meeting. Abstracts will be released on November 5 with late-breakers released on Nov. 16. Then the full data will be presented at ASH in early December.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

 reported third-quarter 2015 loss of 21 cents per share, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 20 cents and the year-ago loss of 13 cents.However, revenues came in at $84.1 million, up 10.8% year over year, and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $81 million. The increase in revenues was primarily driven by higher Adcetris sales.Total revenue comprised product revenues, collaboration and license agreement revenues, and royalties. Adcetris, the only marketed product at Seattle Genetics, generated revenues of $59.1 million (in the U.S. and Canada), up 22.5% year over year.Collaboration and license agreement revenues were down 21.5% year over year to $15.3 million. Collaboration revenues included revenues earned from the company's Adcetris collaboration with Takeda Pharmaceutical  as well as other antibody drug conjugate (ADC) collaborations. Royalty revenues were up 19.1% year over year to $9.7 million driven by higher royalties from Takeda for international sales of Adcetris.In the reported quarter, research and development (R&D) expenses were $70.8 million, up 21% year over year reflecting expenses for pipeline development and an upfront payment of $25 million in the second quarter under the company's collaboration with Unum Therapeutics. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 17.1% year over year to $29.7 million.In Aug 2015, Adcetris received regular approval from the FDA for the treatment of classical Hodgkin lymphoma in patients, who are at high risk of relapse or progression in post-autologous transplant consolidation setting. Adcetris' accelerated approval status for relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma was also converted to a regular approval. Additionally, Adcetris is being evaluated for various other indications including relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and second-line Hodgkin lymphoma, among others.Seattle Genetics increased its Adcetris net sales guidance for 2015 to the range of $218 million - $223 million in the U.S. and Canada (previous guidance: $210 million - $220 million).Seattle Genetics' third-quarter 2015 results were mixed with the company missing bottom-line estimates but beating on revenues. We are pleased with the company's efforts on expanding Adcetris' label. The increase in guidance for 2015 Adcetris sales guidance was also encouraging. However, we are concerned regarding the company's sole dependence on Adcetris for growth.Seattle Genetics intends to report data on Adcetris, SGN-CD33A and other ADC candidates at the annual meeting of The American Society of Hematology. We expect investor focus to remain on pipeline updates from the company.Seattle Genetics carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

"f we don't understand both sides of China's balance sheet, we understand neither.- Michael PettisThe most thought-provoking China analyst I know is Michael Pettis, author and economist, who is a professor at Peking University's Guanghua School of Management as well as a rock music club owner and impresario. Conversations with Michael are always fascinating.He has a fairly balanced take on China's future, which is significantly different from most of what you read. That's because he comes at understanding China's problems in terms of balance sheets rather than macroeconomics. So five years ago he was telling us there was going to be a real debt problem in China because he understood the nature of balance sheets and China's balance sheet portended further growth.In his latest blog, which is today's OTB, he ventures rather deep in the weeds in order to understand how of China's balance sheet problems are now going to constrain its potential future growth. Let me quote the first few paragraphs:With so much happening in China in the past month it seems that there are a number of very specific topics that any essay on China should focus. I worry, however, that we get so caught up staring at strange clumps of trees that we risk losing sight of the forest. What happened in July this year, and again in August, or in June 2013, or a number of other times, were not unexpected shocks and game changers. China is a dynamic and unbalanced economic system entering into something that we might grandly call a ""phase shift"", or less grandly the rebalancing process, and that it is doing so with a great deal of debt structured in a highly inverted way. Anyone who sees China this way would have been able to predict not so much the specific shocks, panics, and credit crunches that we have experienced, but rather that we would of necessity experience a series of very similar shocks.These debt-related shocks will occur regularly for many more years, and each shock will advance or retard the rebalancing process so that it a""ects the way future shocks occur. There are only a few broad paths along which the Chinese economy can rebalance, and if we can get some sense of the China's institutional constraints and balance sheet structures, we can figure what these paths are and how likely we are to slip from one to another.In order to get China right I would argue that above all we must understand the dynamics of debt, and of balance sheet structures more generally.A China that slows down to ""only"" 3 to 4% growth is a China that buys materially less resources from around the world. My friend Barry Ritholtz published the following chart, which shows the amounts of raw materials that China buys as a percentage of world production. If debt fueled growth built around infrastructure and increasing capacity slows down, which if Michael is right it must, that is going to have significant impact on the prices of raw materials and on the stocks of those who sell them.Let me issue a bit of a warning: the last month or so the essays in  have been relatively brief and pretty easy to grasp, I think. This one is not in that vein. You will need to don your thinking cap on and focus a bit more than is normal for an While everybody gives lip service to how important China is, if you understand the underlying dynamics, China's significance is even more impressive. My team at Mauldin Economics has created a very professional documentary on China, which you can register to watch for free right here.I, along with a sizable portion of the American electorate, spent Wednesday evening watching the Republican primary debate, to see who would be the next candidate voted off the island. Who knew primary debates would morph into reality TV? I am absolutely fascinated by the process. And while the Republican Party holds my focus, I have to admit that what is developing for the Democratic Party is almost as intriguing. Next year's presidential election is shaping up to be a surprise.Continue reading: http://www.mauldineconomics.com/outsidethebox/global-imbalances-and-the-chinese-economyRead More: About GuruFocus: GuruFocus.com tracks the stocks picks and portfolio holdings of the world's best investors.

"Today was a ""good news, bad news"" sort of day for investors in biotech  . On the one hand, shares in this cancer researcher have gained more than 16% over the past year. On the other hand, one analyst thinks these same shares are poised to lose all of those gains -- and more. On Wednesday,  announced that it is initiating coverage on Seattle Genetics with a sell rating. Citing the stock's surge in 2015, Goldman worries that the stock is now ""fully valued"" to account for all the good things that might happen to it over the next year, but not priced to account for its many risks.In particular, Goldman notes that while there is a potential for ""label expansion"" to grow revenue for Seattle Genetics' Hodgkin lymphoma drug Adcetris, this ""upside ... is already well-captured in the share price."" On the down side, Goldman worries about a ""lack of clarity"" in Seattle Genetics' ""early stage pipeline,"" while data from phase 3 trials for more mature drug candidates will not arrive until late 2016-2018. (And those results may not even be favorable).In short, there are a few things that can go right for Seattle Genetics -- but also a whole lot that can go wrong. But is Goldman Sachs right about the risks here? That's the real question.Unfortunately for Seattle Genetics shareholders, Goldman may well be right. Ranked in the top 20% of investors we track at  , Goldman is one of the better analysts out there -- and it's particularly good when it comes to biotech and pharmaceuticals. According to our data, Goldman's significantly more likely (57%) to be right than wrong when recommending a biotech stock. Meanwhile, fully 15 of its 18 active pharmaceuticals picks are beating the market.A few examples:
  
 I have to say that, after reviewing Goldman Sachs' record, and considering how very negative the analyst is on the stock (which according to StreetInsider.com, Goldman is now valuing at just $33), things are not looking good for Seattle Genetics' prospects.They look even worse after you examine the company's financials.With less than $320 million in annual revenue to its name, but a market cap well in excess of $6 billion, Seattle Genetics shares sell for the princely valuation of 20 times sales. That's not an unheard of valuation in the risky biotech sector. Then again, the average biotech tracked by  earns at least some profits from its business. Seattle Genetics earns none.To the contrary, data from S&P Capital IQ confirm that over its 17 years of existence, Seattle Genetics has never earned a full-year profit. Instead, its losses are increasing. The company booked $122 million in combined losses over the past 12 months, and burned through more than $150 million in negative free cash flow. With more than $730 million in the bank (an amount  last quarter), Seattle Genetics is at no risk of running out of money anytime soon. On the other hand, judging from its history, it's at no ""risk"" of earning a profit anytime soon, either.So what's a better stock to invest in?One look at Goldman Sachs' record suggests that Gilead Sciences might make for a good alternative. Priced at less than 5 times sales, it's a significantly cheaper stock than Seattle Genetics. Gilead Sciences is also profitable and free cash flow positive -- massively so. Over the past 12 months Gilead generated roughly $17.7 billion in cash profits.Motley Fool CAPS members -- including more than 88% of our All-Star investors -- love it. Gilead Sciences earns a full five-star rating on CAPS, the highest rating our members can give. And with Gilead selling for the bargain-basement price of less than 10 times earnings, I'm inclined to agree with them.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. And we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in-the-know investors!

"nvestors in Seattle Genetics Inc (Symbol: SGEN) saw new options become available this week, for the November 20th expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the SGEN options chain for the new November 20th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $39.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.85. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $39.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $37.15 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of SGEN, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $42.23/share today.Because the $39.00 strike represents an approximate 8% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 68%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of SGEN stock at the current price level of $42.23/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $43.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 8.34% if the stock gets called away at the November 20th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if SGEN shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Seattle Genetics Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing SGEN's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $43.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $43.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

 announced that it has expanded Adcetris' label for yet another indication. The FDA approved Adcetris for the treatment of classical Hodgkin lymphoma in patients who are suffering from a high risk of relapse or progression as post-autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT) consolidation.With this approval, Adcetris has become the first and only consolidation treatment option for high-risk classical Hodgkin lymphoma patients who have gone undergone a transplant to preserve their post-auto-HSCT remissions.Adcetris is now approved for three indications. We remind investors that in Aug 2011, Adcetris gained FDA approval for two indications - classical Hodgkin lymphoma after failure of auto-HSCT or after failure of at least two prior multi-agent chemotherapy regimens in patients who are not auto-HSCT candidates, and systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (sALCL) in patients who have failed at least one prior multi-agent chemotherapy regimen. Both approvals were granted on an accelerated basis. Currently, Seattle Genetics stated that based on positive results of the phase III AETHERA study on Adcetris, the U.S. accelerated approval status of the drug for classical Hodgkin lymphoma has been converted to a regular approval.Adcetris also has conditional marketing authorization in the EU for the treatment of relapsed or refractory sALCL and relapsed or refractory CD30-positive Hodgkin lymphoma following autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) or following at least two prior therapies in patients for whom ASCT or multi-agent chemotherapy is not a treatment option.Additionally, Seattle Genetics has submitted data from the AETHERA study, which evaluated Adcetris therapy administered every three weeks following auto-HSCT versus placebo, to the European Medicines Agency and Health Canada for review.Meanwhile, the company is working on further label expansion of Adcetris. It is being assessed in three phase III studies - ECHELON-1 (frontline advanced stage classical Hodgkin lymphoma), ECHELON-2 (frontline CD30-positive mature T-cell lymphoma) and ALCANZA (relapsed CD30-positive cutaneous T-cell lymphoma relapsed CD30-positive cutaneous T-cell lymphoma). Patient enrollment in the ECHELON-1 and ALCANZA studies should be completed during 2015 and in ECHELON-2 during 2016.We note that Seattle Genetics has an agreement with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited  for the development of Adcetris. Per the agreement, Seattle Genetics holds commercialization rights to the drug in the U.S. and Canada, while its partner enjoys commercialization rights in the rest of the world. The companies bear cost equally for the development of Adcetris, except in Japan, where Takeda has the sole responsibility for development costs.Seattle Genetics' efforts to expand Adcetris' label is encouraging. Given that it is the only marketed product at the company, approval for additional indications should help in increasing the eligible patient population. In the first half of 2015, Adcetris generated revenues of $104 million, up 24.5% year over year.Seattle Genetics carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the health care sector are AMAG Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  and Actelion Ltd.  . Both carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

" reported ""record"" sales in the second quarter for its only drug, Adcetris.But ""record"" is all relative, as the sales in the U.S. and Canada only amounted to $55 million. With the solid but far from blockbuster sales, management raised guidance by $10 million on either end of the range and now expects Adcetris sales for the year to come in the range of $210 million to $220 million.Royalties from Takeda's sales of Adcetris outside the U.S. and Canada added another $7.6 million and Seattle Genetics booked another $14 million in revenue from collaboration and licensing agreements. Added together the $77 million in revenue couldn't even cover Seattle Genetics' research and development bill of $85 million. All told Seattle Genetics lost $47.5 million in the second quarter.Using sales from a first approved drug to offset some of a biotech's expenses as it ramps up sales is par for the course, but after having Adcetris on the market for nearly four years, it's clearly time for Seattle Genetics to accelerate sales.Fortunately, that opportunity is right around the corner in the form of an expanded label for Adcetris. By Aug. 18, the Food and Drug Administration is expected to rule on the use of Adcetris as a posttransplant consolidation treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma patients at high risk of relapse or progression.If the FDA agrees, and that seems likely given the data, Adcetris will be used right after an autologous stem cell transplant if the doctor feels the patient is at high risk of the lymphoma coming back. Adcetris is currently only approved for Hodgkin lymphoma patients after they fail an autologous stem cell transplant or if a transplant isn't possible (and then they have to fail two other cocktail treatments). Getting to the patients earlier in their disease progression should increase sales. Seattle Genetics is testing Adcetris as early as it can go in front-line Hodgkin's lymphoma in a phase 3 trial called Echelon-1 that is set to complete enrollment this year. The trial will test Adcetris against the standard of care, a cocktail of chemotherapy drugs called ABVD. The patients that get Adcetris will also get a related cocktail called AVD because the B, which stands for bleomycin, can cause lung toxicity when combined with Adcetris. If the Adcetris cocktail works better than the ABVD, doctors certainly won't miss bleomycin, since it's fairly toxic on its own.This year, the biotech is also looking to complete enrollment in a second phase 3 trial, dubbed Alcanza, which is testing Adcetris against a chemotherapy in patients with CD30-positive mature t-cell lymphomas.Expanding sales of Adcetris is a good move as it gives Seattle Genetics lots of shots on goal with a drug that's already shown clinical activity. In addition to the Echelon-1 and Alcanza trials, Seattle Genetics is testing the drug in four other settings that are further behind and has plans to start trials in three other settings.But eventually Seattle Genetics is going to have to develop another drug on its own. The closest one to market is SGN-CD19A, which Seattle Genetics plans to test in a phase 2 trial in second-line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.Hopefully by the time SGN-CD19A makes it to market, enough of the Adcetris trials will be positive that sales will have expanded enough to get Seattle Genetics to profitability.One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World Wide Web to bed. And if you act quickly, you could be among the savvy investors who enjoy the profits from this stunning change. Experts are calling it the single largest business opportunity in the history of capitalism...  is calling it ""transformative""... But you'll probably just call it ""how I made my millions.""

The medication demonstrated ""significant"" improvement in progression-free survival, with patients in the Adcetris arm surviving a median 42.9 months compared with a median 24.1 months for patients who received a placebo -- an improvement of about 18.8 months.SGEN shares were down about 2% this afternoon at $45.50 apiece, beginning trade today at their session high of $47.49 a share but sliding underwater within the first hour of trading.

"he $11.4 billion healthcare specialist investing firm co-managed by Felix and Julian Baker, known as the Baker Bros. Advisors, is regarded as one of the best when it comes to picking stocks in this volatile sector -- and for good reason. The Baker Bros., for instance, have had the rare insight to gobble up shares in former small-cap companies like  ,  , and  . before they ripped higher. So when this fund starts to accumulate shares in a company, investors may want to take heed.On that note, the Baker Bros. have slowly been building a massive position in the antibody drug conjugate, or ADC, specialist  for a few years now, even adding almost 2 million more shares to their holdings in the second quarter of 2015, according to the quarterly 13Fs filed with the SEC. In total, the firm's holdings in the drugmaker are valued at around $1.5 billion, making it the largest stakeholder in the company.Given their significant financial interest in Seattle Genetics, and the fact that Felix Baker sits on its board of directors , I think it's worth the effort to consider if investors should add this stock to their portfolios. So let's take a look at what Seattle Genetics has to offer investors as a mid-cap biotech stock.Before immunotherapies stole the headlines and perhaps the show as well, ADCs were believed to be one of the most promising new classes of cancer treatments coming online. After several cases of off-site toxicity cropped up in clinical studies for some experimental ADCs, though, the investing community seemingly forgot about them overnight.But the pharma industry has not forgotten, not by a long shot. By contrast, several pharma companies have been working vigorously on improving the technology to make it both safer and more effective across a wide variety of solid tumors and hematological malignancies.This work has so far spawned several regulatory approvals for Seattle Genetics' Adcetris for various forms of blood cancer and  's Kadcyla for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.Source: Seattle Genetics.Commercially speaking, these two drugs have also been fairly successful as novel oncology treatments. Adcetris' second-quarter sales, for example, grew to $55 million, compared to approximately $44 million for the same period a year ago. And not to be outdone, Kadcyla posted a monstrous 65% sales growth rate in the first half of 2015, relative to the same period a year ago. Perhaps the key takeaway from these figures is that the medical community appears to be deeply interested in employing ADCs in the fight against cancer.An easy criticism to lob at Seattle Genetics is that it's a smaller biopharma trying to compete against the big boys like  and Roche, among others. But a deeper look at the company shows that it is a central player in the ADC field, with major licensing agreements with  ,  , Pfizer, Roche, and many others, already in play. In short, big pharma and biotech appear to be rather optimistic about Seattle Genetics' drug development platform moving forward.So what investors need to understand is that ADCs are probably not going to be displaced by the suite of checkpoint inhibitors grabbing the headlines right now, evinced in part, by big pharma's major investment in this technology. And the real focus is to refine the ADC platform as a whole.Turning to the question of whether Seattle Genetics' stock is a buy or not, I think the answer is a ""yes."" From a fundamental perspective, the drugmaker may not look like a compelling value buy -- largely because of its huge and growing clinical program that is keeping the company's  .But its massive core clinical program, that sports 8 clinical candidates being assessed across a whopping 17 indications, has the potential to generate multiple products with each one capable of raking in hundreds of millions in annual revenue. And then there's Seattle Genetics' wide diversity of research collaborations that also could lead to a substantial upswing in royalty payments.All told, Seattle Genetics' wide diversity of clinical activities gives it several shots on goal in terms of turning the company into a profitable operation, which is probably one of the main reasons why the Baker Bros. are so keen on this mid-cap biotech stock.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. And we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in-the-know investors!

"nvestors in Seattle Genetics Inc (Symbol: SGEN) saw new options become available this week, for the March 2016 expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 241 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the SGEN options chain for the new March 2016 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $50.00 strike price has a current bid of $6.50. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $50.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $43.50 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of SGEN, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $50.65/share today.Because the $50.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

If an investor was to purchase shares of SGEN stock at the current price level of $50.65/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $55.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 19.25% if the stock gets called away at the March 2016 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if SGEN shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Seattle Genetics Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing SGEN's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $55.00 strike highlighted in red: Considering the fact that the $55.00 strike represents an approximate 9% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

 reported a loss of 38 cents per share, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 23 cents and the year-ago loss of 14 cents.Revenues increased 12.9% from the year-ago quarter to $77.1 million but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $78 million. The increase in revenues was primarily driven by higher Adcetris sales.Total revenue comprised product revenues, collaboration and license agreement revenues, and royalties. Adcetris, the only marketed product at Seattle Genetics, generated revenues of $55.1 million (in the U.S. and Canada), up 23% year over year.Collaboration and license agreement revenues, and royalty revenues were $14.4 million (down 11.2% year over year) and $7.6 million (up 3.8% year over year), respectively. Collaboration revenues included revenues earned from the company's Adcetris collaboration with Takeda Pharmaceutical  as well as other antibody drug conjugate (ADC) collaborations.During the quarter, Seattle Genetics entered into a strategic collaboration and license agreement with Unum Therapeutics for the development and commercialization of novel antibody-coupled T-cell receptor therapies for cancer. Per the deal, Seattle Genetics made an upfront payment of $25 million to Unum and an equity investment of $5 million in the company.On the other hand, Seattle Genetics received a milestone payment from AbbVie  upon the initiation of a phase I study by the latter on an ADC for hematologic malignancies using the Seattle Genetics' technology.In the reported quarter, research and development (R&D) expenses were $85.7 million, up 59.7% year over year primarily due to the $25 million upfront payment to Unum. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 18.9% year over year to $30.3 million.Seattle Genetics' supplemental biologic license application for Adcetris for post-transplant consolidation treatment of patients suffering from Hodgkin lymphoma, who are at high risk of relapse or progression, is under priority review with the FDA. A response from the agency should be out by Aug 18, 2015.Meanwhile, the company is enrolling patients in three phase III studies on Adcetris. Patient enrollment in ECHELON-1 (frontline Hodgkin's lymphoma) and ALCANZA (cutaneous T-cell lymphoma) are expected to be completed by 2015-end and in ECHELON-2 (frontline mature T-cell lymphoma) in 2016.The company also intends to initiate a randomized phase II study on Rituxan (plus Treanda) with or without Adcetris for the treatment of relapsed/refractory CD30-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and a randomized phase II study on SGN-CD19A for the second-line treatment of DLBCL. Data from ALCANZA should be out in 2016, while that from ECHELON-1 and ECHELON-2 are expected in the 2017-2018 timeframe.Additionally, Seattle Genetics is looking to expand Adcetris' label in the field of autoimmune diseases. In Jul 2015, the company started a phase II study on the drug for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).Meanwhile, under a partnership with Bristol-Myers Squibb  , Seattle Genetics' intends to conduct two studies (expected to begin in 2015) on ADCETRIS in combination with Opdivo for the treatment of relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma and relapsed CD30 positive non-Hodgkin lymphoma.Seattle Genetics increased its Adcetris net sales guidance for 2015 to the range of $210 million - $220 million in the U.S. and Canada (previous guidance: $200 million to $210 million). R&D expenditure is expected in the range of $275 million - $300 million, primarily due to the $25 million upfront payment made to Unum Therapeutics.Although Seattle Genetics' second-quarter 2015 results were disappointing with the company missing both bottom- and top-line estimates, we are pleased with the company's efforts on expanding Adcetris' label. The raise in 2015 Adcetris sales guidance is also encouraging.Given that Adcetris is the cornerstone of Seattle Genetics' business, approval for the drug in the post-transplant consolidation treatment setting should be a major positive for the company. Seattle Genetics' efforts to develop the in other indications including SLE are also encouraging.We expect investor focus to remain on regulatory updates on Adcetris.Seattle Genetics carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

 and Unum Therapeutics announced the signing of a strategic collaboration and license agreement for the development and commercialization of novel antibody-coupled T-cell receptor (ACTR) therapies for the treatment of cancer.Per the deal, Seattle Genetics will make an upfront payment of $25 million to Unum Therapeutics, apart from an equity investment of $5 million in the latter's next round of private financing.To begin with, both companies will develop two ACTR therapies using Seattle Genetics' antibodies. Seattle Genetics has the option to expand the collaboration to include a third ACTR product. While Unum is responsible for preclinical research and development activities through phase I, Seattle Genetics will funds these activities.Beyond phase I development, the companies will jointly develop the candidates, fund development programs and commercialize the products (if approved), unless either of them opts out of the agreement. They will share profits on a 50-50 basis on any co-developed program within the U.S. In ex-U.S. markets, Seattle Genetics will retain exclusive commercial rights and pay high-single to mid-double digit royalties on sales to Unum Therapeutics.

"n the latest look at stocks ordered by largest market capitalization, Russell 3000 component Seattle Genetics Inc (Symbol: SGEN) was identified as having a larger market cap than the smaller end of the S&P 500, for example Tenet Healthcare Corp. (Symbol: THC), according to  .Market capitalization is an important data point for investors to keep an eye on, for various reasons. The most basic reason is that it gives a true comparison of the value attributed by the stock market to a given company's stock. Many beginning investors look at one stock trading at $10 and another trading at $20 and mistakenly think the latter company is worth twice as much - that of course is a completely meaningless comparison without knowing how many shares of each company exist. But comparing market capitalization (factoring in those share counts) creates a true ""apples-to-apples"" comparison of the value of two stocks. In the case of Seattle Genetics Inc (Symbol: SGEN), the market cap is now $5.39B, versus Tenet Healthcare Corp. (Symbol: THC) at $5.27B.Below is a three month price history chart comparing the stock performance of SGEN vs. THC:Another reason market capitalization is important is where it places a company in terms of its size tier in relation to peers - much like the way a mid-size sedan is typically compared to other mid-size sedans (and not SUV's). This can have a direct impact on which indices will include the stock, and which mutual funds and ETFs are willing to own the stock. For instance, a mutual fund that is focused solely on Large Cap stocks may for example only be interested in those companies sized $10 billion or larger. Another illustrative example is the S&P MidCap index which essentially takes the S&P 500 index and ""tosses out"" the biggest 100 companies so as to focus solely on the 400 smaller ""up-and-comers"" (which in the right environment can outperform their larger rivals). And ETFs that directly follow an index like the S&P 500 will only own the underlying component of that index, selling companies that lose their status as an S&P 500 company, and buying companies when they are added to the index. So a company's market cap, especially in relation to other companies, carries great importance, and for this reason we at TheOnlineInvestor.com find value to putting together these looks at comparative market capitalization daily.At the closing bell, SGEN is up about 1.6%, while THC is down about 0.1% on the day Thursday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Seattle Genetics Larger Than S&P 500 Component Tenet Healthcare@2015-05-28@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/seattle-genetics-larger-sp-500-component-tenet-healthcare-2015-05-28

eattle Genetics, Inc.  announced that the FDA has accepted its supplemental Biologics License Application (BLA) for Adcetris for priority review for as consolidation therapy immediately following an autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) in patients suffering from Hodgkin's lymphoma, who are at high risk of relapse or progression.Adcetris is already approved for the treatment of relapsed Hodgkin's lymphoma and systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Currently, Seattle Genetics is looking to expand Adcetris' label in the post-transplant setting for consolidation therapy in Hodgkin's lymphoma patients.The FDA accepted the BLA on the basis of positive data from the phase III AETHERA study. An action from the FDA is expected by Aug 18, 2015.According to the American Cancer Society, approximately 9,050 patients are expected to be diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma in the U.S. through 2015, with more than 1,150 patients expected to die from the disease. Seattle Genetics believes that up to 30% of Hodgkin's lymphoma patients treated with front-line therapy relapse or are refractory to the treatment.Moreover, nearly half of all these patients, who undergo an ASCT, experience disease relapse. Hence, there is a solid scope for Adcetris to gain a large share in this market, if approved as consolidation therapy immediately following an ASCT.We note that Adcetris is the only marketed product at Seattle Genetics. Upon label expansion, the drug should be able to support the company's top line further, thereby strengthening its growth trajectory.Meanwhile, Seattle Genetics and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company  intend to evaluate Adcetris in combination with the latter's Opdivo in two phase I/II studies as a potential treatment option for relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma and relapsed or refractory B-cell and T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas including DLBCL. The studies are expected to begin in 2015.Seattle Genetics carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the health care sector are Shire plc  and Horizon Pharma plc  .

lthough the earnings season is coming to a close, few companies are yet to report their results. Late last week,  announced better-than-expected first-quarter 2014 results. The company reported a loss of 17 cents per share, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 19 cents but wider than the year-ago loss of 13 cents.Revenues increased 20.3% from the year-ago quarter to $82.2 million, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $74 million, primarily driven by higher Adcetris sales and royalty revenues.Total revenue comprised product revenues, collaboration and license agreement revenues and royalties. Adcetris, the only marketed product (relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma or relapsed systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma) at Seattle Genetics, generated revenues of $48.9 million (in the U.S. and Canada), up 26.3% year over year. The increase was mainly driven by record Adcetris sales and strong royalties.Collaboration and license agreement revenues and royalty revenues were $22.2 million (up 31.6%) and $11.1 million (down 12.8%), respectively. Collaboration revenues included revenues earned from the company's Adcetris collaboration with Takeda Pharmaceutical  as well as ADC collaborations.In the reported quarter, research and development (R&D) expenses were $63.4 million, up 16.3% year over year. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 33.7% year over year to $32.1 million.Seattle Genetics is working on expanding Adcetris' label. In Apr 2015, the FDA accepted the company's supplemental biologic license application for Adcetris for post-transplant consolidation treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma patients at a high risk of relapse or progression. With priority review status, an action from the FDA is expected by Aug 18, 2015.Meanwhile, Seattle Genetics received FDA approval for an amendment in the Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) agreement for a phase III study on Adcetris (ECHELON-1) for frontline Hodgkin lymphoma. Per the amendment, target enrollment will be increased by 200 patients to a total of 1,240. Patient enrollment is expected to be completed in 2015.Data from the ECHELON-1 study should be out in the 2017 - 2018 timeframe. Additionally, the SPA agreement for another phase III study on Adcetris (ECHELON-2) for frontline mature T-cell lymphoma was amended to increase target patient enrollment by 150 patients to a total of 450. Patient enrollment is expected to complete by 2016 with data from the study expected in the 2017 - 2018 timeframe.Seattle Genetics raised its expectation for selling, general and administrative expenses for 2015 to the range of $115 million - $125 million (previous guidance: $105 million - $115 million, declared at the time of announcing fourth-quarter 2014 results). This increase is attributable to accelerated commercial activities, legal expenses and other administrative costs.Seattle Genetics' first-quarter 2015 results were satisfactory on the back of strong Adcetris sales. Being the only marketed product at Seattle Genetics, the drug remains the key growth driver for the company. Moreover, Seattle Genetics is working on expanding Adcetris' label and is looking to evaluate the drug for diseases like DLBCL and SLE. We expect investor focus to remain on updates from the company.Seattle Genetics carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

"nvestors got a beat and a raise of guidance from  ' conservative management, but not the kind they were looking for.The company reported Adcetris sales of $48.9 million in the U.S. and Canada during the first quarter, a 5.2% quarter-over-quarter increase from the fourth quarter. At that rate of growth, the company would slightly exceed the top end of its Adcetris sales guidance of between $200 million and $210 million this year, but Seattle Genetics didn't raise its revenue guidance.Instead the raise of guidance was for selling, general and administrative expenses, which Seattle Genetics now thinks will come in the range of $115 million to $125 million, slightly higher than previously anticipated. Management said the increase was partially attributable to the acceleration of commercial activities that were moved forward because the company received a priority review for its application to approve Adcetris as a post-transplant consolidation treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma patients at high risk of relapse or progression.It's ironic that Seattle Genetics raised expense guidance but not revenue guidance, since an FDA approval for the expanded indication -- which seems highly likely -- will naturally accelerate Adcetris sales in the United States. The FDA gave Seattle Genetics a target review date of Aug. 18, but the oncology division has been making decisions well ahead of the target dates for drugs given priority reviews, so we could see acceleration of sales for most of the second half of the year, causing Seattle Genetics to blow through the top of its Adcetris guidance.While the FDA hasn't approved the drug for the expanded indication, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines have included the use of Adcetris for up to one year after autologous transplant in Hodgkin lymphoma patients who had primary refractory disease or who had relapsed less than 12 months following frontline therapy. The addition to the compendium could help with off-label reimbursement ahead of the expanded FDA approval, although Seattle Genetics wouldn't be able to market the drug for the expanded indication until the FDA gives its thumbs up.Seattle Genetics' marketing partner, Takeda, has already submitted an application for expanded approval in the EU, but that approval will likely come after the FDA approval, and then Takeda will probably have to wait for reimbursement decisions in many of the EU countries before sales in the expanded indication can proceed. On the conference call, Seattle Generics confirmed plans for data releases in three additional indications forAdcetris.The Alcanza trial, which is testing Adcetris in patients with CD30-positive cutaneous t-cell lymphoma, should read out next year. And the biotech finalized plans for its Echelon-1 trial in frontline Hodgkin's lymphoma and the Echelon-2 trial in patients with CD30-positive mature t-cell lymphomas that will read out in the 2017 to 2018 timeframe.Further back in development, Seattle Genetics is testing Adcetris in combination with  's Obdivo in bothHodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma and as a treatment for lupus. The latter is an interesting choice since it's not an oncology indication, but the company believes that targeting CD30 positive immune cells could help the autoimmune disease, which makes sense biologically.Assuming there aren't any hiccups, look for management to increase revenue guidance when it releases second-quarter guidance, although by that point, the expectation may already be priced into the stock.One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World Wide Web to bed. And if you act quickly, you could be among the savvy investors who enjoy the profits from this stunning change.

 (  ) announced the submission of a supplemental biologics license application (BLA) to the FDA for Adcetris as consolidation therapy immediately following an autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) in patients suffering from Hodgkin lymphoma, who are at a high risk of relapse.The company submitted the BLA on the basis of positive data from the phase III AETHERA study.We note that Adcetris is already approved for intravenous injection in the U.S. (accelerated approval) and the EU (conditional marketing authorization) for the treatment of patients with Hodgkin lymphoma after the failure of ASCT or at least two previous multi-agent chemotherapy regimens in patients who have not undergone ASCT.The drug also received accelerated approval for systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (sALCL) after the failure of at least one prior multi-agent chemotherapy regimen in the U.S. and conditional marketing authorization for relapsed or refractory sALCL in the EU.Adcetris is being developed by Seattle Genetics in partnership with Takeda Pharmaceutical (  ). According to the agreement, Seattle Genetics holds the commercialization rights to Adcetris in the U.S. and Canada, while Takeda has the rights in the rest of the world. Both companies share development costs for Adcetris equally, except in Japan where Takeda bears the entire costs of development.Apart from the AETHERA study, both companies are evaluating Adcetris in three phase III studies - ALCANZA (relapsed cutaneous T-cell lymphoma), ECHELON-1 (front-line advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma) and ECHELON-2 (front-line mature T-cell lymphoma including sALCL). Data from the ALCANZA study should be out in 2016.Meanwhile, Seattle Genetics is also working on developing its pipeline beyond Adcetris. The company has several early-stage candidates in its pipeline including six antibody drug conjugates - SGN-CD19A, SGN-CD33A, SGN-LIV1A, SGN-CD70A, ASG-22ME and ASG-15ME.

 rounded out 2014 with revenue a hair above the guidance it gave last quarter. For the year, the biotech registered $178.2 million in sales of its blood cancer drug Adcetris in the U.S. and Canada, just above the $177 million upper end of guidance given on its  .Of course, beating guidance is all relative. This time last year, Seattle Genetics was guiding for Adcetris sales of $155 million to $165 million in 2014. That's a beat of 11% at the midpoint.In addition to the company's direct sales, Seattle Genetics also received $40 million in 2014 from partner  for royalties and a sales-based milestone where the Japanese pharma sells Adcetris. That's more than double the $17.8 million in royalties Seattle Genetics received last year.Of course, Seattle Genetics also spent more during the year. Research and development expenses are still the biotech's largest expense, making up 80.5% of total revenue. All told, the company lost $76 million in 2014, up from just under $63 million in the prior year. With $313 million in cash, cash equivalents, and investments in the bank, the biotech has plenty of runway to get to profitability.This year, Seattle Genetics is looking for Adcetris sales in the range of $200 million to $210 million. That's only a year-over-year increase of 15% -- smaller than the 23% increase from 2013 to 2014 -- but given the trouncing of last year's guidance, there's a good chance the guidance is conservative.To get to profitability, Seattle Genetics needs to capture a larger portion of Hodgkin lymphoma patients. Adcetris is currently only approved for Hodgkin lymphoma patients if they fail an autologous stem cell transplant or if they're not candidates for the transplant and failed at least two multi-agent chemotherapy regimens. But that could change soon as the company plans to apply for FDA approval this quarter to use Adcetris as a consolidation therapy for HL patients at high risk of relapse immediately after ASCT.Consolidation therapy is used to kill any remaining cancer cells that may be left. The patient may or may not actually need the therapy, but since it's hard for doctors to know whether there are cancer cells remaining from the initial treatment, they'll give the drug to all patients -- in this case, all patients who are at high risk of relapse -- and Seattle Genetics benefits from treating the patients who wouldn't have relapsed.Seattle Genetics is also trying to zoom to the front of the class as a first-line treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma. A phase 3 trial, dubbed ECHELON-1, is still ongoing, but data from a phase 1 trial started a few years ago suggests the drug should help early stage patients. After three years, all the patients in the phase 1 trial are still alive, and 92% haven't seen their cancer return.And there's opportunity for Adcetris in other blood cancers. The drug is currently approved as a second-line treatment for systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Besides the aforementioned first-line Hodgkin lymphoma, Seattle Genetics has two phase 3 trials testing Adcetris in T-cell lymphoma, and data from earlier-stage trials in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma look promising.Seattle Genetics is staving off potential competition from the immune checkpoint inhibitors -- which have shown solid, albeit early, data in blood cancers -- by striking a deal with  to test its checkpoint inhibitor Opdivo in combination with Adcetris.Beyond Adcetris, look for Seattle Genetics' pipeline to move along in 2015, including starting a phase 2 trial for SGN-CD19A in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and a phase 1 trial of SEA-CD40 for solid tumors and bringing two new drug candidates into the clinic. The best biotech investors consistently reap gigantic profits by recognizing true potential earlier and more accurately than anyone else. Let me cut right to the chase. There is a product in development that could revolutionize not just how we treat a common chronic illness, but potentially the entire health industry.

"n the latest look at stocks ordered by largest market capitalization, Russell 3000 component Seattle Genetics Inc (Symbol: SGEN) was identified as having a larger market cap than the smaller end of the S&P 500, for example Noble Corp plc (Symbol: NE), according to  .Market capitalization is an important data point for investors to keep an eye on, for various reasons. The most basic reason is that it gives a true comparison of the value attributed by the stock market to a given company's stock. Many beginning investors look at one stock trading at $10 and another trading at $20 and mistakenly think the latter company is worth twice as much - that of course is a completely meaningless comparison without knowing how many shares of each company exist. But comparing market capitalization (factoring in those share counts) creates a true ""apples-to-apples"" comparison of the value of two stocks. In the case of Seattle Genetics Inc (Symbol: SGEN), the market cap is now $4.54B, versus Noble Corp plc (Symbol: NE) at $4.52B.Below is a three month price history chart comparing the stock performance of SGEN vs. NE:Another reason market capitalization is important is where it places a company in terms of its size tier in relation to peers - much like the way a mid-size sedan is typically compared to other mid-size sedans (and not SUV's). This can have a direct impact on which indices will include the stock, and which mutual funds and ETFs are willing to own the stock. For instance, a mutual fund that is focused solely on Large Cap stocks may for example only be interested in those companies sized $10 billion or larger. Another illustrative example is the S&P MidCap index which essentially takes the S&P 500 index and ""tosses out"" the biggest 100 companies so as to focus solely on the 400 smaller ""up-and-comers"" (which in the right environment can outperform their larger rivals). And ETFs that directly follow an index like the S&P 500 will only own the underlying component of that index, selling companies that lose their status as an S&P 500 company, and buying companies when they are added to the index. So a company's market cap, especially in relation to other companies, carries great importance, and for this reason we at TheOnlineInvestor.com find value to putting together these looks at comparative market capitalization daily.At the closing bell, SGEN is up about 8.5%, while NE is trading flat on the day Wednesday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Seattle Genetics Larger Than S&P 500 Component Noble@2015-02-25@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/seattle-genetics-larger-sp-500-component-noble-2015-02-25
 (  ) announced better-than-expected fourth-quarter and full-year 2014 results. In the fourth quarter of 2014, the company reported a loss of 22 cents per share, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 27 cents but wider than the year-ago loss of 13 cents per share.Revenues increased 10.3% from the year-ago quarter to $74.3 million, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $68 million, primarily driven by higher Adcetris sales and royalty revenues.Total revenue comprised product revenues, collaboration and license agreement revenues and royalties. Adcetris, the only marketed product at Seattle Genetics, generated revenues of $46.5 million (in the U.S. and Canada), up 21% year over year. The increase was due to effective commercialization and higher prescriptions of the drug.Collaboration and license agreement revenues and royalty revenues were $16 million (down 28.2%) and $11.9 million (up 80.3%), respectively. Collaboration revenues decreased due to an expected reduction in reimbursement from Seattle Genetics' partner Takeda Pharmaceutical (  ) under their collaboration for the development and commercialization of Adcetris on a global basis.In the reported quarter, research and development (R&D) expenses were $64 million, up 26.1% year over year. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 15.5% year over year to $29.4 million.Seattle Genetics reported a loss of 62 cents per share in 2014, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 67 cents but wider than the year-ago loss of 51 cents per share.Revenues increased 6.5% from the year-ago quarter to $286.8 million, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $281 million. Net sales of Adcetris came in at $178.2 million, up 23% year over year.Seattle Genetics is working on expanding Adcetris' label. In Dec 2014, the company reported data from the phase III AETHERA study on Adcetris showing that Hodgkin lymphoma patients, who had a high risk of relapse following an autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT), were treated with Adcetris as consolidation therapy immediately after ASCT and achieved significant improvement in progression-free survival compared to placebo. The company intends to submit a supplemental Biologics License Application to the FDA for Adcetris in this indication in the first quarter of 2015.Meanwhile, Seattle Genetics inked a deal with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (  ) for the development of an investigational combination of the former's antibody-drug conjugate, Adcetris and the latter's immunotherapy, Opdivo. The combination therapy will be evaluated in two phase I /II2 studies, both of which are slated for initiation in 2015.Seattle Genetics expects revenues from net sales of Adcetris in the range of $200 million - $210 million (in the U.S. and Canada). Additionally, revenues from collaboration and license agreements are expected in the range of $60 million - $70 million.The company expects R&D expenses in the range of $250 million - $275 million and SG&A expenses in the range of $105 million - $115 million.We are pleased with Adcetris' performance so far. Being the only marketed product at Seattle Genetics, the drug remains the growth driver for the company. Moreover, Seattle Genetics is working towards label expansion of Adcetris - the drug is being evaluated in a number of corporate and investigator sponsored trials for Hodgkin lymphoma, apart from the AETHERA and ECHELON-1 studies. We expect investor focus to remain on updates from the company.Seattle Genetics carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in the health care sector is BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.

"ource: Pfizer. is struggling to offset slowing sales tied to expiring patents, and that has some observers thinking that Pfizer remains on the hunt to buy another drugmaker that can spark its growth. Earlier this week, Pfizer  that it would acquire  , the top provider of injectable drugs. The deal will net Pfizer an intriguing biosimilar program, but some suspect that the company is still hungry for more. If Pfizer is indeed still on the lookout for another buyout, three of our top Motley Fool contributors think these three companies should be on Pfizer's wish list.: Over the past couple of years, Pfizer's R&D efforts have decidedly shifted away from small-molecule drugs and more toward next-generation types of therapies, such as biologics, evidenced most recently by the aforementioned acquisition of Hospira. So it's not entirely surprising that the pharma giant has taken a keen interest in cardiovascular gene therapy company  . At last count, Pfizer owned nearly 1.8 million shares of Celladon, making it one of the company's largest shareholders.My take is that Pfizer's initial interest could turn into a full-blown tender offer if Celladon's lead clinical candidate, Mydicar, reports positive mid-stage results this April as a treatment for systolic heart failure. Such a deal would give Pfizer access to a potential megablockbuster. And, as a biological-based treatment, Mydicar would benefit from the high standards for generic ""biosimilars"" set by the Affordable Care Act in 2010, meaning the drug could effectively be immune from generic rivals for several years past its patent expiration. Furthermore, as a gene therapy, it would hold a competitive moat simply by the lack of competitors that can easily manufacture the viral vector on a commercial scale.Mydicar would also fit in nicely with the big pharma's strong cardiovascular product portfolio and clinical pipeline. All told, this pairing looks like a great match -- that is, if Celladon's gene therapy platform is validated by the upcoming clinical data readout.: Pfizer should look at  , a major developer of antibody-drug conjugates, or ADCs, commonly known as ""cancer smart bombs."" ADCs seek out and attach themselves to cancerous cells and then inject them with cytotoxic agents. This ""targeted chemotherapy"" spares healthy cells, which traditional chemotherapy usually wipes out. Although Seattle Genetics wouldn't move the needle in a huge way for Pfizer, a bolt-on acquisition could give a boost to Pfizer's oncology business.Seattle Genetics has one approved ADC, Adcetris, indicated for two types of lymphoma. The company holds commercialization rights for Adcetris in the U.S. and Canada, while  holds the marketing rights worldwide. Sales of Adcetris in the U.S. and Canada rose 24% year over year to $131.7 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2014, accounting for 61% of revenue.There was  that two recently approved immunotherapies --  's Keytruda and  's Opdivo -- could cause trouble for Seattle Genetics. Both drugs, which target the PD-1 pathway, have been effective at treating Hodgkin's lymphoma, or HL,  patients were first treated with Adcetris and showed disease progression. However, Bristol-Myers and Seattle Genetics are now testing Adcetris with Opdivo in  for blood disorders, including relapsed/refractory HL, so PD-1 inhibitors could complement, instead of compete against, Adcetris.Seattle Genetics already collaborates with Pfizer on Anti-5T4, an ADC that's being tested in phase 1 trials on solid tumors. The company seems like a smooth strategic fit for Pfizer's oncology business, although at a price tag of at least $4 billion, the stock may need to pull back before it could really be attractive, especially considering that the company is yet to be profitable. Still, it's one for both Pfizer and investors to keep an eye on.: While I don't necessarily think it's the best idea, Pfizer is most likely to make a large acquisition. That's just what Pfizer does: $90 billion for Warner-Lambert, $60 billion for Pharmacia, $68 billion for Wyeth, $119 billion in a rebuffed deal for  .Of the four large biotechs --  ,  ,  , and  -- I think Amgen is the most likely candidate.Gilead is out because of the overlap with ViiV Healthcare, Pfizer's joint venture with  and  to sell HIV drugs.Celgene and Biogen would both fit well with Pfizer. Celgene's cancer drugs would fit right into Pfizer's oncology portfolio. Biogen would be a bit more of a bolt-on type of acquisition, but that's not necessarily a bad thing since it would open up new opportunities for Pfizer. However, both companies trade for premiums, which makes it less likely that Pfizer would buy them. As the failed deal for AstraZeneca showed us, Pfizer isn't interested in overpaying for growth potential.Amgen, on the other hand, is more reasonably priced. With revenue up 7% in 2014, the company is still growing, albeit far from the hyper-growth of yesteryear. Buying Amgen would garner Pfizer Enbrel, which Pfizer used to sell with Amgen, a pack of approved cancer drugs, as well as a pipeline that includes evolocumab, a cholesterol-lowering drug. There might be some dust on the Lipitor sales manuals, but I'm pretty sure Pfizer knows how to market one of those. The best biotech investors consistently reap gigantic profits by recognizing true potential earlier and more accurately than anyone else. Let me cut right to the chase.

nvestors eyeing a purchase of Seattle Genetics Inc (Symbol: SGEN) shares, but cautious about paying the going market price of $31.67/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the September put at the $25 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $1.40. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 5.6% return against the $25 commitment, or a 8.5% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to SGEN's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $25 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Seattle Genetics Inc sees its shares fall 21.3% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $23.60 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $1.40 from $25), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 8.5% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Seattle Genetics Inc, and highlighting in green where the $25 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the September put at the $25 strike for the 8.5% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks.

"nvestors in Seattle Genetics Inc (Symbol: SGEN) saw new options become available this week, for the September 18th expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 238 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the SGEN options chain for the new September 18th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $30.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.80. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $30.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $27.20 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of SGEN, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $32.27/share today.Because the $30.00 strike represents an approximate 7% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

If an investor was to purchase shares of SGEN stock at the current price level of $32.27/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $34.00.

 Shares of  , a biotechnology company that utilizes its antibody-drug conjugate technology to develop therapies to fight cancer, dipped 12% in December, based on data from  , following the release of scientific data at the American Society of Hematology's annual meeting. Here's the interesting part: the study data presented by Seattle Genetics at ASH wasn't bad. The unfortunate part is the company was upstaged by cancer immunotherapies, and Wall Street is concerned about the long-term future of antibody-drug conjugates, or ADCs, in light of the  that work with the body's immune system to identify and attack cancer cells.For instance, Seattle Genetics presented four-year survival data on FDA-approved Adcetris in patients with relapsed or refractory systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma at ASH. The company highlighted that an impressive 64% of patients were still alive, with half of the patients that achieved a complete response remaining disease-free. It also delivered positive phase 3 data with partner  in the  for post-transplant Hodgkin lymphoma patients at risk for a relapse that were treated with Adcetris.Source: Bristol-Myers Squibb.The problem is that Seattle Genetics was upstaged by PD-1 inhibitors like  's Opdivo and  's Keytruda. Both showed remarkable efficacy in treating Hodgkin's lymphoma during ASH  patients had been treated with Adcetris and showed disease progression. The worry here is these PD-1 inhibitors may begin working their way up the scale to first- or second-line indications and push Adcetris and other ADCs out of the way. This was a rough month for Seattle Genetics shareholders, and I suspect it could get rougher in 2015. While I'm a fan of ADCs in general and believe we'll see Adcetris' label expanded to new indications in the coming years, I also can't deny that immunotherapies are picking up steam, and that Seattle Genetics is accordingly looking very pricey.Source: Seattle Genetics.On a fundamental basis, Seattle Genetics isn't forecasted to be profitable until 2017, and it's not expected to hit $500 million in sales until 2018. Yet, the company currently boasts a $4 billion price tag, which is far too high for most value investors and likely puts it out of the realm of buyout territory for big pharma. Seattle Genetics does have the ability to monetize its technology to generate cash, so share dilution doesn't look as if it'll be a big immediate concern, but the fundamental hope of ADCs being the next big thing in cancer may be flying out the window.I'm certainly willing to keep Seattle Genetics high on my watchlist, but it would take a  pullback to intrigue me enough to pull the trigger to buy this stock. Healthcare stocks soared in 2014, and 2015 is shaping up to be another great year for stocks.

LPS Advisors snuck in one last ETF launch before the end of the year, adding to the long list of ETFs launched in 2014. The ALPS Medical Breakthrough ETF (NYSE:  ) began trading on New Year's Eve and could attract big money on the calendar flip.The ETF is designed to track biotech company's that have products in their pipeline in either Phase II or Phase III of the FDA clinical trial process. In a Phase II trial, the drug is administered to a group of 100 to 300 people to see if it is effective and to evaluate its safety. In a Phase III trial, the drug is given to a larger group, between 500 to 3,000 people, to confirm its effectiveness, monitor side effects, compare it to commonly used treatments and collect information that will allow the drug or treatment to be used safely.This strategy allows some of the risk to be eliminated from investing in the smaller biotech stocks. Rather than having just an idea or a drug in its very early stages, companies in SBIO are made up of companies that are further along the approval process.The ETF is composed of 75 small and medium-size companies with a market cap ranging between $200 million and $5 billion. The top five individual holdings are:NPS Pharmaceuticals with a 4.5 percent holding Receptos Inc making up 4.4 percent Seattle Genetics Inc at 4.4 percent Akorn Inc coming in at 4.1 percent Pacria Pharmaceuticals INC at 3.8 percentSBIO opened at $25.00 on December 31 and traded 25,000 shares in the first two hours.The charts of SBIO's top holdings show the potential gains with smaller biotech names when their drugs progress through the approval process. By using an ET, the company-specific risk is softened and investors could ride the wave of medical breakthroughs without a huge risk.© 2015 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide .

 (  ) announced that it has initiated an open-label, multi-center, dose-escalation phase Ib study on SGN-CD33A for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML).The study will evaluate SGN-CD33A in combination with cytarabine and Cerubidine as the frontline standard-of-care therapy for induction and/or cytarabine for consolidation. Additionally, the candidate will be studied as a single-agent maintenance regimen. The primary endpoints of the study are to determine the maximum tolerated dose of SGN-CD33A and its safety profile.We remind investors that SGN-CD33A is already being studied as a single agent or in combination with hypomethylating agents in an ongoing phase I dose-escalation study for the treatment of patients suffering from relapsed AML or those unsuitable for intensive frontline therapy.According to the American Cancer Society, more than 18,500 patients, comprising mostly adults, are expected to be diagnosed with AML in 2014 leading to approximately 10,500 deaths.We note that BerGenBio AS is currently evaluating BGB324 as a single agent as well as in combination with a standard-of-care therapy, cytarabine, in a phase Ib study for AML, with data expected in 2015. BGB324 enjoys orphan drug status in this indication.Meanwhile, Seattle Genetics is working towards further development of its early-stage pipeline. The company had said on its 3Q14 call that data on SGN-LIV1A, which is being developed for several subtypes of metastatic breast cancer including the triple negative form of the disease, is expected in 2015.Seattle Genetics holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Some better-ranked stocks in the biotech sector are Biogen Idec Inc. (  ), Cytokinetics, Inc. (  ) and Amgen Inc. (  ). All these stocks carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

" (SGEN) is a $4 billion biotechnology company focused on developing and commercializing innovative antibody-based therapies for the treatment of cancer. They are the industry leader in antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), a technology designed to harness the targeting ability of monoclonal antibodies to deliver cell-killing agents directly to cancer cells.ADCs are intended to spare non-targeted cells and thus reduce many of the toxic effects of traditional chemotherapy, while potentially enhancing antitumor activity.Seattle Genetics' first ADC product ADCETRIS (brentuximab vedotin) is commercially available for two indications in more than 45 countries, including the U.S., Canada, Japan and members of the European Union. The approval of ADCETRIS makes it the first in a new class of ADCs.The company is also testing their two most advanced product candidates, SGN-15 and SGN-10, in patients with breast, colon, prostate or other cancers.In the biotech world, young companies rely on larger pharmaceutical enterprises to assist with long R&D periods that require lots of funding before any FDA-approved and marketable drugs are generating net income.Seattle Genetics is jointly developing ADCETRIS in collaboration with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company. Under the collaboration, Seattle Genetics has full commercialization rights to ADCETRIS in the United States and Canada. Takeda has exclusive rights to commercialize the product candidate in all other countries.To expand on the ADCETRIS opportunity, the two companies are conducting a broad clinical development program to evaluate its therapeutic potential in earlier lines of its approved indications as well as in a range of other lymphoma and non-lymphoma settings.On December 8, Seattle Genetics and Takeda presented important research at the annual American Society of Hematology (ASH) conference in San Francisco. The partners announced four-year overall survival data from a pivotal phase II study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Adcetris for the treatment of relapsed or refractory systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). Adcetris showed durable, long-term responses in this treatment setting.At a median follow-up in the study at 46.3 months, the four-year survival rate was estimated to be 64%, with median overall survival (OS) of 55.1 months and progression-free survival (PFS) of 20 months. In other words, more than 60% of patients suffering from relapsed or refractory ALCL treated with Adcetris were alive at the fourth year of follow-up. One-third of all the patients treated in this study showed complete remission with no evidence of disease after a median follow-up of 46 months.Analyst reactions to these presentations were overwhelmingly positive as most believe that Adcetris will have a significant market opportunity outside its current indications.Seattle Genetics also announced detailed results from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III study (named AETHERA) on Adcetris for the treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma patients with the risk of disease progression following autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). PFS was higher in Adcetris-treated patients compared to placebo (43 months versus 24 months).Earlier, in Sep 2014, the company had already announced that the study met its primary endpoint with a 75% improvement in PFS. Seattle Genetics intends to submit a supplemental biologics license application to the FDA for Adcetris for the above-mentioned indication in the first half of 2015.Additionally, Seattle Genetics reported data from two ongoing phase I studies on SGN-CD19A for the treatment of B-cell malignancies including non-Hodgkin lymphoma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. SGN-CD19A showed multiple objective responses without significant myelosuppression or neuropathy. Based on this data, the company plans to initiate a randomized phase II study on SGN-CD19A for this indication in 2015.William Blair analysts commented on several on-going research studies in a recent note. Here was one highlight...""Pipeline candidate SGN-CD33A debuted with data in the acute myeloid leukemia (AML) setting. We are encouraged by the first data set in the AML setting. We believe that SGN-CD33A is an excellent validation of Seattle Genetics' drug discovery capability, platform utility, and drug development expertise.""While Seattle Genetics is not yet profitable, it became a Zacks #2 Rank in November because analysts were rapidly raising earnings estimates. Full-year 2014 estimates were raised from a loss of $0.82 to a loss of $0.66.And 2015 estimates went from a loss of $0.63 to a loss of $0.51. What's been driving these revisions? Earnings surprises, as you can in this table for the past four quarters...Equally impressive is the promising rise in revenues as you can see below...SGEN is projected to produce nearly $400 million in revenues in 2015. These trends in top and bottom line progress, in addition to the pipeline ""hopes and dreams"" are inspiring analysts to either reaffirm or raise their price targets for the stock. Let's hear from some of them now.Several Wall Street analysts are positive on SGEN science and the shares, with the average price target north of $40. After the ASH conference, William Blair analysts reiterated their Outperform rating and noted...""We reiterate our view that Seattle Genetics is well positioned, with a broad and growing pipeline, validated technology platform, and strong balance sheet ($340 million in cash). Therefore, we encourage investors to take advantage of recent share price weakness to build or add to positions.""Jefferies analysts reiterated their $53 price target and had this to say about potential competition from  (MRK) and  (BMY)...""While investors have raised many concerns on competing PD-1 therapies in HL (MRK's pembrolizumab and BMY's nivolumab), which demonstrated robust response rates of 66% and 87%, respectively, we believe that the recent pressure on SGEN shares is unwarranted.""But the most bullish investment house of all is H.C. Wainwright with a $65 price target. After reviewing the company's ASH presentation, analyst Andrew Fein concluded ""Continued quality and breadth of data should yield investor re-engagement."" They see good things ahead for SGEN in 2015.As with most targets on emerging biotech companies, there is an element of ""how much will the other guy pay for this science?"" And this is especially true in the investing arena we call ""biopharma"" since the big pharma companies constantly face old drugs going off the ""patent cliff"" and having their revenue sources stolen by generics.Their solution is to buy young companies with promising drugs in the pipeline. This doesn't mean for certain that SGEN is on any big pharma shopping lists, but it's definitely a probability that gets factored into the valuation models of big investors.And finally, speaking of big investors, one of my favorite ""indicators"" is institutional buying. They may not be a household name yet, but the brothers Julian and Felix Baker manage $8 billion in a biopharma-focused fund for other institutional investors like the Tisch family, owners of the New York Giants football franchise.Through their Baker Bros. Advisors fund, they bumped their stake in SGEN shares to over 20% in the days immediately following the ASH conference.Then, in a 13D SEC filing on December 17, they revealed the purchase of another 2.88 million shares within the prior ten days. I should note that Felix Baker is on the Board of Directors of SGEN, so these are also considered ""insider"" purchases as well as part of their investment fund.The Baker brothers have taken the activist investor role in many early, mid, and late-stage biotech companies, and it's usually for a very compelling reason. You could say Felix is the Carl Icahn of biopharma.Plus, these guys have used their science backgrounds to evaluate and invest in biotech companies successfully for over two decades. Some recent home runs include  (PCYC),  (INCY), and  (AGIO).So I follow the Baker brothers' ""money trail"" often in biotech, and SGEN quickly moved to the top of my buy list this month. They see something extremely valuable in the company's potential that the market is not currently recognizing. And they obviously believe the reward is greater than the risk at these levels.Disclosure: I own shares of SGEN for the Zacks FTM Trader.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Seattle Genetics reported a loss of $0.13 per share in the third quarter of 2014, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate for a loss of $0.25 and the year-ago loss of $0.19. Revenues of $75.9 million surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $67 million. Adcetris sales were driven by higher demand in the approved indications as well as physicians' prescriptions in other areas. Although Seattle Genetics has increased its 2014 revenue guidance for Adcetris, it still depends solely on the product for growth, which raises concerns. While Seattle Genetics is working on increasing Adcetris sales, we prefer to remain on the sidelines until we gain visibility on the impact of these efforts. We are initiating coverage on Seattle Genetics with a Neutral recommendation.Bothell, WA-based Seattle Genetics, Inc. is a biotechnology company which primarily focuses on the development and commercialization of therapies targeted for the treatment of cancer.Adcetris, Seattle Genetics' only marketed product, received FDA accelerated approval in Aug 2011 for the treatment of relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma and relapsed systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (sALCL). Adcetris is also received conditional marketing authorization in the EU (Oct 2012), conditional approval in Canada (Feb 2013) and full approval in 45 other countries in this indication. Seattle Genetics has an agreement with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd. for the development and commercialization of Adcetris. Seattle Genetics retains all rights to sell Adcetris in the U.S. and Canada, while, Takeda has commercial rights to the drug in the rest of the world.The company also has collaboration with several companies for the development of its pipeline. The companies partnered with Seattle Genetics include Celldex, Genetech (a Roche company), Progenics, Millenium (a Takeda company), GlaxoSmithKline, Astellas, Pfizer, AbbVie, Bayer, Daiichi Sankyo, Genmab and Oxford BioTherapeutics.Seattle Genetics generated net revenues of $269.3 million in 2013, up 27.7% year over year.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

 (  ) announced encouraging data from the ongoing phase Ib CheckMate - 039 study on immuno-oncology drug Opdivo (nivolumab, a PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor). Data from the study was published in  .The CheckMate - 039 study evaluated the use of Opdivo in patients with relapsed or refractory hematological malignancies. In the study, Opdivo demonstrated high levels of response in patients with relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma with an overall response rate of 87% and stable disease in 13% of patients.The data supports the Breakthrough Therapy designation granted by the FDA to Opdivo for the treatment of patients with Hodgkin lymphoma after failure of autologous stem cell transplant and being unsuccessfully treated with Seattle Genetics Inc.'s (  ) Adcetris (brentuximab).Opdivo is being studied in several oncology indications, such as, renal cell carcinoma, head and neck cancer, glioblastoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. We note that Opdivo is already approved in Japan for treating patients with unresectable melanoma.The candidate is already under review in the U.S. and EU for previously treated advanced melanoma. A response from the FDA is expected by Mar 30, 2015. In the EU, the marketing application has been granted accelerated assessment status by the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use.Opdivo is also under review in the EU for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In the U.S., the company initiated a rolling submission for the NSCLC indication. Bristol-Myers expects to complete the rolling submission by the end of this year.Approval of Opdivo for NSCLC and melanoma indications would strengthen Bristol-Myers' position in the lucrative as well as highly sought after immuno-oncology space. We expect investor focus to remain on updates regarding the high potential Opdivo.Bristol-Myers carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Other well-ranked stocks in the health care sector include Allergan (  ) and Actavis (  ). While Allergan carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), AMAG Pharma carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

eattle Genetics, Inc. (  ) and partner Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (  ) have inked a deal to develop an investigational combination of the former's antibody-drug conjugate, Adcetris and the latter's immunotherapy, Opdivo.The Adcetris-Opdivo combination therapy will be evaluated in two planned phase I/II studies. In the first study, Seattle Genetics will evaluate the combination for the treatment of patients suffering from relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma.The next study will be conducted by Bristol-Myers in patients suffering from relapsed or refractory B-cell and T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Both studies are expected to begin in 2015. Financial details pertaining to the collaboration were not disclosed.We note that Adcetris had received accelerated approval in the U.S. in Aug 2011 and conditional marketing authorization in the EU in Oct 2012 for relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma or relapsed systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Opdivo injection received accelerated approval in the U.S. for intravenous use in patients suffering from unresectable or metastatic melanoma and disease progression following treatment with Yervoy and in patients who are BRAF V600 mutation positive following treatment with a BRAF inhibitor.We are positive on Seattle Genetics' collaboration with Bristol-Myers and expect the collaboration to boost Adcetris' development prospects. Adcetris is the only approved candidate in Seattle Genetics' franchise. Hence, successful development and commercialization of the combination therapy should bode well for the company.Seattle Genetics holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

 (  ) announced encouraging early results from the ongoing phase Ib KEYNOTE-013 study on its anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda (pembrolizumab).Results revealed that patients suffering from relapsed/refractory classical Hodgkin Lymphoma treated with Keytruda achieved an overall response rate of 66%. These patients either failed or were ineligible to respond to transplant and disease progressed on or after treatment with Seattle Genetics Inc.'s (  ) Adcetris (brentuximab vedotin). Results further revealed that 21% patients in the study achieved complete response.The study is evaluating the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of Keytruda as a monotherapy in patients suffering from blood cancer like myelodysplastic syndromes, multiple myeloma, Hodgkin lymphoma, mediastinal large B cell lymphoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.Merck plans to start a phase II study on Keytruda in the classical Hodgkin Lymphoma indication in the first half of 2015.We remind investors that Keytruda was the first anti-PD-1 therapy to gain approval in the U.S. earlier in the year. The drug was approved in the U.S. at a dose of 2 mg/kg every three weeks for the treatment of patients suffering from unresectable or metastatic melanoma and whose disease progressed after treatment with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company's (  ) Yervoy and a BRAF inhibitor, if BRAF V600 mutation is positive.Moreover, the FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to Keytruda for the treatment of patients with epidermal growth factor receptor mutation-negative and anaplastic lymphoma kinase rearrangement-negative non-small cell lung cancer, whose disease has progressed on or following platinum-based chemotherapy.Merck is evaluating Keytruda for different cancer types including bladder, colorectal and gastric among others. We are encouraged by the company's progress with its pipeline so far.Merck currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Buy). A better-ranked stock in the health care sector includes Allergan Inc.

ooking for a stock that might be in a good position to beat earnings at its next report? Consider  (  ), a firm in the Medical-Biomedical/Generic industry, which could be a great candidate for another beat.This company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. In fact, in these reports, SGEN has beaten estimates by at least 35% in both cases, suggesting it has a nice short-term history of crushing expectations.Two quarters ago, SGEN projected to incur a loss of 22 cents per share, while it actually produced loss of 14 cents per share, a beat of 36.4%. Meanwhile, for the most recent quarter, the company looked to incur loss of 25 cents per share, when it actually saw loss of 13 cents per share instead, representing a 48.0% positive surprise.Thanks in part to this history, recent estimates have been moving higher for Seattle Genetics. In fact, the  for SGEN is positive, which is a great sign of a coming beat.After all, the Zacks Earnings ESP compares the most accurate estimate to the broad consensus, looking to find stocks that have seen big revisions as of late, suggesting that analysts have recently become more bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This is the case for SGEN, as the firm currently has a Zacks Earnings ESP of 7.69%, so another beat could be around the corner.This is particularly true when you consider that SGEN has a great Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) which can be a harbinger of outperformance and a signal for a strong earnings profile. And when you add this solid Zacks Rank to a positive Earnings ESP,  of the time, so it seems pretty likely that SGEN could see another beat at its next report, especially if recent trends are any guide.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"he Dow had a particularly disappointing week, following a slump in  and disappointing overseas economic data. The blue-chip index began the week on a dismal note because of these factors in the absence of significant domestic data.The Dow took losses once again on Tuesday as investors remained concerned about the global economy and political turmoil in Greece. The blue-chip index recorded its biggest decline since Oct 9 on Wednesday, after a slump in oil prices dragged down energy shares. Ultimately, the Dow rebounded on Thursday propelled by better-than-expected retail sales data and an impressive initial claims report. The Dow has lost 2% during the first four trading days.Stocks ended in the green on Friday boosted by upbeat jobs data. The Dow reached its 34th record high this year, gaining0.3%. Total nonfarm payroll employment increased by 321,000 in November, significantly more than the consensus estimate of 226,000. The economy added the most number of jobs in November since Jan 2012.The economy also added a minimum of 200,000 jobs for 10 straight-months in November. This turned out to be the longest stretch in more than 30 years. Nonfarm payroll data for September and October were also revised higher, that showed 44,000 more jobs were added during the two-month period.Additionally, the average hourly earnings of American workers increased 0.4% in November, more than the consensus estimate of a rise by 0.2%. Meanwhile, unemployment rate remained at a six-year low of 5.8%.The blue-chip index also registered its seventh successive week of gains, advancing 0.7%. Most stocks ended in the green fueled by a rally in energy and healthcare shares as well as solid gains in material stocks.Moreover, merger and acquisition news involving Japan-based Otsuka Pharmaceuticals and Avanir Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (  ), and Cypress Semiconductor Corp. (  ) and Spansion Inc. (  ) also boosted investor confidence. Additionally, encouraging reports of domestic vehicle sales, strong service sector numbers and uptick in construction spending had positive impact on the benchmarks.Among the negatives, decline in sales during the Thanksgiving weekend and the European Central Bank's failure to provide solid clues about further monetary stimulus had negative impact on investor sentiment. Moreover, domestic manufacturing activity expanded at a slower pace in November compared to that in October. This development, along with a decline in purchasing managers' index (PMI) in China dented investor sentiment.The Dow declined 0.6% on Monday after a slump in oil prices and disappointing overseas economic data dented investor sentiment. Energy shares were hit hard after oil prices plunged to a five-year low over continued concerns of oversupply. Moreover, discouraging China's trade numbers, contraction of Japan's economy and less-than-expected expansion in Germany's industrial output has raised concerns of a slowdown in global economy.Oil prices took a beating on Monday. The West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil dropped to its lowest level since Jul 2009. Additionally, Brent crude oil prices slumped to its lowest level in five years. Oil prices tumbled on forecasts that oversupply will persist in the first half of 2015.Meanwhile, China's imports dropped 6.7% in November from the year-ago period, in contrast to analysts' forecast of a 3.9% increase. On the other hand, exports increased 4.7% in November, lower less than October's increase of 11.6%.Separately, Japan's economy shrank 1.9% from July to September, more than the preliminary estimate of 1.6%. Additionally, German industrial output expanded 0.2% in October, less than analysts' expectation of a rise by 0.3%.Stocks ended Tuesday's trading session on a mixed note as investors remained concerned about the global economy and political turmoil in Greece. People's Bank of China's move to tighten rules on loans and unexpected declaration of presidential elections in Greece dented investor sentiment. However, the Dow lost only 0.3% erasing much of the initial losses, banking on a rally in energy and technology stocks.Greece's ASE Index plunged 12.8% after Prime Minister Antonis Samaras declared presidential election. This move came in after the country was given an additional two months to fulfil its bailout obligations. Separately, Germany's November import figures declined 3.1%.Investors were primarily concerned about economic weakness in China. The country's benchmark Shanghai Composite Index tumbled 5.4%, its biggest one-day percentage decline since Aug 2009. The index plunged after the People's Bank of China tightened lending rules. China's stocks took a beating after the regulator restricted investors from using low-grade corporate debt as security to raise cash. The blue-chip index lost 0.3%.The Dow slumped 1.5% on Wednesday, recording its biggest decline since Oct 9. Benchmarks suffered their biggest drop in two months on Wednesday after a slump in oil prices dragged energy shares down. Oil prices took a beating after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) slashed its demand for oil estimates in the next year due to abundant North American output and rise in other producers.OPEC predicts demand for its oil in 2015 to be at 28.9 million barrels a day, less than 29.4 million barrels a day in 2014. Stocks rebounded on Thursday propelled by better-than-expected retail sales data and an impressive initial claims report. Advance estimates of U.S. retail and food services sales for November increased 0.7% from October to $449.3 billion, easily beating the consensus estimate of a gain of 0.4%. Also, retail sales data reflected a decent 5.1% year-on-year jump in retails sales, which is adjusted for seasonal variation and holiday and trading- day differences, but not for price changes.Meanwhile, jobless claims for the week ending Dec 6 was 294,000, down from previous week's 297,000. This was 3,000 lower than consensus estimate of 297,000. Indices made a comeback from the slump they suffered a day earlier and the bearish mood that mostly prevailed through this week. However, some of the day's gains were eroded post noon by concerns over the US crude futures falling below $60 per barrel for the first time since Jul 2009. The blue-chip index added 0.4%.

This expands the portfolio of the U.S. energy giant's long-term projects in the Asia-Pacific region.The blocks - 57083, 57085 and 57087 - are located at water depths of 800 meters to 3,000 meters in the Pegasus and East Coast basins.

Stocks have experienced one of their gloomiest weeks in recent times. A combination of plunging oil prices and dismal foreign economic data guided markets lower. The announcement from OPEC has compounded fears of a further decline in oil prices. This could ultimately lead to gains in other sector next year.However, for now, oil prices may continue to dictate the fate of the indices. At the same time, this week has been bereft of domestic data but for Thursday, when markets moved upward.Next week has several key economic reports lined up for release. This includes data on industrial production, housing, leading indicators and jobless claims.Most importantly, the Fed policy statement is slated for release, an event which the market is eagerly awaiting. Any positive indications for investors from the domestic front will help boost stocks in the days ahead.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download  .

"nvesting in biotech companies can be tricky, especially for investors who don't have a scientific background or who don't completely understand the process of bringing new drugs to the marketplace.Fortunately, the Fool is here to help. We asked three of our top biotech analysts which company they're keeping a close eye on as we head into November, and this is what they had to say. : With the American Society of Hematology meeting happening in early December, November is a good month to catch up on drugs that treat blood cancers and other blood diseases.We'll actually get a bit of a catalyst before the meeting: On Nov. 6, abstracts for the presentations at the meeting are released, and on Nov. 17, late-breaking abstracts for clinical trials are published.The late-breaking submissions tend to be the most interesting, but they usually have the least amount of data since the clinical trials are often still in process. The abstracts are sometimes just placeholders, and you have to wait for the meeting to get any meaningful data.Whether it's in the abstract or at the meeting, I'm looking forward to seeing  data from its Aethera trial, testing Adcetris immediately following an autologous stem cell transplantation in patients with Hodgkin lymphoma. The biotech already reported a 75% improvement in progression-free survival -- living without the disease progressing -- but the details of how the patients are responding are more important than the top-line data.Autologous stem cell transplants are basically the last chance at a cure for patients with Hodgkin lymphoma. If patients fail the transplant, the subsequent treatments -- including Adcetris, which is currently approved for patients that failed a transplant -- can extend survival, but don't typically cure the patient. If using Adcetris directly after a transplant can increase the transplant's cure rate, use of Adcetris should go up substantially.:  The biotech stock that has my interest this month is  . Even though shares have already risen by 52% this year, Gilead still offers tremendous value at current levels for a number of reasons.First off, we have the company's next-generation hepatitis C treatment, Harvoni. With about 40% of patients eligible to receive the shorter treatment duration with this fixed combination pill (eight weeks compared to 12 weeks) and most patient sub-types reporting 99% functional cure rates in clinical trials, this drug looks like it has what it takes to dominate the hepatitis C market. The only serious risk to Harvoni's utter domination is if  prices its hepatitis C offering in a manner that allows it to gain favor on the formulary. Even then, AbbVie's experimental treatment will still need to be deemed ""clinically equivalent"" in order to displace Harvoni on the formulary.Gilead, though, has a lot more to offer than AbbVie. For example, the company is in the process of launching its new blood cancer drug Zydelig, and its HIV medicine, Stribild, has seen sales more than double in the past year. All positive signs for Gilead's future. :  already sells one commercial drug, Nuedexta, but it hopes to win FDA approval for a second treatment on Nov. 26, when the FDA is slated to issue its decision on AVP-825 as a treatment for migraines.If Avanir wins the FDA go-ahead for AVP-825 it could win away share from oral sumatriptan tablets, which are the most commonly prescribed medicine for acute migraines. Prior to losing patent protection, sumatriptan, sold as Imitrex by  , had sales of more than $1 billion annually.AVP-825 is a new low-dose formulation of sumatriptan that is taken intra-nasally, rather than swallowed. During clinical trials, AVP-825 and outperformed oral sumatriptan with AVP-825 patients reporting greater pain relief within 30 minutes than patients taking sumatriptan tablets.The CDC estimates there are 37 million migraine sufferers in the U.S. and Avanir reports that roughly 13 million scripts are written for triptan medicines every year; about half of which are for sumatriptan. As many as 66% of migraine sufferers remain dissatisfied with their treatment options, so they may find a willing audience. Industry watchers project AVP-825's peak sales could be between $125 million and $200 million and while that wouldn't move the needle for a big drugmaker, it should go a long way toward turning Avanir profitable while also providing cash for the company's promising Alzheimer drug trials. The best biotech investors consistently reap gigantic profits by recognizing true potential earlier and more accurately than anyone else. Let me cut right to the chase. There is a product in development that will revolutionize not just how we treat a common chronic illness, but potentially the entire health industry. Analysts are already licking their chops at the sales potential.

 is up in after-hours trading after posting record sales for its blood cancer drug Adcetris, and raising guidance for the year. The biotech sold $48 million worth of Adcetris in the U.S. and Canada, a 32% year-over-year increase.Seattle Genetics also booked $8 million worth of royalty revenue from sales of Adcetris by its overseas partner  . The drug is now approved in 47 countries, including 11 new approvals in the last 12 months.In the U.S., the big driver of sales is coming from off-label use treating Hodgkin lymphoma to knock back the lymphoma so patients can get a stem cell transplant. Adcetris is currently only approved to treat Hodgkin lymphoma patients that have failed a stem cell transplant, so Seattle Genetics can't promote it for use before stem cell transplants, even if doctors are choosing to use it then.On the back of a strong third quarter, Seattle Genetics raised its guidance for sales of Adcetris this year to between $172 million and $177 million. That guidance implies fourth-quarter sales of $40 million to $45 million.If you're playing along at home, you'll notice that's less than the $48 million in the third quarter. The holiday season will result in less shipping days, which will affect sales; but it doesn't necessarily mean that demand is down. The aforementioned off-label sales could also diminish -- they tend to be lumpy as doctors explore what's working. And, of course, there's a good chance that management is just sandbagging its guidance.Looking forward, Adcetris sales growth should come from consolidation therapy immediately following an autologous stem cell transplant in patients with Hodgkin lymphoma. Using it on all patients -- not just those who have failed a stem cell transplant -- will obviously increase sales.Seattle Genetics recently presented top-line data for a trial in that indication, which showed Adcetris significantly extended survival without the lymphoma progressing, referred to as progression-free survival. We'll get more data on the trial at the American Society of Hematology meeting in December, where Seattle Genetics expects to have data presented at eight oral presentations. The company plans to submit an application to the FDA in the first half of 2015 for using Adcetris as a consolidation therapy, which would put it on track for an approval toward the end of next year or in early 2016.Of course, Seattle Genetics is more than just Adcetris. The drug is built on its antibody drug conjugate technology, which the biotech has licensed to 12 different companies, including  , which signed up for a second collaboration in September. During the quarter, three of the collaborators --  ,  , and Bayer -- moved drugs along in the clinic, triggering milestone payments.Seattle Genetics isn't profitable yet; but with $340 million in cash and investments, solid growth in sales of Adcetris, and potential for future royalties from collaborators' drugs, the biotech looks like it's in good shape for now. The best biotech investors consistently reap gigantic profits by recognizing true potential earlier and more accurately than anyone else. Let me cut right to the chase.

"n the latest look at stocks ordered by largest market capitalization, Russell 3000 component Seattle Genetics Inc (Symbol: SGEN) was identified as having a larger market cap than the smaller end of the S&P 500, for example Nabors Industries Ltd. (Symbol: NBR), according to  .Market capitalization is an important data point for investors to keep an eye on, for various reasons. The most basic reason is that it gives a true comparison of the value attributed by the stock market to a given company's stock. Many beginning investors look at one stock trading at $10 and another trading at $20 and mistakenly think the latter company is worth twice as much - that of course is a completely meaningless comparison without knowing how many shares of each company exist. But comparing market capitalization (factoring in those share counts) creates a true ""apples-to-apples"" comparison of the value of two stocks. In the case of Seattle Genetics Inc (Symbol: SGEN), the market cap is now $4.54B, versus Nabors Industries Ltd. (Symbol: NBR) at $4.53B.Below is a three month price history chart comparing the stock performance of SGEN vs. NBR:Another reason market capitalization is important is where it places a company in terms of its size tier in relation to peers - much like the way a mid-size sedan is typically compared to other mid-size sedans (and not SUV's). This can have a direct impact on which indices will include the stock, and which mutual funds and ETFs are willing to own the stock. For instance, a mutual fund that is focused solely on Large Cap stocks may for example only be interested in those companies sized $10 billion or larger. Another illustrative example is the S&P MidCap index which essentially takes the S&P 500 index and ""tosses out"" the biggest 100 companies so as to focus solely on the 400 smaller ""up-and-comers"" (which in the right environment can outperform their larger rivals). And ETFs that directly follow an index like the S&P 500 will only own the underlying component of that index, selling companies that lose their status as an S&P 500 company, and buying companies when they are added to the index. So a company's market cap, especially in relation to other companies, carries great importance, and for this reason we at TheOnlineInvestor.com find value to putting together these looks at comparative market capitalization daily.At the closing bell, SGEN is down about 1.9%, while NBR is down about 4.9% on the day Tuesday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Seattle Genetics Larger Than S&P 500 Component Nabors Industries@2014-11-25@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/seattle-genetics-larger-sp-500-component-nabors-industries-2014-11-25

 's shares (  ) gained 4% following the release of better-than-expected third-quarter 2014 results. The company reported a loss of 13 cents per share in the third quarter, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 25 cents and the year-ago loss of 19 cents per share.In the reported quarter, revenues increased 6.9% from the year-ago quarter to $75.9 million. Revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $67 million. The increase was primarily driven by higher Adcetris sales and royalty revenues.Total revenue comprised product revenues, collaboration and license agreement revenues and royalties. Adcetris, the only marketed product at Seattle Genetics, generated revenues of $48.2 million (in the U.S. and Canada), up 32% year over year. The increase was due to higher demand for the product in the approved indications (relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma or relapsed systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (sALCL)) as well as physicians' prescriptions in areas other than these indications.Collaboration and license agreement revenues and royalty revenues were $19.5 million (down 33.3%) and $8.1 million (up 55.1%), respectively.In the reported quarter, R&D expenses were $58.5 million, down 13.8% year over year. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 18.1% year over year to $25.3 million.Seattle Genetics is working on expanding Adcetris' label. The company is evaluating Adcetris in the phase III AETHERA study in Hodgkin lymphoma patients who are at risk of relapse of the disease. It intends to file a supplemental biologic license application (BLA) for Adcetris for this indication in the first half of 2015.Apart from the AETHERA study, Adcetris is in three phase III studies - ECHELON-1 (front-line advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma), ECHELON-2 (front-line MTCL including sALCL) and ALCANZA (relapsed cutaneous T-cell lymphoma). Seattle Genetics is currently in discussion with the regulatory authorities in the U.S. and Europe regarding the modification of the statistical aspects of ECHELON-1 and ECHELON-2.Seattle Genetics increased its 2014 revenue guidance for Adcetris to the range of $172 million - $177 million (previous guidance: $160 million - $170 million). Additionally, the company increased its collaboration revenues for the rest of 2014 in the range of $64 million - $68 million.Although Adcetris performed well in this quarter, the company expects sales to fluctuate on a sequential basis.We are pleased with Adcetris' performance so far. Adcetris being the only marketed product at Seattle Genetics remains the growth driver for the company. Meanwhile, the company has a number of data presentations lined up in Dec as well as 2015. Positive results should act as a catalyst.Seattle Genetics carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the biotech sector are Biogen Idec Inc. (  ), Medivation Inc.

(  ) and partner Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd. (  ) announced positive top-line data from the randomized phase III AETHERA study on Adcetris as a consolidation therapy immediately following an autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in patients suffering from Hodgkin lymphoma.The AETHERA study compared the use of Adcetris as a single agent to placebo in 329 Hodgkin lymphoma patients who were at risk of relapse. Results showed that patients treated with Adcetris lived significantly longer without the disease worsening compared to those in the placebo arm.Adcetris met the primary endpoint of improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) compared to placebo by achieving 75% improvement in PFS. Seattle Genetics also said that most of the placebo-treated patients were administered Adcetris after their disease showed progression.Seattle Genetics intends to make an analysis of overall survival in this study in 2016. The company will present detailed data from the study in the annual meeting of the American Society of Hematology (ASH) in Dec 2014. It intends to submit a supplemental biologics license application (BLA) to the FDA for Adcetris in the above mentioned indication in 2015.According to the American Cancer Society, nearly 9,200 patients in the U.S. will be diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma in 2014 with more than 1,200 expected to die from the disease. More than 62,000 cases of Hodgkin lymphoma are diagnosed each year in the world. Up to 30% of these patients relapse or are refractory to frontline treatment with only few patients having therapeutic options beyond ASCT.We note that apart from the AETHERA study, Adcetris is being evaluated in three other phase III studies − ALCANZA (relapsed cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL)); ECHELON-1 (front-line advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma) and ECHELON-2 (front-line CD30-positive MTCL, including systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (sALCL)).Adcetris is already approved in more than 45 countries for the treatment of relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma and sALCL.Other stocks worth considering in the health care sector are Gilead Sciences Inc.

 (  ) announced data from a two-year durability analysis of a phase I study on Adcetris (in combination with CHP chemotherapy) for the treatment of patients newly diagnosed with CD30-positive peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) (also known as mature T-cell lymphoma, or MTCL).Patients, who achieved at least partial remission after completing six cycles (each three week long) of the combination therapy, were further treated with single-agent Adcetris for up to ten additional three-week cycles. The primary endpoints of the study were to define the maximum tolerated dose of Adcetris in combination with CHP regimen and evaluate its safety.We note that Adcetris is in four phase III studies − AETHERA (Hodgkin lymphoma patients who are at high risk of relapse following autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT)), ALCANZA (relapsed cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL)), ECHELON-1 (front-line advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma) and ECHELON-2 (front-line CD30-positive MTCL, including systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (sALCL)).Data from the phase I study in newly diagnosed CD30-positive MTCL patients with advanced or high-risk disease characteristics showed durable progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) rates. The estimated two-year PFS rate in this study was 54% while the OS rate was 80%. This data supported the ongoing phase III ECHELON-2 study, in which patients are currently being enrolled.Seattle Genetics will present the phase I data at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress to be held from Sep 26 to Sep 30.Seattle Genetics has accelerated approval for Adcetris in the U.S. and conditional approval in Canada for two indications − Hodgkin lymphoma after failure of ASCT or after failure of at least two prior multi-agent chemotherapy regimens in non-ASCT patients and sALCL after failure of at least one prior multi-agent chemotherapy regimen.In Europe, Seattle Genetics has conditional marketing authorization for Adcetris for relapsed or refractory CD30-positive Hodgkin lymphoma following ASCT or following at least two prior therapies when ASCT or multi-agent chemotherapy is not a treatment option and relapsed or refractory sALCL.Seattle Genetics holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

 's (  ) oncology candidate ABT-414 received orphan drug status in the U.S. and the EU for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme. AbbVie is developing ABT-414 with certain components in-licensed from Life Science Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Seattle Genetics (  ).Orphan drug status is granted to treatments being developed for rare diseases (affecting less than 200,000 people in the U.S. and up to 5 out of 10,000 people in the EU).Glioblastoma multiforme is the most common and aggressive type of malignant primary brain tumor. According to the press release issued by AbbVie, 2−3 out of 100,000 people in the U.S. and Europe are diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme each year, with a five-year survival rate of only 4% (approximately). After nearly 15 months of diagnosis, patients are found to succumb to their disease.Currently, ABT-414 is in a phase II program for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme.Considering the limited treatment options for glioblastoma multiforme, there is urgent need for new treatments in this field. If successfully developed and commercialized, ABT-414 will boost the company's portfolio.Meanwhile, Tocagen Inc.'s Toca 511 in combination with Toca FC is also under development for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme.We remind investors that AbbVie is working on strengthening its portfolio. In Jul 2014, the company announced its plans to acquire Shire plc (  ). This deal makes AbbVie the latest to join a string of U.S. health care companies that have been looking towards overseas acquisitions to lower their tax rates.AbbVie will not just lower its taxes through this acquisition; it will also boost its product portfolio significantly. This acquisition is very important for the company, which was mainly dependent on a single drug, Humira, for growth.AbbVie carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in the biotech sector is Actelion (  ), carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Seattle Genetics carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

 's (  ) biopharmaceutical division, Merck Serono, has signed a collaboration and license agreement with Sutro Biopharma to develop antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) targeting cancer cells. This deal is aimed at enhancing Merck KGaA's access to ADC technologies and expanding its oncology pipeline.Under this agreement, Merck KGaA will use Sutro's cell-free protein synthesis platforms Xpress CF and Xpress CF+ to develop ADCs for multiple undisclosed targets. While Sutro will supply ADCs for phase I studies, Merck KGaA will be responsible for the development and commercialization of any product developed under the collaboration.As far as financial details are concerned, Merck KGaA will make an upfront payment to Sutro apart from funding certain R&D activities. Additionally, Sutro will receive royalties on product sales as well as milestones payments once specific research, development and regulatory milestones (approximately totaling €230 million) are achieved.We are positive on Merck KGaA's collaboration with Sutro. We believe Merck KGaA's access to the new technology platforms will complement its efforts to develop its oncology pipeline, which comprises a number of mid and late-stage candidates.We note that several companies are currently adopting an interest in the development of ADCs for the treatment of cancer. Earlier this month, Seattle Genetics (  ) entered into an antibody drug conjugate collaboration with Genmab A/S for the development of Genmab's ADC for solid cancer using the former's auristatin-based ADC technology.Merck KGaA carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

 's shares (  ) gained 4.8% following the release of second-quarter 2014 results. Seattle Genetics reported second-quarter loss per share of 14 cents, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 22 cents but wider than the year-ago loss of 6 cents per share.In the reported quarter, revenues declined 7.1% from the year-ago quarter to $68.3 million. Revenues, however, surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $65 million. The year-over-year decrease in revenues was mainly due to a decline in collaboration revenues.Total revenue comprised product revenues, collaboration and license agreement revenues and royalties. Adcetris, the only marketed product at Seattle Genetics, generated revenues of $44.8 million (in the U.S. and Canada), up 25.3% year over year. This increase was due to higher demand in the approved indications (relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma or relapsed systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma) as well as physicians' prescriptions in areas other than these indications.Collaboration and license agreement revenues and royalty revenues were $16.2 million (down 52.8%) and $7.3 million (up 107.2%), respectively.Research and development (R&D) expenses increased 2.7% year over year to $53.7 million due to Adcetris' development activities and higher investment in other antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) programs. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 8.5% year over year to $25.5 million.Seattle Genetics and partner Takeda Pharmaceutical (  ) are working on expanding Adcetris' label. Adcetris is currently in four phase III studies, including AETHERA (post-transplant Hodgkin lymphoma), ECHELON-1 (frontline therapy in patients with advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma), ECHELON-2 (newly diagnosed CD30-positive mature T-cell lymphoma) and ALCANZA (CD30-positive cutaneous T-cell lymphoma). Top line data from the AETHERA study should be out by Oct 2014. Positive results would allow the company to go ahead with the filing of a supplemental biologics license application in the U.S. in the first half of 2015.Additionally, Seattle Genetics is developing five antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) - SGN-CD19A, SGN-CD33A, SGN-LIV1A, ASG-22ME, and ASG-15ME.Seattle Genetics increased its 2014 revenue guidance for Adcetris to the range of $160 million-$170 million (previous guidance: $155 million-$165 million). The company also reduced 2014 R&D expense guidance to the range of $235 million−$250 million.Seattle Genetics depends on Adcetris significantly for growth. Although Adcetris performed well in the reported quarter, the company expects sales to fluctuate on a quarter-over-quarter basis.Seattle Genetics currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Some better-ranked stocks in the health care sector are Actelion Ltd. (  ) and Enzo Biochem Inc. (  ). Both stocks carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

ooking for a stock that might be in a good position to beat earnings at its next report? Consider  (  ), a firm in the biotechnology industry, which could be a great candidate for another beat.This company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. In fact, in these reports, SGEN has beaten estimates by at least 35% in both cases, suggesting it has a nice short-term history of crushing expectations.Two quarters ago, SGEN expected to report a loss of 24 cents per share, while it actually reported a loss of 13 cents per share, a beat of 45.8%. Meanwhile, for the most recent quarter, the company looked to post a loss of 20 cents per share, when it actually reported a loss of 13 cents per share instead, representing a 35% positive surprise.Thanks in part to this history, recent estimates have been moving higher for Seattle Genetics. In fact, the  for SGEN is positive, which is a great sign of a coming beat.After all, the Zacks Earnings ESP compares the most accurate estimate to the broad consensus, looking to find stocks that have seen big revisions as of late, suggesting that analysts have recently become more bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This is the case for SGEN, as the firm currently has a Zacks Earnings ESP of 4.55%, so another beat could be around the corner.This is particularly true when you consider that SGEN has a great Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) which can be a harbinger of outperformance and a signal for a strong earnings profile. And when you add this solid Zacks Rank to a positive Earnings ESP,  of the time, so it seems pretty likely that SGEN could see another beat at its next report, especially if recent trends are any guide.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"n the latest look at stocks ordered by largest market capitalization, Russell 3000 component Seattle Genetics Inc (Symbol: SGEN) was identified as having a larger market cap than the smaller end of the S&P 500, for example Patterson Companies Inc (Symbol: PDCO), according to  .Market capitalization is an important data point for investors to keep an eye on, for various reasons. The most basic reason is that it gives a true comparison of the value attributed by the stock market to a given company's stock. Many beginning investors look at one stock trading at $10 and another trading at $20 and mistakenly think the latter company is worth twice as much - that of course is a completely meaningless comparison without knowing how many shares of each company exist. But comparing market capitalization (factoring in those share counts) creates a true ""apples-to-apples"" comparison of the value of two stocks. In the case of Seattle Genetics Inc (Symbol: SGEN), the market cap is now $4.08B, versus Patterson Companies Inc (Symbol: PDCO) at $4.06B.Below is a three month price history chart comparing the stock performance of SGEN vs. PDCO:Another reason market capitalization is important is where it places a company in terms of its size tier in relation to peers - much like the way a mid-size sedan is typically compared to other mid-size sedans (and not SUV's). This can have a direct impact on which indices will include the stock, and which mutual funds and ETFs are willing to own the stock. For instance, a mutual fund that is focused solely on Large Cap stocks may for example only be interested in those companies sized $10 billion or larger. Another illustrative example is the S&P MidCap index which essentially takes the S&P 500 index and ""tosses out"" the biggest 100 companies so as to focus solely on the 400 smaller ""up-and-comers"" (which in the right environment can outperform their larger rivals). And ETFs that directly follow an index like the S&P 500 will only own the underlying component of that index, selling companies that lose their status as an S&P 500 company, and buying companies when they are added to the index. So a company's market cap, especially in relation to other companies, carries great importance, and for this reason we at TheOnlineInvestor.com find value to putting together these looks at comparative market capitalization daily.According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, SGEN and PDCO collectively make up 1.45% of the First Trust Health Care AlphaDEX Fund ETF (  ) which is up by about 0.6% on the day Friday.At the closing bell, SGEN is off about 0.8%, while PDCO is down about 0.4% on the day Friday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Seattle Genetics Larger Than S&P 500 Component Patterson Companies@2014-05-23@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/seattle-genetics-larger-sp-500-component-patterson-companies-2014-05-23

The company intends to employ a collaborative research and development model and create strategic partnerships to drive innovation.In addition to an upfront payment, Mersana will receive milestone payments and royalties on worldwide net sales of the products.The agreement should be beneficial for Merck KGaA since the company will be able to expand its oncology portfolio. With this deal, Merck KGaA's cancer immunotherapy portfolio, which consists of both early-stage and late-stage candidates, will be strengthened.Currently, Merck KGaA is focusing on its immuno-oncology portfolio and has inked quite a few deals to boost its pipeline in this disease area. Earlier this month, the company entered into an agreement with MorphoSys AG for the discovery and development of therapeutic antibodies against undisclosed immune checkpoints.The use of ADCs is becoming an important method of treatment that allows selective administration of highly cytotoxic agents to the tumor cells thereby sparing normal tissue.

The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 69%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

 (  ) recently announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted its supplemental biologics license application (sBLA) seeking approval of Adcetris (brentuximab vedotin) for an additional indication. The company is looking to get Adcetris approved for retreatment and extended duration of medication with the drug beyond 16 cycles in relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (sALCL).We remind investors that Seattle Genetics submitted the sBLA to the FDA in Mar 2013 on the basis of encouraging data from a phase II study. The study had two treatment arms. One arm evaluated retreatment with Adcetris in patients who had responded to Adcetris treatment earlier, then discontinued treatment and as a result suffered disease progression or relapse. The other arm evaluated prolonged treatment with Adcetris beyond 16 cycles of medication. 70% of patients retreated with Adcetris and 88% of patients with extended treatment with Adcetris achieved an objective response. In both the settings, Adcetris was well tolerated. A final decision from the FDA is expected by Sep 14, 2013 (action date).We note that Adcetris was approved by the FDA in Aug 2011 for the treatment of patients with HL after failure of autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) or after failure of at least two prior multi-agent chemotherapy regimens in patients who are not suitable for ASCT. Adcetris was also approved for sALCL in treatment-experienced patients.We are positive on Seattle Genetics' efforts to expand Adcetris' label. Successful label expansion should boost the sales potential of the drug. Adcetris' net product revenue in the first quarter of 2013 was $33.9 million. Adcetris is also being evaluated in other indications.Seattle Genetics carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Right now,  (  ) and  (  ) look more attractive with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

 (  ) recently commenced a phase I/II study to evaluate Adcetris in combination with  's (  ) Treanda (bendamustine) for Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) patients after first relapse.The single-arm, open-label study is divided into two cohorts. The phase I cohort's primary endpoint is to find the recommended dosing level of Treanda in combination with Adcetris and evaluate the safety and tolerability of this combination.The complete remission rate will be assessed as the primary endpoint of the phase II cohort. Secondary endpoints include best response, duration of response and progression-free survival.After receiving Adcetris plus Treanda patients will have an option to suspend the therapy and undergo an autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) following which treatment with single-agent Adcetris will be resumed.Seattle Genetics also announced that Adcetris data on first line salvage therapy in relapsed/refractory HL was presented recently. In this study, 85.7% of the patients showed an objective response rate.In May 2013, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted a supplemental biologics license application (sBLA) for Adcetris for retreatment and extended duration of medication with the drug beyond 16 cycles in relapsed HL and systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (sALCL).We note that Adcetris was approved by the FDA in Aug 2011 for the treatment of patients with HL after failure of ASCT or after failure of at least two prior multi-agent chemotherapy regimens in patients who are not suitable for ASCT.

 (  ) recently presented data from studies conducted on Adcetris. Data was presented at the 12 th International Conference on Malignant Lymphoma (ICML).Seattle Genetics is conducting an investigator-sponsored phase II study in patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) to examine whether Adcetris can replace the combination chemotherapy regimen (ifosfamide, carboplatin and etoposide - ICE) or be used in sequential administration with ICE to increase the rate of pre-transplant FDG-PET normalization (PET-N). Out of 33 patients that completed this program, 26 patients achieved complete remission.Seattle Genetics is conducting a phase II study which is evaluating Adcetris in CD30-positive non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Out of 22 patients whose response could be evaluated, 6 experienced complete remission and 2 partial remissions.Seattle Genetics had presented encouraging phase I data on Adcetris in mature T-cell lymphoma (MTCL) patients at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) annual meeting in Dec 2012. The study showed 100% objective response rate, which includes 88% complete remissions.Currently, a global phase III study (ECHELON-2) is ongoing. Adcetris plus chemotherapy is being evaluated for the front-line treatment of CD30-positive MTCL including patients with systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (sALCL) and other types of peripheral T-cell lymphomas. The randomized, double-blind, controlled study will enroll roughly 300 patients and will be conducted in North America, Europe and Asia.Seattle Genetics' Adcetris was approved by the FDA in Aug 2011 for the treatment of patients with HL after failure of ASCT or after failure of at least two prior multi-agent chemotherapy regimens in patients who are not suitable for ASCT.

Comparable Biotechnology companies Onyx Pharmaceuticals (), Seattle Genetics (), and Medivation () may not look the same as the SPDR Biotech ETF (), or even similar to each other, but they do have one thing in common - when these stocks gain, they gain big. PCYC is already up over +25% on the year, but it's short-term potential back to its early March highs is an additional +16% from its current price. The stock pulled back throughout March, based through the first few weeks of April, and is making what appears to be another bullish run currently. We wouldn't buy the stock if it fell below its 18-day moving average (.28 - just above our stop at .46), but it looks like a great opportunity at current prices. Just below its 50-day moving average, PCYC could be a quick way to net a double-digit gain on a short-term trade, especially given the way Biotech has been trending lately.At the current price (~.40) or on a pullback to the 10-day moving average (.72).Pharmacyclics, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing small-molecule drugs for the treatment of cancer and immune mediated diseases.

The study had two treatment arms. One arm evaluated retreatment with Adcetris in patients who had responded to Adcetris treatment earlier, then discontinued treatment and as a result suffered disease progression or relapse. The other arm evaluated prolonged treatment with Adcetris beyond 16 cycles of therapy.Adcetris was approved by the FDA in Aug 2011 for the treatment of patients with HL after failure of autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) or after failure of at least two prior multi-agent chemotherapy regimens in patients who are not suitable for ASCT. Adcetris was also approved for sALCL in treatment-experienced patients. In Oct 2012, Adcetris gained EU approval as well for the same indications.In Jan 2013, a global phase III study (ECHELON-2) was initiated on Adcetris. In this study, Adcetris plus chemotherapy will be evaluated for the front-line treatment of CD30-positive mature T-cell lymphoma (MTCL) including patients with sALCL and other types of peripheral T-cell lymphomas.In Feb 2013, Adcetris received approval under Health Canada's Notice of Compliance with conditions (NOC/c) for the treatment of relapsed or refractory HL and sALCL.We are positive on Seattle Genetics' efforts to expand Adcetris' label.

uring the last decade, companies have spent billions of dollars in research to find new ways of treating the deadly disease of cancer. The difficult part is that cancer can come in a variety of different forms and can affect different parts of the body. This can make finding effective treatments very challenging. However, there is one promising treatment program that may soon create a lot of hope among medical professionals. That program is called immunotherapy. is defined as the treatment of disease by inducing, enhancing, or suppressing an immune response. Cancer immunotherapy attempts to stimulate the immune system to reject and destroy tumors. Immunotherapy for cancer was first developed by the National Institute of Health USA.  , a team of researchers reported a low tumor regression rate of roughly 3% in 1205 patients with metastatic cancer who underwent different types of immunotherapy.Since that time, a lot of time and money has been spent attempting to take immunotherapy to the next level. Below are four companies which are on the verge of finding breakthrough treatments for aggressive forms of cancer. (  )Celldex Therapeutics is the first antibody-based combination immunotherapy company. Celldex has a pipeline of drug candidates in development for the treatment of cancer and other difficult-to-treat diseases based on its antibody-focused Precision Targeted Immunotherapy Platform. The PTI Platform is a complementary portfolio of monoclonal antibodies, antibody-targeted vaccines and immunomodulators used in optimal combinations to create novel disease-specific drug candidates.During the past six months, Celldex shares have rallied by more than 125%. Most of this run can be attributed to the hype surrounding  , a drug candidate that is a potential breakthrough treatment for breast cancer. CDX-011 is an antibody drug conjugate that was licensed from  (  ). The antibody conjugate works by connecting with cancer cells that contain a protein called glycoprotein NMB (GPNMB for short). GPNMB has been shown to express itself in some of the most aggressive forms of breast cancer. Once the antibody is connected to the protein, CDX-011 releases a toxic chemotherapy payload.In December of last year, Celldex released extremely  from a mid-stage trial of CDX-011. Celldex announced that the trial had demonstrated delayed tumor growth and had prolonged survival in patients with advanced and aggressive forms of breast cancer when compared to those only using the standard chemotherapy. Patients treated with CDX-011 had a median survival rate of 12.5 months compared to just 5.4 months for patients in the control arm.Analysts are expecting potential sales of  if the drug is approved. On that amount of revenue, Celldex could generate $1.60 per share. A conservative P/E ratio of 20 would yield a share price of $32.00. (OTCMKTS:ONCS)OncoSec is an early stage biotechnology company focused on developing and commercializing treatments for advanced forms of skin cancer.The company is primarily focused on three types of difficult to treat skin cancers:OncoSec has developed a proprietary process known as electroporation, which uses an electrical pulse to create temporary pores in cancer cells. Clinically proven chemotherapeutics or gene-based cytokines are then delivered through these pores, allowing for more effective treatment at significantly lower doses. The company's technology development now includes the design and manufacture of medical-grade electrical pulse generators, treatment applications, and software that maximize safety and efficacy for different clinical applications.The company has  for killing cancer:In addition to having  , OncoSec just recently announced that it has signed a  (SRA) with Old Dominion University and the Frank Reidy Research Center for Bioelectrics. Under the agreement, OncoSec and Old Dominion will collaborate on nonclinical research focused on developing new technology related to the electroporation and delivery of different agents into solid tumors by electroporation. The first research experiment under this SRA will evaluate the effects of ImmunoPulse in combination with Anti-CTLA4, Anti-PD1 and Anti-PDL-1 in a melanoma mouse model. The study is expected to begin this month.In a much smaller niche within the immunotherapy field, there are two small-cap companies fighting to offer a breakthrough treatment for brain cancer. Those two companies are  (  ) and  (NYSEMKT:IMUC).ImmunoCellular Therapeutics is an early stage biotechnology company focused on developing and commercializing new therapeutics to fight cancer using the immune system. The flagship product for ImmunoCellular is ICT-107. ICT-107 is a vaccine used in the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). It is in currently being evaluated in a Phase II trial after successfully completing a  . The Phase I trial demonstrated prolonged survival with relatively low toxicity. The company expects to update investors on the Phase II trial's progress by the end of 2013.Much like ImmunoCellular, Northwest Biotherapeutics is focused on developing cancer therapies that utilize its capability in the biology of dendritic cells, which are a type of white blood cells that activate the immune system. The company has two ongoing trials, one of which is for DCVax-L. This product is currently in a  and will also be used to treat glioblastoma multiforme. The trial is expected to enroll approximately 300 patients that are newly diagnosed and require treatment with surgery, radiation and concurrent chemotherapy.Immunotherapy is an extremely promising niche within the biotechnology field but it is still extremely speculative.

"f you're a regular StreetAuthority reader, then you may have heard of the ""Dividend Decade."" If you haven't, then it's a prediction that in the next 10 years, the broadermarket will be absolutely flat . Instead, dividends will account for  of the market's total return.This means companies that steadily raise dividends will outperform the overall market in the next decade. And one of my favoritestocks that could benefit from this trend just went through a major change, making it an even sweeter deal.Health care giant  celebrated the New Year by splitting itself in two. The legacy pharmaceutical business, which was renamed  ,will focus on breakthrough drug therapies. The company's diagnostic tests, medical devices, nutritional products and branded generic pharmaceutical operations were combined into a second business that retains the Abbott name. Abbott structured the breakup as a tax-free distribution to shareholders, with investors receiving one Abbvie share for every Abbott share they held.Abbott made a brilliant move by spinning off its pharmaceutical business. Humira, its top-selling drug, accounts for more than half this segment's business, and itspatent expires in 2017. Spinning off this segment frees the rest of the company from its risks. StreetAuthority Co-Founder Paul Tracy has even identified it as one of the  .Abbvie will pay a rich $1.60 annualdividend , which at the current $35 share price, provides a hefty 4.6%yield . Equally important, Abbvie is already showing many of the characteristics of a high-quality dividendstock . Abbvie generates plenty ofearnings andcash flow , has a cash-richbalance sheet and a hugely valuableasset in its blockbuster drug Humira.The top-selling drug is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, Crohn's disease and other common auto-immune disorders. Sales of the drug have doubled in the past four years. Humira is expected to earn $10 billion inrevenue this year and accounts for roughly half of Abbvie's total sales.There is risk associated with Abbvie's loss ofpatent protection on Humira three years from now, but analysts don't anticipate sales will decline for several reasons. First, Humira belongs to a class of drugs (biologics) that is extremely difficult to manufacture. This will likely limit competition from generics. Second, because of Humira's proven track record and dominant share in themarket for rheumatoid arthritis drugs, physicians will probably continue to utilize Humira as a first-line treatment even after generic versions are launched. Third, overall sales of auto-immune drugs are projected to grow 6% a year to reach about $48 billion by 2015. Humira has already been approved as a treatment for nine different illnesses and Abbvie has four more indications in late-stage clinical trials that should help drive future sales growth. For these reasons, analysts say Humira sales will likely continue to rise and peak at more than $12 billion by 2017.    Abbvie also owns other category winners. These include a leading
testosterone replacement therapy drug, a hormonal therapy for
thyroid disease and two of the top-selling antiviral medicines for
HIV.Abbvie also owns other category winners. These include a leading testosterone replacement therapy drug, a hormonal therapy for thyroid disease and two of the top-selling antiviral medicines for HIV.Of course, when all is said and done, any pharmaceutical company is only as good as its drug discovery pipeline. But AbbVie has made impressive progress in recent years through internal drug development, and licensing and collaboration deals. The company is considered second only to  in the strength of its hepatitis C drug franchise. Both companies are developing new oral treatments for hepatitis C, a deadly disorder that infects 180 million individuals worldwide.Beginning in 2015, Abbvie expects to begin launching four major new drugs in rapid succession, each of which is estimated to be worth $4 to $6 billion in peak sales. In all, the company has a total of 20 new drugs in mid- to late-stage development.In addition to a flourishing new-drug pipeline, Abbvie has a global footprint that few new-drug companies can match. The company has commercial operations worldwide and sales in more than 150 countries. Abbvie plans toleverage this global presence in the next several years and is targeting nearly $1 billion in new sales from developing markets.Thestock split happened in early January, so Abbvie won't be reporting sales and earnings as a stand-alone company until the first quarter is completed. However, the past performance of Abbott's proprietary pharmaceuticals business provides a framework for what Abbvie investors can expect. During the first nine months of 2012, sales of proprietary pharmaceuticals improved 7% to $12.9 billion, fueled by a 29% jump in Androgel sales and a 19% increase in Humira sales.Operating income for this business rose 13% to $5.6 billion andprofit margins were generous even by pharmaceutical industry standards at 43%. Analysts predict Abbvie will likely generate sales of $18 billion next year and 2013 earnings per share estimates range from $3.03 to $3.17.This stock has $7.2 billion ofcash and an investment-gradecredit rating . The company is also a cash machine that generates roughly $6 billion of cash flow a year, which will more than twice covers the $2.5 billion annual dividend payment. Management targets 50% payout of cash earnings for the dividend on an ongoing basis and is strongly committed to dividend growth.Old Abbott had a stellar track record, increasing dividends 40 years in a row, including a 6% dividend increase just prior to the breakup to an annualized rate of $2.16 a share. Abbott divided the dividend amount between the two companies when they split. As stated before, Abbvie plans to pay a $1.60 annual dividend currently yielding 4.6%, while Abbott will pay a 56-cent annual dividend that yields 0.9%.Risks to Consider:  By purchasing Abbvieshares now, investors can collect a 4.6% dividend while they wait for new drugs to launch beginning in 2015, which should fuel earnings growth as well as share price gains.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@"This Stock Could be Perfect for the ""Dividend Decade"""@2013-01-08@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/stock-could-be-perfect-dividend-decade-2013-01-08

()The biotech business is shrouded with uncertainty – from awaiting FDA decisions or the results of a clinical trial, or from determining whether the company can even capitalize on its latest scientific discovery – and this uncertainty is reflected in how quickly investors change their minds about biotech firms.Because of how easily day-to-day changes can affect stock prices, many investors consider this industry too difficult to track. We can therefore assume that qualified investors who brave the sector are keeping a very close watch on it.Interested to know what informed investors are thinking about a stock? One of the most telling indicators is net institutional purchases. Institutions, such as hedge funds and investment banks often invest hundreds of thousands of dollars or more at one time.Regular investors pay attention to what institutional investors do because if they are willing to handle such large amounts of money it is easy enough to assume that they know what they are doing — or at the very least know more than the average investor. This is why these investors are also sometimes referred to as “smart money.”If institutional investors start investing in a company, regular investors can assume that some of the most talented analysts and money managers expect the company’s share prices to increase over time.We ran a screen on the biotech industry for stocks seeing the most significant net buying from institutional investors in the current quarter, indicating they believe there is more upside to these names.“Smart money” investors are feeling bullish about these biotech companies – do you agree with their optimism?1.  of all companies mentioned2.  mentioned below3.  mentioned Amyris, Inc., an integrated renewable products company, offers renewable compounds for a variety of markets.

Analyst ratings are a great way to gauge what the market currently thinks about a stock’s outlook – if you’re considering the stock for purchase, knowing whether you’re going with or against other investors is an important starting point.But this starting point can be improved. Groups of analysts whose ratings have historically predicted stock movements are theoretically more likely to predict future movements. Looking for these “predictive analysts,” we compiled analyst ratings from Reuters to find groups of analysts that have rightfully predicted stock market movements over the last three months.Beginning with companies that have seen significant net insider buying over the last six months, we screened these stocks for those being followed by groups of predictive analysts.From Reuters ratings presented on a linear scale (with 1 = “Strong Buy” and 5 = “Strong Sell”), we sliced the data of stocks seeing significant net buying from insiders into three monthly time periods, and identified the groups of analysts that have shown predictive value over two consecutive time periods.We further narrowed down the list by only focusing on those stocks that have seen bullish trends in recent analyst opinion.Although past performance is no guarantee of future results, the recent accuracy of these analyst ratings suggests their opinions may be a helpful starting-off point for your own analysis.Insiders are buying these stocks while predictive analysts expect them to outperform – do you think these stocks are in a strong position to move higher?1.  of all companies mentioned2.  mentioned below3.  mentionedList sorted by net insider purchases as a percent of share float.

")In case you didn't know it yet: the US is now officially in a bear market! Sure, this isn't very cheerful news, but the technical definition lays to rest the ongoing ""are we or aren't we"" debate.The S&P 500 index was down 19.8% on Monday October 3rd from its recent highs. After a sharp drop of 0.82% on Tuesday's opening, the decline exceeded the 20% that technically defines a bear market. Now what?The official drop to a bear market does not mean it is time to panic. According to Matt Koppenheffer at , some historical perspective should help the nerves: ""The last time we were talking about a bear market was just last summer. We didn't hit the ""official"" level, but between April and July the S&P shed 16%. The rally that followed added 34% back to the S&P index. Even at today's intraday low, the index is still 5% above the summer of 2010 low.""What's more, although ""today's macroeconomic forecasts sound positively frightful,"" it's worth reminding that forecasters are humans, and therefore fallible no matter their combined brain power. That's because experience between market downturns are fundamentally dissimilar. Conventional wisdom and historical evidence can prove downright worthless when the variables aren't identical.However, this silver lining does not help investors watching their savings gradually disintegrate. So, how can you prepare yourself for more market losses?For ideas we went back in time, and identified a list of stocks that outperformed the market during each of the last three big market downturns over the last decade (between 10/01/2007 - 03/02/2009, 04/19/2010 - 06/28/2010, and 07/18/2011 to the present day).For each stock we'll list the alpha, i.e. outperformance, relative to the S&P 500 index, a benchmark for our analysis.In addition, all of these stocks have seen significant insider buying over the last six months.Considering the track record of these companies during downturns, and the bullish sentiment expressed by insider executives, are these companies worth a closer look?Use this list as a starting point for your own analysis.1.  of all companies mentioned2.  mentioned below3.  mentioned Ultralife Corporation offers products and services ranging from portable and standby power solutions to communications and electronics systems.

()Last Wednesday’s euro zone discussion was hailed by the world as an agreement among EU leaders to contain the region’s debt crisis. Naturally, this bit of good news countered the market’s oversold pessimism and left the global markets to experience a long-awaited rally.European governments agreed to leverage 440 billion euros in a rescue plan, but the details remain unclear. In fact the details are so unclear that many skeptics suggest the funds may not be sufficient, and the hope of a swift resolution that led world markets to rally may be based on false assumptions. They suggest the  away as quickly as they have in the past.But there are a number of analysts in the bullish camp who say investors have been overly negative and it is very possible the rally could correct the markets to a more reasonable level of pessimism.Greg Budy of Sydney based financial advisory firm AIMS Finance is one such optimist. In a conversation with on Monday he says, “what we see now is a manageable restructure of Greek finances, the U.S. although not racing ahead, growing about two and a half percent and… China [is] by no means [facing] a hard landing… Overall, I think we’ve passed the darkest part of the storm, there’s a light at the end of the proverbial tunnel, and I’m actually quite optimistic about 2012.”Furthermore, bullish analysts like Sailesh Jha, Head of Asia Market Strategy at SEB Bank Singapore believe “markets have underestimated growth in the U.S. economy.” She tells CNBC “the data is panning out to the idea that the fourth quarter in terms of GDP in the United States should probably be stronger than what we saw in the third quarter, pretty much led by consumer and investment spending, which was evident in the third quarter data release.”So, if the dark days are indeed over, where should you start looking for your next investing idea?One place to start is by looking at the companies that have already proven to be winners during the recent downturn.To create this list, we started with a universe of about 200 stocks that are close to their highest point over the last 52 weeks.From this list, we collected data on insider buying, and identified the names that have seen significant buying from company insiders during the current quarter.Insiders think there’s more upside to these rallying stocks.

Getting FDA approval for a new drug is not always the end of the road, especially for biotech firms that have chosen not to sell their marketing rights to larger pharmaceutical companies. When small biotech firms maintain ownership of their new product launches, their ability to successfully market and sell the drug is put to the test.Investors now wait and watch as Seattle Genetics () faces this same hurdle.Late last week the FDA gave marketing approval for Seattle Genetics’ Hodgkin lymphoma drug Adcetris, the company’s first commercialized drug and the first new drug for the disease in over 30 years. The 14-year-old company had run up a deficit of more than $546 million during development, according to .Seattle Genetics has U.S. and Canadian commercialization rights for Adcetris, meaning that sales, marketing, and pricing lie on their shoulders.After the recent share-price slashing that Dendreon Corp. () had endured for not meeting their initial sales expectations with Provenge, investors are concerned that Seattle Genetics may meet the same fate. Dendreon shares fell 67% on August 4 after pulling their 2011 revenue estimate of $350-400 million.Dendreon’s CEO Mitchell Gold told  the main stumbling block had been lack of knowledge about insurance coverage, with Medicare and Medicaid’s coverage of Provenge impacting physician adoption.“You have to develop a drug, and then you have to be able to launch a drug, and those are not necessarily connected,” Mark Monane analyst at Needham & Co. said in an interview with  before the FDA approved Adcetris. “If you’re good at development, it doesn’t give you a get-out-of-jail-free card.”Jason Kantor, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets told Bloomberg, “there is a general concern about owning any company into a drug launch, and the recent blowup of Dendreon does not help…general concerns relate to reimbursement, uptake, execution and expectations.”No longer is it enough for biotechnology companies to spend years and millions of dollars developing experimental drugs, gathering data to show their medicines can help patients with acceptable levels of side effects. Investors want to know if the drug will be reimbursed by insurance companies, how many patients will benefit from it and which doctors will prescribe it, Monane told Bloomberg.Do you think that Seattle Genetics will successfully launch Adcetris?

"Next month [November] marks Pancreatic Cancer Awareness Month. Visibility for the disease is already on the rise due to recent celebrity victims, including Apple's Steve Jobs and Hollywood actor Patrick Swayze.According to the  , pancreatic cancer is a devastating disease with the worst mortality rate and an overall 5-year survival rate lower than 5%. Although accounting for only 3% of all cancers, this disease is the fourth leading cause of death and represents 6% of all cancer related deaths in the United States.The disease remains one of the most difficult to treat due to late initial diagnosis and extreme resistance to treatment. For example, about 50% of patients have locally advanced disease at the time of diagnosis, indicating that the cancer has grown beyond the confines of the pancreas to invade surrounding vital structures, and in 40% of patients the tumor has spread to distant sites, such as the liver and lungs [metastatic stage]. Case in point: Patrick Swayze was diagnosed with stage IV pancreatic cancer that had already spread to the liver in March 2008 and lost his battle with the disease in September 2009 at the age of 57.The majority of pancreatic tumors [95%] are adenocarcinomas that mainly develop from exocrine cells in the tissues of the pancreas. They are characterized by an aggressive behavior with a fast progression rate that makes them highly metastatic. Neuroendocrine tumors [NET] of the pancreas [islet cell tumors] are much less common [1-2%] than exocrine pancreatic tumors and are considered less deadly. For example, Steve Jobs, co-founder and chief executive of Apple Inc. (  ), was diagnosed with this rare, slow-growing pancreatic tumor in 2004.In terms of treatment, surgical removal of the tumor represents the best option for pancreatic cancer patients without invasion into surrounding organs or distant metastasis. Unfortunately, only 15-20% of all patients are candidates for potentially curative surgery. Depending on the tumor localization, pancreaticoduodenectomy, distal or total pancreatectomy can be performed. However, even with an optimal curative surgery, metastases often occur. Median survival time without evidence of recurrent disease is 21.2 months after resection.For locally advanced or metastatic disease, treatment is still palliative rather than curative, and chemotherapy remains the only option. Since its approval in 1997, Eli Lilly's (  ) Gemzar® [gemcitabine] is the current standard first-line treatment in the U.S. It has been shown to improve the median time to disease progression and overall survival [OS].Just like lupus, sepsis, and several others, pancreatic cancer has been referenced as one of those challenging diseases where good drugs [and companies…] go to die. Since 2005, nine late-stage clinical trials have been performed to improve the efficacy of gemcitabine with little success in terms of improving survival outcomes [see Table 1]. Such failures resulted in at least two companies filing for bankruptcy [both Aphton Corp and Therion Biologics in 2006]. In fact, the only combination approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration [FDA] is gemcitabine plus Astellas Pharma's Tarceva® [erlotinib], which increased the median OS from 6.0 to 6.4 months.
  
Despite past failures, drug developers continue to explore new options for treating pancreatic cancer and more than a dozen new molecular entities are currently being evaluated in clinical trials [see Table 2]. Several programs have recently demonstrated impressive results in Phase 2 studies and are now enrolling patients in pivotal trials. While a comprehensive review of investigational pancreatic cancer therapies is beyond the scope of this article, we briefly review some of the more promising pancreatic treatments currently in clinical development:Historically known more for its franchise in treating blood cancers, Celgene moved into the realm of solid tumors through its recent acquisition of Abraxis BioScience, Inc. As a result, Celgene is now developing Abraxane® [paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension] for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Updated overall survival findings from a phase I/II study of Abraxane given in combination with gemcitabine demonstrated increased survival of the first-line treatment of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.In 44 patients treated at the recommended dose of 125 mg/m2 Abraxane plus gemcitabine [1000 mg/m2], the median OS time was 12.2 months, an impressive doubling of survival compared to historical control of gemcitabine administered alone. The findings were discussed at the 101st Annual Meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research [AACR] in 2010. The combination of Abraxane and gemcitabine is now the treatment arm of a randomized Phase 3 clinical trial that is currently enrolling patients [ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00844649].In June 2010, at the 12th World Congress on Gastrointestinal Cancer, Novartis reported that its RADIANT-3 Phase 3 study of Afinitor® (everolimus), plus best supportive care met its primary endpoint, showing that the drug more than doubled median progression-free survival [PFS], or time without tumor growth, from 4.6 to 11.0 months when compared with placebo in patients with advanced pancreatic NET.More recently, Novartis presented data from a second Phase 3 study called RADIANT-2 at the 35th European Society for Medical Oncology [ESMO] Congress. The study, which evaluated Afinitor® in combination with Sandostatin® LAR Depot (octreotide acetate for injectable suspension), demonstrated that everolimus plus octreotide LAR provided a clinically meaningful extension in the median time without tumor growth from 11.3 to 16.4 months when compared with placebo plus octreotide LAR. However, the study did not meet its primary endpoint of PFS based on central radiologic review of the data (p=0.026 versus p=0.024 predefined). According to the company, results from the two RADIANT trials will form the basis for regulatory filings later in 2010.Amgen is developing AMG 479, an investigational fully human monoclonal antibody that targets type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor [IGF-1R], which plays an important role in the regulation of cell growth and survival. At the 2010 American Society of Clinical Oncology [ASCO] Annual Meeting, Amgen announced results from a Phase 2 study demonstrating that the addition of AMG 479 to gemcitabine resulted in an overall survival rate at six months of 57% versus 50% with gemcitabine alone and 39% versus 23% at 12 months. Median overall survival was 8.7 months versus 5.9 months in the gemcitabine arm. AMG 479 is moving into a Phase 3 study for metastatic pancreatic cancer.At the 2010 ASCO Annual Meeting, Threshold Pharmaceuticals presented results with its hypoxia-activated prodrug, TH-302, in combination with gemcitabine in thirty-four patients with advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer that had at least one evaluable post-treatment tumor assessment. One patient [3%] demonstrated a complete response as measured by RECIST [Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors] and 8 patients [24%] had a partial response. Of the 34 assessed patients, 28 had elevated carbohydrate antigen CA19-9 levels at baseline and 17 of 28 [61%] had a CA19-9 reduction of greater than 50%. This is important, as a greater than 20% decrease in levels of this tumor-associated antigen has been shown to correlate with improved overall survival. The biomarker CA19-9 has been shown to be highly specific and sensitive for pancreatic cancer and approximately three-quarters of all pancreatic cancer patients have elevated baseline serum CA19-9 level at baseline.Neogenix Oncology is develping ensituximab, a novel, chimeric monoclonal antibody intended for the treatment of advanced pancreatic and colorectal cancer. Pre-clinical studies have demonstrated that NPC-1C specifically targets pancreatic and colorectal cancer sparing healthy tissue. In 2010, the company initiated a multi-center Phase 1 trial in patients with late stage pancreatic or colorectal cancer being conducted at Johns Hopkins University Hospital, Duke University Medical Center, and North Shore University Hospital. Neogenix is also exploring the diagnostic and prognostic utility of ensituximab using a new serum ELISA test in a prospective study. Preliminary results demonstrate that the biomarker test can differentiate between blood serum of healthy donors and that of patients with colorectal or pancreatic cancer. In addition, the results of the biomarker test indicate superior sensitivity as compared to commercially available CEA and CA19-9 assays.
  
* Based on ClinicalTrials.govIn contrast to the prominent late-stage failures over the past five years, several drugs have recently shown promise for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Going forward, early detection using biomarkers, more effective treatments, and novel drug targets could provide new hope for the treatment of this deadly disease.

"For exchange-traded fund investors, there is virtually no other place in the equity markets where the benefits of diversification are more apparent than in the notoriously volatile biotechnology sector of health care.One drug's odds of success typically have no bearing on another drug's likelihood of succeeding, and investors can think of an ETF as a portfolio of bimodal options. Many publicly traded biotechs are early-stage players with no drug on the market yet. A small subset of those firms will develop therapies that prove safe and effective and eventually come to market, often resulting in explosive success for those firms and instant economic moats, or competitive advantages. The vast majority of biotech companies, however, will fail to meet clinical hurdles for their drugs in development and fall by the wayside.Right now, plenty of investor attention is focused on the biotech space for a different reason: potential merger-and-acquisition activity. It's widely believed that large pharmaceutical firms will continue to be major acquirers of biotech firms in the coming months, as Big Pharma sees massive upcoming patent losses and relatively poor research and development productivity (and little further opportunity to consolidate among one another). So, Big Pharma has been looking at absorbing large and small biotech firms alike. Already, we have seen Roche (  ) acquire Genentech and Sanofi (  ) gobble up Genzyme; and Morningstar equity analysts see several other biotechs as likely takeout targets, including Biogen Idec (  ), Seattle Genetics (  ), Actelion, Exelixis, and BioMarin (  ).From a fundamental perspective, in 2010, large-cap biotechs suffered from some pricing pressure (owing to U.S. health-care reform and European austerity measures), and an industry tax should erode earnings by 1% to 2% in 2011. Looking ahead, we see something of a ""return to normal"" for the entire biotech industry in the very near future. Morningstar equity analysts see stabilization next year, after a tough 2010 and the annualization of some measures in 2011.Even so, the entire biotech space has done extremely well, relative to the broader market. For ETF investors, the biotech industry has been the place to be for capital appreciation in recent years, with all biotech ETFs significantly outperforming the S&P 500 over the last five years.We think there is plenty of rapid growth ahead in the biotech sector. There are several drugs for diseases with high unmet patient need and favorable demographic trends that are approaching the market, including for diabetes, hepatitis C, and cancer.Currently, investors can choose from among five biotech ETFs. There are meaningful differences in portfolio construction and performance among the five, and we would suggest that investors study the funds closely before investing. Below we highlight the five funds and then make our recommendation.Far and away the biggest and most liquid of the biotech ETFs, IBB holds more than 125 biotech firms listed on the Nasdaq with market caps of at least $200 million. It follows a cap-weighted index, meaning that close to half of its assets are invested in its top-10 holdings. Morningstar analysts believe this ETF is close to fully valued, trading at 99% of its fair value. The fund charges a 0.48% expense ratio. This is the second best-performing biotech ETF over the last five years (rising an impressive 44%). The fund also has posted generally smoother recent performance than some of its biotech peers.The second-largest and second-most liquid biotech ETF, XBI offers much higher-beta exposure because it tracks an equal-weight index of 43 biotech firms. As a result, it provides much more exposure to small- and mid-cap stocks than a cap-weighted fund like IBB. XBI, whose index recently expanded, also owns only a handful of established biotech companies. Nearly half of its holdings are early-stage players with no drug on the market yet and that therefore are devoid of profitability. The smaller firms and their decidedly uncertain prospects but explosive upside potential definitely loom larger and have a meaningful sway on the portfolio. The fund has done well over the last few years, rising almost 60% in that time period (and topping all but one of its biotech ETF peers), compared with the S&P 500's anemic rise of just 2.4%. XBI significantly underperformed in 2009 (when it was basically flat, compared with the S&P 500's 23.5% increase), but has had good performance in other years. One nice attribute for investors is the fund's 0.35% expense ratio--the lowest of all traditional biotech ETFs. Because Morningstar equity analysts follow just half of the assets in this ETF, we are not able to provide a fair value for it.Like XBI, this is an equal-weight ETF, meaning that upstarts sit shoulder-to-shoulder with established players like Biogen Idec, Amgen (AMGN), and Celgene (CELG). This fund also is the second-most concentrated biotech ETF, holding just 20 biotech firms. With a 0.60% expense ratio, FBT is one of the most expensive biotech ETFs, and it's easy to question the potential upside for investors at these levels, given that the fund trades at 99% of its fair value. At the same time, this has been the best-performing biotech ETF by far over the last five years, rising an explosive 113%. That includes a 45% gain in 2009 and a 37% increase in 2010.Although this quirky fund trades on an exchange, it does not track an index, unlike traditional ETFs. And holdings are static, reflecting solely the selections that its parent, a Bank of America Merrill Lynch subsidiary, made at launch. As a result, this is a highly concentrated (just 12 names) fund that devotes more than 85% of assets into just three large biotechs: Amgen, Gilead Sciences (GILD), and Biogen Idec. Amgen alone makes up more almost 36% of the fund. We like the cost structure of a HOLDRS fund--they charge annual custody fees of $0.08 per HOLDR share, which converts to an expense ratio of anywhere from 0.02% to 0.05%. Like its peers, BBH has outperformed the broader market significantly over the last five years; however, it has significantly underperformed competing biotech ETFs during that same interval. We would attribute that to its heavy concentration in larger names; investors in this fund see less volatility but also are deprived of the potential for explosive gains from individual portfolio companies that enjoy drug approval. BBH also trades at a slightly less expensive valuation than the other biotech funds that Morningstar values. Currently, it trades at 92% of fair value.Like XBI, this is an equal-weight ETF with a higher exposure to small- and mid-cap biotechs, many of which are early-stage players with no drug on the market yet. In addition, this ETF tracks a dynamic (as in, changing often) benchmark that selects and ranks biotech stocks based on capital appreciation. The index is governed by a quantitative-active model that aims to surpass the returns of traditional indexes by investing in stocks that display favorable fundamental growth, attractive valuations, and momentum traits. This ETF charges a 0.63% expense ratio, which is higher than several competing ETFs, but eminently reasonable for a fund that can outperform its rivals. This fund has done well over the last five years (up 36%) and in the last few years in particular (up 31% last year alone, versus a 13% increase for the S&P 500). Unfortunately, Morningstar does not cover enough of the assets in this ETF to be able to provide an estimate of its fair value.In looking closely at the five funds, we would encourage investors to focus on cost, portfolio construction and risk, recent performance, and if available, valuation. Right out of the gate, we would dismiss the HOLDRS and PowerShares offerings. We like the BBH's price tag and its current valuation, but it has posted pretty weak performance relative to the other funds over the last few years, and we don't think the biotech space is the place to be for such heavy portfolio concentration. PBE charges a high price tag, and investors should expect to receive superior performance for that cost. In recent years, they haven't--at least, not relative to peer ETFs.We also would dismiss the iShares fund. We like its liquidity and its portfolio diversity, but it has a higher price tag and a fairly rich valuation, and its five-year performance is below that of two of its other peers.That leaves the SPDR and the First Trust offering. For more conservative investors, we would recommend the SPDR (XBI), given its low beta relative to its peers, its very strong recent performance, its low price tag, and its portfolio diversity. For a more risk-seeking investor, we would recommend [[FBT]], which has posted incredibly impressive performance over the last few years. FBT is a perfect example of a higher-priced fund that thus far has earned its fee. At the same time, we worry about the concentration in FBT, which holds just 20 firms, and the fund's currently fairly rich valuation, and we would urge investors to tread carefully with this ETF. Morningstar licenses its indexes to certain ETF and ETN providers, including Barclays Global Investors ((BGI)), First Trust, and ELEMENTS, for use in exchange-traded funds and notes. These ETFs and ETNs are not sponsored, issued, or sold by Morningstar. Morningstar does not make any representation regarding the advisability of investing in ETFs or ETNs that are based on Morningstar indexes.See also  on seekingalpha.comThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Narrowing Down the List of Biotech ETFs to 2 We'd Recommend@2011-06-22@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/narrowing-down-list-biotech-etfs-2-wed-recommend-2011-06-22
Interested in rebound candidates? We are, which is why we created the list below of stocks with high short floats (sort squeeze candidates) and insider buying.Our reasoning is this: is a strategy to cash-in on a stock dropping in price: the short-seller borrows shares today, immediately sells them, and then buys them back at a future date (and hopefully at a lower price) to return them to the owner and keep the difference as profit. The number of shares shorted indicates how bullish or bearish those investors currently are on a company.When a stock becomes highly shorted amid deep pessimism, it can reach a sort of tipping point referred to as a  There are so many shares currently shorted that any bump up in price triggers a cascade in which short-sellers have to cover their positions by buying back the stock, which causes the stock to rally even further.One way to find short squeeze candidates is simply by looking at a company's . The short float of a company is the percentage of shares in a short position (being short sold by short sellers) as a percentage of the total amount of shares available on the market (). Short sellers make money when the share price of a stock falls. Therefore, if the short float is high, short sellers are really confident that the share price is going to fall.Because investors frequently pay attention to the behavior of short sellers, a high short float could make investors nervous about a stock, which might in turn cause the share price to fall (like a self-fulfilling prophecy). But as mentioned above, any increase in price could result in the opposite outcome.Among those names we wanted to find companies that have been experiencing insider buying over the past six months.Many analysts follow trends because, after all, insiders know more about their companies than anyone else. Their investment activity is closely monitored and can tell us a lot about where they feel the business is heading.Insider buying is represented as a percentage of the share float. Companies experiencing insider buying over the past six months provide an indicator that insiders think the stock is undervalued at current levels. Inversely, insider selling serves as a negative indicator.Insiders think these stocks are good short squeeze candidates, do you agree?1.  of all companies mentioned2.  mentioned below3.  mentioned Engages in processing, marketing, and distributing snack products, as well as culinary, in-shell, and ingredient nuts.

The 51st American Society of Hematology [ASH] Annual Meeting will take place December 5-8, 2009, at the Ernest N. Morial Convention Center in New Orleans, LA. This is the premier event for the hematology industry, attracting more than 20,000 hematologists and other health-care professionals.In this regard, Celgene Corporation (  ) recently announced that data from more than 200 clinical trials involving the company's products will be presented at the ASH annual meeting. After reaching a 52-week low of $36.90 in April 2009, shares of Celgene have rebounded nearly 50% to close at $54.97. As a result, investors may gravitate to other biotechnology companies specializing in the area of hematology to uncover similar investment opportunities.Accordingly, we recently reviewed press releases from a baker's dozen of public biotechnology companies also announcing upcoming clinical data presentations at ASH [as of November 27, 2009]. Further, to determine which topics are likely to generate significant visibility and investor interest, we tallied the number of abstracts accepted for each company, identified the product development stage(s), and consolidated the therapeutic classes into the following four general categories:See Table 1 below for the results from the 32 abstracts referenced in the press releases.Table 1. Baker's dozen of public biotechnology companies issuing press releases regarding clinical data presentations at ASHInhibitors of intracellular kinases have the potential to be synergistic with several classes of chemotherapeutic and immunotherapeutic agents. For example, different cancers have mutations on a few key kinases [such as PI3K], many of which lead to increased cellular growth, proliferation, angiogenesis, and survival. In addition, many kinases have elevated expression levels or increased activity with several cancers. Also, while antibodies may target one specific receptor, often multiple receptors are overactive in cancer cells; however, the different receptor signals may converge upon a central nodal signaling point making pharmacological intervention possible.Intracellular kinase inhibitors vary not only by their target [and isoform selectivity] but also by their inhibition mechanism. For example, some small molecule inhibitors are ATP analogs, catalytic domain inhibitors, non-catalytic domain inhibitors, or target ligand inhibitors. Some of the most studied intracellular kinases include PI3K, mTOR, AKT, SRC, JNK, and others.One of the major drug development problems to date is that inhibition of one pathway leads to upregulation of a parallel signaling pathway. It will be important for researchers to decipher the roles of redundant parallel pathways and feedback loops. Together, inhibition of the necessary intracellular signals needed for a cell to respond to external growth and survival factors have the potential to prevent further cancer growth.Due to significant interest in PI3K inhibitors, such as Keryx Biopharmaceuticals' perifosine, we have also listed two private companies presenting Phase I clinical data at ASH.Table 2. Kinase Inhibitor PresentationsTherapeutic applications of monoclonal antibodies [MAbs] are the most widely used form of immunotherapy for cancer at this time. Examples of MAb mechanisms include prevention of ligand-receptor interaction, antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity, complement mediated cytotoxicity, and immune modulation. Most MAbs target cellular receptors that are overexpressed or specific to certain cancers. New technology in MAbs has allowed for improved conjugations and increased penetration.In view of significant interest in the area of MAbs, we have also included a private company presenting preclinical data demonstrating proof-of-concept at ASH with an IND planned for Q1 2010.Table 3. Biologic Agent PresentationsAntimetabolites have well established anti-cancer profiles with actions on intermediary metabolism of proliferating cells. The mechanism of action of antimetabolites is through the inhibition of nucleotide and nucleic acid synthesis. Many of these drugs have delayed toxicity and are subject to drug resistance. Examples of approved therapies include methotrexate, 5-FU, and more recently Allos Therapeutics' Folotyn™ [pralatrexate injection].Nucleoside analogues are similar in mechanism to alkylating agents. Many nucleoside analogues kill cells by binding to DNA and forming strand breaks leading to an inhibition of DNA synthesis and function. Nucleoside analogues are associated with nephrotoxicity but have shown to be synergistic with other therapies such as vinblastine. Examples of approved nucleoside analogues include cisplatin and carboplatin.In terms of development candidates, Cyclacel recently reported topline survival data from a Phase II study of its oral nucleoside analog, sapacitabine, in elderly patients aged 70 or older with either newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia [AML] or AML in first relapse. The study was a three-arm, randomized trial evaluating three dosing schedules of sapacitabine. The primary endpoint of one-year survival was approximately 30% in two out of the three schedules tested and further details of the study will be presented at ASH.Histone deacetylase enzymes [HDACs] are a group of proteins that deacetylate lysine residues on core histones resulting in chromatin condensation and gene repression. In addition, HDACs have been shown to inhibit transcription factors and interact with other proteins including p53 and c-myc. There are three classes of HDACs each with unique domains and cellular expression profiles [and cancer expression profiles]. Thus, HDACs have a diverse and complex role in cellular activity. HDAC inhibitors have shown to induce apoptosis, while it is not clear if HDAC specific or pan-HDAC inhibitors, such as Pharmacyclics' PCI-24781, will have the best clinical outcome. An example of an FDA approved HDAC inhibitor is Merck & Co.'s (  ) Zolinza® [vorinostat].Table 3. Chemotherapeutic PresentationsIn 2003, Velcade® [bortezomib] by Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (  ), became the first proteasome inhibitor to be approved for use in the U.S. Bortezomib disrupts normal protein homeostasis by targeting the proteasome, the final enzyme in the proteolysis cycle that is critical for normal protein turnover and homeostasis. Proteasome inhibitors are linked with decreased NF-kappaB [NFkB] activity, which has been shown to be a central transcription factor involved with this disease. In addition to NFkB, proteasome inhibition has other antitumor activity such as p53 stabilization. Because the proteasome has been validated as a target for myeloma, other drugs, such as Onyx Pharmaceuticals' carfilzomib, are in development with novel features such as decreased toxicity and increased potency.In August 2009, Gentium S.p.A. (  ) announced top-line results from a Phase III trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 25 mg/kg/day of defibrotide, a deoxyribonucleic acid derivative derived from cow lung or porcine mucosa, for the treatment of severe veno-occlusive disease in hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients. The results did not reach the protocol-specified levels of significance for the primary and secondary endpoints at 100 days. The Company plans to present full results from the trial at ASH.Table 4.

EST. Also, a new report showed the US trade deficit is bigger than analysts had expected.Before the market open, a report showed the U.S. trade deficit widened more than expected, to $50.2 billion in May. It's the widest gap since Fall 2008. The June quarter earnings season got underway with results from materials staple Alcoa (  ), which met the Street's Q2 earnings estimates and beat on revenue.Overseas, euro-zone finance ministers said late Monday they were prepared to adopt further measures ""that will improve the euro area's systemic capacity to resist contagion risk,"" according to news reports. But officials stopped short of announcing any specific measures. Italy successfully sold 6.75 billion euros ($9.4 billion) of 12-month bills. Concern that Italy's chance of default is rising with expensive bond yields knocked back global stocks to start the week.In company news:Shares of Cisco Systems (  ) are higher after Bloomberg, citing two people familiar with the situation, reported the company could cut as many as 10,000 jobs, or about 14% of its workforce. About 7,000 jobs will be cut by the end of August. Another 3,000 people will take early retirement buyouts, the report said.Seattle Genetics (  ) is down after federal regulators said its drug brentuximab for Hodgkin's lymphoma and a less common type of the disease may require more data on benefits, according to Bloomberg.Shares of Deutsche Bank (  ) are down after Bloomberg reported that the German Bank and its MortgageIT unit are seeking dismissal of a $1 billion lawsuit by the U.S. government. The suit claims Deutsche Bank lied to qualify thousands of high-risk mortgages for the insurance by the Housing and Urban Development Department's Federal Housing Administration.Boston Scientific (  ) is up just over 1% in mid-morning trading after announcing today that it has completed patient enrollment in the ASTI post-market clinical follow-up study. The trial is designed to evaluate its Adapt Monorail Carotid Stent System in combination with its FilterWire EZ Embolic Protection System for treatment of carotid artery disease in patients at high risk for carotid surgery.Netflix (NFLX) is up slightly, at $291.60 after the company unveiled a new DVD-only subscription plan for $7.99 per month, targeted at customers who don't have access to broadband service. Previously, Netflix subscribers had to pay $9.99 for unlimited DVD rentals and subscription access, or $4.99 for just two DVDs per month. Analysts believe that focusing on its DVD business hedges the company's potential loss of streaming content, according to a report by Zack's.In other earnings news:--Novellus (NVLS) is down sharply after the company reported Q2 sales of $350.2 million, just below the analyst consensus of $352 million on Thomson Reuters.
