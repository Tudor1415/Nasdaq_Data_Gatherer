There are 8 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Cintas Corporation, but the average is just that — a mathematical average.  There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $157.00.  And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $282.00.  The standard deviation is $43.742.


But the whole reason to look at the average CTAS price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes.  And so with CTAS crossing above that average target price of $215.38/share, investors in CTAS have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $215.38 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?  Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Cintas Corporation:



The average rating presented in the last row of the above table above is from 1 to 5 where 1 is Strong Buy and 5 is Strong Sell.  This article used .  .

Shares of uniform specialist   rallied 28% in April according to data from . That was more than twice the 13% or so gain seen in the  during the month. However, when you pull back a little, Cintas was lower by roughly 18% through the first four months of the year versus a drop of just under 10% for the S&P 500. There's clearly more to understand.Demand for Cintas' products and services is economically sensitive. When businesses aren't doing well, they pull back on staffing and spending. That, in turn, reduces demand for Cintas. However, that trend has yet to fully show up in the company's numbers.Image source: Getty Images.Cintas reported fiscal third-quarter earnings in late March. The fiscal period ended in February and sales and earnings were actually pretty good. The top line increased 7.6% year over year, with earnings advancing 17.4%. The problem with these numbers is that they don't include the worldwide effort to slow the spread of , which effectively caused large sections of the global economy to shut down. Fears surrounding the impact of these efforts, which is likely to spur recessionary conditions, led to a deep market swoon in March. In April, investors switched gears and started to push everything higher again, with some of the most beaten-down names (like Cintas) rallying the most. Here's the problem: The recession that's likely on the way hasn't really started to hit company numbers just yet.   In fact, Cintas CEO Scott Farmer made an interesting statement when the company reported earnings in late March:A week ago, we were expecting today to raise revenue and EPS guidance based upon our fourth quarter outlook. However, much has changed in the past week as our country and others continue to respond to the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. Due to the uncertainty, including the severity and duration of the pandemic, we are not providing guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 at this time and withdrawing our full fiscal year guidance.That is not the type of thing you say when you expect the future to be bright.   Based on the words of Cintas' CEO,  themselves for what is likely to be a difficult period just ahead. Sure the market may have reversed course in April, but the business environment hasn't changed and, in fact, might have actually gotten worse. At this point, a weak fourth quarter seems likely, with more to come as Cintas' new fiscal year gets under way.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"Investors in Cintas Corporation (Symbol: CTAS) saw new options begin trading this week, for the July 17th expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CTAS options chain for the new July 17th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $220.00 strike price has a current bid of $13.80.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $220.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $206.20 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CTAS, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $226.50/share today.

Because the $220.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 60%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.27% return on the cash commitment, or 36.34% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.


Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Cintas Corporation, and highlighting in green where the $220.00 strike is located relative to that history:


   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $230.00 strike price has a current bid of $15.70.  If an investor was to purchase shares of CTAS stock at the current price level of $226.50/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $230.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 8.48% if the stock gets called away at the July 17th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CTAS shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Cintas Corporation, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing CTAS's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $230.00 strike highlighted in red:



   
Considering the fact that the $230.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 49%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.93% boost of extra return to the investor, or 40.16% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.


The implied volatility in the put contract example is 53%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 55%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $226.50) to be 50%.

"Image source: The Motley Fool. Q3 2020 , Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Cintas Quarterly Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Sir, please begin. -- Thank you and good evening. And thanks for joining us tonight.With me is Paul Adler, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our third quarter results for fiscal 2020.The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the Company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.Before discussing the financials, I want to say that our thoughts go out to all of those impacted by the COVID-19 coronavirus. This is a challenging time for all of us, and we can't thank enough our employees whom we call partners for doing all that they can to keep our customers' places of business clean, safe and ready for the workday. We currently find ourselves at the peak of uncertainty as it relates to the pandemic's impact on the economy. The response of our country in each state evolves daily.A week ago, we hadn't seen much impact to our business and we were expecting today to increase revenue and EPS guidance based on our year-to-date results and fourth quarter outlook. However, much has changed in a matter of days, and more changes are likely to come. Due to this uncertainty, including the severity and duration of the pandemic, we are not providing guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 at this time. We certainly remain focused, though, on the safety and well-being of our employee partners and the care of our customers.So let's move to providing our third quarter results and then we will open it up for questions. Our fiscal 2020 third quarter revenue was $1.81 billion, an increase of 7.6% over last year's third quarter. Earnings per diluted share or EPS from continuing operations were $2.16, an increase of 17.4% over last year's third quarter, adjusted for G&K integration expenses. Free cash flow for this year's third quarter was $300 million, an increase of 17.2%.The organic growth rate which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and differences in the number of workdays was 5.7% for the third quarter of fiscal '20. The organic growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment was 4.8%, and the organic growth rate for the First Aid and Safety Services operating segment was 12.5%.Gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal '20 of $824.4 million increased 9.2%. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 45.5% for the third quarter of fiscal '20 compared to 44.9% in the third quarter of fiscal '19.Operating income for the third quarter of fiscal '20 of $314.7 million increased 13.1%. Operating margin was 17.4% in the third quarter of fiscal '20 compared to 16.5% in fiscal '19.Net income from continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal '20 was $234.5 million, and reported earnings per diluted share were $2.16. Excluding the G&K acquisition integration expenses in fiscal '19, EPS increased 17.4%.In addition to the solid financial performance, we continue to generate strong cash flow and commit to effectively deploying cash to increase shareholder value. Third quarter free cash flow was $300 million, an increase of 17.2% compared to last year. In the third quarter of fiscal '20, we paid an annual dividend totaling $268 million. The dividend of $2.55 per share was an increase of 24.4% over last year's annual dividend. In addition to the annual dividend, we purchased $393.1 million of Cintas stock in fiscal '20 to date, including $200 million in March. The amount remaining under our buyback authorization is $1.1 billion.We ended our third quarter with fiscal year-to-date revenue growth of 7.2% and an organic growth rate of 7.1%. Operating income, excluding last year's G&K integration expenses, increased 14.7%. EPS, adjusted for last year's special items, increased 22.2%. And finally, free cash flow for the third quarter year-to-date increased 61%. Our employee partners have really done a great job this year.With that, I will turn the call over to Paul for additional details for our third quarter results. -- Thanks, Mike.We have two reportable operating segments: Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All Other consist of Fire Protection Services and our Uniform Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement.The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels, and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1.45 billion, an increase of 6.6%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate changes and the difference in number of workdays, the organic growth rate was 4.8%. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 45.8% for the third quarter compared to 44.9% in last year's third quarter, an improvement of 90 basis points. Gross margins have strengthened for many reasons, including strong revenue growth and realization of cost synergies from the acquisition of G&K.Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the third quarter was $170.5 million. The organic growth rate for this segment was 12.5%. The First Aid segment gross margin was 48% in the third quarter compared to 48.2% in last year's third quarter. The difference in gross margin was due to revenue mix in the quarter, which consists of service, product sales and training. The strong organic revenue growth benefited from more safety and personal protective equipment product sales, which generally have lower margins than the other revenue categories.Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. Our fire business continues to grow each year at a strong pace. The Uniform Direct Sale business growth rates are generally low single digits and are subject to volatility such as when we install a multi-million-dollar account. Uniform Direct Sale, however, is a key business for us and its customers are often significant opportunities to cross-sell and provide products and services from our other business units.All Other revenue was $192.1 million, an increase of 9.9%. The organic growth rate was 7.1%. The fire business organic growth rate was 4.1%. Fire revenue was weighed down by the loss of a struggling national account in the retail sector that recently disclosed a closing of over 100 stores, by mild winter weather that resulted in less sprinkler repair service revenue from freezing and bursting water pipes and by a decline in sales rep productivity through the Christmas and New Year's holidays.Uniform direct sale business organic growth rate was 11.1%, and benefited from additional sales from the rollout last quarter of Carhartt branded garments to a Fortune 100 customer. All Other gross margin was 41.3% for the third quarter of this fiscal year compared to 42.3% last year.Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 28.2% in the third quarter of fiscal '20 and 28.3% in the third quarter of fiscal '19. G&A labor expense as a percent of revenue improved year-over-year.Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal '20 was 18.9% compared to 20.1% last year. The tax rate can move from period to period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense.Our cash and equivalents balance as of February 29 was $234.4 million. Of that amount, $144.7 million was in the United States and unrestricted. Capital expenditures in the third quarter were $63.2 million. Our capex by operating segment was as follows: $50.2 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services; $10.1 million in First Aid and Safety; and $2.9 million in All Other.Year-to-date free cash flow was $745.2 million, an increase of 61% compared to the prior year period. Free cash flow increased because of strong earnings growth and improvements in working capital, particularly accounts receivable, inventories, uniforms and other rental items and service and accounts payable.As of February 29, our balance sheet remains strong. Our leverage was 1.7 times debt to EBITDA. We have an untapped credit facility of $1 billion, no debt maturities in the next 12 months and no material debt maturities in the next two years.That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions.[Operator Instructions] And first, we have Manav Patnaik with Barclays Capital. -- Good evening, gentlemen. Just maybe in light of all the stuff going on, perhaps you could help us with a little bit more detail in terms of where your exposures lie, whether that's restaurants, lodging and so forth. Just we at least know magnitude of what percentage of revenues are really at risk versus those that could go -- like 50-50 or whatever it is. I was hoping you could help us with a little bit more color there. -- Sure, Manav. As I mentioned a bit earlier, we're really at the peak of uncertainty. As of a week ago, we didn't really see much impact to our revenue. And so we're going about trying to get a better understanding of that as we go through this week and into the future. But let me remind you. We have a very diverse customer base. About 30% of our revenues from industrials, 70% from service providing businesses. That includes healthcare, retail distribution centers, foodservice, hospitality. And all of these are being affected in different ways.If you think about healthcare, for example, they really need us now. They need our scrubs, they need our microfiber wipes, they need our cleaning chemicals, they need our fire protection. If you think about restaurants, some are closed, some are opened only carry out. And we're learning as we visit them this week what are their needs. They may still need some chef works, some hygiene products, first aid and safety. But it's going to take a little bit of time to understand what those needs are. Office environments, they're looking to stay clean more than ever, and so we're seeing some nice movement there in terms of our first aid and safety, our personal protective equipment like gloves. And then you think about hotels, casinos, arenas. They aren't doing very much business right now.And so we are in the midst of better understanding the collective impact to the business, Manav. And I guess we're so early in that process that it's really hard to break it down. Because, in addition to the details that I just provided, and keeping in mind if you think about three-digit mix codes [Phonetic], we don't have revenue of greater than 10% in any of those three-digit mix codes. But also keep in mind, as I talked about revenue per vertical, it's quite different from geography to geography today. So if you think about some of those different businesses that are on the coasts, they may be impacted more severely than those same kind of businesses in the same verticals in the middle of the country. And so it's going to take a little bit of time for us to really get clarity on the collective impact to the business, and we're just not there yet.Thank you. Next, we have a question from Andrew Wittmann with RW Baird. -- Great. Thanks. A question that we've gotten a lot this week is how customer closures work and how they affect you and what the contract says when such things happen. I know there's probably different ways to treat different categories of customers; small customers, large customers, maybe even by end market. But for those customers that are shutting down and we know are shutting down, how does that get treated by Cintas and what is the impact to your financials? -- Yeah. It's a great question, Andy. And as I said, we're still working on gaining clarity there. But it's going to be all over the board, right. This is not a normal environment. In a normal environment, we may have a business shut down for a week and we still may be charging the rental of garments and other products. Holiday and manufacturing shutdowns are a good example of that. Semester breaks at school is a good example of that. What we're talking about right now is quite different.And so we have to understand from our customers how long do they think they will be closed, and many of them right now don't know -- about how long do we think they're going to be closed and what are the needs of the business today versus maybe where they were a couple of weeks ago. And so it's going to be all over the board, Andy, from small businesses to large businesses and different kinds of verticals in different geographies. And as I said, we're working through that to gain clarity.Thank you. Our next question will come from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan Securities. -- Hi, Mike, let me give it a try. So my sense -- I've been at this for over a decade, looking at Cintas and the group, and my sense is that the Uniform Rental business really is kind of cyclical on a delay. Like when you look at your fiscal 2008, it was actually up. It wasn't until 2009 and 2010 fiscals did you have kind of moderate declines about 5% organic per year for those two years. So my question really is, do you think that the impact that you experience now will be more immediate or do you think it's going to be a delay like I described last recession? -- Yeah, Andrew, this is not a normal recession or even like the Great Recession. And so I think there is going to be a more immediate impact simply because we have so many businesses that have been ordered to close, right. We've got 40 states have closed their schools. I think another over 20 states have closed their restaurants. I mean, that's unprecedented. And it's not like our customers are going out of business over time or even had the chance to reduce their workforce. They're kind of closing, many of them on orders of municipalities. And so there is going to be a little -- there is going to be certainly a more immediate impact. What is that impact?Look, one of the reasons that we did not provide guidance is, it's really hard to tell. We've never been through a pandemic. And in this pandemic, we're seeing things that we really haven't seen in the 90 years of Cintas, of running the business. And so we need a little bit of time for clarity. As I said, we hadn't seen much of an impact as of a week ago. But there is going to be an impact coming. And that's why we did not provide guidance because it's just too hard to tell right now.Thank you. Our next question will come from Seth Weber with RBC Capital Markets. -- Hey, good evening, guys. I guess maybe just following up on that line of questioning. I think in 2010, your decremental margins were sort of mid 30%. I guess, Mike, just kind of trying to read between what you're saying here, it seems like the impact could be sort of more of a shock here near-term. So from a decremental margin framework, should we think about levels above kind of where you were in the last sort of time that organic growth was down? Is that kind of what your messaging? Thanks. Or can you [Speech Overlap]? -- Sure, sure. So if you think about the fixed versus variable and how will we manage the business right through this disruption, and right now there is a fair amount of uncertainty as I've mentioned a number of times. And we need a little bit more clarity, and the clarity as it relates to this is really around what's the depth of this, what's the breadth of this, how long will this last, what's the severity and duration. If we start to believe that, for example, the severity is pretty high, so we don't expect the duration to last very long, then we may not be as aggressive because we don't want to harm the long-term opportunities and the performance of the business as we move into next fiscal year, as we go into this.If we feel like the duration is going to be longer, then we may take different steps to pull down some of those variable expenses. And so we're going to need a little bit of time to understand what our best expectations are for severity and duration and we'll manage accordingly to that. I can tell you, as we sit here today, we are generally -- and we have been for a long time -- in a mode of growing the business and adding routes and adding laundry capacity. And as we sit here today, we have not, or at least we've slowed capex, for example, to only those things that are essential.And so, in other words, we're not looking to add routes right now. That will reduce capex. We're not looking to expand capacities in our wash alleys, open new processing facilities. That's going to reduce capex. Along those lines, that means we likely won't be hiring people to staff those new routes, to staff the added capacity. And so there are certainly things that we can do today to say we expect to get into a period where the growth isn't going to be what it was in the first three quarters, and so we can pull back on that a little bit. And that certainly is going to help the cash flow. But as it relates to then being more aggressive, we are here for the long term. And if we feel like this is a short duration disruption, we'll likely treat that a little bit differently than a longer-term duration.Thank you, sir. Our next question will come from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. -- Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. Oil prices have contracted sharply in recent weeks. What are your expectations for your industrial and manufacturing verticals? And what factors could potentially cause Cintas to perform differently during this energy downturn compared to the prior 2014 to 2016 downturn? -- Well, I think, George, if we were looking at this only in the lens of the oil and gas vertical, then I'd say a couple of things. One, it's a smaller piece of our business than it was at the beginning of that last downturn. And so that will not have as big of an impact on us as it did last time, and the lower gas prices will certainly help us today. And so, if we're just looking in the lens of that particular or maybe a few verticals, I think we fared really well during that. And we did several years ago as well. But this is broader. This is certainly broader than just that one lens. And so, it's going to be really hard to tell exactly how do we think we performed in that one vertical compared to what's going on in the rest of the United States.Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. -- Hey guys, good afternoon. In the earlier question about cost actions, you referenced variable versus fixed. But actually you didn't, unless I missed it, give us the mix of the two. Can you take a shot at that? And maybe, just at a high level, if you do decide that this could be longer duration, what are the kind of actions you would take? Is it just headcount or are there other actions you would take to reduce costs? Thank you. -- Well, so, Gary, if you think about our business, there are many variable costs in the business. The question is, are they variable to the point where we can turn them off immediately, and do we want to turn them off immediately. That's the biggest question that we're dealing with. And it's really -- I think it'd be irresponsible of me to give you a percentage of just total variable costs because we have to manage the business, and we're managing it for the long term. And so I don't want to throw out some variable number where you think we will cut to the bone our business. So let me give you some examples, though.When you think about the material cost of the business, we've got a lot of cost of disposable products like paper, soaps. We have direct sale like our catalog business. Those are highly variable. And if we're not selling them, we don't have those costs. We also have the gas, water and energy, the gas for our trucks, the water and energy for running the facilities. There certainly is a variable component of that. But there is also a bit of a fixed. And it just depends on how much of that capacity we may decide or not to pull back on. Then, if you think about the laundry capacity, there are a lot of different pieces that go into that, including labor. And then when you think about our route capacity, we've got the cost of our drivers. And there are a lot of variable costs.Our goal is to make sure that our business remains strong for the long term. And so, if we start to see a longer duration, then there are certainly some things that we will do like pull back even a little harder on capital expenditures and other growth pieces of what we do. We may do some things through attrition, and we'll have to make sure we understand the capacity utilization and knowing that we want to manage to that.If you go back to '09 and '10, we did close facilities. But that was a little bit different in that it was a longer period of a recession. This is potentially deep. But we just don't know the duration and we do not want to impact the business for the long term until we really have to.Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. -- Good evening. Thank you. Mike, if you could just provide just a little more detail on your contract structure. And what I mean by that is, if a customer goes bankrupt, clearly you see that right away if it's a closure. But how quickly do your contracts adjust to permanent headcount changes? Just any sense as to how defensive your portfolio is? But specifically, what's the lead lag to headcount changes that may be permanent? I realize absences don't impact your business. -- Yeah. I mean, our contracts are generally five year contracts and they provide for a steady stream of revenue. And generally, there is some minimum level of revenue that we require. But Hamzah, we're in a little bit of a different time today. And so there is going to be a customer by customer conversation about what makes sense, and that's going to take a little bit of time to get through. Again, this is not a normal kind of ramping down, a trending down of the business. This is kind of an abrupt closure of a lot of different customers.But let's remember something else about our business. As I mentioned a little bit earlier, there are a number of -- there are many businesses that really need our products and services. And I don't want that to be lost. There has been a couple municipalities and areas within the country, particularly on the coasts, and we have been identified as an essential provider. And so even though other businesses may be shutting down, we are operating, because our customers need us. And over the course of the next few weeks, we're going to understand the collective impact. But let's keep in mind that while some of our customers are going to be impacted negatively, there are others that really need us. We are seeing an increase in what they need, and we're going to do everything we can to take care of them. So it's a mix. And we're going to -- it's going to take a little bit of time to understand that and get some clarity.Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair. -- Yeah. Good afternoon. I understand this slowdown is very different, Mike. But if you go back to the last recession -- and I can't remember if you broke this out or not. But how did customer retention look through that period? I'm trying to figure out how much of that mid single digit organic decline in '09 and '10 was due to a deterioration in retention rates versus new customer sales or pricing, for example. -- Yeah. The retention was not negatively impacted that much. It was more about customers reducing their headcount. We certainly did have more customers than normal periods go out of business. And so that contributed to a little bit of a higher lost business number. But generally speaking, our retention was really good then. And I think our retention outside of possible businesses that actually have to go out of business, I think our retention is going to be very good here. There is going to be some period of disruption that we have to work ourselves through.I think we have to be careful about comparing this to a prior recession. This is a pandemic that's quite different and the disruption is going to be a little bit more abrupt and immediate. The question is how long will it last. And boy, if we can get through this as a country in the next 60, 90 days, we look forward to getting back to normal operations. But we've got to see what that looks like first.Thank you, sir. Next, we have a question from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel Nicolaus Investment. -- Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Can you talk about how many of your contracts, let's say, percentage-wise, like first aid and safety? Are those primarily consumption based contracts? Or are they contracts that are [Indecipherable] a recurring revenue [Indecipherable] per month? Can you go into that a little bit more because -- and first aid and safety has been a very good growth portion of the business. Now just wondering how those contracts work [Phonetic]. -- Yeah. Generally those are based on -- there are some recurring revenue streams. I would tell you the bulk of that is consumption based, and it's a business that's performing very, very well right now as you can imagine with the need for sanitizing personal protective equipments. That's a business that is performing very well. It has for the whole year. And we're getting a lot of customer requests for more ways to help. When you think about the needs of many businesses today, the cleanliness and the safety aspects have really risen, and we've got a lot of products and services that can help in those areas. And those have been asked for quite a bit over the course of the last couple of weeks. And I expect that those kind of things will perform well.Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Kevin, make sure you're unmated. -- Yeah. Great. Thank you so much. Hey, can you give us a sense of, not only the client mix, but what was the revenue trends in the last week or so? Just to get a sense of how much the business came off. And then, just, if you think [Indecipherable] think about it geographically, because it sounds like California, New York, Washington, maybe that's been a little bit weaker than the interior. But just any thoughts on kind of trends the last week or so? And then is there any way to kind of just frame it out within a little more context geographically? -- Yeah. Unfortunately, Kevin, through last week, we didn't see much disruption to the revenue. In our uniform direct sale business, we did start to see the incoming orders start to come down. And so that was probably the early signs. But through last week, not a lot of impact. There has been certainly some impact on the coasts. And so for example, all of our customers in New Rochelle, they are hard to get to, as you can imagine, with the National Guard patrolling the streets there. That's been difficult. There are others that have been difficult on the West Coast as well. But collectively, it wasn't that big of an impact.I expect that we will start to see some impact as we go through the rest of this week and certainly then in next week, and that's when we're going to start to be able to get a little clarity on what's the initial response of our customers and what might their needs be as we move through. And like I said, there are going to be some customers where their needs have really increased. There are going to be others who have closed, and we're going to be talking about a different -- there is a different conversation there. We need to get through all those conversations, though.Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer & Co. -- Thanks. Good afternoon, guys, and thanks for taking the questions. I guess you've alluded to capex a few times. Just looking at it year-to-date, you're trending -- I think your guidance at the midpoint this year was the same as what you did last year. But you're trending about $17 million below per my numbers. So I'm just curious when we delve into capex a little bit more, and I think you had said you'd already taken some actions with regard to what you've been seeing over the last weeks or months. So just kind of delve in a little bit more on what you would be thinking about on a go forward basis as well. Thanks. -- Sure. When I mentioned that we've made some decisions to reduce capex, that's a very, very recent type of conversation. Look, when we think about capex, we love to grow the business and we have been expanding the routes as necessary and expanding capacity. But also keep in mind, we've gotten some capacity through the G&K deal, and we've gotten some efficiency through projects within the facilities. And our routes -- the revenue per route has been growing. And so we've become a little bit more efficient. And so we've been pretty efficient and I'd say prudent in capex throughout the year.But having said that, going forward, we've been at a, let's call it, a $60 million to $65 million quarterly clip, and certainly that's going to come down probably by half. Now, I don't have a very -- I don't have a -- that's a scientific measurement. But it's going to come down quite a bit as we think about the fourth quarter. Beyond the fourth quarter, it's going to get back to our expectation for the severity and duration of this.Thank you. Our last question in the queue comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. -- Thank you. Saves the best for the last. -- That's right. -- I'm going to take the road less traveled and ask a question about the quarter. Could you talk about the organic growth deceleration within the uniform rental space? It sounds like it wasn't related to coronavirus since you hadn't really seen an impact from that yet. So I guess just what were the main drivers of the deceleration within rental? Thank you. -- Yeah. We've talked a little bit over the last two quarters about the choppiness that we had seen in industrials. And we certainly saw that pick up a little bit in our third quarter. Now, whether that has to do with China in the early parts of the quarter, not sure -- or the uncertainty around this. That's really hard to put our finger on. But we certainly did see some choppiness in that side of the business, and that contributed to a little bit of a deceleration there.Pricing was a bit more aggressive in the quarter. We talked a little bit about that in our second quarter, and that remained here in the third quarter. And the holidays -- I mentioned this in the second quarter call back in December. The holidays are tough when you've got two holidays on a Wednesday. Generally speaking, our sales people have a really hard time of setting appointments. And so if you think about a two-week period of time where you've got many customers, because it's on a Wednesday, taking the whole week off or in and out, it's really hard to set appointments. And so we did see some impact to our sales rep productivity, Paul mentioned, in fire and also in rental. And that was a bit of a contributor as well. So collectively those things were what we saw in the third quarter.Let's set aside the pandemic. The business has been operating at a very healthy pace, and we really like the execution of it. And while the disruption is coming, we think we're poised pretty well to manage through that and get back on to our business once we get through this.Great. Thank you, sir. And that concludes the question-and-answer session for today's call, and I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Hansen for closing remarks. -- Thank you. And before ending the call, we'd like to leave you with a couple of final comments. First, I want to say again that our thoughts remain with those impacted by the COVID-19 coronavirus as our country works to get through this difficult situation as quickly as possible.But secondly, our business has performed very well over the course of the last 10 years, with strong revenue, income and EPS growth. In fact, we've grown our sales and profits in 48 of the last 50 years. And although we're entering a period of disruption, we and all Cintas partners remain excited about the future opportunities of our business and look forward to getting back to business as usual. In the meantime, we are well positioned to enter this period of disruption with a strong cash flow, a very solid balance sheet and an untapped $1 billion credit facility.So we feel good about our ability to manage through this and come out the other side with a very strong business. So thank you, again, for joining us tonight. We will issue our fourth quarter financial results in July, and we look forward to speaking with you again at that time.[Operator Closing Remarks] --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --

"The longest bull market in history has blown up in spectacular fashion, thanks to the coronavirus pandemic that has shut economic activity all around the world. As a result, investors have been sent scrambling to find the safest dividend stocks to buy.Stocks are reeling, interest rates are plumbing the depths and the specter of defaults and bankruptcies are on the horizon. Income investors now more than ever need to be able to trust their dividend stocks. Hefty yields do no good if a company . By the same token, even the slimmest yield is immensely valuable if there's little to no chance it will come under duress.In short, income investors need super safe dividend stocks right now, and we know some good ways to find them.One option is to monitor  from exchange-traded fund provider Reality Shares. DIVCON's methodology uses a five-tier rating to provide a snapshot of companies' dividend health, where DIVCON 5 indicates the highest probability for a dividend increase, and DIVCON 1 the highest probability for a dividend cut. And within each of these ratings is a composite score determined by cash flow, earnings, stock buybacks and other factors.These are 15 of the safest dividend stocks to buy right now. Each stock has not only achieved a DIVCON 5 score, but a composite score within the top 10% of all stocks that DIVCON evaluated. This makes them the crème de la crème of dividend safety - and more likely to keep the dividend increases coming going forward.Market value: $194.9 billionDividend yield: 3.3%DIVCON score: 65.00Coronavirus could mean deep trouble for retailers forced to lock their doors. Happily for investors in Home Depot (, $181.31), the nation's largest home improvement chain has been deemed an essential business. Not only are its stores open, but they're doing brisk business. One of the few things you can do when trapped at home is to fix the place up.Indeed, Nomura Instinet analyst Michael Baker, who has a Buy rating on HD shares, writes to clients that home-center trends are holding up ""reasonably well in the new near-term normal.""Home Depot is a longtime dividend payer that has raised its payout annually since 2010. And the yield on the dividend is pretty darn good in a world where interest rates are at record lows.The Dow stock generates more than twice as much levered free cash flow (cash a company has left over after it meets all its obligations) than it needs to support that payout, according to DIVCON's data. Indeed, for the 12 months ended Feb. 2, HD had levered free cash flow of $8.5 billion after disbursing $6 billion in dividends. That puts Home Depot among a small set of safe dividend stocks to buy now in the retail space.Market value: $195.0 billionDividend yield: 3.2%DIVCON score: 65.00Like a number of health-care names, shares in Merck (, $76.873) have held up comparatively well during the market crash. The  is off about 6% since the market topped in February. The S&P 500, by comparison, tumbled 25%.The resilient share price has thus far limited upside on Merck's dividend yield. At 3.2%, it remains fairly generous but certainly not eye-popping. However, what's more important than yield these days is safety, and Merck has that in spades.On a fundamental level, Merck can count on Keytruda - a blockbuster cancer drug approved for more than 20 indications - to keep the cash coming. And it's partly thanks to the hit drug that Merck has such a  and cash flow situation. Not only does MRK have more than $10 billion in cash in its coffers, but it also generates twice as much levered free cash flow than it needs to support its payout. That's encouraging.Market value: $40.1 billionDividend yield: 1.2%DIVCON score: 65.00Sherwin-Williams (, $436.91) is one of the largest paints, coatings and home-improvement companies in the world, and it also happens to be one of the market's most reliable dividend payers. Indeed, SHW is a member of the S&P Dividend Aristocrats,  that have raised their payouts annually for at least a quarter-century.SHW has 41 straight years of annual increases to its name and DIVCON data suggests it won't break the streak anytime soon. The paint company generated levered free cash flow of $1.13 billion in 2019 - or three times as much cash as it needed to support $421 million in dividend payments.In another sign of dividend strength, SHW's payout ratio is about only 24%. That means the company's dividends come to less than a quarter of its profits. The chintzy yield might not wow income investors, but they can take comfort in its reliability.Better still: Sherwin-Williams is actually . Goldman Sachs' Robert Koort, for instance, raised the stock from Neutral to Buy on March 30 and put the stock on his firm's Conviction List. Koort notes that declines as deep as the current 26% plunge are rare for SHW, especially amid declining input costs and low housing inventory. That makes this safe dividend stock a ""unique long-term opportunity.""Market value: $87.5 billionDividend yield: 2.4%DIVCON score: 65.25Linde (, $164.09) is another Dividend Aristocrat, having gained entry to that illustrious list of safe dividend stocks as a result of its merger with Praxair two years ago. Taking the Praxair streak into consideration, the world's largest industrial gasses company has hiked its payout annually, without interruption, for 26 years.Shares in Linde have sold off just about as much as the S&P 500, which means new investors can get a significantly higher yield than in the recent past. LIN's dividend was stuck below 2% for more than a year. It touched a low of less than 1.6% at one point in February.To be sure, Linde is vulnerable to the global economic shock set off by COVID-19. Analysts expect organic revenue, which excludes contributions from acquisitions, to be flat for the next five years. But more than ample free cash flow and a payout ratio of 48% gives the company plenty of breathing room for future dividend growth.Goldman's Koort views Linde similarly to Sherwin-Williams, upgrading the stock from Neutral to Buy and saying this is an ""attractive opportunity"" in a ""high-quality defensive name.""Market value: $12.9 billionDividend yield: 2.4%DIVCON score: 66.25W.W. Grainger (, $239.69) is something of a sleepy company, but investors best not sleep on its dividend. The company - which not only sells industrial equipment and tools, but provides other services such as helping companies manage inventory - has hiked its payout annually for almost 50 years.In addition to being an Aristocrat, GWW is on sale these days and offers a great way to take advantage of a rebound when we get to the other side of the crisis.""In 2021, we expect sales will get a boost from pent-up demand and larger distributors investing in inventory,"" says William Blair Equity Research, which rates the stock at Outperform (equivalent of Buy). ""Owning distributors is a safe way to participate in the industrial recovery, but not get killed if the economy gets worse.  Grainger's valuation is attractive.""Grainger's strong cash position puts it among a number of safe dividend stocks to buy now. Analysts add that GWW will probably raise its dividend to keep its 48-year streak intact.Market value: $1.2 trillionDividend yield: 1.3%DIVCON score: 66.75Microsoft (, $155.26) is off 18% since hitting an all-time high in February, and it remains the world's largest publicly traded company. The trillion-dollar-plus market value, massive amounts of cash on the balance sheet and gushers of free cash flow make this one of the safest dividend stocks to be found.MSFT generated $35.1 billion in levered free cash flow for the year ended Dec. 31. Meanwhile, its cash pile grew to $134.2 billion. And that's after paying $14.4 billion in dividends. DIVCON notes that the tech giant delivers two-and-a-half times the free cash flow it needs to cover the dividend.Microsoft also has an impressive streak of dividend hikes, having raised its payout annually for more than 15 years.Deutsche Bank recently reiterated its Buy call on MSFT, but the analyst outfit concedes that demand will take a hit as the recessions slows the rate of companies' migration to cloud-based services. In fact, it's extremely difficult to find analysts willing to bet against Microsoft. Over the past three months alone, the stock has piled up 25 Buy calls versus just one Hold and no Sells.Market value: $32.4 billionDividend yield: 0.7%DIVCON score: 67.00Roper Technologies (, $305.07) is another Dividend Aristocrat, having raised its payout annually for 27 years. Although the yield on the dividend is a paltry 0.7%, it can be counted on during these turbulent times.Roper is an industrial company whose businesses include medical and scientific imaging, RF technology and software, and energy systems and controls, among others. A combination of acquisitions, organic growth and stronger margins have helped Roper juice its dividend without stretching its profits. The company has a payout ratio of only 16% that not only indicates a safe payout, but plenty of room for growth.Even better, Roper has far more levered free cash flow than it needs to pay the dividend. The company generated $1.5 billion in free cash flow last year while paying out $191 million in dividends.Market value: $13.0 billionDividend yield: 0.9%DIVCON score: 67.25Domino's Pizza (, $333.45) was one of  and now it's one of . Shares in the sprawling pizza chain are up about 12% since the market topped in February. The S&P 500 is down 25% over the same span.Domino's dividend, which it began paying in 2014, has never been all that juicy, spending most of its time in sub-1% territory. It can, however, be counted on.DPZ is one of the safest dividend stocks to buy now if only because its business is positioned to benefit from this difficult scenario. With so much of the world stuck at home hiding from COVID-19, Domino's business is booming. At the same time, the pizza joint generated $278 million in free cash flow for the 12 months ended Dec. 31, while paying out $106 million in dividends. And it finished 2019 with $191 million in cash and short-term investments.""Despite headwinds, we continue to view DPZ as among the best positioned in this environment,"" writes Credit Suisse, which rates the stock at Market Outperform (equivalent of Buy).Market value: $228.1 billionDividend yield: 1.8%DIVCON score: 67.50UnitedHealth Group (, $240.44), the largest publicly traded health insurance company by a wide margin, might not boast the highest dividend yield, but it is one of the safest.UNH, a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, has tumbled in line with the broader indices since the bull market died in February. But ample cash flow and a strong balance sheet won't allow the same sort of disappointment with the dividend.UnitedHealth generates more than five times as much levered free cash flow than it needs to support the dividend, DIVCON notes. Heck, the health insurer generated $3.6 billion in free cash flow in the fourth quarter alone - a time when it paid out $1 billion in dividends. UNH's dividend strength is also evidenced by its payout ratio, which stands at just 26%. The payout ratio of the S&P 500 is more than 40%.What's less clear is how the outbreak of COVID-19 will affect revenue in the near term as hospitals defer elective procedures so they can concentrate on pandemic treatment. Regardless, Credit Suisse maintains its Outperform rating.""We continue to believe that investors will tend to stick with market leading companies such as UNH as this crisis unfolds and, therefore, maintain our favorable investment rating on the stock,"" Credit Suisse analysts write.Market value: $348.8 billionDividend yield: 0.8%DIVCON score: 67.75Visa (, $157.39) is among some awfully safe dividend stocks to buy now, even though it will never blow away income investors with its yield. But aggressive dividend growth will help investors' yield on cost grow over time and contribute to what should be strong total returns.The world's largest payments network is a popular stock pick with mutual fund managers, hedge fund managers and Warren Buffett, chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (). That's because its global breadth makes Visa an ideal way to play explosive growth in cashless transactions and digital mobile payments.Visa has more than a decade of annual dividend increases to its name and investors can expect that streak to continue. The transactions company has a payout ratio of just 21%. According to DIVCON, Visa generates more than five times as much free cash flow as it needs to support the dividend. (Visa generated more than $9 billion in levered free cash flow last year.)And then there is the imprimatur of Warren Buffett, who makes no secret of his ardor for collecting dividends - even if he refuses to allow Berkshire to pay one. BRK.B owns more than 10 million shares in Visa worth about $1.6 billion.Market value: $39.7 billionDividend yield: 0.8%DIVCON score: 68.25Humana (, $300.11) is another dividend payer with a firehouse of free cash flow compared with what it spends on dividends. The health insurance company doled out $291 million in dividends last year and still had $2.3 billion in free cash flow left over.Humana fortified its coffers in March by selling $1.1 billion in senior secured notes. The company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, which may include the repayment of existing indebtedness.With interest rates plumbing fresh lows, refinancing is just good thinking.Although the suspension of many elective surgeries adds a measure of uncertainty to the company's revenue growth rate, Humana is doing its part in the battle against COVID-19. The firm has waived out-of-pocket costs regarding coronavirus-related treatment for its members. (Credit Suisse notes that elective procedures are a small fraction of spend.) On the other hand, patients requiring ventilator support could be costly over the short term, analysts say.Humana also has a short but encouraging track record of dividend growth, with a decade of payout hikes under its belt.Market value: $22.7 billionDividend yield: 3.7%DIVCON score: 68.5Asset managers such as T. Rowe Price (, $97.14) are losing market share to indexed funds of the type Vanguard offers, but the company still boasts $1.2 trillion in assets under management. And thanks to advising fees, analysts expect revenue to tick up to $5.7 billion in 2020 from $5.6 billion last year.As for the security of its payout, TROW is yet another Dividend Aristocrat, having lifted its payout every year for 34 years. The last hike came on Feb. 2, when it raised the quarterly dividend 18% to 90 cents a share from 76 cents a share. The payout ratio of 45% is essentially in line with that of the broader market.DIVCON notes that TROW has more than twice as much levered free cash flow as it needs to support the dividend.Market value: $17.2 billionDividend yield: 1.5%DIVCON score: 69Cintas (, $165.19) is a Dividend Aristocrat with more than three decades of annual dividend increases. However, although the payout looks safe, the top line might very well take a hit in the months ahead.CTAS is perhaps best-known for providing corporate uniforms, but the company also offers maintenance supplies, tile and carpet cleaning services and even compliance training. As such, it's seen by some investors as a bet on jobs growth.With workers being laid off in the millions and the unemployment rate forecast to top 10%, labor market growth doesn't look like a particularly good bet these days. However, its facility services division - basically, things such as cleaning offices and restocking restroom supplies - could see bolstered interest.Regardless of how the jobs market is doing, Cintas is a stalwart as a dividend payer. The company has raised its payout every year since going public in 1983, and it has the wherewithal to keep the streak alive. Cintas' payout ratio comes to just 32% of profits, and the company generates almost four times as much levered free cash flow as it needs to support its payout.Market value: $240.1 billionDividend yield: 0.7%DIVCON score: 69.75Like Visa, Mastercard (, $238.88) is a sprawling global payments processor in prime position to benefit from the growth of digital mobile payments and other cashless transactions.Shares in Mastercard tumbled when the spread of COVID-19 amped up worries about global growth. After all, Mastercard depends on transaction volume for revenue. But those fears may be misplaced. Company insiders sure think so and they're backing up their optimism with cash. Mastercard has seen  - a bullish sign.While Mastercard is one of the safest dividend stocks to buy right now, its dividend yield is slim. But MA is good for the payouts. The firm generated $65 billion in levered free cash flow last year after paying $1.3 billion in dividends.Income investors can also take heart in the fact that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway owns almost 5 million shares worth about $1.2 billion.Market value: $5.3 billionDividend yield: 1.7%DIVCON score: 71.5No dividend stock gets a higher safety score from DIVCON than Dolby Laboratories (, $52.98). Dolby is a leader in audio, visual and voice technologies for cinemas, home theaters, PCs, mobile devices and games.B. Riley FBR equity research, which rates DLB at Buy, says the probability that the company will cut the dividend is zero. Dolby Laboratories can ""push through any potential spending slowdown"" because Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos systems have become ""de facto standards"" for home theaters, cinemas and audio surround sound, they write.The dividend yield of 1.7% is nothing to sneeze at when interest rates are plumbing the depths, especially when investors can bank on it. Dolby generates more than twice as much levered free cash flow than it needs to support the dividend. The payout ratio stands at just 34%, and DLB has hiked the dividend annually for six straight years.

"Corporate uniform and facility services company   is definitely a big loser from the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. The virus is now the cause of a series of abrupt and severe actions taken by governments in order to curtail its spread. That's not great news for a business services company like Cintas, but is the market overreacting to events or not? Let's take a look at the investment case for the stock.Frankly, no one knows exactly when this outbreak will ultimately be contained. Unfortunately, this fact is creating so much uncertainty in the marketplace that many companies are abandoning giving guidance altogether. Indeed, Cintas became the latest company to do so when it recently reported its fiscal third-quarter earnings. It's a disappointing outcome, as  that Cintas was actually planning to its full-year revenue and earnings guidance ""based on our year-to-date results and fourth-quarter outlook"" prior to the events of last week.Image source: Getty Images.There's no way of getting around it. Cintas counts hotels, restaurants, and industrial companies as being some of its key customers, so when whole economies are being shut down in response to the novel coronavirus pandemic, it's highly likely that Cintas's core rental uniform business is going to suffer. Moreover, an extended shutdown could put some of its customers under financial duress, or at the least reduce demand for Cintas's services in the light of a recession or an economic slowdown.In this context, it's perfectly understandable that the market has heavily sold off Cintas stock. All of this leads to a highly unusual situation whereby a company with good earnings momentum is being sold off to valuations at multi-year lows due to an event (the shutdowns) which happened in an extremely short space of time. data by With all the doom and gloom of the current situation out of the way, it's time to turn to a more optimistic outlook. There are three key points. The first has partially been addressed in the chart above -- Cintas's valuation is looking relatively attractive on current earnings basis.Second, while it's wrong to be flippant about the crisis, and definitely wrong to try and predict its severity or when it will end, the fact is that the measures being taken in Europe and the U.S. have arguably been proven to work in China. As such, it's probably a matter of time before they work in the rest of the world as well. Moreover, the so-called ""v-shape"" recovery that occurred in Asia after a previous coronavirus outbreak, SARS, in 2002-2003 serves as a useful precedent.Third, it's worth noting that in some ways Cintas could be a net beneficiary of a post-COVID-19 world. After all, the company also sells safety and sanitizing products and services. As Hansen outlined on the , it's a business that's ""performing very well"" and ""the cleanliness and the safety aspects have really risen, and we've got a lot of products and services that can help in those areas. And those have been asked for quite a bit over the course of the last couple of weeks.""In addition, Cintas's core business of uniform rental (which involves routinely cleaning uniforms) might also receive a boost from a heightened sense of cleanliness in the workplace.The price has gone down, and arguably Cintas's long-term growth potential has gone up -- if the argument that COVID-19 will lead to an increase in awareness of cleanliness in the workplace is correct. In this context, the stock is attractive. However, its core hospitality, hotel, and restaurant customers are likely to take a severe hit for at least a quarter or two, and there may well be a lingering reluctance to visit public areas even after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides.For cautious investors and those worried about  the stock is probably worth avoiding, but if you believe an economic recovery will occur after the virus is contained, then Cintas is an attractive stock for a long-term investor. Just be aware that the near-term headlines are not going to be good.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Shares of uniform provider   lost a painful 35% of their value in March, according to data from . That was much worse than the 13% decline in the . The general reason for the selloff was the , but what's really got investors worried are longer-term issues.Cintas' business model is pretty simple from a big-picture perspective -- it provides uniforms and other facility-upkeep services to businesses. As COVID-19 began to spread rapidly across the country, state and local governments have either mandated or firmly requested that most people stay home as much as possible, and that all non-essential businesses close. That's a big headwind for a company that makes all its revenues by supporting other businesses' operations. In the near term, Cintas will see a drop in demand because of the widespread social distancing efforts being taken.Image source: Getty ImagesHowever, even during normal times, Cintas' . It ebbs and flows along with the broader economy, and there's really nothing that can be done about that. That's the longer-term concern driving investors to sell the stock today. The efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19 have basically caused economies around the world to stop in their tracks. It appears almost certain that, in the months and quarters ahead, the economic data will show that a has already begun. In fact, any near-term hit Cintas feels from the immediate impacts of  COVID-19 might be relatively modest compared to the business decline associated with that apparently unavoidable recession. Thus, the drop in Cintas' share price is hardly unreasonable.Cintas is a financially strong company that has managed its way through downturns before. That said, the stock's dividend yield is higher than it has been in a long time -- though still below the levels it reached during the depths of the Great Recession. That suggests that there could still be more pain ahead for shareholders as the immediate concerns surrounding COVID-19 recede and the longer-term ripples from the containment effort start to show up in the global economy. Investors might want to keep this stock on their watch lists for now.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

There are 8 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Cintas Corporation, but the average is just that — a mathematical average.

The standard deviation is $27.185.


But the whole reason to look at the average CTAS price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes.

"The  are an exclusive club of 57 companies that have raised dividends every year for at least 25 years. Paying a dividend is challenging -- companies need to have a business model that provides stable and consistent cash flow. But raising the dividend annually takes something even more special.Dividend Aristocrats have the ability to thrive in any kind of economic environment, take a long-term view, and have a culture of continuous improvement that strengthens the financial statements every year.Even though just about any company on the Dividend Aristocrat list is a safe bet, here are three that are adapting in ways that will pay off for years to come:  ,  , and  .  data by Cintas started as a uniform provider in 1968 and has grown to serve over one million customers with a footprint primarily in North America. Over the years, it has expanded into complementary services focused around first aid, fire protection, and safety services which now account for around 15% of revenue ($6.9 billion in revenue last fiscal year).In 2016, it unveiled its ""Ready for the workday"" branding campaign, which highlighted that the company had moved beyond its uniform rental roots. This has given its customers a new way to think about what Cintas can deliver and has helped fuel its growth.In its full-year results ending May 31, 2019, non-uniform services segments have topped $1 billion in revenue and grew at 12% year-over-year, more than twice that of the core uniform segments at 5.5%.Image source: Getty images.Also in 2016, the company announced it was , G&K Services, for $2.2 billion. This added another $1 billion in revenue and 100,000-plus customers. Even though it is still in the process of full integration of the two operations, it has started to see bottom-line improvements as it reduces redundancies between the two organizations.These two examples show Cintas' ability to adapt and highlight its competitive edge. Although its dividend yield is only 0.87%, its outperformance of the market over the past 10 years has rewarded shareholders handsomely. A track record of consistent execution and a low  of 30% should keep its 37-year streak of  intact, and shareholders happy for many years to come.The Census Bureau estimates that over half of the 136 million homes in the U.S. were built before 1980, and over 80% are at least 20 years old. This is a great opportunity for Lowe's, which provides products and services for home remodeling and repair.It operates 2,220 stores in the U.S. and Canada under the Lowe's and RONA brands, pulling in $71.8 billion in revenue for the last four quarters. In July 2018, it hired outsider and seasoned retail executive Marvin Ellison to be its CEO. He quickly  and performed a top-to-bottom assessment of the organization.The new CEO concluded that even though Lowe's had a strong brand and a solid balance sheet, its infrastructure had failed to keep up, and the company lacked modern tools to run its operations. Ellison and his management team are now executing on a transformation plan that focuses on the fundamentals of running a retail operation, and it's paying off.In its most recent quarter, the company  due to improved execution. But Ellison indicated it still has a , including shoring up its Canadian store base, further improvements to its Pro business, and stabilizing its e-commerce infrastructure.Lowe's' record of increased dividend payouts is now going on 57 consecutive years, making it a  and further proving its ability to adapt in all economic environments. With millions of aging homes around the U.S., a brand that people trust, a solid dividend yield of 1.7%, and a reasonable payout ratio of 54%, this is one stock you could keep in your portfolio forever.You are probably familiar with McCormick from its consumer segment (which fills the spice aisle of your local grocery store), but you might not know it also has a robust flavor solutions segment that sells spices and condiments to manufacturers and restaurants.This business-to-business segment makes up 39% of the company's $5.3 billion in sales, and is the faster-growing of the two segments, with revenue growth last year of 1.1%.A key part of McCormick's growth strategy is acquiring brands that help bolster its position as the leading flavor company. Since the beginning of 2015, it has acquired seven companies, including the $4.2 billion purchase of RB Foods in 2017 from . These acquisitions have added well-known brands such as French's, Frank's RedHot, and Stubb's to the fold, but have also added complexity.In mergers, it's often difficult to realize savings in core support functions with different information technology (IT) systems from the companies being acquired. Because of this, McCormick has embarked on a multi-year effort to replace its enterprise resource planning (ERP) software that runs its factories, supply chain, and finances. The project will cost $300 million to $350 million and put a wrapping up in 2022. The result will be a single global system, providing a solid foundation for it to grow and enable additional efficiencies for its back-office processes.The company has been increasing its dividend for 33 years and currently has a nice dividend yield of 1.4% and a comfortable payout ratio of 44%.With its leading position in the flavor business, you could rest easy with this stock in your portfolio for many decades.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"Uniform rental and business services provider   is on deck to report first-quarter fiscal 2020 results on Jan. 8 before the markets open for trading. The Wilmington, Massachusetts-headquartered garment and textiles giant enjoyed a 41% leap in its stock price in 2019. Can it maintain its drive over the coming 12 months?Below, let's briefly walk through key details that may influence UniFirst's shares when it releases its first scorecard of 2020 next week.UniFirst improved revenue by 6.7% to $1.81 billion in fiscal 2019. This fast growth rate was anchored by the company's core laundry operations, which grew year-over-year revenue by 6.1%. Laundry operations make up 89% of total company sales; the smaller specialty garments and first aid divisions advanced annual revenue by 21.1% and 11.1%, respectively.UniFirst CEO Steve Sintros attributed the year's progress to a number of factors during the company's ; these included higher customer retention, record sales in new accounts, better sales rep productivity, and a favorable pricing environment. Sintros also noted that the 2019 fiscal year included 53 weeks. The extra week added roughly 2% to Unifirst's overall revenue total.Image source: Getty Images.UniFirst doesn't provide quarterly estimates; rather, it discloses an annual outlook that it updates as needed during the fiscal year. For 2020, the company expects revenue to fall between $1.86 billion and $1.88 billion. At the midpoint, this will equate to year-over-year expansion of 3.3%; however, shareholders should be aware that fiscal 2019 had the benefit of one extra week.On the earnings front, the company expects core laundry  to land at 10.3%. Laundry margins are returning to a more normalized level after jumping to 13.2% in 2019 due to several one-time items that boosted reported profitability. In addition, management anticipates higher administrative expense in 2020 related to the company's CRM (customer relationship management) initiative.UniFirst projects that diluted earnings per share (EPS) will range between $7.47 and $7.97 this year. This compares to $9.33 in diluted EPS in 2019: Net earnings also benefited from the 53rd week, as well as a non-recurring gain from a vendor settlement related to the company's CRM initiative.Shareholders will also keep an eye on UniFirst's strong cash generation in fiscal 2020. Last year, the company achieved operating cash flow of $282.1 million. Even after adjusting for $13 million received in the company's CRM vendor settlement, operating cash flow jumped by 17% over the prior year.Finally, while this isn't part of the company's formal earnings guidance, management has signaled that UniFirst is actively seeking more of the smaller, bolt-on acquisitions it's undertaken in recent years. On the fourth-quarter , CFO Shane O'Connor observed that UniFirst purchased a small uniform company in Kansas City, Missouri, in September 2019 after the fiscal year ended. This purchase is expected to add $12.5 million in additional revenue this year (the boost is included in annual guidance discussed above). O'Connor stated that the company continues ""to look for and aggressively pursue additional targets as acquisitions remain an integral part of [UniFirst's] overall growth strategy."" As we head into four new quarters of reporting on UniFirst's operations, it's important for investors to understand that a disappointing quarter against the cadence of annual expectations could hurt its shares. Given last year's run-up and the fact that it now trades at nearly 25 times forward earnings, UniFirst is no . However, the ""UNF"" symbol may have a slight bit of insulation as it trades at a discount to rival uniform rental bellwether , which currently trades at roughly 31 times forward earnings. UniFirst presents investors with similar characteristics to an investment at Cintas, but at a cheaper price, and thus, any post-earnings sell-off may be mitigated by bargain hunters.

"Investors in Cintas Corporation (Symbol: CTAS) saw new options become available this week, for the August 2020 expiration.  One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 241 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CTAS options chain for the new August 2020 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $250.00 strike price has a current bid of $9.50.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $250.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $240.50 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CTAS, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $268.41/share today.

Because the $250.00 strike represents an approximate 7% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.80% return on the cash commitment, or 5.76% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.


Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Cintas Corporation, and highlighting in green where the $250.00 strike is located relative to that history:


   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $280.00 strike price has a current bid of $14.20.  If an investor was to purchase shares of CTAS stock at the current price level of $268.41/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $280.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 9.61% if the stock gets called away at the August 2020 expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CTAS shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Cintas Corporation, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing CTAS's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $280.00 strike highlighted in red:



   
Considering the fact that the $280.00 strike represents an approximate 4% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 55%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.29% boost of extra return to the investor, or 8.01% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.


The implied volatility in the put contract example is 23%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 22%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $268.41) to be 21%.

Shares of   rose 60.2% in 2019, . The leading provider of corporate uniforms and related services executed this climb the old-fashioned way: by beating Wall Street's earnings estimates in each one of the year's earnings reports.The earnings beats ranged from a 7% surprise in March's fiscal third-quarter report to a 12% outperformance in . Revenue rose 7% in the second quarter, while earnings increased 29% compared to the year-ago period. That period reaped the benefit of an unusually large cohort uniform order from an unnamed Fortune 100 customer, but Cintas' business is humming even in quarters without outsize mega-orders. The  unlocked a plethora of cost-saving synergies, which Cintas is using to drive its bottom-line earnings higher.Image source: Getty Images.This is one of those simple business models that a ham sandwich could run, but this sandwich would probably settle for slow and stable long-term growth. Cintas' actual management team is doing much better, aiming to expand its uniform market into previously unserved niches. The underlying strategy is a relentless focus on providing high-quality products and services that its industry rivals often cannot match at a reasonable price.Management expects revenue growth of approximately 6% for full-year fiscal 2020, which ends in May. Earnings should increase by roughly 15%. It's no surprise to see investors rewarding Cintas for running a predictably excellent uniform rentals business.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Workplace uniform giant   completed its $2.2 billion acquisition of competitor G&K Services in March 2017, and integrating the two companies and realizing merger benefits has proved to be a multiyear project, as management had originally projected. But efforts to wring more value from the tie-up finally seem to be coming to fruition.In Cintas' fiscal second-quarter 2020  on Dec. 17, executives discussed examples of recent progress in the integration effort. Let's briefly review three of management's comments to gauge how the process is affecting Cintas' results and long-term  for its shares.[In] our uniform rental and facility services segment, gross margin was 46.6% for the second quarter, compared to 45.3% in last year's second quarter, an improvement of 130 basis points. Operating-income margin was a record 19.5% for the second quarter, and it was 19% year to date. Profit margins have strengthened for many reasons, including strong revenue growth and realization of cost synergies from the acquisition of G&K.-- Paul Adler, treasurerCintas' uniform rental and facilities services business makes up roughly 80% of the company's total top line. During the , executives detailed how  and  are improving as major integration efforts are wrapping up.For example, as Cintas has incorporated G&K manufacturing volume into its existing plants, and closed some G&K plants, it's achieved production efficiencies that are beginning to turn up in higher profitability. This impact is speeding up as the company has now completed most of its plant integrations and closings. Over a longer time period, Cintas will continue to find opportunities to boost the yield from combined operations. Management cited a specific example on the call, explaining that the company often converts G&K workwear rental customers to Cintas uniforms when inventory in legacy G&K products gets depleted. Cintas' products carry slightly higher margins, and management believes that switching customers over to Cintas workwear provides them, in many cases, with a higher-quality uniform.Image source: Getty Images.[W]e're about 85% of the way through our SAP journey at this point in time. So we've made some good progress in the quarter, and we're still on track to complete the project by the end of the fiscal year. As far as benefits are concerned, I think the benefits from SAP are going to be kind of [found] throughout the [profit and loss statement]. -- AdlerCintas' conversion to German software giant 's namesake enterprise software was one of management's most prominent business themes in calendar year 2019. Implementing a single accounting, finance, and data analysis framework across the organization will be especially helpful to Cintas. It has grown through acquisitions of numerous smaller uniform companies, and as a result, management's information for decision making and reporting has been gathered (until now) from a host of disparate accounting and finance systems.On the call, Adler discussed the benefits to invoicing and pricing that the SAP system will bring. He also mentioned that having the company's uniform rental and first-aid segments under a single system will foster opportunities for collaboration within its sales team and help with product cross-selling to customers.Though the enterprise software's rollout is 85% complete, the company has so far realized only a fraction of the ultimate benefit to the profit and loss statement; this will happen over a period of years. Analyzing data provided by SAP should also help Cintas get a firmer grasp on the profitability of G&K's manufacturing operations and service routes, and assist in making better-informed decisions.[From a] working capital standpoint, we certainly have been in a period of disruption over the last couple of years, as it relates to our accounts receivable, converting two systems as it relates to our inventory, and shutting down [distribution centers], opening new DCs, converting a lot of volume. And we're starting to get some of those inefficiencies and disruptions behind us. And so for example, in accounts receivable, we've seen a nice improvement year over year. And that's part because we've gotten a little bit of that disruption behind us.-- CEO Michael HansenHansen's point above relates to disruptions from both the G&K Services integration and the SAP implementation. It also illuminates how improving an organization's handling of its current assets, from physical inventory to accounts receivable, helps liquidity and cash flow, and ultimately widens profits.As the SAP conversion nears completion, management has much more visibility into the accounts receivable of its various operating subsidiaries, which helps to facilitate collections while pinpointing delinquent accounts more quickly. And the integration of G&K inventory into Cintas' distributions system is speeding inventory turnover, while helping the buildup of additional inventory for future sales.The fine-tuning of the components of working capital (i.e., current assets less current liabilities) shows up most prominently in Cintas' cash flow. Hansen said that Cintas has enjoyed a cash conversion ratio of over 100% in fiscal 2020. This ratio, calculated by dividing operating cash flow by net income, measures the amount of net profit a company converts into cash in a given period.By my calculation, cash conversion reached 115% in the first six months of fiscal 2020.  more than doubled during the same period against the first two quarters of fiscal 2019, to $445 million. These are perhaps the two clearest pieces of evidence that Cintas has indeed reached a tipping point in its gradual effort to extract value from the G&K acquisition.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The world after COVID-19 is likely to look a bit different from the one before it. While it's clear the actions taken to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus are going to severely impact the economy in the first half of the year, the key question is, what stocks could be set to benefit in the long term?Potential answers include: cleaning supply company  , corporate uniform services company  , and food safety, clean water, and hygiene company  . Here's why.Image source: Getty Images.The case for buying these stocks rests on two underlying assumptions.First, the novel coronavirus will eventually be contained -- meaning that global economic activity will return to normality in due time. This is an important point because Cintas benefits from employment growth (no jobs means no demand for corporate uniforms). Similarly, Ecolab, which provides water, hygiene, and energy technologies, relies on industrial activity as well as growth in the food and lodging sector. Clorox's personal care products and disinfectants also rely somewhat on recurring spending by households and businesses. As you can see below, all three companies saw revenue declines around the time of the Great Recession in 2008-09, so these companies are still reliant on a positive overall economy for growth.  data by The second assumption we have to make is that the shock created by the COVID-19 outbreak will lead to a heightened sense of awareness around the need for cleanliness in public and private spaces. That could add some long-term growth to recurring demand for Clorox's disinfectants, Ecolab's food safety and hygiene solutions and Cintas facilities services businesses.That said, it's important not to underestimate the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on economic growth. The fact is that the number of new daily cases worldwide has been on the uptrend since the end of February and the preventive measures taken to deal with the situation -- travel bans, corporate and government shutdowns, etc. -- are going to have a significant effect on the economy and company earnings. As such, investors should brace themselves for some potential near-term earnings disappointments, and that could include disappointments at Ecolab, Cintas, and Clorox. So, buyer beware. But with all that said, here's more detail on why these three stocks stand to benefit and why you should buy them this month.Clorox is one of the few stocks that's actually held up well through the crisis. With its portfolio of home care and professional cleaning products, household products (cat litter, bags, and charcoal), and an odd assortment of so-called lifestyle products, the company's prospects are improving in an environment where clean hygiene is paramount.Clorox's current P/E valuation of 26 times earnings is not exactly cheap. However, another way to look at it is to focus on its  of 2.7% -- as you can see below, its dividend payout is well covered by its free cash flow -- and consider that the 10-year treasury yield is less than 1% at present. If the economy is headed for an extended slowdown due to the novel coronavirus, then interest rates are likely to remain low and Clorox's dividend is likely to remain sustainable and a valuable source of income for dividend-seeking investors. data by Another , Cintas' claim to be a beneficiary of a post-COVID-19 world comes from the idea that there will be an extra emphasis on cleaning corporate apparel and on maintaining cleanliness in the workplace. As such, more corporations may decide to rent Cintas' corporate uniforms and have them regularly cleaned by the company -- its core business.Moreover, Cintas is also growing its facility services business, which includes cleaning services and restroom supplies. That's another market set to do well in the post-COVID-19 world. As you can see in the chart below, the recent market declines have taken the company's price-to-earnings valuation lower than it has tended to trade at over the last few years, but given an economic recovery from the coronavirus shock, Cintas is well placed to benefit in a post-COVID-19 world.  data by The  of food safety, water, and hygiene technology,  Ecolab has long been seen as a company set to grow market share within its industry. Ecolab's products and services help keep the food, hospitality, and healthcare industries hygienic and sanitized.  In addition, its environmental and water and wastewater treatment solutions help industrial companies maintain quality and meet environmental standards.In common with Cintas, Ecolab's valuation has now moved down to levels it hasn't seen in a while.  data by The company is already set to benefit from long-term growth in urbanization, and an increase in demand for protein and processed food -- something usually associated with the growth in middle classes in the emerging world. Throw in the increased emphasis on public health issues in the aftermath of the novel coronavirus outbreak and the long-term future looks bright for this .When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

usiness services specialist   reported earnings this Tuesday evening, covering the results of the second quarter in fiscal year 2020. The provider of uniform rentals, fire safety services, and restroom supplies for corporations of every size crushed Wall Street's expectations and raised its full-year guidance targets.Data source: Cintas.  = generally accepted accounting principles.Uniform rental and facility services recorded 5.7% year-over-year revenue growth, stopping at $1.47 billion. Other products and services saw 14% higher sales, adding up to $374 million. The typically sleepy direct sales of uniforms posted a 25% revenue increase in the second quarter, driven by a large order of branded garments from an unnamed Fortune 100 client. This order alone explains the bulk of Cintas' surprising growth across the board.The company also widened its profit margin to a significant degree. Cintas' operating margin stood at 16% in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and 18% in this week's report for Q2 2020. The company benefits from lower oil prices, which limits the costs of running its massive distribution and product delivery network. Cintas is also still integrating , a multiyear project that continues delivering synergies and cost-cutting opportunities along the way.Based on these solid second-quarter results, Cintas boosted its full-year revenue guidance by a hair, lifting the midpoint of the guidance range from $7.30 billion to $7.31 billion. The earnings projection increased by a larger margin, from roughly $8.52 per share to $8.70 per share.Image source: Getty Images.Cintas expects the G&K Services buyout to deliver annual cost savings of more than $130 by calendar year 2021. The company already holds a dominant market share with 1 million customers under contract, but the addressable market remains much larger, with 16 million different businesses in North America. Selling uniform rentals and other services to the unserved majority represents a massive growth opportunity for the long term, and Cintas is going after that target with a combination of large buyouts and a quality-first attitude.On the , when asked why new clients are choosing Cintas over other alternatives, CEO Mike Hansen underscored that commitment to quality:We need to be doing a pretty good job of showing why they are moving into a Cintas garment and what are the features and functions of that new garment. It may be that it's softer, it may be that fits a little bit better and may be that it's the fabric breezes a little bit better. And generally when we explain those kinds of features to the customer, they get it and they understand, and it doesn't take very long for them to be in those garments to recognize that there is a quality difference.Cintas shares rose slightly on the news, poised to open Wednesday's trading near $267 per share. That's a 61% increase in 52 weeks and a 260% gain over the last five years. On top of all of that, Cintas saw the strong report coming and  by 24% a couple of weeks ago.

"Image source: The Motley Fool. Q2 2020 , Good day, welcome to the Cintas Quarterly Earnings Results Conference Call. This call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir. -- Good evening, and thank you for joining us tonight. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our second quarter results for fiscal 2020. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss, I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.Revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 was a record $1.84 billion, an increase of 7.3% over last year's second quarter. The organic growth rate which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was also 7.3%. In the second quarter of fiscal 20, the organic growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment was 5.8% and the organic growth rate for the First-Aid and Safety Services operating segment was 10.6%.Gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal '20 of $852.4 million increased 10%. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 46.2% for the second quarter of fiscal '20 compared to 45.1% in the second quarter of fiscal '19. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment gross margin as a percentage of revenue improved 130 basis points from last year's second quarter to 46.6% and the First Aid and Safety Services operating segment gross margin improved 40 basis points to 48.4%.Operating income for the second quarter of fiscal '20 of $334.5 million increased 21.3%. Operating margin was 18.1% in the second quarter of fiscal '20 compared to 16% in fiscal '19. Operating income in the second quarter of fiscal '19 was impacted by integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition of $7.8 million or 50 basis points.Net income from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal '20 was $246.4 million and reported earnings per diluted share were $2.27. Excluding the one-time gain on the sale of a cost method investment and the G&K acquisition integration expenses both in fiscal '19, EPS increased 29%. As our Chairman and CEO, Scott Farmer was quoted in today's earnings press release, we are pleased with our second quarter and year-to-date performance.We thank our employee partners for continuing to execute well and take great care of our customers. In addition to the strong financial performance, we continue to generate strong cash flow and commit to effectively deploying cash to increase shareholder value. On December 6th, we paid an annual dividend of $2.55 per share, an increase of 24.4% over last year's annual dividend. We have increased the dividend for 36 consecutive years. In the past 10 years, the annual dividend per share increased at a compound annual growth rate of 18.2%.Before turning the call over to Paul for more details. I'll provide an update of our fiscal '20 expectations. We have increased our expectations of financial performance. We expect revenue to be in the range of $7.29 billion to $7.33 billion. We expect EPS to be in the range of $8.65 to $8.75. Note the following regarding the guidance, the growth rate at the revenue guidance range is 5.8% to 6.4%, however, our fiscal '20 contains one less workday than our fiscal '19. Adjusting for this one-day difference on a constant workday basis, the revenue growth rate range at guidance is 6.2% to 6.8%. One less workday also has a negative impact on EPS, reducing at about $0.06, which is a 90 basis point drag on the EPS growth rate. Adjusting for this, the EPS growth rate range is 14.7% to 16%. Guidance assumes an effective tax rate for fiscal '20 of 19.2% compared to a rate of 19.7% for fiscal '19. Keep in mind that the tax rate can move up or down from period-to-period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. It assumes the share count for computing EPS of 109 million shares. This consists of diluted weighted average shares outstanding plus participating securities in the form of restricted stock. The guidance does not assume any future share buybacks or any additional G&K integration expenses.I will now turn the call over to Paul. -- Thank you, Mike. Please note that our fiscal '20 contains one less workday than in fiscal '19. One less day will negatively impact of fiscal '20 total revenue growth by 40 basis points. To illustrate the magnitude of the headwind using fiscal '19's annual revenue, one less workday equates to about $27 million. One less workday also has a negative impact on operating margin and EPS. Fiscal '20 operating income margin will be reduced by about 12.5 basis points in comparison to fiscal '19 due to one less day of revenue. The negative impact on the margin occurs because certain expenses like amortization of uniforms and entrance mats are expensed on a monthly basis as opposed to on a daily basis, and we will have one less day of revenue to cover the expenses. As Mike stated, one less workday is a headwind of about 90 basis points on EPS growth and about a $0.06 drag on total EPS in comparison to fiscal '19.Each quarter of fiscal '20 contains 65 workdays. In comparison to fiscal '19, our upcoming Q3 of fiscal '20 will have one additional day and our Q4 will have one less day. Please keep the quarterly day differences in mind when modeling our fiscal '20 results. We have two reportable operating segments; Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in all Other. All Other consist of Fire Protection Services and our Uniform Direct Sale business.First Aid and Safety Services and all Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segments, includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route.Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1.47 billion, an increase of 5.7%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes, the organic growth rate was 5.8%. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment, gross margin was 46.6% for the second quarter compared to 45.3% in last year's second quarter, an improvement of 130 basis points. Operating income margin was a record 19.5% for the second quarter and it was 19% year-to-date. Profit margins have strengthened for many reasons, including strong revenue growth and realization of cost synergies from the acquisition of G&K.Our First Aid and Safety services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. The segment's revenue for the second quarter was $169.7 million. The organic growth rate for this segment was 10.6%. The first aid segment gross margin was 48.4% in the second quarter compared to 48% in last year's second quarter, an increase of 40 basis points. First aid segment gross margins continued to increase with strong revenue growth.Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the all Other category. Our fire business continues to grow each year at a strong pace. Uniform Direct Sale business growth rates are generally low single digits and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multi-million dollar account. Uniform Direct Sale, however, is a key business for us and as customers are often significant opportunities to cross-sell and provide products and services from our other business units.All Other revenue was $204.1 million, an increase of 17.2%. The organic growth rate was 16.5%. The fire business organic growth rate was 9.6%. Uniform direct sale business had an exceptionally strong quarter, posting an organic growth rate of 25% growth. Growth was driven in large part due to the roll out of cohort branded garments to a Fortune 100 customer. All Other gross margin was 41.8% for the second quarter of this fiscal year compared to 41.2% last year.Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 28.1% in the second quarter of fiscal '20 and 28.6% in the second quarter of fiscal '19. Improvement was realized in many areas, including lower G&A labor expense as a percent of revenue.Last quarter, we mentioned that medical expense as a percent of revenue spiked. It came back in line in the second quarter as we expected. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal '20 was 20.1%. Stock-based compensation positively impacted the tax rate. As Mike stated earlier, the tax rate can move from period-to-period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense.Our cash and equivalents balance as of November 30th was $226.5 million. Year-to-date, operating cash flow increased about 66% from last year because of strong earnings growth and improvements in working capital, particularly accounts receivable, inventories, uniforms and other rental items and service and accounts payable.Capital expenditures in the second quarter were $61.4 million. Our capex by operating segment was as follows: $48.6 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services, $10.8 million in First Aid and Safety and $2 million in all Other. We expect fiscal '20 capex to be in the range of $265 million to $290 million. As of November 30th, total debt was $2,738.4 million, $2,538.6 million was fixed interest rate debt and $199.8 million was variable rate debt in the form of a term loan. At November 30th, our leverage was 1.8 times debt to EBITDA.That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your question.[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Toni Kaplan at Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. -- Thanks very much and good afternoon. -- Hi, Tony. -- You did pretty solidly in the quarter, but only a modest 2% raise for the full year. Could you just talk about your expectations around maybe the broader macro and anything else that might be one-time in the quarter or might reverse as we go through the year. Just wondering why not a bigger raise? Thanks. -- And Toni, you are speaking of revenue right now. Correct. Yeah. And so from a -- let's talk about the quarter, we had a very good quarter. The -- all of our businesses grew, and in particular, our direct sale business had a really nice quarter. Toni, you had asked a little bit about the macro first, and I would say, not a lot of change during the quarter. We did say at the beginning of the quarter at energy, we were starting to see a little bit of softness in the energy area. We did see a little bit of that during the quarter, in fact, we had one fairly good size customer in this space go bankrupt. But I would say, the other thing is, industrials are a bit choppy generally speaking. Having said that, not a lot of change during the quarter, we are encouraged as we kind of think forward. We are encouraged that we've -- it looks like we've made some progress in the U.S. MCA and the China trade and we're encouraged by the movement there, and we look forward to getting those result. It seems like we've seen a little bit of a steady direction out of the fed on interest rates, and so as we leave the second quarter, I would say, there are some encouraging signs but there is still -- we're entering the election year, there is still -- there's a lot going on in terms of the noise in the marketplace and whether or not small businesses and other businesses will continue to invest. And so we still look a little bit with caution as we think about the second half of the year.As it relates to the guidance. Look, we had a very good first half of the year. Our partners did a great job and the year is playing out generally as we expected. We had growth of roughly 7% organic growth of over 7% for the first half of the year. But we also had some things that went our way. I talked a little bit about this in the first quarter where rental probably got a little bit of year-over-year benefit in the first quarter and that's certainly helped as we kind of -- we're finding the bottom last year in our rental business as we lap the G&K acquisition. So got a little bit of benefit in the first half there. We talked about pricing being incrementally positive in the fourth quarter and the first quarter, maybe not quite as incrementally positive in the second quarter, but certainly some benefit in the first half of the year. I would expect that it will fall back into kind of the pricing range we've been in the last few years.When you think about the direct sale business, we talked about that, we referred to that a few times, had a great year in the first half. In the second half, our expectation is as this business can be lumpy, that we'll be flat to down in that. And so just that alone is about 75 basis points of growth impact when you compare the first half to the second half. I talked a little bit about the outlook on the macro. And so as we think about the second half, we're thinking about the macro, we're thinking about -- there are some things that really went well in the first half, may not get all of that benefit in the second half. Having said all of that, look it's -- are seeing workday growth of 6.2% to 6.8% and the year is shaping up pretty much the way we expected it to, and if we can hit those kind of numbers, that's really nice year for us. -- That's great. And just wanted to ask about buybacks. You really pulled back pretty dramatically this quarter. Just wanted to get some color around, how we should be thinking about any sort of change to capital deployment philosophy or just why it's very minimal buybacks this quarter? Thanks. -- Yeah, we do have -- we've got the authorization of about $1.2 billion, and we look at that -- as we talk about, we look at that opportunistically. One thing to keep in mind is we -- in the first week of December, we made a $268 million payment related to our dividend and we also had some debt interest payments. So we're back in the CP in the month of December, but we'll look at the buyback opportunistically as we move through the rest of the year, and specifically to your question, we have not made any changes to the way we think about capital allocation. -- Thank you.We'll now take our next question from Hamzah Mazari at Jefferies. Please go ahead. -- Good afternoon. Thank you. My first question is just on the SAP roll out. Sort of just any update there and specifically, where do we see benefits once that's rolled out in April or May next year. Is that going to be an organic growth through cross-selling or do we see sort of SG&A come off? Any color as to benefits of on that roll out? -- Hamzah, we're about 85% of the way through our SAP journey at this point in time. So we've made some good progress in the quarter, and we're still on track to complete the project by the end of the fiscal year. As far as benefits are concerned, I think the benefits from SAP are going to be kind of throughout the P&L. We've talked about some of them already that can be achieved by locations individually, better technology in the half -- the hands of the people providing the services, better information at their disposal, the ability for our accounting and finance people and operations people to look at data from the very back of the house, all the way to invoicing and pricing with the customer. But then there are other benefits to that we believe we'll be benefiting the top line later on and more perhaps impactfully when the entire network is in the system.But certainly, we believe that putting the Uniform Rental business and our First Aid business in the same operating system will foster more collaboration, more cross selling which will help the top line. And just better, as I mentioned earlier, use of data, looking at our big large national accounts from city to city to city to do analysis and make sure that we're getting all the entitled revenue that we should pretty agreements, make sure the pricing is appropriate for the contract. So lots of opportunities, but not able to quantify anything at this point in time. As I said, we'll complete that roll out this fiscal year and have more color next fiscal year for you. -- That's very helpful. And just a follow-up question. I'll turn it over. When you think about M&A outside of core Uniform Rental and the businesses you're in. What are some of the metrics you're looking at? I know you want to touch more businesses. I assume it's rough base, does it have to be accretive to growth, accretive to margin. I know you guys did shred it a long time ago and you know that business got sold. We did G&K that was part of the core, just any color as to metrics you can share how you think about larger M&A outside the core? Thank you. -- Sure. We. First of all, we look for B2B. We love the recurring revenue and nature of our kinds of businesses. Route based is preferred, but it's not absolutely necessary, the key is what kind of service can we add to provide some level of value to the customer. So it's -- that's the real key. We wanted to be -- we would wanted to be an opportunity that can add value to many of our customers, not just the small subset. And we would wanted to have margin potential. So you asked does it need to be growth accretive and margin accretive. We certainly would love it to be. But there really aren't that many out there. We're looking hard forum, but those are the kind of things that we will look for. Recurring revenue streams, can it benefit our current customers, is it a large opportunity for us or is it very narrow, what's the service component. -- Very helpful. Thanks. Thanks a lot. Mike. -- Okay. -- And I'll take our next question from Manav Patnaik at Barclays. Please go ahead. -- Thank you. Good evening, guys. My first question is just -- can you just walk us through why the lower capex assumption? And then maybe just some context, when you look at the -- over the next two to three years, like -- I guess where are your greatest investment needs? -- Yeah. We generally we are making our capex in terms of our growth opportunities like new routes and in adding capacity. I would say, we continue to add the routes, so in other words, buying trucks and that is certainly important for us. But as it relates to laundry capacity, for example, we've got some really interesting projects that are going on that we think can help us out in certain cases. And so we're seeing a little bit of a benefit because of that. I've talked a little bit about G&K auto sort that's kind of a quasi auto sort that helps us in certain facilities and we're moving on rolling out some of those kind of things we're looking at things like efficiency in the Wash Alley and then we certainly still have a little bit of the capacity that we have gotten from the G&K acquisition. So the combination of all of those things has created efficiency opportunities for us, particularly in the production environment and you're seeing a little bit of that benefit in our gross margin. -- Got it. And then just in terms of G&K and maybe tied to the SAP implementation, are their systems, I guess, on SAP as well? And is it still too hard for you guys to quantify any revenue synergies that you might be getting from that deal? -- Well, keep in mind, we converted all G&K locations to either the Cintas SAP system or the legacy Cintas system. So that we could fully get off of that system and that was completed, gosh probably over a year ago. And so we still have some of those that need to get from the Cintas legacy system to SAP. And so it's -- we inserted those locations as it made sense into the SAP roll out. And so we're almost there. Paul said we're 85% of the way there in total in terms of the conversion and we made good progress. So we have a pretty good handle on in terms of viewing the G&K legacy locations in much the same the way that we're viewing the Cintas locations. And so we see some benefits there is, I would call them anecdotal, we need to get all the way on SAP before we really start taking advantage of the power of that information. -- All right. Thank you, guys.I'll take our next question from Andrew Steinerman at JPMorgan. Please go ahead. -- Hey Mike, you mentioned just treat G&K legacy locations like Cintas locations. I wanted to know about the inventory and how much of the uniforms today are still the G&K uniforms and when you convert over and introduce Cintas uniforms, which are presumably better Uniform to G&K legacy customers, how have they responded and has there been a price adjustments since they getting better uniforms? -- From an inventory conversion standpoint, we're in the midst of that and those happen at such different times, Andrew. So for example, if we have a customer that's got 10 wares, for example, in legacy G&K inventory, we may be in a style where as they churn, in other words, as they have turnover and they replaced their open positions with new hires and we put them into legacy G&K current garments there's going to be a point in time at which we run out of those garments whether it's the style or the size. And that happens have very different intervals depending on the kind of garment that they have. And so it is a customer-by-customer approach. When they start to run out of -- when we start to run out of G&K legacy garments, we will start to put them into Cintas garments and generally that can be all at once, because we don't want them to have different looks. But as I said, that is a customer-by-customer decision point based on the styles. So it's really hard to give you a full percentage because it's happening all over the country. We are not finished with that. We are still working our way through G&K legacy inventory. When they get onto Cintas inventory, as you know, pricing becomes a customer-by-customer conversation as well and there may be some where we -- there is no change at all and we've put them in something that's, let's say, at a workwear type of a garment. There may be others where we give them an opportunity to upgrade into a cohort garment, for example, and in that case, there may be times where we will increase the pricing or adjust the pricing as it's necessary. So it is a customer-by-customer decision on when to convert and then it's also a customer-by-customer decision on what does that pricing and what does that contract look like. -- And do you think the customer recognizes that the Cintas uniform on average is a better uniform than the legacy uniforms ahead? -- You know, I can give you anecdotally the answer is yes. We need to be doing a pretty good job of showing why they are moving into a Cintas garment and what are the features and functions of that new garment, it may be that it's softer, it may be that fits a little bit better and may be that it's the fabric breezes a little bit better. And generally when we explain those kinds of features to the customer, they get it and they understand and it doesn't take very long for them to be in those garments to recognize that there is a quality difference. -- Okay. Thank you.We'll take our next question from Gary Bisbee at Bank of America. Please go ahead. -- Hey guys, good evening and happy holidays. I guess the first question from me, just the Uniform Rental revenue slowed somewhat obviously had a much tougher comp, but anything other than that I guess you mentioned one a little weaker energy, anything other than that you call out in the sequential deceleration in the organic consequently revenue growth? -- Yeah, I don't think it's anything of real significance, but I would point to the three things I mentioned earlier, a little bit of the absence of that lapping, a little bit of the chopping in the energy and maybe industrials generally and pricing may be wasn't quite as incrementally positive as we've seen in the previous two quarters. I think those things kind of capture what we saw in the quarter, still a good quarter for us, but I think those things capture. -- Okay. And then you've been asked for a few years about cross-sell potential both within G&K and just more broadly against your different businesses and I realize you don't have the data and haven't provided real granular color. But can you give us any sense like as your salespeople for the main businesses go out, how often are they targeting people that are customers of your other businesses. How important is cross-sell in terms of how you're trying to compensate the different types of salespeople. Is it really something you've focused a lot on to date or should we think that the data that SAP will provide is really going to be the key to unlocking that more broadly? -- We do spend a lot of time with that today, Gary. Our SSRs are looking for opportunities. We have our -- we call market development reps who are looking at some of our more complex customers and looking for upsell and penetration opportunities there. And we've become a bit better at the cross-sell between Rental and First Aid and fire. I think we still have some ways to go there to take advantage of all of that opportunity, but we're starting to spend more time than in the past. So it has been important to us, and I think we've been doing a pretty good job of that over the last few years, including in the last probably 18 months with G&K legacy customers. But having said that, SAP will unlock some additional potential that is going to be something that should prove to be a nice opportunity for us. -- Great. And then just one more and this isn't so much next quarter or anything like that. But as we think out over the next few years in sort of a normalized economy. How are you thinking about incremental operating margins these days? What's the potential -- they've been obviously terrific the last few years, particularly as the G&K savings have flown through but what's like a long-term target or opportunity there? -- Yeah. We still like the -- we talk a lot about incrementals of 20% to 30%. We're getting pretty darn close to the bottom of that with our Rental Division. But as we continue to get success with penetration opportunities to get success in some of the verticals that can be even bigger types of customers with a service opportunity that's more efficient. We think there are still opportunities and that incremental as we move forward, we think that incremental certainly is in the 20% to 30% and you know if we can capitalize on some of those different things that we talked about, the penetration, the sales into these customers with maybe more efficient service aspects, the capacity efficiencies. We think we can get that incremental into that mid 20% type of a neighborhood. So it's a nice opportunity that looks that we look forward too. -- Great. That's all I've got. Thanks.We'll now take our next question from Andrew Wittmann at R.W. Baird. Please go ahead. -- Yeah. Great. Thanks for taking my questions here. Yeah, I was looking at the two-year growth rate stack and your rental segment looks like the accounts prove out, it's 12.4 over the last few years, both for the first quarter and the second quarter, but kind of brings to the question, you've talked about in the past, which is your sales force productivity, you mentioned that kind of the headwinds for the deceleration in the growth rate, but I was just wondering how the sales force is performing for you. I think it was not that many quarters ago, you said even the G&K people that you kept on were producing at record levels. Can you just give us an update, Mike about what you're seeing out of them in terms of their ability to add gross new customers? -- When we think about total in -- look, we have one sales team. And so that sales team continues to perform well. And they're doing a nice job of adding customers and selling into existing customers. Their productivity levels are still -- this quarter was a little bit higher than last year in this quarter. So we're still making some really nice improvements. So we are still very pleased with the sales rep productivity. -- That's helpful. And then -- sorry. And then I guess I wanted to maybe Paul, if you could just help us a little bit on some of that in the cost structure. I think typically you've given energy as a percentage of your rental segment revenue. How much of the benefit was that? And just any other details that you could call in the cost structure. I think labor has been something that people would flag maybe that would be something you address. You mentioned healthcare that is back to normal, but is there anything else you can help us understand the moving pieces inside the margins I think it would be helpful. -- Yeah, Andy, energy was a 20 basis point benefit year-over-year, flat sequentially. So I think that's -- if oil continues, the price per barrel in the second half where it is in the first half, it will be a little bit of a tailwind for us in the cost structure in the second half. Labor, I would say overall in check. We talked about gosh -- was probably a year ago now about certain areas of our workforce, particularly in the production area, we were having some labor inflation and we made some changes. So we believe that was behind us and we want to have to make any further adjustments there. But otherwise, inflation is normal, I would say, it's something that we've been able to deal with, it's certainly tight, but it hasn't prevented us from running the business and serving our customers. -- Yeah. And Andy when you think about our gross margins, for example, we've seen some really nice and year-over-year improvement in this first half of the year and certainly the growth levels have been good and that helps. So we're getting really nice leverage, our salespeople are productive and they're selling good profitable business and that's been good. And we are -- we've done a nice job of capturing the G&K synergies, but what we're also seeing a little bit of as we've talked about over the last few years, there is a lot of inefficiency in running the facilities, when you're going through a lot of conversion of incorporating G&K volumes into Cintas legacy plants and closing those plants and rebar coding inventory and there is a lot of work that goes on there and really what we've seen in the first half of the year is we've captured those G&K synergies just as we wanted them too. And we've seen some real nice efficiency gains because there aren't quite as many of those projects going on. Those are a little bit more in the past. And so, are we -- the timing for us has been kind of fortunate and good from the standpoint of when we were seeing a little bit of pressure in our production labor, for example, we were also making some synergies and capturing some synergies there too and we've been able to get more efficient in this first half of the year and I think that's a little bit of what you're seeing. -- All right. Thanks. I'll leave it there, guys.We'll now take our next question from Scott Schneeberger at Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. -- Good evening guys. It's Daniel on for Scott. You discussed efficiencies earlier. Could you provide a little bit more perspective on some type of efficiencies to pursue want to go-forward basis besides the route optimization and a little bit color on automation of processes and use the advanced technology and how that is applied and where you could go there with? Thank you. -- Sure. We are always looking for them. And so when we think about efficiencies going forward, I've talked a little bit about capacity. How can we continue to get more efficient in terms of using our Wash Alley, some of that is automation, I'm sorry, technology and some of that is a Six Sigma like process improvement there are opportunities there. We still have a lot of route optimization to go, that is both a little bit of technology, but just its customer touching and so we're being cautious in that regard. We've talked about getting through the SAP conversion and as we are able to then pull off of the legacy Cintas system a bit. That's going to create some efficiency just that because we won't have duplicate systems, but also then using that technology for things like sales rep productivity gains and cross-selling and penetration opportunities, so that we do have a number of those different efficiency opportunities as well as then just typically the Six Sigma processes that we're always working on and how can we get better and as the business changes can we get more efficient in the way we move product and through our plants and provide services. We're looking at all of those different things, but we think we've got some nice opportunities ahead. -- Got it. That's helpful. Thank you. Switching gears a little bit, cotton price has been down in the first half of this fiscal year on a year-over-year basis. Could you please discuss half of that is impacting earnings. I mean I know historically you've smooth that out through amortization, but how is that really impacting your earnings presently? Thank you. -- Not really any impact in the first half of this year. We are, as you mentioned, it takes a while for that cotton price to ripple through into our P&L, if we have to sell the garments, we have to bring the garments into our distribution center. We then ship them from our distribution centers out to our rental locations, and at that point they start an 18 months amortization process, so it takes a while. And then even when it does get through, we're generally smoothing that out as you said, because we've got, if we see a spike for a few months, you might have 118 fourth of that in one month, you may could have two or 318th fourth of that. It's got to be sustained movement in that before it really starts to hit us and keep in mind cotton isn't a -- it's not one of the more significant pieces of our cost structure. So if you think about our cost structure, our cost of rentals is you can think of it in three buckets, one is material cost, one is production, part of this running of our laundry facilities and the third is our service costs, so the routing. The cotton piece is then part of that material cost, but that material cost includes also the labor content to serve garments, the freight on the garments, the trim on the garments, etc. And so it really takes some sustained large movement in cotton before it really starts to impact us. -- Got it. Helpful color. Thank you very much.We'll take the next question from George Tong at Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. -- Hi, thanks, good afternoon. Your revenue outlook has certainly improved from where it was a quarter ago, you discussed the macro factors that are impacting this, but can you elaborate on some internal initiatives where you're seeing traction that improves your revenue expectations for the full year? -- Well, there they are -- things generally George that, that we've been working on for a while and that is we are looking to continuously focus on some of the verticals that have been really powerful for us. So for example, the healthcare vertical, the education government hospitality, those places where the sales are a little bit more complex. The purchasing decisions might be a little bit more complex and we've made some really good progress in those areas and we still are in the early innings and think there are great opportunities as we move ahead. And so those are areas that are really important to us.The penetration, I mentioned that we have been working more on the penetration opportunities, I think we can get better and more opportunities ahead for that area as well and the penetration is both better coordination between our businesses but also taking advantage of our newer products and making sure we're getting things like [Indecipherable] works in front of all of the right decision makers. And so it's really continuing to move forward with our -- what we believe to be our unique products that create opportunity in the marketplace. We are doing the same kinds of things in our First Aid and Safety business where we are looking for those penetration opportunities, product adjacencies are great and continue to look for larger national types of customers as well in both First Aid and our fire businesses. So we're doing all of those things. We've made some really nice progress and we think we've got a really nice year ahead of us as we move into the second half. -- Got it. That's helpful. Your gross margins expanded about 110 basis points year-over-year in the quarter, can you discuss how much pricing contributed to this margin expansion and how sustainable pricing increases are at the current pace? -- Pricing, certainly has an impact, I mentioned that it wasn't quite incrementally positive in this quarter as it had been in the previous two quarters. And so I would say the pricing is somewhat in line with what we've seen over the last couple of years, absent the last couple of quarters. Generally, we've been able to when we can show value and when we can have the right conversations with our customers. Generally, we've been able to get some pricing and I don't see that necessarily changing, but I would -- as it relates to then the margin opportunity and the margin improvement. It's really more about the growth creates leverage, it creates efficiencies in our plants, when we grow in our rental business in particular where we don't use capacity like our restroom and hygiene products, we effectively get some really nice leverage and get more efficient with the capacity. And in addition to that we've pulled out a little bit of inefficiency in the business. So more of the gross margin improvement relates to the revenue of the business, the leveraging and the efficiencies that we're able to gain. -- Very helpful. Thank you.I'll take the next question from Kevin McVeigh at Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. -- Great, thanks. Hey, just to follow-up on the guidance a little bit, I know last year there was some severe weather in the third quarter that was kind of unexpected. Do you have any kind of just thoughts on or any allowance for that in the Q3 guide obviously with -- obviously which would be incorporated into the full year or how are you thinking about just the weather impact as we work our way through the back half of the year? -- Yeah, good question. Last year in the third quarter, we talked a little bit about the weather and the holidays. It's hard to predict the weather. And so we are -- I would say, we're not trying to build in any particular weather pattern. As it relates to the holidays, one of the things we talked about last year was Christmas and New Year's falling on a Tuesday, which was the first time in a number of years. And that has an impacted . This year the holidays both fall on a Wednesday, and the last time they fell on a Wednesday, I think it was like our fiscal '14 year. So it's been a bit of a time period since we've had a Wednesday. And so if you think about our weekly flow of volume you can think of it as a bit of a bell curve Monday -- Mondays and Friday's I would call are our maybe our lower days and our as you go from Monday to Tuesday that when the volume starts to build because customers are just more, they're more easy to see etc. Wednesday tends to be one of our heavier days, and then you start to come back down as you go through the rest of the week. With -- by the holidays, both being on a Wednesday, this year we are considering that we will have any year-over-year benefit because of the comments we made last year during the holidays. We're kind of thinking that look, we're going to still have that holiday disruption a little bit. I don't think it necessarily will be a drag on growth, but it's certainly, it isn't going to help us with an easier comp. -- Super helpful. And then just the margins again really nice. And if I have a right. It looks like kind of the other category at least outpaced our estimates that can be kind of uniform sales which are lower margin. Is there anything else in there that's helping boost the gross margins overall despite the mix? -- We are continuing to make improvements in the fire business. We really like that business and it has performed very well in the second quarter and in the first half. And as we gain -- as we get bigger and we gain scale and we -- that revenue growth allows us to leverage our infrastructure a bit better. It creates more dense routes and that creates some margin opportunity. We've got a long way to go. But certainly have seen some nice performance in the fire business and certainly the heavy volume in our direct sale business was a bit of a health too. -- Super. Thank you.We'll take the next question from Seth Weber at RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. -- Hey guys, good afternoon. Most of the questions asked and answered, but I wanted to see if we could dig into your -- you've made the pricing comments a few times now, just a little bit less robust than maybe what we saw in the first quarter, is there anything you'd call out, is it a mix issue or the comps just getting harder or is there something going on from a competitive front that you would highlight? Thanks. -- I think it's a bunch of different things, Seth. I think it's a -- there is a little bit of mix going on. We've had some good performance in a few quarters in a row now, and if that's kind of outperformance isn't sustainable in the long term, and I don't think it's anything that we are concerned about. But just something a little bit of maybe a notch below where we had seen in the last couple of quarters, made up of a number of different things. -- Okay. And then just on working capital has been frankly better than what we would have thought given the growth trajectory. I mean do you think that working capital can continue to be just a little bit better than normal. Normally, I think you expect to see a little bit more usage here. Has there something you'd call out that's really helping that or can we expect that to continue? Thanks. -- Well, look from a working capital standpoint, we certainly have been in a period of disruption over the last couple of years, as it relates to our accounts receivable converting two systems as it relates to our inventory and shutting down DCs, opening new DCs, converting a lot of volume. And we're starting to get some of those inefficiencies and disruptions behind us. And so for example in accounts receivable, we've seen a nice improvement year-over-year and that's part because we've gotten a little bit of that disruption behind us. There still is some system conversion to go, but we think we're getting a little bit better and better and more efficient at it. If you think about the -- I'll sort of to a cash flow for a second, when you think about our operating cash flow, it was pretty strong this quarter and really for the first six months of the year and our conversion of net income to cash -- operating cash flow has been over 100%. I would expect that that's going to continue for the second half of the year. Free cash flow was really strong and I think that's going to be strong for the rest of the year. And so I think more than anything Seth, it's getting a little bit of this disruption of two system conversions, a new business conversion, a little bit of that stuff behind us. But as we've talked in the past, when we are growing we're generally going to use some working capital, in other words, we're going to see AR continue to increase. We're going to see, generally speaking, inventory and in service inventories grow over time, inventory is a little bit different from a standpoint of we do have opportunities there where some of those opportunities will create more inventory. For example, if we believe we can have enough volume to bring new products into our distribution center that may create new inventory. However, as we get more efficient and you get the G&K conversion behind us, that's going to create some forecasting and supply chain opportunities. So there's going to be some ups and downs in that inventory line item, but generally the performance has been good. We've gotten a little bit of that disruption behind us, but we're generally going to be a user of the working capital. -- Okay, super helpful. Thank you, guys. Have a good night. -- Thanks.It appears there are no further questions at this time. So I'd like to turn the conference back to the speakers. Please go ahead. -- Well, thanks very much for joining us tonight. We will issue our third quarter financial results in March, and we look forward to speaking with you again at that time, and we wish you all happy holidays. --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --

t's almost the end of 2019 and time to look back and reflect on the strongest-performing industrial stocks of the year. The interesting thing about the top 10 is how diverse they are. Outside of aerospace -- , , and  have heavy exposure -- the recurring theme is that stock selection was key in 2019. It was a year where industrial production growth slowed more than expected, and investors were forced to find niche markets or individual stock stories in order to outperform. Let's take a look at how and why these stocks did so well in 2019.It's been another strong year for the aerospace industry and particularly for the aftermarket. While it's true that commercial airline passenger growth slowed to 4.2% from 7.4% in 2018, a combination of the Boeing 737 MAX grounding (meaning older planes would have been run more than expected) and an aging worldwide fleet meant that aftermarket revenue remained strong for GE, Heico, and TransDigm.Image source: Getty Images.Looking ahead, there is a slight concern that the return to service of the 737 MAX and the International Air Transport Association's forecast for passenger growth to slow to 4.1% will mean that commercial aviation aftermarket revenue growth could slow a bit. This is a concern when you consider that HEICO and TransDigm trade on 43 times and 23 times next year's earnings respectively. GE's rise is partly down to aerospace, but it's also a consequence of the company beating the low expectations set by CEO Larry Culp when he took over last year. In addition,  and GE's restructuring cost expectations have been lowered. All told, it's been a year of positive, if slow, progress at GE and shareholders have been rewarded for seeing value opportunity.Data source: Author's analysis. Ycharts data.Two decades ago Teledyne generated nearly two-thirds of its revenue from aerospace and defense, but a string of acquisitions and divestitures has left the company generating just 22% from aerospace and defense, with around a third of revenue coming from digital imaging and instrumentation respectively. The strategy has led to significant increases in margin and free cash flow generation over the years, and Teledyne's strong performance continues. data by Leidos also has aerospace exposure through its work integrating systems at Air Navigation Service Providers (such as the Federal Aviation Authority, or FAA) and airport operators across the globe, but since nearly half its revenue is generated from defense work it's arguably a play on government spending, particularly on defense. On less than 17 times forward earnings, Leidos doesn't look expensive, but it's always going to be a stock subject to political uncertainty.Barcode scanners, printers, and mobile computers may not seem like a strong growth market, but if companies are increasingly automating manufacturing and warehousing -- notably in e-fulfillment -- they will need to capture and analyze data. Similarly, retail and healthcare companies are increasingly seeking to gather data on stock/people in order to improve outcomes.This is where Zebra's scanners and computers come in. As such,  to improve the performance of physical assets. Cintas's core uniform and businesses services business is always a useful bellwether of the economy. The good news is that ongoing economic growth coupled with low unemployment . In addition, the company continues to add complementary services -- such as first aid kits and fire and safety solutions -- with which it can sell to its existing client base. Dover Corp's rise is largely down to the self-help initiatives that its management has put in place to cut costs and improve operating margin -- salutary proof that companies don't necessarily need help from end markets or the economy to generate earnings growth.As you can see below, Dover's operating margin expansion came down to a drop in sales and general and administrative costs, rather than any increase in gross margin.  even if its stock looks close to fair value.  data by Allegion's security doors and locks are . Meanwhile, the embedding of web-enabled devices is allowing its customers to create a wealth of data and information with which to monitor and control the movement of people for security reasons. It remains . It's been a great year for the beverage can and packaging companies such as Crown Holdings. The market has warmed to the fact that these companies have relatively stable revenue growth with customers tied up on long-term contracts. Moreover, there's a sense that aluminum is  -- aluminum is easily recycled -- and the  because aluminum prices tend to fall when the economy does, while people still keep consuming beverages.It's unlikely that all these stocks will repeat their performance next year, but the long-term prospects for companies like Crown, Zebra, Allegion, and even GE -- provided the gas turbine market improves -- provide a solid foundation for their stock for the long term. They are all worth a look for investors in 2020. When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"ith the holiday season in full swing, many of us are more interested in our wish lists than our stock watch lists, but the end of the year can still be a great time to invest. It's especially important for investors to keep an eye on  -- stocks, not gifts -- and be ready to pounce if the opportunity arises.Three stocks that you'll want to keep on your radar in December are , , and . Here's why, and what you should look for that might push these watch list entries into your ""buy"" column.For investors, a list of top stocks to watch is almost as important as a holiday wish list. Image source: Getty Images.It's hard to argue that uniform renter and business services provider Cintas hasn't been a successful long-term investment. Despite its large-cap status,  249.2% over the last five years, trouncing the 's 50.2% return over the same time frame. Record-low unemployment -- together with some strategic acquisitions -- has helped Cintas maintain steady growth in its core uniform rental segment.Meanwhile, Cintas has also been investing in the other services it offers, including first aid kit restocking and fire and safety equipment maintenance and service. Its large existing customer base has allowed it to grow these other services -- which can be handled by the same employee and vehicle that does the uniform rental, to keep costs low -- at an even faster clip than its core uniform rental business.Cintas has already increased its guidance for fiscal 2020 (which ends May 31, 2020), expecting top-line growth in the 6%-6.6% range over fiscal 2019, and even stronger bottom-line growth of 11.4%-12.8%. However, all these high expectations and soaring share price have pushed the stock's price-to-earnings ratio above 30 -- a 15-year high. That's a lofty valuation for a company that's likely to take a big hit if the cyclical labor market starts showing signs of weakness. Still, Cintas' leading market position and growth prospects should keep it on your watch list, especially as the company reports Q2 earnings on Dec. 16. Another company reporting earnings on Dec. 16 is Midwestern gas station operator Casey's General Stores. Like many other service station companies, Casey's sells gas, but the big money is in the food and retail sales from its convenience stores. Unlike many other chains, Casey's primarily operates in exurban and rural areas, which brings a unique set of challenges and opportunities.Casey's new CEO, Darren Rebelez, has been overseeing  to use technology to wring more value out of the existing business. These include a price optimization tool to adjust gas prices at individual locations, which resulted in a 400-basis-point fuel margin improvement after it debuted in Q1 2019; a new fleet card program for small business customers; and an app that allows customers to order food -- particularly the chain's popular pizzas -- in advance. These initiatives have Wall Street expecting big things from the stock.Like Cintas, though, Casey's P/E ratio is near 30 -- 29.3, to be exact. That's practically an all-time high for the company, and raises concerns about whether the stock can be considered anything close to a bargain. Certainly, if Casey's releases another stellar earnings report, that valuation -- and its underlying share price -- could well go up again, but investors may want to sit this one out for now.Although it won't report earnings until late January at the earliest, ExxonMobil is on the list of stocks to watch this December because of a recent event that a lot of investors missed. The oil major's dividend yield recently surpassed 5% for the first time in the 21st century.In the year 2000, Exxon achieved Dividend Aristocrat status by increasing its dividend each year for 25 years. But in 2004, despite continuing to up its payout each year, its dividend yield lagged those of its big oil peers. That situation persisted until 2017, when its yield finally surpassed 's. While its 5% yield is still a far cry from big yielders and (both of which currently pay more than 6.5%), it's creeping up on French peer 's 5.5%.Investors have been concerned about Exxon's declining production levels, especially as oil and gas prices have fallen this year. The company plans to turn things around through increased capital spending, but it's an ongoing process. A yield of 5% should encourage income investors to keep an eye on . The holidays are a busy time, and it's easy to forget about investing until after the ball drops in Times Square. But savvy investors are constantly keeping at least one eye on their watch lists, no matter how busy things get. Amid all the hustle and bustle, consider adding Cintas, Casey's, and ExxonMobil to your watch list. And then, like Santa, be sure to check it (at least) twice.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"egendary investor Warren Buffett advises to be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful.  One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100.  A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.

In trading on Wednesday, shares of Cintas Corporation (Symbol: CTAS) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 28.1, after changing hands as low as $247.67 per share.  By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) is 66.0.  A bullish investor could look at CTAS's 28.1 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.    The chart below shows the one year performance of CTAS shares:
   
   

Looking at the chart above, CTAS's low point in its 52 week range is $155.98 per share, with $277.85 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $249.63.

"I'm not sure if ""boring stocks"" are ever going to make it as an asset class of their own, but it serves as a useful epithet to describe factors that certain stocks have in common. Stocks like cleaning and household products company  , corporate apparel company , and heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and refrigeration (HVACR) distributor   are easy-to-understand businesses that quietly operate within their own niches while paying dividends to investors. If that's the kind of stress-free ride that you want as an investor, then these stocks might be for you.Watsco's business model is simple. In fact, it's so simple it's explained away in one slide in its investor presentations. An HVACR unit breaks down, a Watsco contractor is called in to fix it, and the contractor duly sources a part or a new unit in order to fix the problem. That's how Watsco makes money.Boring stocks give you a relaxed life. Image source: Getty Images.HVACR servicing is a relatively stable end market with 65% to 70% of sales coming from replacement demand and only 10% to15% from more cyclical new housing demand. It also helps that, of the 110 million HVAC units installed in the U.S., about 92 million of them are over 10 years old -- older equipment tends to be serviced more.It's a highly fragmented market, but Watsco is the clear market leader with more than 2.5 times the revenue of its nearest competitor. It's a position built up partly through its joint venture with '  HVAC company, Carrier -- one the largest HVAC suppliers in the world and a company set to be spun off in 2020.  Moreover, as the market leader, Watsco continues to consolidate the industry, pursuing a policy of buying and building its business by acquiring smaller companies in order to gain market share or expand its geography.This has resulted in a company with relatively stable operating margins -- a hallmark of a boring company -- with a revenue growth opportunity by consolidating its industry. It's all added up to some impressive operating income growth over the year, as the revenue increases have dropped into profits thanks to stable margins. data by Throw in the potential to improve productivity through using web-enabled devices to help its contractors be more effective in the field, and there is an opportunity to expand margin even more. That's something that its investors -- already enjoying a 3.5% dividend yield -- will surely welcome.It's a bit of a stretch to call Cintas a dividend play -- a 1% yield won't satisfy most investors --  but it's definitely a boring company. After all, it's hard to make providing corporate uniforms and apparel sound like an exciting business. No matter, Cintas shareholders won't care about that. Instead, they will simply point to the stock's market-busting performance over the last decade should they need a thrill or two.In addition, if you had bought Cintas a decade ago -- and the price of the stock was still at around $29 then -- it would be yielding close to 9% right now. Dividend increases aren't just important for the income; they can also lead to substantive capital gains due to stock price appreciation. data by Moreover, Cintas isn't just about uniform rental, because once it's established a point of contact with a customer it can sell other services such as restroom cleaning, carpet and tile cleaning, and first aid and safety products and services, too. Just as with Watsco, Cintas is a business operating within a profitable niche and with an opportunity to build scale. However, the interesting thing is that Cintas has also demonstrated an ability to expand margin over time -- although to be fair, this is also partly a function of ongoing growth in the economy and tightening labor market. data by If you believe the U.S. economy is headed for long-term growth, then Cintas is well worth a look.You can't get much more boring than home care and professional cleaning products (34% of revenue), household products including cat litter, bags, and charcoal (totaling 30% of revenue), and assorted lifestyle products (20% of revenue) including water filters, dietary supplements, and personal care products.That said, 80% of its brands are No. 1 or No. 2 within their product category, and management is on a drive to improve margin and free cash flow (FCF) generation via cost-cutting and investing in its leading brands. As such, FCF generated from sales has improved to 13% in 2019 from just 10% in 2014. As a result, Clorox has been able to expand its dividend per share over the years -- in fact, Clorox is a dividend aristocrat, having raised its dividend for more than 25 consecutive years -- and it currently sports a 2.8% dividend yield. data by If Clorox can continue to be a market leader, its longtime history of raising dividends is likely to continue. None of these stocks are particularly cheap -- they all trade on a forward P/E ratio around 20 -- but if forced to pick one of them, then Watsco stands out as having a combination of revenue and margin expansion prospects. The installed base of HVAC units promises solid underlying growth, while the opportunity to use technology to improve productivity is compelling.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, , has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Clorox wasn't one of them!

"nvesting in companies you don't understand isn't really investing at all. That would be gambling at best -- throwing money at an unknown target and hoping for the best. , as master investor Peter Lynch said. That's the best way to ensure that you're separating the truly promising wheat from the worthless chaff -- before putting real money into any of them.With that in mind, here's a handful of companies that every investor should be able to understand in a hurry. If you don't have any particular field of expertise from which to launch your investing strategy, these super-simple business models would be .Image source: Getty Images.Business owners in need of uniforms, cleaning services, and logotype-adorned promotional items often go straight to   for help. The company is a leader in all of the market niches mentioned, turning Cintas into a pretty good measuring stick for the economy as a whole.This company provides essential services to every sector. Cintas counts more than 1 million companies among its clients, chiefly focused on uniform rentals and facility services in North America. This company does all the boring maintenance stuff for other businesses, allowing the clients to focus on whatever it is they do best.You probably learned all you need to know about Cintas' business model from the first sentence in this section. It really is that simple. Cintas is very good at its chosen field of expertise, and the ho-hum uniform rental service is actually a cash machine that drove Cintas shares to market-crushing returns over the last 10 years: data by See, you can beat the market without getting fancy. Cintas dominates a clearly defined market niche, and shareholders can laugh about it all the way to the bank.I don't have to tell you how   makes money. I'll do it anyway, just so you can see how incredibly simple this company is.Starbucks sells coffee and related products. Sure, customers could make their own coffee at a large discount to Starbucks' premium drink prices, but they keep coming back to the coffee shop because it's a convenient way to get your hands on a well-made cup o' joe.You can dive deeper into certain wrinkles of the Starbucks model, of course. Some Starbucks stores are company-owned and others are franchised locations under the management of local business owners. The company must keep its product quality reliably high, or else the whole business model falls apart. Other than that, Starbucks' management can focus on creating effective marketing campaigns and expanding into new international markets. Those are the most difficult parts of this sophisticated yet uncomplicated company.I don't have to tell you that Starbucks tends to beat the market too, right? Everybody knows, and here's all the evidence you need: data by Again, you already know this company.   is a leading provider of internet-based entertainment services, having kick-started the market for streaming video . What began as an inventive take on movie rentals, shipping DVD discs in red envelopes, morphed into a video-streaming service in a hurry. You might recall , where Netflix made that switch official -- in a painfully awkward way.OK, I am getting carried away here. You don't have to know much about Netflix's history in order to understand how it operates today. But the company has been in the public spotlight for so long that you probably do know what I was talking about a minute ago.Appropriately enough, you can boil Netflix's business down to a classic movie quote.-- , 1989That's it. Netflix has built a user-friendly video-streaming service that lets viewers consume its content on pretty much any device with a screen and an internet connection, in any country where it is legal to do business with American companies. As long as Netflix keeps feeding high-quality content into , subscribers will come back for more -- and bring their friends.Like Starbucks, it's easy to get lost in the complexities of Netflix's detailed operations. The company is producing a lot of content of its own nowadays, replacing the old model of licensing shows and movies from other companies. Cash flows are negative at the moment but management expects to turn that metric positive in a few years. Every international market comes with its own set of cultural and legal challenges. Nobody really knows how consumer tastes will change in the next year or the next decade. Netflix has to adjust to all of these details and more.But it's OK if most of that goes over your head because the Kevin Costner quote above really does cover it all. The company's official long-term strategy  says the same thing in different words:""Netflix is a global streaming entertainment service offering movies and TV series commercial-free, with unlimited viewing on any internet-connected screen for an affordable, no-commitment monthly fee.""If Cintas and Starbucks stomped the market over the past decade, Netflix made both of them look glacial by comparison: data by ...and Netflix did it all with the same unwavering focus on improving the user experience. That's really all you need to know about Netflix. It's one of the simplest business models I know, and it belongs in every long-term investor's portfolio.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''.  These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand.  Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).  Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

ll investors hope to multiply their money tenfold, a hundredfold, or more. But if it were easy to pick a stock that was going to turn a modest investment into a pile of loot, everybody would be rich. Still, there's a lot you can learn from looking at top-performing stocks that have done just that for their investors. Three stocks that would have turned a $10,000 investment into $60,000 -- or even more -- in just 10 years include  ,  , and . Here's how they did it...and what that can tell you about where to put your money today. Top M&A-focused companies can experience explosive growth through acquisitions. Image source: Getty Images.Trash hauler and landfill operator Waste Connections is the third-largest company of its kind in North America, behind and . However, being in third place gave the company more room to grow; a $10,000 investment in Waste Connections 10 years ago would now be worth $61,750, assuming you reinvested the dividends.While  lately -- thanks in large part to an increasing population -- a big part of Waste Connections' growth stemmed from its 2016 merger with No. 4 waste services provider Progressive Waste Solutions. Gobbling up its smaller competitor not only provided an immediate boost to the company's market cap, but put it on a faster growth trajectory, thanks in part to synergies between the businesses: data by .As the chart above shows, prior to the merger, Waste Connections was less than half as big as No. 2 Republic Services. Today, it's almost the same size. Organic growth isn't the only route to outperformance. A company can grow just as much -- or even faster -- by eating up competitors.So when evaluating a company, don't just take into consideration its organic growth potential. Be sure to look also at the company's industry and whether there are any opportunities for growth through acquisition.Cintas, the largest uniform renter in North America, has made its share of big mergers and acquisitions, too. In some cases, these acquisitions , like its purchase of the uniform division of rival G&K Services in 2017. In other cases, things didn't go as planned. Cintas' disappointing foray into document shredding resulted in a short-lived partnership with Shred-It in 2014 and a complete exit from the business in 2015.You might be wondering what uniform rental and document shredding have in common. Well, they both can be primarily handled by a single employee making rounds in a delivery truck or van. The employee drops off clean uniforms and picks up the documents to be shredded and the soiled uniforms at the same time. Even though document shredding didn't work out for Cintas, the company has successfully integrated other delivery businesses -- including floor mat rental, restroom restocking, and first aid and safety services -- into its business model. While these other lines of business contribute less revenue than the flagship uniform rental business (which accounts for about 80% of corporate revenue), they are growing at a faster rate. Put together, these services have helped a $10,000 investment in Cintas grow to $103,000 in just 10 years.The bottom line: Even when a mature business seems to have little room to expand, it can find new streams of revenue in underserved, related markets. Cintas has executed that strategy excellently and looks like a good candidate for continued growth.  data by .Looking at the chart above, you can see that Waste Connections' and Cintas' total returns over the last decade are impressive, but nowhere near as impressive as the gains of transportation and logistics specialist XPO Logistics. A $10,000 investment in XPO Logistics 10 years ago would be worth $186,000 today (and that's down from Q3 2018, when it would have been worth nearly $250,000). XPO followed some of the same tactics as Waste Connections and Cintas. In a fragmented industry -- last-mile shipping and logistics -- it gobbled up competitors and used technology and economy of scale to improve efficiency for its customers. But XPO pursued a supercharged version of that strategy under acquisitive CEO Bradley Jacobs. A decade ago, the company was just a trucking brokerage -- connecting truckers and trucks with customers who needed them but couldn't afford a fleet of their own. Under Jacobs, its measly $177 million in annual sales ballooned to $17 billion, largely as a result of acquisitions.However,  in its strategy, from deploying cash for mergers and acquisitions to using it to buy back shares. Stunned investors, believing this to be a signal that the company's days of explosive growth were behind it, began heading for the exits. The departure of an unnamed major customer -- which is almost certainly  -- has caused additional big headaches for the company. There's a lot here to digest for investors. A company can't sustain double-digit growth indefinitely, and eventually it's going to reach a size where that growth slows. Sometimes, especially when making acquisitions, there's simply nothing around worth buying. And even for high-growth companies, an unexpected situation -- like the loss of a big customer -- can come like a bolt from the blue and upend a company's thesis. , but investors may want to wait and see what its updated strategy looks like before buying in. Acquisitions aren't the only way to grow, but they can supercharge a company's growth. On the flip side, a company that's acquired can also give investors a big payday in the form of a cash payout or stock in the acquiring company. When evaluating a company, be sure you consider its potential to acquire or be acquired. When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

ajor benchmarks picked up ground on Wednesday, bouncing back from Tuesday's weakness.

Today, investors seemed to focus more on the favorable conditions that currently prevail domestically. Some good news from individual companies also bolstered sentiment. , , and  were among the top performers. Here's why they did so well.Shares of Marathon Petroleum rose more than 8% after activist investor Elliott Management followed up on calls it first made several years ago to take steps to enhance the  shareholder value. Specifically, Elliott suggested that Marathon break itself into three separate components, with the new companies to focus on retail gas stations, refining operations, and midstream transportation and storage assets, respectively. The move is the second time that Elliott has targeted Marathon, but shareholders seem pleased at the prospect that the energy specialist might take bigger steps this time around than it did in 2016 -- especially given the .Image source: Getty Images. following the release of its fiscal third-quarter financial results.

After dropping notably in the morning, stocks reversed and closed higher on the day. It leaves investors wondering what’s next for the market. In the meantime, here are a few top stock trades.  (NASDAQ:) stock held the $172.50 level for four consecutive sessions. It was an impressive couple of days as bulls refused to break. On Wednesday, shares caught a boost after Goldman Sachs analysts took their price target from $179 to $192. As shares reclaim the 20-day moving average, traders are shifting their outlook higher in the short term. Look to see if the stock can get back to $185, recent resistance earlier this month. Above it puts the high at $188.40 on the table, which comes into play near the 61.8% retracement. On the downside, watch $172.50. Below could send shares to the 50-day and possibly the 200-day moving average.  (NASDAQ:) took a hit on Wednesday, as cracks start to show up on the chart. For now, shares are holding onto the 61.8% retracement. Below it will put Wednesday’s lows on the table. The $65 level has been decent support, while the 200-day moving average is near $64 and the 50% retracement is near $63. On a rebound, see if MTCH stock can get back to $80. I love  (NASDAQ:) for the long term, but it would be foolish to ignore the charts. Invitae is taking out this month’s low and falling below the 200-day moving average.Should shares continue lower, look for the 50% retracement just below $19. If it fails as support, look for a potential test of the May lows, with support in the low-$17s. At that point though, bulls may as well just ask for a January gap-fill and test of the 38.2% near $16.50. On the upside, NVTA needs too reclaim the 200-day moving average, as well as the $22 level, which is acting as short-term resistance.  (NASDAQ:) has seen a widening range (blue lines) since popping higher in July. On Wednesday, shares jumped on better-than-expected earnings results. Thanks to its rally, CTAS is reclaiming the 50-day moving average and is approaching resistance at $270. Over $270 puts the 52-week high of $270.36 on the table, as well as a possible run to $276, which is recent trend resistance.  (NASDAQ:) has been frustrating investors lately, but pleasing traders as it bounces between $250 range support and $270 range resistance. The setup is simple: traders can go long near $250 support and sell near $270 resistance. If shares break down below support, see if the 200-day supports it, along with the 61.8% retracement near $243.75.

"illions of investors own stocks that regularly pay out dividends of varying amounts per share, but few are familiar with an elite class of  known as Dividend Aristocrats.In this article, we'll break down exactly why Dividend Aristocrats are so attractive to investors and share a few aristocrat stocks that could help unlock the full potential of your portfolio.A dividend is a payment from a company's profits to its shareholders. Just as all stocks are created differently, so are . Different companies pay out different dividend amounts. For example, if a company pays 3% of its total stock price each quarter, an investor with $100 in that stock gets $3 back every quarter. Of course, this number can fluctuate vastly depending on a company's success.Not all companies pay their investors dividends. Typically, the companies that offer consistent and increasingly higher dividend yields are older and more established businesses. These are companies that have been around for decades, perhaps even centuries, and can afford to let go of some of their liquid capital each quarter without needing to immediately reinvest it in the business to fund things like research, development, marketing, or paying off debt.A special collection of established and reliable companies known as Dividend Aristocrats can help make investing in dividends a relative no-brainer.Image Source: Getty Images.The term ""Dividend Aristocrats"" is trademarked by the financial firm Standard & Poor's, and S&P maintains strict definitions for several classes of aristocrat stocks. Most commonly, though, investors who are referring to Dividend Aristocrats colloquially are talking about companies on the S&P 500 index that have increased their dividend payouts for 25 consecutive years or more, at least once a year. These companies have never decreased their dividend payout to shareholders during that time.First established in 1989, this index contained the most stocks in 2001, but given considerable changes in dividend policy among companies over the past two decades or so, the list has undergone significant scale-backs and revisions.The number of companies on the list tends to coincide with historically significant bear markets. For example, the initial list of just 26 companies was published 25 years after the down years of 1973-1974. That tough economy very likely forced many companies to freeze or drop their dividends, disqualifying them from the original list 25 years later. Likewise, the list peaked in 2001 at 64 and again at 60 in 2008. The recessions that immediately followed those peaks once again forced numerous Dividend Aristocrats off the list.Many stocks listed on the index are familiar household names., , and  have all managed to retain their status as Dividend Aristocrats for more than a quarter of a century. There are 57 companies on the list currently, with the consumer staples category containing the most. These include companies like , , , and . But industrials don't trail far behind, making up more than a fifth of the companies listed. Think , , and .The list of Dividend Aristocrats tends to fluctuate semiregularly, with new companies being added (and, unfortunately, occasionally subtracted) every year. Here's a full list of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats as it stood in August 2019:Source: S&P Dow Jones Indices.Not just any company is capable of increasing its dividend for 25-plus years. The sustained success required is, almost by definition, next to impossible. Only around 10% of companies on the S&P 500 qualify today, after all. To achieve such a feat, a company must be consistent and resilient and have strong competitive advantages and excellent capital allocation.Economically speaking, this means a company must have a demonstrated record of raising its earnings and cash flow and sharpening its balance sheet to make those payments to its eager investors. That combination of factors leads to strong fundamental performance first. The dividend strength is a reflection of those fundamentals, not the other way around. In other words, a company doesn't become successful because it offers dividends; a company offers dividends because it is successful.When it comes to Dividend Aristocrats' yield, a couple of percentage points might not sound like much: 3% of a $100 stock barely buys you a candy bar at your local gas station. But it's not just about how high a yield is. One should also consider the , which is how smart investors examine a company's sustainability. Mathematically speaking, a payout ratio is calculated by dividing dividends per share (DPS) by earnings per share (EPS).Let's look at an example. Say a company has earnings per share of $5 and dividends per share of $2. Its payout ratio would therefore be 40%.Investors use this figure to determine the sustainability of the company's business. The higher its payout ratio is, the more a company is spending to maintain its dividend payments. If, for example, a stock's payout ratio is 100%, it means the company is spending all of its earnings on paying investors dividends. This is an unsustainable model for obvious reasons.But Dividend Aristocrats are different. They're resilient, established companies with proven records. They're bringing in sustainable income, and we can mostly trust that they aren't going anywhere. They can afford to toggle their dividend payout ratio -- and consistently raise it -- without upsetting their balance sheets.Many of the companies listed as Dividend Aristocrats, therefore, have been in business for decades. Some, like 3M, Coca-Cola, and PepsiCo have lasted more than a century. Dividend aristocrats also tend to follow the S&P 500, many times outperforming it. Since many of these companies are also on the S&P 500, it makes sense that the Dividend Aristocrats would follow such a reliable trend. However, not all companies on the S&P offer dividends, and those that do haven't necessarily maintained an increasing dividend yield for more than 25 years. Investing in an index of these elite and reliable companies, therefore, makes for a smart bet in the long run.Data source: YCharts.Like any other stock, Dividend Aristocrats are subject to market change. An argument can be made that such mammoth companies are under more pressure -- and therefore are criticized more for a misstep or underperformance -- because they are hailed as such sustainable and sound investments. Any mistake is recorded, analyzed, and often mentioned on TV, heightening an audience's awareness. For instance, if Coca-Cola makes a bad bet on a new product, the market notices more than if a lesser-known company or one that's only recently gone public makes the same ill-advised judgment call. But it's not all bad for Coca-Cola or for its investors. The company's stock is capable of absorbing mistakes better than a new company can, since it has a proven track record and has likely weathered similar errors in the past.Dividend aristocrats are therefore good (or, at least, better) bets if you're trying to sift through the noise of a constantly fluctuating market. This isn't to say they're bulletproof, but they are resistant to nuanced daily fluctuations and have been around for generations. And since they've demonstrated a repeated ability to line investors' pockets with a little extra cash -- just for putting their trust (and money) with them -- they enjoy a coveted consumer confidence that few other companies have.Investors have come up with other terms to talk about stocks with even more impressive dividend histories. For instance, Dividend Kings are an exclusive grouping of companies that have raised their dividends for 50 or more years, every single year. That's no small feat when you consider how vastly stocks can fluctuate on a day-to-day basis, let alone year to year. Consider what the market has seen over the past 50 years: global unrest, wars, rising interest rates, falling interest rates, historic highs, lows, 10 presidencies, a technological boom, automation, disruption, disruption, disruption. And somehow, these companies have weathered it all. It's amazing to consider, really. And the list is always changing. It's not easy being king, and very few retain the crown.As of this year, only 26 companies are considered Dividend Kings. They are:Source: .Keep in mind that being a Dividend King does not make a company a Dividend Aristocrat. This sounds counterintuitive, since it seems as if companies that managed to double the Dividend Aristocrats' 25-year track record should fit seamlessly into the category. But at least as strictly defined, Dividend Aristocrats belong to the  and therefore also must be American-based companies of a certain market cap, whereas Dividend Kings are measured only by their dividend records.When it comes to the market, everyone has an opinion. And when we're talking about Dividend Aristocrats, even though they may  too good to be true, many investors see a certain drawback to investing only in stocks that offer such steady dividends.One common critique of Dividend Aristocrats is that they're unimaginative. Plenty of people say that these payouts are a waste of money, since companies will never see a tangible return from their generosity. Rather than reinvesting extra capital in their own business for something like marketing, research and development, expansion, or other areas of improvement, the common complaint is that these companies just send money out the door without putting it to work for them.This criticism is somewhat valid; it certainly adds up when a company like PepsiCo regularly gives away almost $4 on every share. But these are huge companies, many of which have been around for more than a century. Sure, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, and  can continue to expand -- at least marginally -- and continue to acquire smaller companies in the name of growth. But on a macro level, most Dividend Aristocrats have already hit their critical mass. How many countries have at least one McDonald's within their borders? (Answer for your next cocktail party: 117 and counting.)There's still at least marginal room to grow, but these hugely lucrative companies don't need to reinvest each and every penny they make in their businesses to keep their heads above water. Newer companies, disruptors, and less profitable ones do.It's also worth noting that while offering dividends isn't inherently risky, it does mean that a company repeatedly raising its dividend has a larger target on its back. When companies randomly  dramatically with little forewarning (yes, it happens), investors panic, which can drive a stock price down.Newer companies such as  or  might be exciting, but it's far riskier to overweight your portfolio with relatively untested, high-growth stocks like those than to stick with companies that have slower growth but proven records and steady dividends. Aristocrats, therefore, are slow and safe bets.Put simply, investing in Dividend Aristocrats is a Foolish (with a capital F!) way to invest! No, filling your portfolio with tons of shares of  probably won't make you rich overnight. Overweighting your portfolio with one company would not only be risky, but it would also take the fun and creativity out of investing!Instead, we suggest doing your homework:Sure, this research will provide indicators as to whether purchasing a particular stock is a good idea, but it won't tell the whole story. Take the individual dividend yield percentage into account, consider a company's mission and whether you believe in it, and remember the most important factor to any company's success: its leadership. As we always say, a CEO is the most important key to a business's success in the long run. So if you don't like a company's CEO, board, or long-term vision, consider skipping it altogether.Adding Dividend Aristocrats to your portfolio and sitting on them for the long haul isn't necessarily foolproof. Market downturns, busts, and recessions can still happen. But Aristocrats will deliver a small amount of steady and reliable income as your portfolio grows (and your companies succeed) over the years. And when the market inevitably corrects or a black-swan event shocks the world (let's hope it doesn't, but it's best to be prepared), you'll be glad you tucked away a few safe bets that bolster your portfolio with a little extra cash for a rainy day.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

There are 7 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Cintas Corporation, but the average is just that — a mathematical average.  There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $217.00.  And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $300.00.  The standard deviation is $28.771.


But the whole reason to look at the average CTAS price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes.  And so with CTAS crossing above that average target price of $267.14/share, investors in CTAS have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $267.14 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

It suspended its dividend earlier this year because it needs to redirect cash back into the business in order to better position itself for the changing games market.The upcoming second-quarter report should provide some insight on how same-store sales and cost-reduction initiatives are doing -- as well as some color and guidance related to the performance of video game console hardware, games from leading publishers, and the pop-culture merchandise space that hosts big players like .The semiconductor market can be a good bellwether for the broader  because chips are core components in consumer-level and enterprise-level devices and infrastructure.Broadcom's management shed light on how big tech companies are reading and dealing with some macroeconomic headwinds. The company has seen its outlook affected by the U.S.-China trade war. And restrictions placed on dealing with Chinese hardware company Huawei have meant that it appears to have lost (at least temporarily) one of its biggest customers. Broadcom revealed several weeks ago that it would be acquiring 's enterprise security business for $10.7 billion, and investors may get extra information on the big deal, which is expected to close before the year is out. Management could offer additional color about its big push into software and its appetite for additional acquisitions. Big tech stocks have shown some weakness in recent weeks as signs of softening demand among leading industry players have combined with some worrying economic indicators in global markets to shake investor confidence. Oracle stock has retreated from the record high it hit with its last earnings report, but investors will still be looking for signs of solid momentum for its cloud service offerings. The company's role as a top enterprise software provider means that its upcoming quarterly report and guidance could also provide a view into broader corporate sentiment about macroeconomic conditions. September could bring some legal news for the company as well. Oracle has appealed the July dismissal of its lawsuit challenging the Pentagon's bidding process for the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) cloud computing contract that is valued at upward of $10 billion. The suit alleges that the government violated procurement laws and that the bidding process unfairly favored Amazon and was unduly influenced by personal relationships.Oracle's board of directors also gave the go-ahead in August for a billion-dollar shareholder lawsuit against company executives Larry Ellison and Safra Catz, with the suit alleging that the executives breached their fiduciary duties by paying a substantial premium to acquire NetSuite in a $9.3 billion deal that was completed in 2016.Shareholders will be watching to see if the company's first-quarter report and guidance have the business on track to continue its impressive sales and earnings growth. Its performance and outlook could also provide insight into broader economic sentiment. Because it provides workplace uniforms and cleaning services, demand for its products could be an indicator of whether businesses are still feeling confident about expanding.The uniform rental company's stock trades in the neighborhood of its record high and has benefited from strong economic growth over the last decade. With concerns about worsening macroeconomic conditions potentially starting to mount,  upcoming first-quarter report could provide a better picture of the business' near-term outlook and a marker for gauging enterprise sentiment on a wider scale. Micron's fourth-quarter release will provide new information for assessing how the DRAM (or dynamic random access memory) and NAND flash-memory markets are shaping up. DRAM and NAND chip prices have been dragged down by inventory glut, but signs that the memory-chip market may have already reached the bottom of its cycle have propelled stock rebounds for industry leaders in 2019.Micron's results and guidance may provide some outlook on the broader consumer-tech space, enterprise categories like data centers, and what to expect from other memory-chip specialists like  and . Micron's earnings report and conference call may also shed some extra light on the business' dealings with Huawei, one of Micron's biggest customers. The memory specialist has stated that it has a legal workaround that will allow it to continue selling some of its products to the Chinese company. It's worth keeping an eye on how that plays out. It last reported earnings in June, raising its full-year guidance and powering the stock to a record high. Investors will want to see if management's bullish outlook has shifted at all with the upcoming third-quarter report and conference call. J.P. Morgan analyst Ken Goldman cut his rating on the spice giant from neutral to underweight in August, creating some recent downward pressure for the stock. Its second-quarter report arrived with comments from management suggesting there would be strong sales performance in the second half of the year, and in the holiday period particularly, so third-quarter revenue and guidance will be under the microscope. Investors will also get more news about Brexit, which could have an impact on McCormick's business -- as cited in Ken Goldman's note. Whether there will be a ""no deal"" exit that could lead to increased shipping expenses should be clear by the end of September.McCormick will also be presenting at the Barclays Global Consumer Staples Conference on Sept. 4. When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

ncome investors love , but they also know they can't just pick dividend-paying company. The most reliable companies find ways to pay steadily rising dividends year in and year out over the long run.Many investors track dividend stocks by whether they make annual increases to their payouts, and knowing this, companies often make dividend increases at around the same time every year. So far in 2019, , , and  haven't yet delivered a dividend hike to their shareholders, but based on past practices, you can expect to see a payout boost sometime between now and the end of December. of a strong dividend stock, with a current yield that's well below 1%. But the payment processor and credit card giant has still put together a track record of raising its dividends, with 11 straight years of higher payouts. Its most recent hike came last November, with a 19% rise to its current quarterly distribution of $0.25 per share.Image source: Visa., with investors appreciating the company's efforts to keep transaction counts and payment volume high and growing. The card giant has done a good job of building partnerships with key players in the financial industry, choosing to work collaboratively with several industry upstarts rather than trying to suppress their innovations. For instance, Visa and  have had a partnership for several years under which both companies promote greater adoption of digital payment functionality and features.So far, even tepid conditions in the global economy haven't put a big dent in Visa's numbers as electronic payments gain traction internationally. Visa could afford to deliver a nice dividend increase this year, and hopefully it'll do better than it did in 2018 to lift what shareholders can expect to receive., using its leadership position in athletic footwear and apparel to build on its past success. The company has fought back against competitive threats from domestic and international rivals, and stronger financial performance has been the result. In its most recent quarter, Nike saw double-digit gains in revenue on a currency-adjusted basis, and investors were pleased by earnings growth approaching 30%.Nike's another stock that has been slow to embrace the trend toward paying healthy dividends. Even with the athletic giant's 10% boost to its payout in November 2018, the current $0.22 per share quarterly dividend gives Nike a yield of just under 1%. At some point, the company might well choose not just to extend a streak of annual increases that's currently at 17 years but also to make an outsize hike to send a message. Whether big or small, investors can expect Nike to make its move soon.Last but not least, Cintas has taken advantage of the ongoing need for uniform rental and facilities services to build a strong business model. Dividend investors have reaped the rewards, with 36 straight years of rising payouts. Last year's dividend increase amounted to nearly 27%, taking the annual payout to $2.05 per share. Yet due to a soaring share price, not even that size of boost was enough to keep Cintas' yield from staying below 1%.Favorable employment trends , and the company has done well both in attracting clients on its own and in working with other businesses to form collaborations that can benefit everyone involved. Yet it has been able to weather past recessions and other downturns in employment without jeopardizing its dividend. That's a big part of why dividend investors are comfortable with Cintas.Most income investors look at high yields, so these three dividend stocks don't even come onto the radar for many people. Yet with such attractive growth prospects to go with current income, many investors are willing to cut these dividend payers some slack -- especially if they keep delivering rising payouts year after year.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"f you're looking for a ,  is a great place to start. The company's emphasis on uniform rentals for workers across the nation gives it a first-hand perspective on the strength of the job market, and for quite a while now, low levels of unemployment and solid growth in jobs have combined to help produce good results for Cintas.Coming into Tuesday's fiscal first-quarter financial report,  that they'd keep seeing favorable results from the uniform and business services specialist. Cintas didn't disappoint, and its outlook was encouraging for those hoping that the company's positive momentum will continue well into the future.Cintas' fiscal first-quarter results continued a long stretch of good numbers from the company. Revenue of $1.81 billion was higher by 6.7% year over year, decelerating slightly from last quarter's growth rate but still exceeding what most investors had expected. Net income from continuing operations climbed 22% to $212.5 million, and the resulting earnings of $2.32 per share easily topped the $2.15-per-share consensus figure among those following the stock.Image source: Cintas.Investors saw some of the same trends within Cintas' business as in recent quarters. The core uniform rental and facility services segment posted organic revenue growth of 7.5%, adjusting for impacts from acquisitions, currency movements, and calendar differences. The first aid and safety services division saw an even faster organic growth rate of 13.8%, which was more than 3 percentage points higher than it was three months ago.Cintas also kept getting more efficient. Gross margin in both segments of the business rose by more than a full percentage point. Despite some expenses from the integration of the company's G&K Services acquisition, operating margin figures companywide rose 1.3 percentage points to 16.9%.CEO Scott Farmer was succinct in his comments about the quarter. ""We are pleased with our start to fiscal 2020,"" he said, and he pointed to the continued work of employees in helping to move the business services company forward.The strong economy has Cintas feeling optimistic. ""We look forward to another successful year,"" Farmer said, and the company's strategy of seeking to bring on new clients while searching for possible combinations with outside businesses seems to be working well.Cintas also increased its guidance for the full fiscal year. The company now expects revenue to come in between $7.28 billion and $7.32 billion for the year, up $10 million to $40 million from its previous projections. On the earnings front, a $0.12 to $0.17 per share boost will bring guidance up to $8.30 to $8.45 per share.CFO Mike Hansen provided some color on what sorts of strategic combinations Cintas might seek. Hansen pointed to targets that would supplement the areas that Cintas already covers, such as fire, first aid, and uniform rentals. Yet Cintas is also open to larger deals, with a focus of staying within the U.S. and Canada in order to maximize the opportunity for cost-saving synergies from an acquisition.Cintas investors responded favorably to the report, and the stock was higher 5% Wednesday morning following the Tuesday afternoon announcement. There are no guarantees that the strong U.S. economy will be able to strong forever, and some   have started to crop up.

"nvestors in Cintas Corporation (Symbol: CTAS) saw new options become available this week, for the February 2020 expiration.  One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 163 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CTAS options chain for the new February 2020 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $220.00 strike price has a current bid of $6.30.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $220.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $213.70 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CTAS, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $248.30/share today.

Because the $220.00 strike represents an approximate 11% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 80%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.86% return on the cash commitment, or 6.41% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.


Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Cintas Corporation, and highlighting in green where the $220.00 strike is located relative to that history:


   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $250.00 strike price has a current bid of $14.40.  If an investor was to purchase shares of CTAS stock at the current price level of $248.30/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $250.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 6.48% if the stock gets called away at the February 2020 expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CTAS shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Cintas Corporation, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing CTAS's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $250.00 strike highlighted in red:



   
Considering the fact that the $250.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 47%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.80% boost of extra return to the investor, or 12.98% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.


The implied volatility in the put contract example is 31%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 25%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $248.30) to be 25%.

he KISS (keep it simple, stupid) principle is arguably the best strategy for investing, and is one that has been employed by some of the greatest investors ever, from Warren Buffett to Peter Lynch. And if buying stocks that anyone can understand is good enough for the best investors, then it's good enough for all. We asked three Motley Fool contributors to identify stocks that are super-easy to understand and they offered up  ,  , and   as simple businesses anyone can wrap their head around.Image source: Getty Images. If I were to make a Venn diagram of stocks that have delivered blockbuster returns and those that anyone can understand, Netflix would be smack-dab in the middle of it. Not only has the stock surged nearly 400% over the last five years, but the company competes in just one straightforward business -- video streaming. Even better, management explains its thoughts and analysis of the business every quarter in easy-to-read , discussing its results and forecast, content, competition, marketing, and product and partnerships. The letters also include a clear chart of key metrics at the top.Netflix's business model is about as straightforward as they come. It's a subscription business, so revenue as a direct function of the number of subscribers it has. That's why the company puts so much emphasis on subscriber growth, and why the stock tends to move according to the number of quarterly subscriber additions.On the cost side, most of Netflix's expenses come from content, with marketing being the next biggest line item. Netflix considers content and marketing direct costs for the business as those are what drive subscriber growth, and it calls revenue minus content and marketing expenses contribution profit. Contribution profit is essentially the direct profit it makes from its video streaming business before more general costs like management salaries and tech infrastructure, as well as interest expense.No one knows if Netflix stock will continue to deliver outstanding returns, of course, especially with some  entering the arena, but by making its business so easy to understand and offering the potential of market-crushing returns, Netflix is a great stock for beginning for investors.  If you're looking for a business that's easy to understand, it doesn't get much clearer than Cintas. The company rents work uniforms to businesses of all types, and provides other business services as well.Cintas' primary business is simple: It sends a delivery truck or van around to its clients' businesses. The driver picks up soiled uniforms and drops off clean ones. The service is attractive for clients because the costs and space required to install washers and dryers -- not to mention paying an employee and overhead to keep them running -- is high. Cintas has exploited its existing business model to offer other, similar services that can still be achieved by a single delivery driver and van. They include floor mat rental, restroom restocking, first aid kit restocking, and fire and safety apparatus rental and restocking. These additional services have been popular additions and have grown even faster than the core uniform rental business. It's not hard to see why. Why pay separate companies to check your fire extinguishers and refill your paper towel dispensers when the company that's already paying you a visit once a week can do it all?The success of this simple business model was on display , when year-over-year organic growth in the first aid and safety services division was an impressive 10.7%, higher than the core uniform rental and facility services segment's still-impressive organic growth of 6.8%. And not only is Cintas' business model simple, but it's also very profitable, with a 45.9% gross margin in the most recent quarter. While upward movement in the unemployment rate would likely stunt Cintas' recent streak of growth, the company's easy-to-understand business model is a proven winner. Investors should take note.  Brewing beer is as simple as combining barley, malt, and hops in yeast and water, and letting nature do its thing. Understanding how a brewer operates is equally easy: Quality ingredients go in, sales and profits come out.While maybe not so simple as that, otherwise everyone would be doing it, Boston Beer has made tapping into current drinker preferences look so easy. It was able to popularize the craft beer phenomenon during its infancy so that its flagship Samuel Adams lager became the face of the industry, while its Twisted Tea brand of hard tea has long capitalized on the trend of hard soft drinks.In that same way, Angry Orchard brand came to dominate the hard cider market, its Truly line of hard seltzers is quickly assuming a position of primacy in this new market niche.Of course, it had some rough patches as consumer tastes abruptly changed and Samuel Adams declined markedly in popularity as demand for smaller, more localized beer grew. However, Boston Beer has not only stabilized its business, but it is actually growing again, even if most of the growth is coming from nonbeer alcoholic beverages these days.Boston Beer reported reported its  of depletion growth, and six consecutive quarters of double-digit rates shipment growth. Depletions are sales to distributors and retailers and are considered a proxy for consumer demand.Although the brewer's stock has gained almost 70% in 2019, there ought to be plenty of room to run yet because beverages like hard seltzer are proving to be a trend and not a fad -- and a strong one at that. Because Boston Beer is so attuned to where drinker tastes are turning these days, it should be easy to see that its cup is overflowing with potential.Motley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.

"niform-rental behemoth  releases the first earnings report of its new fiscal 2020 year on Sept. 24 after the markets close for trading. The company is coming off a record fiscal year, but to longtime shareholders, this isn't exceptional: Cintas has set revenue and net income records in 48 out of the last 50 years. Below, let's briefly review key areas investors should focus on when the outperforming services company issues its first scorecard of 2020.Cintas expects slightly slower revenue growth versus the 7.4% year-over-year top-line expansion it chalked up last year. The company's aiming for revenue improvement of 5% to 6.1%, which translates to an annual revenue range of $7.24 billion to $7.31 billion. Last quarter, when issuing this goal, management observed that fiscal 2020 will have one fewer workday than fiscal 2019. On a ""constant workday basis,"" Cintas is actually expecting to advance its revenue in a range of 5.4% to 6.5%.Turning to the bottom line, the organization booked diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $7.60 in 2019. For the current year, management anticipates that Cintas' earnings will land between $8.30 and $8.45, good for expansion of 9.2%-11.2%.Cintas doesn't issue quarterly guidance; thus, its first-quarter numbers will be taken within the larger context of the annual revenue and earnings guidance.Image source: Getty Images.For a facilities products-and-services provider, Cintas boasts an enviable . Last year, the company generated gross margin of 45.4%, an improvement of nearly half of a percentage point over the prior year. Sustaining this relatively high level of profitability is central to the company's earnings projections, and gross margin is one of the first numbers investors are likely to check after reviewing revenue and earnings on the 24th. It's likely to fall in the 45%-46% range; anything less will be closely scrutinized.Investors will also look for progress in the company's years-long effort to derive merger synergies from its $2.2 billion acquisition of uniform rental competitor G&K Services in March 2017. Cintas is still incurring integration expenses as it finishes combining its service platforms with G&K's, but it's also realizing cost savings. Last year, management quantified $100 million in realized cost synergies, and in fiscal 2020, Cintas is aiming for $135 million. Expect management to discuss integration-related productivity on the company's post-earnings conference call.While we're on the topic of margins and productivity, Cintas is two-thirds of the way through implementation of a modern enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. The company is investing in software provided by German ERP giant , and management expects that the rollout of the new system, which has been a massive undertaking, will be completed in the new fiscal year.The transition to a unified ERP framework should benefit Cintas greatly, as it's expanded its top line through the years not simply via organic growth, but through the serial acquisition of smaller competitors. A wealth of opportunity exists to clean up a patchwork of disparate operations and accounting systems that continue as a legacy of these acquisitions, and for the company to derive useful analytics from a single shared resource.This is a topic that management has treated at length in recent earnings conference calls, as executives are hopeful that a robust ERP product will help the organization find additional avenues to profitability.

 component of Sir Isaac Newton's first law of motion is that an object in motion tends to stay in motion at the same speed and direction until acted upon by an unequal force. That doesn't apply to stocks, which can and do fluctuate on a daily basis.Yet sometimes stocks of companies with good business prospects do keep to a general course, and though there may be ups and downs, their trajectory seems to remain upward. That's what three Motley Fool contributors believe is the case with  ,  , and  . Read on to learn why they believe these businesses that have already doubled still have more room to keep growing.Image source: Getty Images.  Unless you've been living under a rock, you understand advertising is amid a generational shift. Traditional channels like television and print media are under strain from digital mediums, making investors in  and  millions. Despite the , you're not too late to the party, because The Trade Desk has a long runway for growth.Despite the medium shift, little else has changed: Brands are constantly looking to collect better data on potential buyers and ensure ads are placed appropriately to take advantage of this data. The Trade Desk's programmatic ad buying system allows this to occur in real time, increasing the efficacy of ad spending. The combination of a shift to digital advertising and programmatic delivery will continue to boost The Trade Desk's top line.Shares of the company have doubled this year on account of a strong first-quarter report that included 41% revenue growth. More importantly, customer retention was above 95% during the quarter, the company's 22nd in a row. If you were late to the party and missed the shift to digital advertising, The Trade Desk is a way to take advantage of the second growth wave in the industry. Double? Phooey! Uniform rental specialist Cintas has seen its shares more than over the last five years. And the best part is, the company -- which has been turning itself into a one-stop shop for numerous business services -- still has plenty of room to grow.Cintas' model for uniform rental is simple: It sends a delivery van or truck to the business location of a client, picks up soiled uniforms, drops off clean ones, and moves onto the next one. This process is usually cheaper and easier for clients than attempting to maintain laundry facilities on site. As the unemployment rate has fallen, a larger North American workforce has meant more uniforms to rent, plus the company has been successful in attracting new clients.This success was on display , Q1 2019, when the company's uniform rental and facility services segment logged organic growth of 6.8%. Wait a minute: facility services? Yep: Cintas long ago realized that its delivery vans could transport more than just uniforms. Cintas rents floor mats and does restroom restocking as well. The company has even branched out into first aid kit restocking and fire and safety equipment monitoring, a segment that's growing even faster than uniform rental, with a 10.7% growth rate in the most recent quarter.It's true that a recession or other event that causes the unemployment rate to tick upward would be a major setback for Cintas. But with the U.S. economy still humming along and unemployment remaining low, things are still looking pretty good for North America's largest uniform renter. Data breaches don't make the headlines they used to, though they're as prevalent as ever, with Facebook receiving a $5 billion fine recently from the FTC for consumer privacy violations.The continued assault on our data is likely why Zscaler has  over the past year and is up fivefold from its March 2018 IPO, when it was offered at $16 per share. Because so much data has migrated to the cloud, Zscaler focuses its cybersecurity efforts there rather than on in-house networks.Revenues are growing at a torrid pace, up 61% last quarter to $79 million, and by a like amount year to date. Quarterly losses, though, have also widened year over year, but at a slower rate, expanding to $12 million, or 22% worse than the year-ago period. On an adjusted basis, however, Zscaler turned a $6 million profit. It forecasts being profitable for the year on a similar basis, with non-GAAP earnings of $0.16 to $0.18 per share.Cloud-based computing is only going to grow more, and Zscaler, as the early leader in the space, will likely capture a lot of the business that is moving to the cloud. However, because its stock has soared to such heights so soon, risk-averse investors may be leery about jumping on the bandwagon. It trades at lofty valuations when looking at price-to-sales and price-to-free cash flow metrics -- yes, it is free cash flow positive. And though this stock may be volatile, although it's so far mostly headed in only one direction, there's reason to think it will continue to rise a good deal more.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"niform rental and business services provider   released fiscal fourth-quarter 2019 earnings results on Tuesday that impressed investors with . Cintas shares gained nearly 9% on the Wednesday trading session and have now posted a dazzling return of 55% year to date. Can the stellar performance continue? On the company's , management discussed general financial targets for next year and factors that will help Cintas maintain its momentum. Let's review three key comments from executives below:For the ninth consecutive year, our organic growth rate was in the mid to high single digits. This means, we've been able to grow consistently in multiples of GDP and employment growth...For the ninth consecutive year, we achieved double-digit earnings-per-share growth from continuing operations when adjusted for one-time special items. -- CFO Mike Hansen Steady revenue growth year in and year out has become one of Cintas' biggest selling points to shareholders, and the company intends to maintain its long-term annual target of organic revenue growth in the mid- to high single digits for the foreseeable future. With one fewer workday in the fiscal 2020 year, Cintas is projecting revenue of between $7.24 billion and $7.31 billion over the next 12 months, which will result in reported growth of 5% to 6.1%. Underpinning this expansion is a favorable macroeconomic environment for the company. Hansen pointed out that over 1 million jobs have been created in the U.S. economy in the last year -- a positive benchmark for companies in the uniform services rental industry.As for the bottom line, Cintas is aiming for adjusted earnings per share of $8.30 to $8.45 in the upcoming fiscal year, which, at the midpoint, will represent roughly 10% year-over-year growth.To reach this goal, in addition to sales growth and ongoing productivity initiatives, the company will seek to realize additional projected annual cost synergies arising from its $2.2 billion acquisition of uniform specialist G&K Services in 2017. So far, Cintas has reached $100 million in annual synergies, and it's targeting $135 million in fiscal 2020, with any remaining annual cost savings to be completed by fiscal 2021. The multiyear integration of G&K has provided Cintas with both a sizable growth vehicle and a chance to add value to core uniform rental margins.Image source: Getty Images.In implementing SAP, we are moving from a decades-old platform to new technology that provides powerful information and data designed to help us improve our business.Through fiscal '19, about 65% of the operations are now in SAP. We will complete the rollout to the remaining locations in fiscal '20. -- CFO Mike HansenThe impact of Cintas' migration to a modern enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, specifically, implementation of German software giant 's namesake software, is perhaps underappreciated by shareholders. Decades of acquiring small independent uniform rental operators -- Cintas turned 90 this year -- has resulted in financial and resource planning systems that are adequate, but not optimized to the fullest extent. During the conference call, Hansen compared the implementation of SAP to a very large acquisition, noting that the process affects hundreds of operations, and that the conversion of a significant operation (accounting, for example) typically requires ""an 8-month process of planning, changing business processes and employee mindsets, training and certification and customer communication.""As Hansen observed, the company is roughly two-thirds of the way through the conversion to SAP, and plans to complete the exercise in the current fiscal year. The upside to Cintas will manifest in better information to decision-makers at all levels of the company and a clearer set of analytics that should help Cintas yield more profitable business within each of its revenue streams.Cintas derives roughly 80% of its revenue from its uniform rental and facilities services business. As I noted in my fourth-quarter , this segment's growth has curbed slightly following the G&K Services acquisition. As Cintas continues to integrate G&K's operations, the division is generating moderate organic top-line expansion in the mid-single digits: Last quarter, organic revenue grew 6.8%. The company's remaining services, denoted as ""other"" on the income statement, are adding sales at a much higher rate, primarily because they're focused on new growth areas where Cintas doesn't hold the mature and dominant market position it enjoys in its uniform rentals segment.The ""other"" category includes first aid and safety services, which advanced year-over-year revenue at an organic rate of 10.7% last quarter, and fire protection and uniform direct sales, which together improved organic revenue by 12.7%.Though relatively small, other services are providing a revenue spark and play an increasingly important role in Cintas' mid- to high-single-digit organic revenue growth framework. They're quite profitable ventures as well: Perhaps surprisingly, other services already generate nearly as high a  as uniform services. In the last 12 months, uniform services booked gross margin of 45.5%, versus ""other"" gross margin of 45.1%. Below, Treasurer Paul Adler provides an example from the first aid business to demonstrate how a smaller service provides the benefit of profit growth as it seeks to grab market share:First Aid segment gross margins continue to increase with strong top line growth. As our volume grows, we can negotiate better pricing from vendors. Growth also enables us to improve route density, reducing gasoline and diesel costs and enabling our service teams to spend more time serving and upselling.Expect to see management devote more resources to noncore revenue streams in the new fiscal year. These businesses are particularly ripe for mergers and acquisitions activity. Shareholders probably won't see a purchase on the magnitude of the G&K Services transaction, but bolt-on acquisitions in new business lines that can raise Cintas' profitability profile are likely to occur with some frequency in the coming years. When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Cintas wasn't one of them!

"aEURoeI did read that. I thought about you, B.O.aEURWhile other people may be known for their hobbies, or their families, my publisher thought of me when a Vanguard fund re-opened!IaEURtmve yapped about the Vanguard Dividend Growth Fund (VDIGX) before. I rarely mention (let alone endorse!) mutual funds. But VDIGX is notable for two reasons:Why this fund? Because in my aEURoeBrett Inc.aEUR company plan, I have a set list of Vanguard funds to choose from. This is aEURoeset and forgetaEUR money so my goal is to maximize long-term returns. The best way to do this, of course, is to buy dividend growth stocks.My own portfolio dedicated to this approach has earned 17% per year. IaEURtmll share the details with you in a minute. First, letaEURtms give some credit to VDIGX.As far as 401(K) options go, it is a good one. The fund outperformed the S&P 77% to 68% over the last five years. It really shines in turbulent years like this one, rallying 23% year-to-date.As we discussed at the outset, VDIGX just re-opened itself to new money for the first time in three years. But unless you also have a Vanguard 401(K), I think you can do better than VDIGX. Much better, actually. HereaEURtms how.For 17% Returns Per Year, Buy the Fastest Growing DividendsDividends drive the stock market. While current yields provide a big part of todayaEURtms return, it is the growth of these dividends that determines tomorrowaEURtms return.LetaEURtms spy on VDIGXaEURtms holdings to see how this works. Its number five position, PepsiCo (PEP), has made its investors rich thanks to its ability to grow its dividend. Check out the orange staircase belowaEUR""thataEURtms the payout that PepsiCo hikes every year. Its stock price (blue line below) is attracted to the payout curve like a magnet.

PepsiCoaEURtms best years of payout growth are behind it.Same goes for many Dividend Aristocrats, the stocks that have hiked their dividends for 25 or more consecutive years. They are treated like royalty, so their valuations are always high and their current yields low.

" hearty welcome to one and all to summer earnings season! Results from influential companies will dominate the headlines in the coming days and weeks, with the numbers coming thick and fast.Not surprisingly, tonight's after-hours scene is being steered by trading in stocks that have just delivered their latest numbers. Let's jump right into it.Image source: United Airlines Holdings.Shares of major airline   are climbing slightly higher in the slipstream of the company's Q2 results, released after the closing bell.For the quarter, United's revenue came in at $11.4 billion, nearly 6% higher on a year-over-year basis. Conversely, non- (adjusted) net profit fell to $1.1 billion ($4.21) from the Q2 2018 result of $1.4 billion ($5.32). Despite the bottom-line drop, both headline figures beat analyst estimates. On average, prognosticators were expecting revenue of $11.36 billion and a per-share net profit of $4.09.Although it's still too early to tell, it seems as if  are proceeding well. A round of fare increases last month certainly helped in that regard, as did still-robust consumer demand. Indicating confidence in its strategy, United lifted the low end of its adjusted net profit guidance for the entirety of this fiscal year. It now expects to net $10.50 to $12 per share; formerly the bottom end of that range was $10.United's management will hold a conference call with analysts tomorrow morning to discuss the results in finer detail.The second major company to put the hurt on analyst earnings projections tonight is corporate uniform and equipment supplier  .The company's Q4 results, unveiled after market close, show that revenue was just under $1.8 billion -- 7% higher than in the same quarter last year. Net income amounted to $226 million for an improvement of almost 20%. Adjusted for one-time items, including the integration of , per-share net profit was $2.07.Those numbers exceeded the average analyst estimates, which modeled $1.78 billion on the top line and $1.93 in per-share net profit. Cintas is effectively riding a wave of high confidence in corporate America, and high confidence usually means greater spending on the types of products Cintas delivers. With a still-humming economy, we can expect that dynamic to continue.Speaking of confidence, Cintas' stock price is being pushed up nearly 6% by after-hours traders tonight.In an unusual move, the government is attempting to hit the pause button on a federal court's move on a notable company, in this case chipmaker  . That's according to a report published early this evening by CNN.The Department of Justice (DOJ) formally requested that a federal appeals court issue a temporary halt in a critical decision against Qualcomm.In May, Judge Lucy Koh of the Northern District of California court ruled that competition law was violated when  to use the company's wireless components.The suit was brought by another branch of the government, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).In its filing, the DOJ said that ""[i]n the view of the Executive Branch, diminishment of Qualcomm's competitiveness in 5G innovation and standard-setting would significantly impact US national security.""Other departments within the government professed their support for the DOJ's position, specifically the Departments of Defense and Energy.The DOJ has not commented further on its request.

orkwear and facilities products giant   is set to issue its fiscal fourth-quarter 2019 earnings report to investors on July 16, after the close of the trading day. Cintas shares have soared 44% year to date; thus, the upcoming release is likely to either support further gains or give shorter-term investors an excuse to book profits.Let's take a brief look at the performance factors supporting Cintas' share price ascent and review what investors can expect from its wrap on the current fiscal year.Cintas has won plaudits from investors over the last several quarters by expanding revenue even while successfully integrating the operations of G&K Services, a uniform rental specialist the company acquired for $2.2 billion in March 2017.Cintas has improved year-over-year organic growth by roughly 6% this year. In the organization's , management acknowledged that G&K Services is growing at a slightly slower pace than Cintas' legacy uniforms rental business, but it expects crisper growth ahead as integration activities continue. Meanwhile, the smaller operating segment, which includes first aid and safety services, has recently achieved high-single-digit organic revenue growth, because of the aggressive signing of new national accounts and the uptake of additional products and services by existing customers., Cintas is also exhibiting admirable profitability, with  hovering around 45% in recent quarters. This is a solid mark within the uniform rental and services industry, which isn't noted for breathtaking profitability. Contrast Cintas' gross profit power to smaller competitor , which typically books quarterly gross margin of around 16%. Cintas' relatively high margins have recently enabled it to generate nearly as much in operating cash flow as it's recording in net income per generally accepted accounting principles (). In the first nine months of the fiscal year, the company booked $671 million in operating cash from $659 million in net income. In the comparable period in fiscal 2018, Cintas produced $661 million in operating cash from $656 million in recorded net income.Image source: Getty Images.Cintas' full-year financial targets, shared with investors last quarter, are as follows:The excluded items in the EPS projection include $0.09 in integration expenses related to the G&K Services acquisition and $0.47 from a non-recurring gain on sale of an investment.To meet its full-year revenue projection at the midpoint of the range, Cintas will need to exceed the $1.67 billion top line chalked up in the fourth quarter of 2018 by 6.5%, which is roughly in line with its 6.1% year-over-year revenue growth rate through the first three quarters of 2019 -- an achievable benchmark.Similarly, if operating margin and per-share earnings follow the cadence of the first three quarters, the company will be in striking distance of its full-year targets. With one quarter to go, management is probably confident that it can meet its fiscal 2019 targets: Surprises, if any, may fall to the upside.Cintas' year-end EPS projections, in addition to excluding the items discussed, also don't incorporate any share repurchase activity. The company has been an active buyer of its own shares on the open market this year, having repurchased $608 million of its stock in the first nine months of fiscal 2019. Cintas has roughly $863 million remaining on its current share repurchase authorization, and management indicated a willingness to continue to buy back shares during the company's third-quarter .As I mentioned, rising organic revenue and healthy profit margins are producing ample cash flow for the company each quarter, and it's possible that management will put some of this cash to work to buy back shares in the final three months of the year. Further repurchase activity will reduce share count in the fourth quarter and could contribute to the company's meeting -- or exceeding -- its stated goal of netting between $7.42 and $7.48 in diluted EPS. When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Cintas wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.  The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@What to Expect from Cintas' Upcoming Earnings@2019-07-14@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/what-to-expect-from-cintas-upcoming-earnings-2019-07-14
"hares of uniform rental giant   have gained 31% year to date, and more than a third of that rise came after it delivered its fiscal third-quarter 2019 earnings report on June 26. UniFirst's results featured higher-than-expected earnings and a 5.8% year-over-year increase in organic revenue within the company's core laundry operations segment, which contributes roughly 90% of total annual revenue.But has the workwear specialist's stock price increased too fast in too short a time? The company now trades at 22 times estimated earnings, and this forward P/E ratio has increased roughly 40% since the beginning of the year.In addition, even as the company raised full-year revenue and EPS projections alongside its fiscal Q3 results, management inserted an interesting caveat in its earnings release. ""Although we are encouraged by the third quarter results which reflect certain positive trends in our operations,"" said CEO Steve Sintros, ""we do want to caution that our profits were favorably impacted by a number of items that may not provide the same benefit going forward.""Sintros was alluding to certain variable costs like healthcare and payroll expenses that have boosted results in recent quarters, but may soon climb to more normal levels. Image source: Getty Images.Still, after taking those yellow flags into account, UniFirst stock likely has additional upward potential. This is chiefly because the company trades at a discount to its larger, comparable rival  . Cintas stock has gained 43% itself so far in 2019. Though about four times UniFirst's size -- it booked $6.8 billion in trailing 12-month revenue versus $1.7 billion for UniFirst -- Cintas has managed to expand at a faster pace in recent years.In fiscal 2018, Cintas recorded revenue growth of nearly 21.7%. Acquisitions provided 14.3 percentage points of that advance, mostly from the March 2017 purchase of uniform rental specialist G&K Services for $2.1 billion. Still, Cintas managed impressive organic revenue expansion of roughly 7% in 2018. Cintas has coupled its acquisitions and vibrant organic growth with  that have hovered above 45% for the last three years, and  that have floated around 37%. Compare those to the gross and operating margins of UniFirst, which have improved by a few percentage points to 16% and 12%, respectively, over the same period.While Cintas has catalyzed consolidation in the uniform and workwear rental industry of late through its sizable acquisitions, UniFirst has focused on boosting its organic revenue and profitability. UniFirst's core laundry operations segment has notched year-over-year organic revenue improvement of 4.6% in the first three quarters of this fiscal year, and, as noted above, that pace accelerated to nearly 6% in Q3.This isn't to imply that UniFirst won't entertain the possibility of growth through acquisitions; however, it has employed a relatively nuanced approach that favors bolt-on transactions, rather than huge, transformative purchases that add debt to the balance sheet. In fiscal 2018, UniFirst allocated the modest sum of $42.7 million to business acquisitions.As I hinted earlier, due to Cintas' faster growth and sterling profitability, the market awards it a premium valuation relative to UniFirst: data by Comparing the two on this simple benchmark of forward P/E ratios makes it clear that despite their steep ascent so far in 2019, shares of UniFirst aren't necessarily overpriced. Indeed, in the context of its  primary competitor's market pricing, they have plenty of room for further appreciation. While UniFirst is now within striking distance of Cintas' yearly organic revenue growth of 7%, it has an enormous opportunity to improve its profitability. Thus, investors are more likely to reward increasing margins with a higher earnings multiple than to sell UniFirst stock simply to take profits following this sharp year-to-date pop. But as a corollary, to maintain its share price momentum, UniFirst will need to keep its  trend of rising top-line growth and bottom-line improvement intact in the coming quarters.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

This marked a 19.7% gain when compared to its profit of $189.3 million, or $1.68 per share year-over-year.Cintas added that its net profit from continuing operations, when adjusted for non-recurring items, tallied up to $2.07 per share, nearly 17% higher than the earnings from the year-ago period. This was higher than the growth that Wall Street predicted.Revenue impressed as well, increasing 7.4% to $1.79 billion during the three months that made up the period, topping analysts’ prediction. This metric was backed by strong sales in numerous business segments, including its Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment, which was an organic sales growth of 6.8%.Plus, the company’s First Aid and Safety Services increased 10.7% year-over-year. “For the ninth consecutive year, our organic revenue growth was in the mid- to high- single digits and EPS grew double digits when adjusted for one-time and special items,” per CEO Scott Farmer.“Additionally, our strong cash flow and balance sheet enabled us to deploy cash to increase shareholder value.” Cintas’ management calls for 2020 sales in the range of $7.24 billion to $7.31 billion.CTAS stock surged 6.3% after hours today.The post  appeared first on .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Cintas Earnings: CTAS Stock Surges as Profit Gains Nearly 20%@2019-07-16@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/cintas-earnings%3A-ctas-stock-surges-as-profit-gains-nearly-20-2019-07-16
"Image source: The Motley Fool. Q4 2019 , Good day, everyone and welcome to the Cintas Quarterly Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir. -- Good evening and thank you for joining us. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas, Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our fourth quarter results for fiscal 2019. After our commentary, we'll be happy to answer questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides us safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the Company's current views as to future events and financial performance.These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. Revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 was a record $1.79 billion, an increase of 7.4% over last year's fourth quarter. The organic growth rate which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 7.6%. In the fourth quarter of fiscal '19, the organic growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment was 6.8% and the organic growth rate for the First Aid and Safety Services operating segment was 10.7% . Gross margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal '19 of $823.6 million increased 9.5%. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 45.9% for the fourth quarter of fiscal '19 compared to 45.1% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '18.Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment gross margin as a percent of revenue improved 100 basis points from last year's fourth quarter to 46% and the First Aid and Safety Services operating segment gross margin percentage improved 70 basis points to 47.7%. Reported operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal '19 of $314.4 million increased 18.4%, operating margin was 17.5% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '19 compared to 15.9% in fiscal '18. Operating income was negatively impacted by integration expenses relating to the G&K acquisition by $900,000 in the fourth quarter of fiscal '19 and $15 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '18.Excluding the integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition, operating income increased 12.4% and operating margin improved 80 basis points to 17.6% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '19 compared to 16.8% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '18. Reported net income for continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal '19 was $226.2 million and reported earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal '19 were $2.06. Reported EPS was negatively impacted by integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition by $0.01 in the fourth quarter of fiscal '19. Excluding the G&K acquisition integration expenses, net income dollars increased 13.5% and net income margin was 12.6% compared to 12% last year.EPS increased 16.9%. We are pleased with these fourth quarter results which conclude a very successful year. A year ago in our prepared remarks, we shared our expectations for fiscal '19. We provided revenue and earnings per share guidance, we committed to an estimated amount of synergies from the G&K acquisition and the continued conversion of operations to a new ERP system. We shared our excitement for with returning to our debt to EBITDA target ahead of schedule and we committed to returning to our historical priorities for deployment of cash. We are happy to report that we not only achieved but exceeded these expectations.For the ninth consecutive year, our organic growth rate was in the mid to high single digits. This means, we've been able to grow consistently in multiples of GDP and employment growth. Due to our strong growth, innovative products and services and hard work and dedication of our employee partners, we moved up 41 places to Number 459 in the Fortune 500 ranking. For the ninth consecutive year, we achieved double-digit earnings-per-share growth from continuing operations when adjusted for one-time special items. We paid an annual dividend of $220.8 million that increased 26.5% over the prior year. We've now increased the annual dividend paid to our shareholders for the 35th consecutive year and the Company deployed excess cash by purchasing 4.8 million shares of Company stock for a total amount of $953.4 million. Fiscal '19's achievements were especially noteworthy given that they were accomplished in a period of extreme change management in which we were integrating our largest acquisition to-date and implementing a new enterprise resource planning system, namely SAP.The integration of a very large acquisition require the extra effort of everyone in the organization. Our partners executed our playbook and made the right adjustments when necessary. Better revenue retention and more cost synergies have resulted in a higher return on investments and plan. In many respect, the implementation of an ERP system is like an integration of a very large acquisition. It impacts hundreds of operations and require the involvement of experts from all departments of the Company. The conversion of each operation to SAP is an 8-month process of planning, changing business processes and employee mindsets, training and certification and customer communication. In implementing SAP, we are moving from a decades old platform to new technology that provides powerful information and data designed to help us improve our business.Through fiscal '19 about 65% of the operations are now in SAP. We will complete the rollout to the remaining locations in fiscal '20. The Cintas story is one of growth. We have grown both revenue and profit 48 of the past 50 years. The only exceptions were the Great Recession years. Our successful financial formula is organic revenue growth in the mid to high single digits, double-digit earnings-per-share growth, significant cash generation and prudent deployment of excess cash. Our priorities for uses of cash are investing in the business for growth, acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases. Our opportunity for continued growth is great. We have a product or service to help nearly every business get ready for the workday. This is evident in a diverse customer base spread over numerous verticals in both services providing and goods producing sectors of the economy.All businesses care about image, safety, cleanliness or compliance and businesses continue to outsource to concentrate on their core competencies. We are well positioned to continue to benefit from these tailwinds. We enjoy unrivaled scale, innovate our product and service offering, invest in technology and build our brand. Cintas possesses numerous competitive advantages, but our greatest one is our culture. This year, Cintas celebrates our heritage 90 years in the making. The Cintas culture is the foundation upon which the Company is built and it is the reason for the Company's success. The culture reflects our integrity, professionalism and dedication to our customers.Other hallmarks including positive discontent and competitive urgency drive us to innovate and stay out in front of the competition. The Cintas culture is why even after nearly a century of success, we believe our best years are ahead. Before turning the call over to Paul for more details, I'll provide our fiscal '20 expectations. We expect revenue to be in the range of $7.24 billion to $7.31 billion. We expect EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $8.30 to $8.45. Note the following regarding the guidance. The growth rate at the revenue guidance range is 5% to 6.1%.However, our fiscal '20 contains one less workday than our fiscal '19. Adjusting for this one-day difference on a constant workday basis, the revenue growth rate range at guidance is 5.4% to 6.5%. One less workday also has a negative impact on EPS reducing it about $0.06, which is a 90 basis point drag on the EPS growth rate. The guidance assumes an effective tax rate for fiscal '20 of 21% compared to a rate of 19.9% for fiscal '19. The higher effective tax rate in fiscal '20 negatively impacts our EPS growth, about 180 basis points and total EPS by about $0.14. Keep in mind that the tax rate can move up or down from period to period based on discrete events including the amount of stock compensation expense. The guidance assumes a share count for computing EPS of 109 million shares. This consists of diluted weighted average shares outstanding, plus participating securities in the form of restricted stock. It does not assume any future share buybacks, any potential deterioration in the US economy or any further specifically identified G&K integration expenses.And lastly, the guidance does not or does include the impact from the adoption of the Accounting Standards Update 2016-02 on leases. With the adoption, significant changes to the balance sheet will occur. We expect assets and liabilities to increase in the range of $160 million to $185 million. However, we do not expect any material effect on the P&L or the cash flow.I'll now turn the call over to Paul. -- Thank you, Mike. Please note that our fiscal fourth quarter contained the same number of workdays as the prior year fourth quarter. Looking ahead to fiscal '20, please note that there will be one less workday than in fiscal '19. One less day will negatively impact fiscal '20 total revenue growth by 40 basis points.To illustrate the magnitude of the headwind using fiscal 19's annual revenue, one less workday equates to about $27 million. One less workday also has a negative impact on operating margin and EPS. Fiscal '20 operating income margin will be reduced by about 12.5 basis points in comparison to fiscal '19 due to one less day of revenue. The negative impact on the margin occurs because certain expenses like amortization of uniforms and entrance mats are expensed on a monthly basis as opposed to on a daily basis. And we will have one less day of revenue to cover the expenses.As Mike stated, one less workday is a headwind of about 90 basis points on EPS growth and about a $0.06 drag on total EPS in comparison to fiscal '19 . Each quarter of fiscal '20 will contain 65 workdays. In comparison to fiscal '19, the fiscal '20 Q1 will have one less day, Q2 will have the same number of days, Q3 will have one additional day and Q4 will have one less day.Please keep the quarterly day differences in mind when modeling our fiscal '20 results. We have two reportable operating segments; Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in all other. All other consists of Fire Protection Services and our Uniform Direct Sale business.First Aid and Safety Services and all other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segments includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services.The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on routes. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1.43 billion, an increase of 6.4% excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes, the organic growth rate was 6.8%. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 46% for the fourth quarter, compared to 45% in last year's fourth quarter, an improvement of 100 basis points.Energy expense as a percentage of revenue was 2.4% compared to 2.55% in the prior year quarter. We are pleased with the gross margin expansion, and our ability to overcome wage pressures and tariff impacts. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training.This segment's revenue for the fourth quarter was $163.5 million. The organic growth rate for this segment was 10.7%. The First Aid segment gross margin was 47.7% in the fourth quarter compared to 47% in last year's fourth quarter, an increase of 70 basis points. First Aid segment gross margins continue to increase with strong top line growth.As our volume grows, we can negotiate better pricing from vendors. Growth also enables us to improve route density, reducing gasoline and diesel costs and enabling our service teams to spend more time serving and upselling. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale business -- businesses are reported in the all other category.Our fire business continues to grow each year at a strong pace. The Uniform Direct Sale business growth rates are generally low single digits, and are subject to volatility such as when we install a multi-million dollar account. Uniform Direct Sale however is a key business for us and its customers are all often significant opportunities to cross-sell and provide products and services from our other business units.All other revenue was $201.8 million, an increase of 12.7%. The organic growth rate was 11.6% and was driven by 14.3% organic growth in the fire business. All other gross margin was 43.7% for the fourth quarter of this fiscal year, compared to 43.6% from last year's fourth quarter. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 28.3% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '19 and '18.Lower labor expense as a percent of revenue was offset by increases in other expenses including stock compensation, insurance, workers' compensation and medical. We were [Phonetic] self-insured and therefore subject to some volatility in workers' comp and medical expense from quarter-to-quarter. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal '19 was 21.7%.As Mike stated earlier, the tax rate can move from period to period based on discrete events including the amount of stock compensation expense. Our cash and equivalents balance as of May 31st was $96.6 million, operating cash flow in the fourth quarter of fiscal '19 increased 31% from the amount of operating cash flow in the fourth quarter of fiscal '18.Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter were $68.9 million, our CapEx by operating segment was as follows : $54.7 million in Uniform Rental and Facility services, $9.6 million in first aid and safety and $4.6 million in all other. We expect fiscal '20 CapEx to be in the range of $280 million to $310 million. As of May 31, total debt was $2.849 billion. $2.537 billion was fixed interest rate debt and $312 million was variable rate debt in the form of a term loan and commercial paper. At May 31st, we were at our targeted leverage of 2 times debt to EBITDA.That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions.Ladies and gentlemen [Operator Instructions]. And our first question will come from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. -- Hi, this is actually Greg calling in. I was just hoping to get an update on the G&K synergies in terms of where we were exiting 2019, what we expect in 2020 and how you guys are feeling about potential sources of upside going forward? -- We finished fiscal '19 a little bit over $100 million for the year, a little bit better than we expected at the beginning of the year and I would expect that in fiscal '20, we will get to the neighborhood of $135 million, which is right in the middle of the range that we guided to three years ago, when we announced the G&K deal. So we feel great about achieving the synergies we initially set out to do but if we can get to that $135 million in fiscal '20 that's a year ahead of schedule. We had talked about a four year plan.And so we feel really good about -- about achieving that. The lifting, the heavy lifting that's left continues to be the route optimization, that will continue in fiscal '20. That's -- as we've talked about over the last few years that's not a source of significant synergies. We will get some energy benefits as we eliminate mileage on our routes. But, but we certainly are growing and need to continue to add capacity on route. So all-in-all, Greg. We feel great about the -- about where we are in that G&K integration. -- Okay that makes sense. And then I also wanted to ask about natural adjacencies out of your -- outside of what is the core business, currently it seems like we're getting toward the end of some of the heavy lifting on the integration and the SAP implementation and leverage is pretty reasonable at this point. I'm just wondering, if that changes, how you guys think about potentially going after some of these markets, and what kind of markets that could potentially be? Thanks. -- Well, we, I would say this, we -- I mentioned a little bit in my prepared remarks that that we look for opportunities in image, safety, cleanliness and compliance, and those are some pretty good umbrellas to be covering for our customers. And there are a lot of opportunities there. As we've seen over the years, we have had product adjacencies in all of our businesses and we're continuing to look for those under those four umbrellas that I mentioned. And certainly, we're looking for other things that may also be included under those umbrellas that could be possibly a different route structure or what have you, but we're being disciplined and we want to make sure that there is long-term value that there is a big market opportunity for any new type of product adjacency or business .We certainly, as you mentioned, we are at our 2 times leverage kind of a goal and we've got a strong balance sheet and so we're going to be looking for opportunities to deploy that cash and certainly acquisitions and other investments in our product lines are right at the top of our list.So we'll be -- we'll be looking for opportunities.Our next question will come from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. -- Hi, good afternoon. I wanted to get a sense of how you're thinking about the economic and employment outlook and basically, what you're hearing from your customers right now in terms of their propensity to spend going forward. Just some background on the industry would be great. -- Well we feel pretty good about the macro. Still, the environment still feels pretty conducive to sell new business to continue to penetrate and you see with our fourth quarter, our revenue results as well as the guidance that we've given that we feel pretty good about the momentum that we have in the business and that will continue into our fiscal '20. We look at GDP for calendar '19, it's still above expectations, are still above 2%. If you think about the last nine years, that's the neighborhood in which we've performed and we've had a pretty good nine year period, where we have grown in excess of that GDP and employment.So we still like the macro environment in the, in the last quarter. We've seen just under 500,000 jobs being created, in the last six months, 1 million, in the last year, 2 million and so the job growth has continued to be pretty good as well. So Toni. We like the environment and as you can see by our fourth quarter and our guidance, we like the momentum in the business. -- That's great. And then in terms of margins, how should we be thinking about expansion across the segments in the upcoming year as and then additionally, how should be thinking about incremental SAP costs over next year? -- So from a margin perspective, our guidance would imply something in the way of low-to -mid 17s [Phonetic] as a company and we're certainly striving within each of our businesses to grow margins and that's our expectation. That margin expectation for fiscal '20 would include some pretty good incrementals as a total business. And so we continue to look for opportunities and expect improvements in that. From an SAP cost perspective, we'll continue to roll that system out this fiscal year and we've talked about some of those rollout costs rolling off after fiscal '20 that's been somewhere in the, let's call it $10 million to $12 million.Because we've talked about SAP costs from a few years ago, increasing about 25 [Phonetic], about half of which has been costs that are related to the rollout, whether it's training consultants, etc.So we do expect that some of that will roll off in fiscal '21. -- Thank you.And next, we go to Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. -- Great, thank you. Hey, really nice job. The organic growth in the fire business, the 14.3% . Was there anything in there, in particular that kind of drove that? And then just really, really, really nice margin expansion. Can you give us a sense of how much of a headwind, kind of the tariffs and we just work because obviously, we were able to really offset that nicely. -- Yeah, Kevin, it's Paul. I will talk about fire and... -- Hi Paul. -- Turn to Mike on the tariffs, but in terms of fire. Yeah. The organic growth was strong at 14%, but we continue to expect out of that business organic growth of 10% or a little bit better. So very good execution in Q4 but that's kind of par for the course for the fire business of late, so nothing specific to really call out, but we just continue to do a great job of winning business.We have a very professional aggressive sales force and kind of leveraging our service capabilities that we have in uniform rental, and our experience is there to the fire business and very professional, service oriented businesses -- is on the service side.And so we expect that strong organic growth to continue. -- Kevin, from a tariff standpoint, there certainly has been a lot of noise in the tariff environment. And, but I would say, certainly a little bit of impact, not a lot. The noise around Mexico kind of came and went. China, while we have seen a lot of noise and seen some tariffs. We have not been too affected by the first couple of buckets of those tariffs, but we're not immune to -- to additional tariffs that might happen. We have to stay ahead of those things, and so we're seeing a little bit of it, but there is probably more noise than impact. From a labor perspective, we have -- we have certainly seen some impact market by market, especially. I wouldn't say that it's been significant.We do in our production or our plants environment. We do see a little bit more difficulty in hiring people, but generally speaking, the pressures that we've seen have been not significant and -- and we've been able to deal with them quite well so far. We're certainly, going to need to continue to keep our eyes on all of the tariff information that's going on, now, as we move forward. -- Super. Really nice job. -- Thank you.Our next question will come from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. -- Hey guys, good afternoon. I guess, if I could go back to margins -- in the margins implied in the guidance. I think if we back out the margin benefit from the tail of the G&K synergies and also the drag from one less workday, it doesn't sound like there, the guidance implies a whole lot of margin expansion aside of the -- from those two factors. So I know, you tend to have some conservatism in how you guide, but is there anything else you'd call out that would lead to less operating leverage in fiscal '20? -- No and quite honestly, Gary. I'm not, I'm not sure that I would agree, I think if you think about that margin improvement. That's -- that's -- let's call it low to mid 17s [Phonetic] compared to 16.7 [Phonetic] for fiscal '19 would imply at the midpoint, roughly incrementals right around 30%. That's at the high end of where we talk about being if you strip out those incremental synergies, you're still above 20% at the midpoint. So we feel -- we're right where we want to be with those operating margins and we do expect continued improvement even without the synergies. But inclusive of the synergies, we like the margin expansion, quite a bit. -- Okay. -- Keep in mind, Gary. Keep in mind that when we compare if you're backing from EPS, we've got a $0.14 headwind in the higher tax rate than in fiscal '18. And then, as you mentioned, we've got the $0.06 headwind from the one less workday, so if you're backing in from EPS, you got to keep in mind, there is a $0.20 headwind. -- Yeah, I guess, I was just doing, you said 35 [Phonetic] incremental -- million incremental savings, that's 50 basis points and then that's offset by 10 or 15 [Phonetic] from the one less workday, it's sort of like half of that margin, but I guess -- I guess your points fair that the other half is still pretty good expansion. So that's fine. I guess, I just want to ask one other thing... -- And I would say from a synergy standpoint. Gary, I would -- we think about it as about 105 to 135 [Phonetic], so about a $30 million improvement. -- Okay, all right, fair enough. And then on SAP, I -- a two parter, you've -- I guess, you said you're 65% on the way through the network rollout at this point that you've talked about two benefits. The one you're most excited about is just the information allowing you to cross-sell and run the business better. How is that playing out? Once you've got one of your facilities that is up and running. Is that pretty quick or is there a meaningful learning curve. And I guess, what I'm really trying to get at is, are you beginning to benefit yet from the rollout to date or should we think of it more as a future -- as a future benefit in later this year, maybe even more so into next year? Thanks. -- Sure, I. The -- there is a learning curve, no question about it. This is a system that is heavily data dependent and we have to change our business processes locally to be able to use that system most efficiently. So there is a drag in terms of, we talked about an 8-month planning process prior to implementation. There is also a period of time afterwards, where we are getting efficient at using the system. So it is a -- it certainly is a process and a lot of change going on. From a local perspective, I think we are seeing some incremental benefits like new portable route computers for our SSRs and so there are some incremental benefits that are probably more on the minor side. I think from the ability to manage the information, we would typically do that at greater than a one location at a time type of a look.And so the more we get on, the more we can begin to look at different regional groupings and take advantage of the power of that information. So I think, most of that is going to come as we move into '21 and '22. -- Great, thanks. And then if I could just sneak in one quick cleanup numbers. You said last quarter, you expected, like in the cadence of '19 that the Q1 tax rate to be a lot lower. Is last year's number a good ballpark or should we think, it's higher than that, but still much lower than the rest of the year? Thank you. -- Yes, you're right. Gary, it will be -- it will be quite a bit lower. I would probably think of it in terms of a -- kind of a 12% to 13% type of a range and a lot of that will depend on the level of stock compensation benefits based on the price of our stock, the performance of stock. -- Sure, right, yeah. -- But you're right, it will be much lower than the rest of the year. -- Thank you.Our next question will come from Blake Johnson with Goldman Sachs. -- Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Regarding your revenue guidance, how much of the growth do you expect to be driven by further penetration of the non-programmer market versus head count growth at existing customers and can you discuss traction in penetrating underrepresented verticals such as healthcare and industrials this quarter? -- Sure. So for fiscal '20, our new business efforts are generally the driver of our revenue growth in all of our businesses and we like the opportunities there, particularly in that no programmer space. We can get to that no programmer space with our unique garments with our unique garment solutions like our scrub systems and we think, there is a big opportunity there, so that -- that we expect that to continue to drive the growth like it has for years past. But the penetration remains good, it's when we can provide a good product and articulate the value to our customers. They certainly have shown that they're willing to spend, so that certainly will be important for us, but it's led by the new business efforts. From a fourth quarter perspective, those under penetrated verticals continue to perform very well, healthcare, education, the government sectors, they continue to perform very well.We are focused on those areas, particularly with our sales efforts and we're encouraged by what we have seen in '19 and expect good things out of those verticals also in fiscal '20 and beyond. -- Great, that's helpful. And then regarding G&K, one of the strategic benefits was to drive higher penetration of ancillary products to legacy G&K customers. Can you discuss any progress made here? Maybe the current percentage of cross-selling between various lines of business or any other metrics there would be great? -- We certainly have made progress in fiscal '19 in terms of some penetration, it's hard. I'm not going to provide any specific penetration because so much of that volume is intermixed with legacy Cintas volume. However, we certainly have seen that -- that our penetration has been strong. Our hygiene growth has been strong for the year and so we are encouraged and believe that we've made some good headway there and expect to continue that in fiscal '20, but I would say, overall, we're pleased. -- Great, that's helpful. Thank you.Next, we go to Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. -- Hi, how about just a quick comment about client retention levels, and any changes year-over-year. And my second question is the pricing for new accounts. Has that seen any upward movement in recent years? -- Andrew, it's Paul. In terms of retention, I would say that, really no significant change in our business, it's been roughly about 95% and that's still where it's -- where it was last fiscal year and that's where we still expect it to be. Of course, we're always working on improving that and there are opportunities, but I would say, nothing significant to note. In terms of pricing. -- For new account. -- Our business is very -- for new accounts. -- Andrew, it's a pretty competitive environment still out there and I'll give you an example. When we're -- when we're out there selling workwear for example, our customers have lots of options and so they -- there is a retail option, where we're seeing billions of dollars are being spent at retail -- large retailers. We're seeing direct sale options, where those competitors can design and manage programs and we're seeing the rental option as well.So our customers have alternatives and options and so we have to -- we have to continue to innovate and create good garments and other products. We've got to be able to articulate the value of what we do versus our retail environment versus a direct sale program and we've got to follow through on that great service. So there is a point, Andrew is, our customers still have lots of options. The competition is certainly out there and is available to them and we've got to make sure that we are providing the right value and so all of that competition it keeps. It's a bit of a governor on what we can do with pricing. And so while we are looking for the best price and we sell profitable new business there certainly is competition that keeps that pricing in a -- in a -- bit of a tighter range. -- Okay, thank you.Next, our question will come from Seth Weber with RBC Capital Markets. -- Hey, good afternoon, everybody. -- Hi Seth. -- I wanted to ask about the big share buyback in the fourth quarter. In your -- in your prepared remarks, you kind of listed share buyback as I think, third or fourth in your pecking order, so I mean, is this just a function of you couldn't find acquisitions that you want, that you liked or valuations just stretched above what you're willing to pay. Or can you just sort of characterize why the buyback was so strong in the fourth quarter relative to kind of your pecking order? Thanks. -- Sure. We -- our pecking order is just as we said and we are certainly looking for opportunities. But I'll tell you, Seth, our cash flow was really good. In the fourth quarter, our cash flow from operations was just under $400 million. In the third quarter, it was $325 million. So $750 million [Phonetic] -- $725 million in the second half of the year. So cash flow has been really good and look, we like to put that to work. We would love to be -- we have continued to invest in the business. We would love to find acquisitions. We are aggressively working on those, but we can do with the buyback that we just did in the fourth quarter and still do execute on a large acquisition if it became available.So it's a little bit opportunistic, we like the momentum in the business, the average of those, the average buyback was something in the way of just under $220 million for the fourth quarter and based on where our stock sits today. It feels like a pretty good move for us. So I think, it's opportunistic. We'll continue to look at it this way but we certainly love investing in the business and we love to make acquisitions as well. -- Okay, that's fair. Thanks. And then just maybe just to comment on the SG&A in the fourth quarter was kind of flattish year-to-year, you did mention some, some extraordinary costs. I think -- that offset the lower labor. So how are you thinking about SG&A as a percentage of revenue for next year, do you -- should you see some leverage there, should it go down as a percentage of revenue? Thanks. -- We do, we certainly do. If you think about the fourth quarter, one of the call-outs that Paul made was our stock compensation expense. Our stock continues to perform very-very well and we love that. But it does result in greater stock comp expense, it was higher by about 30 basis points than last year. When we have a good stock performance, we generally will also get a lot of stock option exercises, which we had in the fourth quarter, which was why our tax rate was a little lower than guided.And when we have those exercises, because they are non-qualified stock options. There is an employer portion of payroll tax and so when you combine those things, it's a little bit of a headwind. We don't mind it because of the stock performance but it was there. For the year, our SG&A was down 30 basis points and we certainly do expect to get leverage in fiscal '20 and beyond. That doesn't mean, it's going to happen every quarter, but certainly over the course of the year, we expect it. -- Okay, thank you very much guys. Appreciate it.And next, we go to Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. -- Thanks very much and good afternoon. I have three, but a couple of maybe quick and easy.First one, the way you guys have sized the synergies, it's been more on a time period of achievement than it has been any change to the absolute level, and you said, obviously the route optimization is the last big piece that -- that isn't going to be super impactful. So I guess the question I'm getting at is, is there potential upside to the 130, 140 [Phonetic] once we get out a year from now or is this -- is this probably going to be it for the way you guys discuss it? -- Well, two things. First of all the upside, I've mentioned a few times in the past, we think is coming, will come from our sourcing environment as we kind of combine the G&K spend, legacy G&K spend in our spend. We have seen some of that heavy lifting that is rolling into our P&L and will continue to do so in fiscal '21. And we look for continued opportunities and benefits there. So if it gets above the $135 million that I mentioned earlier and we generally expect that it will, it will likely be in that service. I'm sorry. In that supply chain area.You know, I'll say this though, Scott, it gets harder as the further we get from the acquisition date. It gets harder and harder to specifically say whether it's a synergy or just more efficiency in the business. And so our expectation is after fiscal '20, we won't be talking about that quite as much and we'll be moving forward with looking for all different kinds of efficiencies in the business. -- All right, thanks. Yeah, understood and appreciate that. The next question is, just on -- on CapEx. Looks like an increase of about 1% to about 12% at the high end of the range year-over-year. I was just curious, what would be the swing factors of the 1% versus the 12% over the coming year, on a year-over-year basis? Thanks. -- I'm a little confused by what you mean by 1% to 12%. -- Just comparing the [Speech Overlap] for the guide in fiscal '20 versus fiscal '19, assuming my numbers are right. -- So the guide -- the guide of $280 million to $310 million -- you're saying it's a 12% -- you're saying a 12% increase over our CapEx for fiscal '19. -- Yeah, that's correct. At the high end, it's 1% at the low end, if I... -- Yeah, at the high end, I think. Yeah, I'm sorry, I -- sorry, it took me a bit to understand that.Look we are growing. We're growing nicely and we've, as you know, we've -- we consolidated quite a few G&K locations into Cintas locations, but there is still our capacity needs, particularly in those markets that didn't have a G&K operation in them, and so we do have capacity needs -- as we continue to grow and I would expect that that would -- that fact [Phonetic] would continue if we continue to grow the way we're growing. And so we're going to probably have a little bit of an uptick this fiscal '20 just simply because we are continuing to grow and add more plants than probably we have in the last few years, because of the consolidation efforts. -- Okay great, thanks. And the -- that third question I wanted to get in with -- was on the fourth quarter call, in years past, you've shared a little bit of information with regard to Uniform segment revenue mix. I'm not anticipating much of a change but is that something you're open to sharing this year? -- Yeah, Scott. I have that and you're right, not much of a change. Uniform Rental, and as you mentioned, this is measured as a -- as a percentage of the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment on its Q4 data. So Uniform Rental, 50% of the mix, dust control came in at 18%, hygiene is 14%, shop towels at 5%, linen 9% and then catalog, that was about 4%. -- Great, thanks. Yeah, that's very change from last year. Appreciate all that color, guys. Thank you.{Operator Instructions]. And next, we go to Justin Hauke with Robert W. Baird. -- Yeah, good evening, guys. I guess the one question that I had here. Just on the balance sheet and kudos for getting the leverage down to where you're looking to -- to hold it at 2 times. But I'm curious on the upside -- in the cycle where we are today, how much leverage would you be willing to tolerate to the extent that there were opportunities whether in your ancillary business or in your current business -- where -- maybe there were more material acquisitions that would be out there, what -- how much leverage would you be willing to put on the balance sheet here? -- Well, I'll start with, we currently have a covenant that limits us to 3.5 [Phonetic], now. We've got a great banking group and if we had a -- an acquisition that forced us to go above 3.5, then we would look at it in a couple of different ways. First, does it create the long-term value that would warrant that kind of leveraging and secondly, given then the combined cash flow, would we be able to reduce that fairly quickly, like we did with the G&K -- after the G&K deal close. We would look at it from those two standpoints. So I think, it just depends on the value and the long-term value creation. But we'd certainly, if we felt like -- if we felt like it was a great opportunity, we certainly would evaluate that. -- Right, that's helpful. That's all I had here. Thank you.Our next question will come from Dan Dolev with Nomura. -- Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. Nice job. -- Hi, Dan. -- So on Uniform Rental organic growth. I can't believe I am complaining here because 6.8% is truly an amazing number but compares were about 120 basis points easier. I mean, what can get us upside to that number in fiscal '20? Is it productivity? Is it up-selling like, it -- when can you get to that -- that the heydays of the 8% organic growth and what needs to happen for that? Thanks. -- Well, we would certainly need a very good macro and we like the macro today, but we would need a good macro. We need to be firing on all cylinders in terms of our sales productivity and with some good and innovative products and services. And we've got to be -- we've got to be really on our game to sell into our current existing customers. Dan, look the last four years, our -- our organic growth has been right in this range, where we came in this fourth quarter and we've talked about, I'll -- a few times in the past. We like this pace, it allows us to manage the growth in sales reps. The growth in route capacity. The growth in production capacity and so we do -- we do like the pace and we think that we can get some pretty good margin improvement, when we're at this kind of pace. We can manage the business very well. And we like it. The last four years, we've been -- our organic growth in total has been 6.8%, 6.7%, 7.1%, 6.5% and obviously the 6.5% included the first quarter, where we were -- where we were bottoming out in terms of the post G&K. That's right where we want to be that 6.8% and our guidance for next year is pretty darn close to that. So that's the pace we like, Dan. -- Got it, great job. And then just a quick follow-up on the productivity, just to be clear, I think last quarter, you said that the sales productivity was good, but if I can quote not as good as it was in the second quarter, is there an update to that one, in terms of how it trended in the fourth quarter? -- Yes, Dan, you are correct. We were making great progress on the sales rep productivity kind of coming out of the G&K acquisition in terms of filling the sales roles and getting everybody trained and up to speed and then also getting the systems converted, which was necessary for those G&K reps to sell the Cintas product line. You'll recall, we -- we're making nice improvement through Q2. And then last quarter in Q3 with some weather impacts, we noted that the productivity dipped. But in Q4, it did bounce back very nicely even stronger than it was in Q2. -- Excellent. Nice job. And congrats, again. -- Thank you.Our next question will come from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair. -- Hey guys, thanks for fitting me in. A couple of quick ones here. First of all, if I go back to the fourth quarter. And I look at Uniform Rental segment gross margin expansion of 100 basis points year-over-year. That's a very solid result. Can you just walk us through the primary factors driving that expansion outside of the lower energy costs? -- Yeah, we certainly got some good leverage from the revenue growth. We had some nice synergy capture. Energy, as you said, helped a little bit and we're selling profitable business and so a lot of things went well in the quarter from a pricing perspective, probably a little bit better in the fourth quarter incrementally than in previous quarters. The -- the pricing while still competitive as I talked about with Andrew's question, probably just a little bit incrementally more positive and that certainly helps the margin as well.So all in all, great synergy, great leveraging, selling good profitable business and a little bit of energy help. All put together for a pretty good quarter. -- Got it. Thanks, Mike. -- By the way, if I could -- if I could add, that this -- that the rental gross margin for the year was up 170 basis points from our fiscal '16 which was the year before the G&K deal. So if you think about adding a legacy G&K business with a gross margin of about 37.5% to now today, that full rental gross -- full year rental gross margin of 45.5%. We've made some great progress in the last few years and our partners have worked so hard in integrating this acquisition, we bought a very good business and our new partners have done a great job. Our existing partners have as well and it really shows in this fiscal '19-year with some -- with some really good margins, especially in that gross margin area. -- Yeah, I think everybody in the investment community would agree with that statement. It's been very impressive. If I could move on, did you -- how much you have remaining on your buyback, Mike? And does your guidance assume -- what does your guidance assume with respect to share repurchase? -- We have $263 million on the $1 billion that was authorized last fall and the guidance assumes no additional share buyback. -- No additional share buybacks. Okay, and lastly, from me, any quantifiable impact from weather in the quarter? I mean, we had more rainfall across the U.S. this quarter. But I'm not sure, if that has the same level of impact that the cold weather had last quarter? Thank you. -- Not nearly the same widespread impact. So nothing worth calling out. -- Got it. Thanks, guys, congrats on a great quarter. -- Thank you.And that does conclude our question and answer session for today. And I'd like to turn the call back over to Mike Hansen for any additional or closing remarks. -- Well. Thank you again for joining us tonight. We will issue our first quarter financial results in September, and we look forward to speaking with you again at that time.That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation. --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --

nvesting can be as hard or as easy as you want. Some businesses are nearly opaque in understanding how they operate.  was long an example of a business with  that truly knowing the company was a difficult task.Yet  (NYSE: DIS) ,  (NASDAQ: CTAS) , and  (NYSE: RGR) are all quite easy to understand. Three Motley Fool contributors simply explain why these are stocks worth investing in.Image source: Getty Images. You don't have to be an investing genius to understand how Disney makes money.That's the basic skeleton of Disney's business. The House of Mouse is still monetizing Mickey Mouse, more than nine decades after the premiere of  .Sure, the selection of tie-in sales has evolved over the years. Disney has moved far beyond TV series, lunch boxes, and pajamas to become a true entertainment conglomerate. From Disney World and cruise ships to video games and an upcoming video streaming service, it's hard to find a niche in the entertainment sector where Disney isn't a significant player.And it's also true that the original content is expanding beyond the PG-13 target audience. Big-ticket acquisitions gave this company the keys to the Marvel and  universes, both catering to older youths as well as full-grown adults. And  married Disney to the classic Twenty-First Century Fox content library, where you'll find R-rated gems such as  and  . The Mouse isn't just for kids anymore.That doesn't make Disney's investment thesis any harder to understand, though. A larger target market simply extends the company's proven formula even further, making Disney's stock even more attractive in the long run.This is the kind of stock you can give to your grandkids as a first investment. Everybody knows and understands Walt Disney, and it's also a top-shelf investment with decades of healthy growth ahead. You'll have no trouble understanding Cintas as long as you've ever rented anything, or gone to the dry cleaner's, or ordered a pizza. So that should cover pretty much everybody.Cintas is primarily a uniform rental company. Its customers are businesses in sectors as diverse as hospitality, auto repair, and transportation. Basically, if a business wants its employees to wear a uniform -- and doesn't want to install its own laundry facility (who would?) -- it's a potential customer for Cintas. A Cintas driver makes the rounds in a delivery van on a set schedule, picking up soiled uniforms and delivering clean ones.But this business model offers a lot of opportunity for additional services. Just like a pizza delivery driver can not only bring you pizza, but also breadsticks, cookies, and two liters of Sprite, a Cintas delivery driver -- while already on site dropping off uniforms -- can also change out dirty floor mats, restock your business' restrooms, and check your first-aid kits and fire extinguishers. Cintas offers all of these services -- and more -- which helps make it a cost-effective choice for any business with uniforms, floors, restrooms, and safety equipment. So, basically any business with uniforms.Cintas' share price has more than doubled over the last three years as it has sold these additional services to existing clients and gobbled up smaller competitors in the fragmented uniform-rental space. With its  business model, it's easy to understand that Cintas is a good bet for continued outperformance. Sturm, Ruger essentially does one thing, and does it exceptionally well: It makes firearms. It is the  in the U.S., beating out rival Smith & Wesson on the basis of also being the largest rifle manufacturer, even surpassing Remington, which makes nothing but long arms.Although the firearms industry remains in a slump more than two years after the election of President Trump, there are indications the market has reached a bottom and may soon experience growth again. It undoubtedly won't be at the pace leading up to the 2016 presidential elections, but will instead be at the more historical norms.FBI data from the National Instant Criminal Background Check System shows checks of potential gun buyers rose almost 4% last year. But when adjusted for checks of existing permit holders (which gives a better indication of actual consumer demand), they fell 6%. Still, that's an improvement over last year and indicates the gun market is returning to normalcy.Ruger has remained a stalwart throughout the downturn. It still managed to report operating margins of 13.7% last year, versus 14.7% the year before, despite the decline in sales. With an industry that may have its longest downturn now in the rearview mirror, the leading gunmaker could be poised for a turnaround.Sturm, Ruger trades at just 18 times trailing earnings and less than 11 times the free cash flow it produces, putting it in bargain basement territory. Selling firearms is a business that's pretty easily understood, and with one of the best now at such a discounted valuation, a portfolio would be on target for growth by adding it.Motley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.

"hen the job market is strong,  tends to be strong. That's because the company specializes in providing uniforms to the employees of the companies on its extensive client list, and a healthy economy also helps drive business formation and adds new customers to Cintas' rolls.Coming into Tuesday's fiscal fourth-quarter financial report,  that the company would continue to profit from the strong employment picture in the U.S., and they wanted to see signs that Cintas would keep driving forward into a new fiscal year. Its results were solid, and the guidance it gave for fiscal 2020 created even more optimism about the uniform company's prospects.A Cintas employee refills a cleaning solution dispenser. Image source: Cintas.Fiscal fourth-quarter results reflected the strength of the U.S. economy. The company posted revenue of $1.79 billion, up 7.4% from year-ago levels and outpacing what most of those following the stock had expected. Net income rebounded 22% to $226.1 million, and the resulting earnings of $2.06 per share came in well ahead of the consensus forecast among investors for $1.93.Fundamentally, Cintas did well with its two main business segments. Organic growth for the key uniform rental and facility services segment came in at 6.8%, which accelerated from its pace three months ago. First aid and safety services saw even stronger organic growth, as its 10.7% growth rate pulled up Cintas' businesswide organic growth to 7.6%.Cost-control efforts were also successful in bolstering the bottom line. Gross margin was higher by eight-tenths of a percentage point to 45.9% versus the year-earlier quarter, with a 1 percentage point gain in the uniform rental segment's gross margin driving the gains. Operating margin similarly rose to 17.6% after adjusting for integration-related expenses.CEO Scott Farmer was happy with the way his company closed its 2019 fiscal year. ""For the ninth consecutive year, our organic revenue growth was in the mid to high single digits,"" Farmer said, ""and EPS grew double digits when adjusted for one-time and special items."" He was also pleased with the way that Cintas' balance sheet and cash flow helped the company boost shareholder value, taking special note of its 26% increase in its dividends.Cintas has high hopes, with Farmer noting that ""all businesses care about image, safety, cleanliness, or compliance, and businesses continue to outsource to concentrate on their core competency."" As long as its customers remain financially healthy enough to enlist help with things like uniforms and cleaning supplies, Cintas will remain in a prime position to deliver goods and services to them.It also gave encouraging guidance for the new 2020 fiscal year. The company expects revenue between $7.24 billion and $7.31 billion, which would represent top-line growth of around 5% to 6% versus its final figures for fiscal 2019. Cintas expects earnings between $8.30 and $8.45 per share, suggesting an even faster growth rate of 9% to 11%. The bottom-line estimates in particular were on the high side of the $8.29 consensus forecast among those following the stock.Cintas investors were happy with the news, and the stock jumped 5% in pre-market trading Wednesday following the Tuesday afternoon announcement. Despite some concerns among economists that the strength of the U.S. economy might finally be starting to wane, Cintas hasn't yet seen any signs that the all-important job market is weakening. As long as employment growth remains robust,  to profit from its successful clients.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Shares of   rose a very dramatic 41% through the first six months of 2019, according to data provided by . That easily beats the  roughly 17% gain over the same span. There wasn't any one specific event to point to, however, since the gain was basically a result of Cintas doing what Cintas does best.Cintas is probably most recognized for providing companies with uniforms. That business continued to perform well in the first half of 2019. It has also been expanding its reach into new areas in recent years, with its first aid- and safety products-focused business also performing well in the first half. The company's revenues increased roughly 6% year over year in its fiscal third quarter, with operating income up nearly 40% (helped along by some one-time items).Image source: Getty Images.Although these figures are impressive, some underlying successes really stand out. Specifically, Cintas' operating margin in its uniform business increased 80 basis points, with an even higher 130-basis-point improvement within its first aid and safety operations. That comes as the company continues to integrate a sizable acquisition (G&K Services) made in 2017. So the core of the business is not only strong but getting stronger. Investors have clearly been pleased to see this solid execution. Along with reporting good historical results, the company  to its fiscal 2019 as well when it released quarterly earnings in March.To be fair, the industrial company's business is highly . And in late 2018, it fell further than the broader market when Wall Street swooned amid concerns about the U.S. economic outlook. So a portion of its strong first-half stock advance was related to the bounce back from that fall. But the real driver for Cintas has long been solid execution, and it didn't disappoint investors on that score in the first half of 2019.Cintas stock has a long history of trading at a rich valuation, which makes sense given its history of impressive financial results. That's no different today, with a  of around 31.5 times sitting well above the company's five-year average of around 26.5 times. Essentially, it is a well-run company, and Wall Street knows it. That said, with the current economic expansion among the longest in history, most investors should probably put Cintas on the wish list and not the buy list today. It is a great company, but the stock hardly appears to be a bargain after the first-half stock advance.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The organic growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 6%. In the third quarter of fiscal '19, the organic growth rate for the uniform rental and facility services operating segment was 6.2% and the organic growth rate for the first aid and safety services operating segment was 8.6%.The organic growth rates of both segments were negatively impacted by a greater number of customers being closed for business in this year's third quarter compared to last year's third quarter due to severe winter weather and the timing of the holidays. Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve fell on a Monday this year compared to on a Sunday in the prior year.Gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal '19 of $755.2 million increased 7.8%. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 44.9% for the third quarter of fiscal '19 compared to 44.1% in the third quarter of fiscal '19. Uniform rental and facility services operating segment gross margin as a percentage of revenue improved 80 basis points from last year's third quarter to 44.9% and the first aid and safety services operating segment gross margin percentage improved 130 basis points to 48.2%.Reported operating income for the third quarter of fiscal '19 of $278.3 million increased 39.1%. Operating income margin was 16.5% in the third quarter of fiscal '19 compared to 12.6% in fiscal '18. Operating income was negatively impacted by integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition by $800,000 in the third quarter of fiscal '19 and $9.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal '18.Operating income in the third quarter of fiscal '18 was also reduced $39.7 million by a one-time cash payment to Cintas employees following the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into legislation on December 22nd, 2017. Excluding the integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition and the one-time cash payment to employees, operating income increased 11.8% and operating income margin improved 90 basis points to 16.6% in the third quarter of fiscal '19 compared to 15.7% in the third quarter of fiscal '18.Reported net income from continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal '19 was $200.9 million and reported earnings per diluted share from continuing operations from the third quarter of fiscal '19 were $1.83.Please note that there were a few items impacting the comparability o  ed financial results. First, G&K acquisition integration expenses negatively impacted reported EPS in the third quarter of fiscal '19 and '18 by $0.01 and $0.06, respectively. Also, reported EPS in the third quarter of fiscal '18 included a negative impact of $0.24 from the one-time cash payment to employees.Finally, reported EPS in the third quarter of fiscal '18 included a positive impact of $1.59 from benefits under the tax app, primarily due to a one-time reevaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. Excluding these items, net income dollars increased 31.7% and net income margin was 12% compared to 9.6% last year. EPS increased 34.3%.As Scott Farmer, our Chairman and CEO, stated in today's press release, we're pleased with our third quarter financial performance. Our employee partners are working diligently to exceed customer expectations while also making significant progress on integrating the G&K acquisition and converting more operations to our new enterprise resource planning system.And while our employee partners are focusing on getting customers ready for the workday, we remain committed to efforts to increase shareholder value. In this year's third quarter, we paid an annual dividend totaling $220.8 million. The dividend of $2.05 per share was an increase of 26.5% over last year's dividend. Also in the quarter, we purchased $100 million of Cintas stock under our buybacks program. As of February 28th, we have now purchased $546.6 million of Cintas stock during fiscal '19 and the amount remaining under our buyback program is $863.4 million.We updated our annual guidance for fiscal '19. We expect revenue to be in the range of $6.87 billion to $6.885 billion. This implies a strong finish to our fiscal '19 year with fourth quarter revenue growth in the range of 6% to 7% and operating income margin in the range of 17% to 17.5%. We expect EPS from continuing operations excluding certain items to be in the range of $7.42 to $7.48.Note the following regarding the EPS guidance. It assumes an effective tax rate for fiscal '19 of 20.6%. This implies a fourth quarter effective tax rate of 24.5%. The reported effective tax rate in last year's fourth quarter was 21.5%. The higher tax rate expected in the fourth quarter of this year will have a negative impact of $0.07 to $0.08. Keep in mind that the tax rate can move up or down from period to period based on discreet events, including the amount of stock compensation benefits.Our guidance that assumes that diluted share count for competing EPS of 111.5 million shares. It does not assume any further G&K integration expenses and it does not assume any future share buybacks. I'll now turn the call over to Paul.Thank you, Mike. Please note that our fiscal third quarter contained the same number of work days as the prior year third quarter. Additionally, there will be no work day differences in our fiscal fourth quarter.Looking ahead to fiscal 2020, please note that there will be one less work day than in fiscal '19. Each quarter of fiscal '20 will contain 65 work days. One less day will negatively impact fiscal '20 total revenue growth by about 40 to 50 basis points. To illustrate the magnitude of the headwind, using fiscal '19's third quarter revenue, one work day is about $26 million.One less work day also has a negative impact on operating margin. Fiscal '20 operating income margin will be reduced by about 10 to 15 basis points in comparison to fiscal '19. The negative impact on the margin occurs because certain expenses like amortization of uniforms and entrance mats are expensed on a monthly basis as opposed to on a daily basis. We will have one less day of revenue to cover the expenses. Please keep these headwinds in mind when modeling our fiscal '20 results.We have two reportable operating segments, uniform rental and facility services and first aid and safety services. The remainder of our business is included in all other. All other consists of fire protection services and our uniform direct sale business. First aid and safety services and all other are combined and presented as other services on the income statement.Uniform rental and facility services operating segments includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, and towels, and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers en route. Uniform rental and facilities services revenue was $1.358 billion, an increase of 5.7%.Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes, the organic growth rate was 6.2%. As Mike mentioned earlier, the organic growth rate was negatively impacted by customer closures caused by the severe weather and the holiday calendar. Our uniform rental and facilities services segment gross margin was 44.9% for the third quarter compared to 44.1% in last year's third quarter, an improvement of 80 basis points.Energy expenses as a percentage of revenue was 2.4% compared to 2.5% in the prior year quarter. We are pleased with the gross margin expansion and our ability to overcome the weather and holiday challenges as well as continued wage pressures, increased commodity costs such as for hangers, which are sourced mostly from China, and the inefficiencies that are customary with an acquisition integration and an ERP system implementation.Our first aid and safety services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products, and training. This segment's revenue for the third quarter was $149.2 million. The organic growth rate for the segment was 8.6%. This segment too was negatively impacted by severe weather and the timing of the holidays.The first aid segment gross margin was 48.2% in the third quarter compared to 46.9% in last year's third quarter, an increase of 130 basis points. Note that first aid segment gross margins are at record levels and have been marching higher since the acquisition of ZEE Medical three and a half years ago.National account new business continues to help drive high single-digit organic growth. Penetration of existing customers with more products and services is also a major contributor to topline growth and it results in above average gross margins.Our fire protection services and uniform direct sale businesses are reported in the all other category. Our fire business continues to grow each year at a strong pace. Uniform direct sale business growth rates are generally low single digits and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multi-million-dollar account. Uniform direct sale, however, is a key business for us and its customers are often significant opportunities to cross-sell and provide products and services from other business units.All other revenue was $174.8 million, an increase of 4.5%. The organic growth rate was 2.3% and was driven by 11.3% organic growth in the fire business. All other gross margin was 42.3% for the third quarter of this fiscal year compared to 41.7% for last year's third quarter.Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 28.3% in the third quarter compared to 30.9% in last year's third quarter. Note that the one-time cash payment to employees in last year's third quarter that Mike mentioned earlier was recorded in selling and administrative expenses. Excluding this payment, last year's selling and administrative expense as a percent of revenue was 28.4% compared to 28.3% in this year's third quarter.Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal '19 was 20.1%. In the third quarter of fiscal '18, we realized the significant tax benefit from the Tax Act, primarily due to a one-time revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. Our fiscal '19 EPS guidance assumes an effective tax rate of 20.6%. This implies a fourth quarter effective tax rate of 24.5%. The effective tax rate in last year's fourth quarter was 21.5%. As Mike stated previously, the higher expected tax rate will have a negative impact on fourth quarter EPS of $0.07 to $0.08.Our cash and equivalence balance as of February 28th was $80.9 million. Operating cash flow in the third quarter of fiscal '19 increased 15.7% from the amount of operating cash flow in the third quarter of fiscal '18.Capital expenditures in the third quarter were $70.2 million. Our capex by operating segment was as follows -- $55.8 million in uniform rental and facilities services, $8.1 million in first aid and safety, and $6.3 million in all other. We expect fiscal '19 capex to be in the range of $270 million to $285 million.As of February 28th, total debt was $2.754 billion. $2.537 billion is fixed interest rate debt and $217.5 million is variable rate commercial paper. At February 28th, we are at our targeted leverage of two times debt to EBITDA.That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions.Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. If you would like to ask a question, please signal by pressing *1 on your telephone keypad. If you are using a speakerphone, please make sure that your mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment. Again, press *1 to ask a question.Our first question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.Hi, good afternoon. Uniform rental was a bit below what we'd expected this quarter. Could you just give us the organic growth ex the holiday shift and ex the weather closure. Is it possible that any sales were bumped into the fourth quarter?We expect that the impact was about 60 basis points to the growth of both rental and the total company. I would say that we don't expect much to be bumped to the fourth quarter. That's why you see the guidance coming down from a revenue perspective a little bit greater than the 60 basis points for the third quarter. 60 basis points is roughly $10 million in the quarter.When we think about that quarter, this is the first year since fiscal '15 that the holidays weren't either on a Friday, the weekend, or a Monday. We just found many of our customers not only took off the holiday, but took off the Monday before the holiday, took off a day or so after the holidays as well. When that happened, it just created a lot of disruption to, for example, our new business effort, where appointment setting for our sales reps became very difficult and the momentum they had going into the holidays was really stopped and they had to regain that momentum with the decision maker meetings, etc. after the holidays.The other thing was the weather. If you think about the polar vortex, for example, we had customer shutdowns from Minnesota all the way to the East Coast. Again, that creates real challenges for our sales people to get continued momentum of meeting with decision makers, etc.It also has an impact on our drivers. Our drivers, we call them service sales reps or SSRs. When our customers close, our SSRs have to squeeze more stops into fewer number of days. When it happens, our SSRs have last time to look for revenue opportunities. Because the customers are closed, there's less customer traffic to use our restroom products, for example. It certainly did have an impact on the quarter.Okay. Great. Then I wanted to understand all other a little bit better. It sounds like fire was really strong with 11% organic growth. So, I'm guessing that means that direct sales were sort of weaker. Was it fire that drove the strong margins in that segment? I know that they jump around, but given last quarter was a little bit on the weaker side, was this sort of a catch-up or was this the mix shift? I just want to understand all other margin a little bit better.Toni, it's Paul. You're right. Fire had a very strong quarter organically. So, then the corollary is that uniform direct sale did not perform as well. You know that direct sale business, it's non-recurring revenue. So, it's a little harder to forecast. It's lumpier. It depends on rollouts. It's tougher to forecast and the sales cycle is longer as well.UDS, the uniform direct sale business did come in lighter than we expected. Of course, that suppressed margins as well. The fire business overall still continues to perform very well, high-single-digit organic growth is the expectations. Those margins will continue to improve as the organic growth continues to pick up.Thank you.Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays Capital.Good evening, guys. I just wanted to see if I reconciled this right. you said the impact in the quarter from both weather and the two less days was $10 million, but then for 2020, one less work day impacts you $26 million for the full year. So, is it just because it was in the holiday period maybe and it was less of an impact?Manav, when we have customers close, our goal is to reschedule the visit to them. It's not like we completely lose one full day of revenue. We will still get the rental revenue. We just have to reschedule the stop so that we can pick up, for example, dirty uniforms dropped off clean. We will still generate revenue because of that. But when we are doing that, it's the things like continuing to look for the penetration opportunities that suffer a bit. It's the new business that suffers a little bit.We don't lose all of the days revenue because we have to still visit and serve the customer. It's just that the penetration opportunities and the new business productivity was challenged a bit. Despite all of that, a 6.2% organic growth rate is still a pretty good performance by our rental business despite the challenges we have.You're right, though. As we think about 2020, that's a full day that we lose and don't get back in terms of the revenue within that fiscal year. That $26 million that Paul referenced, that's just an example of if you take our total revenue divided by the number of work days this past quarter, that's effectively the impact that it would have next year.Okay. Got it. Then maybe just the latest on the G&K integration -- what are the next milestones we should be looking to hear from you guys?Manav, the integration continues to progress very nicely. It doesn't mean, though, that there's no heavy lifting going on in our operations still. That heavy lifting is typically now in the form of rerouting. We expect that to continue into fiscal '20. What we're really trying to do, Manav, is in certain markets, minimize the disruption, sync up the rerouting for the G&K acquisition with the SAP conversion.So, minimize disruption to the operation, to the customers, handle all that change management at one time. So, yeah, still some inefficiencies exist in those markets where they're going through that. As I mention, that will continue into '20, but the operations are doing a very nice job of taking care of the customer and I think the solid financial results are kind of a testament to that fact.Got it. Thanks.Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JP Morgan Securities.Hi, guys. You're going to hate this question but I'm going to try it. When you look at the legacy G&K portfolio of business, how fast do you think it's growing relative to the 6% organic overall and if you can talk about salesforce productivity, again, in that G&K legacy business, cross-selling, etc.So, you're right, Andrew, that's a really tough question. I would say that the growth isn't quite near the legacy Cintas levels yet. We are seeing some nice performance in things like our hygiene penetration. So, we really do like the direction, but I would say we're likely not where legacy Cintas locations are just yet. But it's really hard to tell because we have transferred so much volume from closed locations to Cintas locations. As we optimize routes, we are moving G&K volume into Cintas and Cintas into G&K. It's very muddy when you try to parse that out.As it relates to the sales rep productivity, we have one sales team. Let's make sure we're clear on that. The productivity is still very good. It's better than a year ago. It's not quite as high as it was in the second quarter because of some of the challenges that I mentioned a few minutes ago, but we're still very pleased with that performance.Any milestones ahead on cross-selling that you can talk about into that G&K legacy business?I would say because the business is so blended, Andrew, our goal is just continuing to manage the business location by location, but we'll be reporting on it in total because it's so difficult. We'll do our best to give some color like we have in the last couple quarters that we like the revenue performance in former G&K customers. There's going to be a little bit more anecdotal as we go forward because of the blending of that.But if you think about the impact that I mentioned in terms of the weather and holidays, that kind of turns a 6.2% into a 6.8%. That performance we really like and certainly, there is some help compared to where we were a year ago in terms of penetration at legacy G&K customers. Pretty hard to give a specific number, but we know there certainly are signs of success.Okay. Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.Hey, guys. Good afternoon. This is a question I think we all get all the time about the cross-sell. You've never really provided any disclosure of any metrics consistently that would help people think about it. I know you've historically said competitive reasons you didn't want to give too much, but have you thought about potentially at some point introducing some metrics to help us track the success that you're having, whether it's customer accounts that we could revenue per customer or any other metric? It seems to me it would be helpful to your investor base if you were to provide something.Well, I certainly can appreciate that, Gary. As you said, for competitive reasons, we don't like to give too much of that information. But I will tell you practically, if you think about what we've had going on over the last few years, we're talking about the largest integration that we've had in our rental business, the largest integration we've ever had in our first aid business and an SAP conversion -- there's a lot going on.To try to get the kind of data that we would be comfortable enough providing externally out of the three different systems we've been on, that would be very, very challenging. I understand your request and as we get fully on to SAP, we will certainly give that some hard fought, but gosh, we're in the midst of a lot of things going on that would make that kind of reporting pretty challenging.Fair point. I'll ask again once SAP is fully up and running. That's a good point.I'll expect that question in a couple years.Fair enough. A couple of other ones -- a quarter ago, you said fairly strongly that you were seeing no signs of economic weakness from the customer base in the US and Canada. Do you have the same level of conviction or does that same statement ring true today or has the trade impact or some of the other things that have been out there, have you noticed any other impact in the last three months that would change that kind of statement? Thanks.Gary, we still like the environment that we're operating in. Aside from the weather challenges, we like the environment and our customers seem to be very healthy. They're investing. There are lots of job openings. GDP is still at a level today and expected for the rest of the calendar year where we like to operate. We haven't seen a lot of change other than the weather disruption which was certainly real.Thank you. One last one -- the amount of SG&A leverage if we back out the one-time payment a year ago, it's still positive but narrow relatively to the last few quarters. I would guess the revenue impact this quarter was part of the reason, but is there anything from your perspective changing in the ability to deliver operating leverage in the near-term or was that -- anything else to explain that?The weather that we've talked about, the revenue challenge that we've talked about probably took 20 basis points of additional leverage in SG&A. So, we probably would have been 30 basis points better than last year in total. No. There are ups and downs. We're self-insured. We get some things that go up and down. We invest, for example, in our first aid and safety business where we've been growing so nicely. But there's nothing that I would look at as a challenge as we move forward to continue to see that number tweak down.Thanks a lot.Our next question comes from Justin Hawk with R.W. Baird.Two questions here, I guess -- one, the positive that we could take away from this is the margins were pretty good consideration the revenue shortfall. You called out some of the factors that are still out there, the inflation rate costs and whatnot, but I guess I was curious on the labor costs, specifically, if you could just comment on where that's trending, where net pricing is trending and how those have changed from three or six months ago.Labor pressures, I would say, are about the same as we've seen in the first two quarters of this fiscal year. I wouldn't call it any worse. But they still remain. And as we've talked about in the past, we work diligently to deal with those. First of all, we want to retain our partners. So, we do as much as we can to keep our partners engaged and satisfy it in terms of working with us. We want to pay them the right wages, for sure, so that we can, again, help keep them engaged.That partner retention, which remains high for us, is such an important part of managing our labor. But in addition to that, we look for opportunities for process improvement. We look for automation and other types of efficiencies and we've been doing a pretty good job of that so far, not to mention the fact that the synergies that we're getting off of the G&K integration certainly help and are timely. But they remain. Our goal is to continue to perform well despite them.As it relates to the pricing environment, we haven't seen a lot of change from quarter to quarter in that environment either. I don't look for that to change a whole lot as we move forward, at least in the next quarter or so.Okay. Great. Second one here, just maybe more numerical, but the G&K integration expense was pretty light. Your guidance, the $0.09 looks like it's probably going to say fairly light in the fourth quarter as well from the -- I think you were saying $18 million to $22 million was the total for the year. So, is it because you're just ahead of schedule and there's not more expense or are those moving into 2020? How should we think about the level of integration expense that remains?Yes, Justin. I mentioned earlier about the integration activities. It's largely rerouting and our supply chain is still hard at work realizing synergies as well. Rerouting does not really drive significant costs. The purpose of the rerouting is to get those routes more dense. That lowers energy costs, provides us with more time to spend with the customers. It's the smallest bucket of the synergies.The fact is that the larger expenses related to the integration came when the plant closings occurred -- closing the plants, decommissioning them, severing. We just don't have any of that left. So, we would expect another maybe $2 million to $3 million of integration expenses in the fourth quarter. So, we'll probably end the year at about $16 million in total.Then looking ahead to fiscal '20, it's going to be very small, a very nominal amount of integration expenses. But again, we're not finished with the integration activities. We're still rerouting. A lot of challenges out there for our operations, but it just doesn't drive the significant expenses that the other activities did.Just to be clear, there are still expenses and inefficiencies -- for example, duplicate routing, training, overtime, and temps, but the expenses Paul's talking about are those that are identifiable that can really called out into that integration line. The heavy lifting in the route optimization remains and the inefficiencies and the costs associated with it also remain, they're just really hard to call out.So, for example, when we're training SSRs on new routes, we've got a little bit of duplicate labor going on. When we're training and pulling them off of their routes, there's a little bit of inefficiency and duplicate labor. When we've got overtime, it's hard to tell how much of that is the day to day and how much of that is the true integration work. There are expenses and inefficiencies that remain. They're just much harder to call out specifically.That makes sense. That's helpful. Thank you very much.Our next question comes from Dan Dolev with Nomura Securities International.Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Appreciate it. Sorry to harp on this, but if I think about the organic growth, even ex the impact of weather, etc., it's about a 20-basis point acceleration. If I look back, your comp was getting about 80 basis points easier, if I'm not wrong. Is there anything to read into that? What is driving that? As far as I remember back in like 2017, you put out like 8% comp quarters. What are the odds of us getting back to those rates and what's driving the meager acceleration, ex weather? Thanks.Yeah. Dan, the 8% that you're referring to, they were strong and they were without any G&K in them. That was prior to G&K becoming inorganic. So, I had the question from Andrew a little bit ago about how much is the legacy G&K business growing. While it's very, very difficult to tell, it's also pretty clear that they are not growing quite at the legacy Cintas levels yet. We certainly believe that they can get there over time, but that doesn't happen overnight.As we look to the fourth quarter, the range of revenue that we've given is at 6% to 7%. We think it's a very healthy range. At the midpoint, there's some acceleration there. So, we're very, very pleased with the progress that we've made. We got a little bit of a hiccup with the weather and holiday challenges, customer closure challenges, but we're right where we wanted to be.Got it. Just overall?6% to 7% overall, yes.Got it. I was going to ask about the synergies in the quarter. I think last time, you had $25 million.Yeah. Dan, the synergies, we began the fiscal year and we guided to $90 million to $95 million in total for the year and we're on track to achieving that. We'll actually wind up a bit above the top end of that range. Then next fiscal year think about incremental synergies of maybe $30 million to $35 million. So, the bottom line is that we continue to track very nicely to what we committed to in the beginning, which was the $130 million to $140 million of synergies within those four years.Our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs.Good afternoon. You've previously indicated that ancillary products such as first aid and fire safety has less than 20% penetration among uniform rental customers. Can you help frame where that number can go as cross-selling increases, not only at G&K but also the broader Cintas customer base?We haven't really talked about that a lot publicly. The reason is that's a difficult thing to specifically target. We certainly think about that in the different verticals. Some verticals are better than others for that penetration. But George, we're really not really ready to give goals and targets.I would say this -- the stand-alone businesses are still growing very, very nicely. We think there's a lot of runway in just simply growing each business on their own. But there's no question there's more penetration opportunity available. I'm really hesitant to put us in a box and say there's a goal there just yet.Got it. Drilling down into the SAP integration, can you give us an update on how many branches have undergone a conversion and when you would expect to start seeing margin benefits?George, we are about 57% now through the conversion. That's about 202 operations that are now on SAP. This time last quarter, we were at 48% converted. So, a lot of good activity in this past quarter. As far as the margin benefits, we haven't quantified any of the benefits.We've talked about and given examples in terms of the power of the system, what it can do for our route people with a satellite-based type of handheld device, the efficiencies that that brings, opportunities in our stock rooms with managing inventory and sharing it and having visibility, but then there's also a lot of benefits in terms of opportunities to cross-sell and look into the system of first aid and safety, to better understand national accounts and a lot of opportunities around big data and being able to do profitability analysis, price reviews, and that type of stuff.We'll have more commentary on that as we continue to get through the roll out. A lot of those benefits for the system, especially as they relate to the topline and some profitability improvements, you need the entire network to be in and we're just over half of the way. So, nothing we can quantify at this point in time in terms of the benefits.Thank you. Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie Capital.Hey, guys. This is actually Mario Cortellacci filling in for Hamzah. Could you give us any color on your net add stops during the quarter. I'm curious how relevant that metric is today compared to history because I guess the portfolio has changed with time. I wanted to see if that's actually relevant anymore.Yeah. The add stops metric is a real -- we consider it a very old legacy uniform rental-type of metric we used decades ago when we were predominately providing uniforms and entrance mats. It might be meaningful to some of our comp competitors. It's not as meaningful to us because we have such a huge breadth of products and services that we have more to offer the customers than just uniforms and mats.We are not also dependent upon the customer base just adding jobs and going along with GDP and being propelled or held back by employment. You look back at our results and we have grown consistently in multiples of excess of GDP and jobs. So, the add stops metrics, which is more about same-store sales, how is that particular customer growing, are they adding or subtracting. It's not as meaningful for us. We're trying to drive the growth through penetration and through attacking new verticals like scrub rental with new products and services.So, long-winded answer to say it's not meaningful to us. There wasn't anything significant to note in add stops. I would say that to Mike's point earlier, we rely on penetration of our existing customers and it was clear in looking at our operational data that the weather and holidays did impact our ability to penetrate and that's part of that 60-basis point headwind that we had this quarter.Got it. One more and I'll turn it over. Given the portfolio changes since the last major slowdown, could you give us a sense of how Cintas might perform in a decelerating macro environment? I'm sure a piece of your business could be considered late cycle. I assume that first aid would be a little more resilient. Obviously, a piece of the business is still levered to the employment cycle. What would that look like if there was a slowdown?Mario, I typically answer those questions starting out with it depends on how deep and how broad that next slowdown would be. We have a very diverse customer base. We've got customers of all types in all types of verticals, customers of all sizes. So, we've got a very diverse customer base and that helps us when things like a few years ago, the oil and gas customers really were suffering with low  helped us a few years ago when there were some measurements of an industrial recession and we still grew those kinds of things.But it really depends on how deep and how broad. If we can hit our revenue guidance and our EPS guidance, it will be 48 out of the last 50 years where we have grown sales and grown profits, and that would be growing through 6 out of the last 7 recessions. So, how do we stand in the next one? It depends on how deep and how broad.We have done some things since the great recession that we think are beneficial to our performance through the next slowdown and that would be a broader product line so that we have more things to offer to our prospects our existing customers. We have a sales team that is a little bit more sophisticated than it was prior to the great recession where we specifically attacked certain verticals and we sell to existing customers a little bit more proactively. So, we look to drive more revenue that way.And we have probably even more diverse customers today and we have prior to the last recession, where we've really targeted things like healthcare and education, which are a little bit more recession resistant. So, we've made some changes since the great recession, but we've also performed very well over the last 50 years in all kinds of economic cycles, but I would always go back to, it depends on how deep and how broad.Got it. Thank you so much.Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.Good evening, guys. You just gave synergy guidance for next year on an earlier question. I found it interesting because it sounds like you're trending really well on the 90 to 95. Then the incremental guide, 30 to 35, the high end of that gets you to the 130, the low end of the total. I'm just curious, might you finish a year earlier than anticipated or might there be incremental upside that we see in this? If so, where are the areas, sourcing, routing you touched on a little bit, but where are the areas that you're progressing ahead of that are worth addressing at this juncture? Thanks.Great question, Scott. I would say this -- we have some sourcing synergies that we are still working on. As we've talked about, they come a little longer because we had to burn through G&K inventory and then we have to source from either our new supply chains or put the volume, the greater volume into our existing supply chains. We have to get then get the inventory to our locations and put it in service where it begins to amortize. There will be synergies in our fiscal '21 that still are from that global supply chain effort. It's hard to pull those forward.So, getting back to your question, I think there may be a little bit of upside and I think that upside you may have heard me say a few times in the past, I think the biggest bucket for the upside is that sourcing and supply chain, where we kind of built that opportunity off of the G&K inventory and supply chain and the opportunity, the upside opportunity might be does that impact the Cintas sourcing and supply chain? In other words, does the combined volume then help even the Cintas pricing to drive lower as well.I'm not ready to give any kind of numbers, but I think that's where the opportunity lies. And as you suggested, we expect to be at the low end of that range next fiscal year and driving toward the high end and possibly through the high end in fiscal '21.Thanks. That's good progress. More a housekeeping question for my follow-up -- tax rate has been jumping around. Just for our benefit and modeling, how would you think about it for the annual and quarterly as we model out ahead just some rules of thumb because I think without a little guidance, that can be all over the place.Yeah. You're right about that, Scott. With the change in the stock compensation a few years ago, this tax rate has really been bouncing around because we can't control the exercises of options and we can't control the stock price. We talked a little bit about a 24.5% in the fourth quarter. That is our expectation there. As we look to finish this year, if we do that 24.5% in the fourth quarter, that would put us at a 20.6% for the full fiscal '19 year, that's lower than we would expect our typical run rate to be. With our stock performance, we had a tremendous amount of exercises this year and it's hard to say that those are going to repeat next year.So, I would expect that our tax rate would be right in the range of 22% next year with a fairly low tax rate in the first quarter because we generally get more stock comp benefit followed by a higher rate in Q's two through four. I would suggest maybe using fiscal '19's quarterly rates that we talked about as maybe a bit of a guide for the rate to get you there.I would say for the full year, a 22% type of a number would be right where -- I would say that's currently our expectation. Obviously, then, if we are at a 22% next year and a 20.6% this year, that puts a little bit of pressure on us with that increase.Thanks, I appreciate that incremental color.Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair.Good afternoon, guys. I'll talk about the balance sheet. Two times leverage, it seems like a good point to check in your capital allocation priorities. How should we think about capital deployment after capex between the dividend, share repurchase, and M&A?Our cash flow remains healthy. It was very good in the third quarter and we expect it to continue to perform well into the future. That creates opportunities, obviously. We want to continue to invest in the business. We will do that by growing the business via things like adding routes, adding sales people, and doing advertising and R&D. Those things will run through the P&L just like they have, but those are very important pieces for us.Our capex I would expect to continue kind of in that 4% to 4.5% range and that's very important to us. We want to make sure we are creating the capacity for growth. Those are our two highest priorities. Aside from that, we certainly love the tuck-in acquisitions and we'll continue to look for opportunities there as best we can in our rental, first aid, and fire businesses.We will also look if there are larger opportunities, particularly in our existing businesses, we would love to take a look at those. We'll be as aggressive as we can be on looking for great value out of small and larger types of acquisitions, particularly within our businesses.That's going to leave us, though, with some cash. So, we certainly love to increase the dividend. We've done so every year since 1983. I would expect the board will continue to look very strongly at that. And then there may be buyback opportunity.As we've shown so far this fiscal year, where we've acquired almost $550 million through our first three quarters, we like that program, we like the momentum of the business, and I would expect that we'll continue to look at that opportunistically. In addition to all of that, our EBITDA continues to grow and we like that two times leverage neighborhood. We are there right now. Our expectation is we'll continue to be in that range.Thanks, Mike. On the M&A front, are there still areas in the US where you feel there may be more room to grow through M&A in your rental business? Also, what's your position with respect to expanding internationally? Thanks for your time.From a US perspective, it's more about the opportunity than it is the geography. We are in almost all geographies in the US and Canada, but there are still 600 or so independent operators out there and so, the opportunity really is more about the location of those independent operators and having a dialogue with them and understanding if we can team up and create long-term value together. We'll continue to look for those opportunities no matter the geography in the US and Canada.From an international perspective, I would say this -- we love the US and Canadian opportunities. We think there are a lot there. We will continue to invest heavily in those businesses. I think there may be a time in our future where we get into other international geographies. It's not our highest priority, but I think that's something that we'll keep our eyes on. I would say that in our business, start-ups are pretty difficult and so, it would likely be through some sort of M&A, but it would have to be with the right partner in the right geography and one in which we felt like we could operate successfully.Our next question comes from Seth Webber with RBC Capital Markets.Good afternoon. Thanks for keeping the call going here. Going back to the capex commentary for a second, I think earlier this year, you had brought the capex number down a little bit because you had messaged you were able to extract some benefits from the G&K business. So, how should we be thinking about capex going forward? Is it brick and mortar? Do you feel like you need more capacity here? Is there anything you can point to that you'll be spending money on specifically?You're absolutely right, Seth. We did get some benefit from the G&K acquisition in terms of capacity and it allowed us to delay certainly some capex related to new capacity, both in plants and in our routes, but we're continuing to grow and continuing to grow well. Capacity is really a local thing. So, there are certainly still geographies where there may not have been a G&K presence, where we're growing well, where we need capacity.We'll continue to look for or we will have capex related to laundry capacity and routing capacity, I would say, from a growth perspective, most of our capex growth will be in that form, laundry facility capacity and routes, i.e. trucks. Same goes for our first aid and hire businesses as well. We are growing very nicely and the growth will come primarily in the way of additional trucks. We'll certainly have some maintenance capex too. From a growth perspective, yes, bricks and mortar and trucks.Thank you. We have no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference to Mr. Mike Hansen for any closing remarks.Thank you again for joining us tonight. We will issue our fourth quarter financial results in July and look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Thank you.Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

"The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Facebook (FB), American Tower (AMT) and Southern Company (SO). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see Buy-ranked  's shares have gained +27.7% year to date, outperforming the S&P 500's increase of +12.6% during the same period. The Zacks analyst thinks Facebook will benefit from mobile ad revenues driven by robust performance of Instagram Stories and an expanding user base in 2019.Further, the company's plan to introduce commerce in Instagram is estimated to be a major growth driver. The growing appeal of the company's Workplace platform, which has now more than two million paid users, is another key catalyst.Additionally, its plan to integrate messaging apps - WhatsApp, Instagram, and Messenger - will boost user experience by making the services more secure through end-to-end encryption. The company's initiatives to curb the ""fake news"" menace and data breaches are other positives. However, continued mix shift toward Stories is expected to hurt ARPU. Increasing regulatory headwinds is also a concern.(You can  ).Shares of  have outperformed the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust industry in the past three months (+23.2% vs. +16.3%). In fourth-quarter 2018, the company posted better-than-expected results backed by revenue growth. The Zacks analyst thinks increased use of mobile data is fueling demand for space on the company's telecom towers.This enabled American Tower to experience splendid leasing activity and organic tenant billings growth in the recently-reported quarter. With higher investments in 4G and the upcoming 5G technology, wireless carriers will raise the density of their networks. Hence, the company is strengthening its portfolio and focusing on innovation to capture underlying opportunities.Further, efforts to increase shareholder value through dividend hike and stock repurchases bode well. Yet, it has a substantially leveraged balance sheet. Also, the accelerated Indian carrier consolidation-driven churn and high customer concentration remain risks.(You can  ).Buy-ranked  's shares have outperformed the Zacks Electric Power industry over the past six months, gaining +19.7% vs +13.2%. Following the U.S. federal government's approval of $3.7 billion in loan guarantees for the Vogtle nuclear plant in Georgia, Southern Company retains its Buy rating.The Zacks analyst thinks that it will provide substantial support and encouragement in the completion of the troubled nuclear project and will also help to reduce financing costs. Southern Company is one of the largest and best-managed electric utilities in the U.S., dominating the power business across the southeastern region.With good rate base growth and constructive regulation, it is expected to generate steady earnings and dividend growth in the coming years through long-term power contracts. Additionally, the utility's $12 billion AGL buy has significantly increased its customer base and diversified its offerings. Sporting a low beta - translating into less volatility - and a reasonable valuation, Southern Company is seen as an attractive investment.(You can  ).Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Intuitive Discover Financial (DFS), Synchrony Financial (SYF) and Cintas (CTAS).Would you like to see the updated picks from our best market-beating strategies? From 2017 through 2018, while the S&P 500 gained +15.8%, five of our screens returned +38.0%, +61.3%, +61.6%, +68.1%, and +98.3%.This outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. From 2000 - 2018, while the S&P averaged +4.8% per year, our top strategies averaged up to +56.2% per year.Mark VickerySenior EditorPer the Zacks analyst, its strategic initiatives like the buyouts of Loop Commerce and PayPal Credit financing program has led to significant growth. However, escalating expenses remain a concern.Per the Zacks analyst, impressive traction of Cintas' Uniform Rental & Facility Services segment, fueled by increasing penetration levels at existing customers should continue to drive its revenues.Per the Zacks analyst, with rising demand for crossover & SUVs, Magna is focusing more on innovation & new launches. But high tariffs on steel and aluminum are hitting its profitability.The Zacks analyst appreciates passenger revenue growth at LATAM Airlines. The company's efforts to check costs are encouraging too.Per the Zacks analyst, Embraer continues to witness rising demand for its E-jets worldwide.Per the Zacks analyst, Intercept's lead drug, Ocaliva has gained traction following management's efforts to increase awareness about the label update.Per the Zacks analyst, Neogen's Food Safety arm is gaining from solid demand for the foodborne pathogen detection test like Listeria.Per the Zacks analyst, its growing revenues driven by higher net interest income and other total income along with soaring card sales volume has led to significant growth.Per the Zacks analyst, Smucker's top line is likely to continue benefitting from acquisition gains. Evidently, the Ainsworth buyout contributed $199.2 million to net sales during the third quarter.The Zacks analyst stresses that United Rentals' systematic inorganic strategy will expand its core equipment rental business and trench, power and pump footprint and tool offerings.The Zacks analyst believes that weak landfill pricing due to high cost of landfills and leachate can limit Republic Services' ability to increase prices, thereby weighing on its margins and earnings.According to the Zacks analyst, Eastman Chemical faces headwinds from raw material cost inflation. Also, weak demand for its specialty products in China remains a concern.Per the Zacks analyst, Ligand's dependence on a single supplier for its major revenue generating technology, Captisol, is a concern as any supply interruption will adversely effect Ligand's results.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

intas (CTAS) could be a solid addition to your portfolio given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates, which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.The Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. In these situations, the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements.Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Cintas basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.For Cintas, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power o  estimate revisions.The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see  .For the fiscal year ending May 2019, this uniform rental company is expected to earn $7.42 per share, which is a change of 24.9% from the year-ago reported number.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Cintas. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 0.2%.Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn The upgrade of Cintas to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

There are 7 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Cintas Corporation, but the average is just that — a mathematical average.  There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $184.00.  And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $235.00.  The standard deviation is $18.67.


But the whole reason to look at the average CTAS price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes.  And so with CTAS crossing above that average target price of $218.71/share, investors in CTAS have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $218.71 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?  Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Cintas Corporation:



The average rating presented in the last row of the above table above is from 1 to 5 where 1 is Strong Buy and 5 is Strong Sell.  This article used .  .

 is slated to report third-quarter fiscal 2019 (ended February 2019) results on Mar 21, after market closes.The company pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 6.81% in the preceding four quarters. In the fiscal second quarter, Cintas generated adjusted earnings of $1.76 per share that surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.72 by 2.33%.Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Cintas'top line is gaining momentum on the back of consistent performance in the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment. Notably, the company's focus on enhancing its product portfolio and improving customer relationships will bolster organic revenue growth in the upcoming quarters. In addition, strength in the National Account, Fire and Uniform Direct Sale businesses is likely to support the uptick.Also, effective implementation of enterprise resource planning system and integration of G&K Services assets bode well. Notably, the company's recent business acquisitions have strengthened its product portfolio and processing capacity as well as improvised customer service. As a matter of fact, these benefits are likely to get reflected in the company's upcoming quarterly releases. In addition, the company believes that lower commission expenses (on account of Accounting Standard Update 2014-09 adoption) and corporate tax expenses will continue to strengthen profitability.Amid this backdrop, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal third-quarter revenues in the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment is currently pegged at $1,371 million, reflecting growth of 6.7% year over year. In addition, revenues in the First Aid and Safety Services segment are anticipated to be strong, with estimates pegged at $150 million. This indicates a rise from revenues of $137 million in the year-ago quarter.However, rising cost of sales and expenses are major cause of concerns for Cintas. Notably, in second-quarter fiscal 2019, its total cost of sales grew 6% year over year. The company continues to experience cost pressure in certain areas that include rising wages and costs related to hangers. Moreover, costs associated with the G&K Services buyout integration (estimated to be approximately $18-$22 million for fiscal 2019) along with the same incurred for implementation of enterprise resource planning system will continue to hurt margins.In addition, the company's first-aid and fire protection services are decidedly commoditized markets and are subject to fierce competition. The company is required to consistently invest in value drivers to fend off competition, which weakens profitability.Our proven model provides some idea on the stocks that are about to release earnings results. Per the model, a stock needs to have a combination of a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to beat estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  .The case with Cintas is given below: : Cintas has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.73. |  Cintas carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, its 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to beat estimates:Parker-Hannifin Corporation (PH) has an Earnings ESP of +1.03% and a Zacks Rank of 3. You can see Emerson Electric Co. (EMR) is a Zacks Rank #3 stock and has an Earnings ESP of +0.66%.Eaton Corporation, plc (ETN) carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of +0.88%.In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-holds for the year?Who wouldn't?

"he U.S. economy has been strong for a very long time, and in particular, numbers related to the labor force haven't looked this good in decades. That's been good news for  (NASDAQ: CTAS) , because key businesses like providing facilities-related services to corporate clients and offering rented uniforms to their employees tend to be linked closely to the employment picture across the nation. Despite pressures from deteriorating global macroeconomic conditions, the state of things closer to home has been more favorable and has  .Coming into Thursday's fiscal third-quarter financial report, Cintas shareholders were hoping that the company would be able to keep delivering a positive picture on both its past performance and its prospects ahead.  , but its numbers were extremely encouraging for those seeking growth in the coming year and beyond.Image source: Cintas.Cintas' fiscal third-quarter results were solid, although they didn't live up to everything that those watching the company had wanted. Revenue of $1.68 billion was up nearly 6% from year-ago levels, but it lagged slightly behind the $1.69 billion consensus forecast among investors. On the bottom line, though, Cintas looked much stronger. Net income of $203.3 million was down a third due to the positive tax reform-related impact in the third quarter of the previous fiscal year, but after accounting for that and other extraordinary items, adjusted earnings of $1.84 per share were up almost 35% from last year's period and topped the $1.71 per share that investors had expected to see.Cintas continued to see good performance throughout its operations. Organic growth across the business came in at 6%, with a 6.2% growth rate for the key uniform rental and facility services business. Cintas got even better results from its first aid and safety services division, where organic sales were higher by 8.6%.Trying to maximize efficiency paid off once again for Cintas. The company reported gross margin that climbed almost a full percentage point to 44.9% during the period, with gains from both of its segments contributing to the overall rise. Despite expenses related to integrating recent mergers, Cintas managed to boost operating margin by nearly 4 percentage points during the quarter, and even though much of that was related to a one-time payment of bonuses to Cintas employees last year, a full percentage point came from internal efforts.CEO Scott Farmer explained the cause of the slight sales shortfall. ""Customer closures caused by the severe weather and the holiday calendar during the quarter created challenges within our route schedules,"" Farmer said, yet ""despite these challenges, we still delivered solid organic growth for the quarter."" The CEO also noted that ongoing efforts to get its operations unified under enterprise resource planning have kept moving forward and are delivering results.Cintas also believes that its stock is a good bargain right now. Farmer noted that in addition to boosting its annual dividend by almost 27% from the previous year's payout, Cintas also spent $100 million to buy back its stock during the fiscal third quarter. That brought the total spent so far this fiscal year to almost $547 million, leaving $863 million available for future repurchases.Cintas updated its guidance, with moves in both directions for key metrics. The company guided toward the lower end of its previous revenue projections, setting a range of $6.87 billion to $6.885 billion that reduced the top number by $25 million. However, earnings guidance was higher, with adjusted earnings from continuing operations coming in between $7.42 and $7.48 per share. That's $0.10 to $0.12 per share higher than what Cintas predicted three months ago for the full year.Cintas investors seemed to focus on the sales numbers, and the stock dropped between 1% and 2% in  Friday following the Thursday afternoon announcement. Yet with plenty of enthusiasm for the future and strong economic tailwinds helping its businesses, Cintas has the potential to bounce back from minor setbacks and stoke  .When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Cintas wasn't one of them!

Chicago, IL - March 15, 2019 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Oracle  , U.S. Bancorp  , Enterprise Products  , Intuitive Sherwin-Williams  and Cintas  .The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Oracle, U.S. Bancorp and Enterprise Products. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see  's shares have underperformed the Zacks Computer Software industry in the past year, gaining +1.3% vs. +17.3%. Oracle is one of the largest enterprise-grade database, middleware and application software providers. The Zacks analyst thinks the company is benefiting from strong adoption of its cloud-based solutions, comprising Fusion ERP and Fusion HCM, among others. Partnerships with the likes of Accenture are helping the company rapidly expand its cloud-base clientele.Also, anticipated strong demand for the next-generation autonomous database supported by machine learning will boost competitive position against Amazon Web Services (AWS). Nonetheless, stiff competition in the cloud market from dominant players is anticipated to limit margin expansion.Lower hardware volumes are anticipated to hurt top-line growth, consequently keeping margins under pressure. Additionally, integration risks from buyouts remain a concern.Shares of  have outperformed the Zacks Major Banks industry over the past six months, losing -4.7% vs -6.7%. The company possesses an impressive earnings surprise history, beating expectations in all the trailing four quarters.The Zacks analyst thinks U.S. Bancorp's prospects will likely get support from its solid business model, core franchise, lower tax rate, rising interest rate and diverse revenue streams. Also, its organic growth remains solid and will likely benefit from the improving economic scenario.U.S. Bancorp remains well poised to grow through acquisitions. However, escalating expenses due to its ongoing investments in technology and likely increase in legal expenses remain concerns. ' shares have gained +13.6% over the past three months, outperforming the Zacks Oil Production Pipeline MLP industry advanced by +11.9%. Enterprise Products Partners boasts of an extensive network of pipeline that spreads across nearly 50,000 miles.Importantly, the pipeline network is connected to every major U.S. shale play and provides services to producers and users of commodities by transporting gas, liquids and refined products. The Zacks analyst thinks Enterprise's $5.1-billion pipeline of fee-oriented midstream projects will enable it to enjoy above-average growth in distributable cash flow (DCF) over the next two years, expanding its distribution coverage ratio.However, turnaround-related costs from Seminole fractionators hurt Enterprise's fractionation business. Also, the persistent rise in operating expenses has been affecting the partnership's bottom line. Enterprise's balance sheet is more levered than the industry it belongs to. Therefore, the stock warrants a cautious stance.Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Intuitive Sherwin-Williams and Cintas.Would you like to see the updated picks from our best market-beating strategies?

"nvestors in Cintas Corporation (Symbol: CTAS) saw new options become available this week, for the April 18th expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CTAS options chain for the new April 18th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $190.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.90. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $190.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $188.10 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CTAS, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $204.67/share today.Because the $190.00 strike represents an approximate 7% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 84%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.00% return on the cash commitment, or 8.50% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Cintas Corporation, and highlighting in green where the $190.00 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $210.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.30. If an investor was to purchase shares of CTAS stock at the current price level of $204.67/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $210.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 4.71% if the stock gets called away at the April 18th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CTAS shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Cintas Corporation, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing CTAS's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $210.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $210.00 strike represents an approximate 3% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 60%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).

Shares of  (NASDAQ: CTAS) rose just over 10% in February, according to data provided by  . Add that to the gain in January, and Cintas was up around 24% in the first two months of 2019. That's a pretty impressive showing for any company, and marked a big turnaround from the last few months of 2018.The end of 2018 was filled with trepidation, pushing stocks lower across the board. Cintas was no exception, with its stock losing roughly 20% between early September and the end of last year. The big concern driving that drop was fear that the economy was on the brink of a downturn, pushed there by the  and contentious budget negotiations in Washington, among other things. A recession would be painful for Cintas, which provides uniforms to business customers, since a slowing economy would mean reduced demand and weaker financial results.Image source: Getty ImagesAs 2019 has progressed, however, there have been increasingly positive signs. The budget impasse has...passed. As February drew to a close, U.S. and Chinese trade negotiations appeared to have taken a positive turn. And the numbers on gross domestic product released at the end of the month showed that the U.S. economy expanded 2.9% in 2018. So the economy may not be as bad as was feared at the end of 2018. Investors have been getting more positive about Cintas' future with continuing evidence that the U.S. outlook remains solid.After a big rally in Cintas' shares so far in 2019, the company's stock isn't as great a deal as it was in late 2018. Although the P/E of around 25 is a little below the five-year average of about 26, the price-to-earnings-growth ratio (  ) of 2.1 is a little above its five-year average of 2. The forward-looking PEG ratio suggests that investors are paying at least full price for Cintas' expected earnings growth.Cintas is a well-run company, and paying a fair price isn't a bad thing. However, while economic conditions look to be solidifying, it is important to remember that the current expansion is one of the longest on record. Every expansion eventually ends. When that happens, Cintas' stock will probably go on sale again. Bargain-minded investors should probably keep Cintas on their wish lists for now.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

any investors know the value of investing in dividends, and finding a company that's consistently raising its payout can pay off even more. But there's something even more powerful at play when a business is able to raise its dividend for 25 consecutive years or more.Coupled with a solid business that points to their being able to raise their payout every year for years to come,  (NASDAQ: CTAS) ,  (NYSE: AOS) , and  (NYSE: BF-A) (NYSE: BF-B) are three Dividend Aristocrats that you can buy once for your portfolio and hold on to forever.Image source: Getty Images. Of all the businesses you might not expect to become Dividend Aristocrats, a used-rag-washing business started by a couple of out-of-work circus performers during the Great Depression is probably one of them. Yet Dividend Aristocrat Cintas hails from those humble beginnings.Cintas has lasted this long through its incredibly adaptable and flexible business model. When shop towels replaced rags in the 1940s, Cintas started to launder those. In response to demand for industrial laundering of uniforms, Cintas added that to its mix and then began renting uniforms -- now its primary business -- in the late 1950s. It continued to grow through making strategic acquisitions of competitors and by offering new services like floor-mat rental, restroom restocking, and first aid kit restocking, all of which the same driver could take care of on the same route.Cintas' adaptability is still on display as it continues to grow. The company posted 7% revenue and organic sales growth  , while earnings increased an impressive 30%. The North American uniform rental market remains fairly fragmented, but Cintas is the largest player in the space, with plenty of opportunity to gobble up smaller competitors.The one drawback might be that, for a Dividend Aristocrat, Cintas has a fairly low yield at just 1%. But considering that's thanks to all the growing the share price has been doing, it shouldn't bother you. I don't know if Cintas will be around forever, but it should continue to grow and adapt to a changing market for years to come, and also reward shareholders in the process. A hundred years ago, A.O. Smith made bomb casings and bolt-on bicycle engines. Now the company is the largest maker of water heaters in North America. Water treatment success in places like China, India, and the Netherlands shows that the company isn't afraid to evolve again if the market conditions so require.To be clear, A.O. Smith has no plans to abandon the water heater niche that has been its bread and butter for eight decades. But a flexible approach to new opportunities is the most effective way to stay relevant for another century.Holding this stock for a long time has been a winning strategy over the past few decades. If you had invested $1,000 in A.O. Smith's stock in 1989, your holdings would be worth more than $5 million today. That's a plain share-price boost, not including any contributions from  along the way.The company has lifted its quarterly payouts 1,900% over the same period.  along the way would have turned that measly $1,000 into nearly $10 million at this point. To put these potential gains into perspective, an S&P 500 index fund would have grown a $1,000 investment into $830,000 without dividend reinvestments, or $1.3 million with a DRIP plan over 30 years. Not bad, but the long-term A.O. Smith investor would have crushed the market.Don't forget that A.O. Smith was a mature business with decades of large-scale operating history at the start of this long-term thought experiment. Asking for another 12,000% return over the next 30 years might be a bit much, but this is most definitely a high-quality dividend stock for the long haul. Distiller Brown-Forman has been caught up in the international trade war that saw retaliatory tariffs imposed on whiskey imports into Europe, Canada, and China. Because more than half of its sales come from international markets, profit margins have been pinched as the distiller absorbed many of the higher costs associated with the duties, but it has said it can't do that indefinitely, which means it will need to raise prices and possibly hurt sales. It also faces competitive pressures here at home, as rivals reduce prices to gain share because of whiskey's continued popularity. Brown-Forman's stock has slid 30% over the past year as a result.Despite pressures in multiple markets, Brown-Forman's Jack Daniel's brand remains a top seller globally, and the trend toward premium and super-premium spirits means the distiller's Woodford Reserve and Old Forrester brands have been in high demand, blunting some of the impact. Because  isn't abating any time soon, Brown-Forman will continue to be a leader in the space.Brown-Forman has paid cash dividends for 73 consecutive years and has raised its payout annually for 35 straight years. Not even the current global economic situation threatens the dividend.Shares have bounced more than 10% off the low point they hit in January as concerns about a new round of tariffs have eased up. While the trade war dominates its discussions at the moment, the long-term trend is in Brown-Forman's favor, and with the stock having been beaten back, now is the time to consider this Dividend Aristocrat for your portfolio.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

In addition, it will enable more advanced capabilities like the construction of Health System Digital Twins.Emerson is well positioned to benefit from favorable global industrial end markets, as its core businesses hold dominant positions in markets tied to energy efficiency and infrastructure spending. Going forward, continued robust demand in residential air conditioning and professional tools markets are likely continue driving the company's Commercial & Residential Solutions business revenues.Also, Emerson believes that broad-based demand across most key markets, strong Maintenance, Repair and Operations projects as well as ongoing small to mid-sized brownfield and expansion projects will bolster revenues of its Automation Solutions segment.

In the first-quarter fiscal 2019 (ended December 2018), unfavorable mix and material inflation hurt margins of the company's Commercial & Residential Solutions segment by around 50 basis points.

 has impressed investors with its recen  streak, having surpassed estimates thrice in the four trailing quarters. The company's share price increase reflects its impressive performance, exhibiting investor optimism over the stock. In the past three months, the stock has gained 2.7%, outperforming the  's growth of 0.7%.We believe that the company's notable traction across markets will drive growth in the upcoming quarters.Stanley Black & Decker is well poised to gain from strengthening foothold in emerging markets, efforts to innovate new products as well as growing recognition for Craftsman, Lenox, Irwin and DeWalt FlexVolt products. Notably, for 2019, the company anticipates generating organic sales growth of about 4%. Supported by healthy sales growth, cost-saving actions and lower share count, adjusted earnings are predicted to be $8.45-$8.65 per share. This bottom-line projection reflects year-over-year growth of 4-6%.We are highly optimistic about Stanley Black & Decker's market expansion strategies, which are expected to act as key growth drivers. In this regard, in March 2017, brands like Lenox and Irwin were acquired as part of Newell Tools, while Craftsman branded products were also added to the company's portfolio. Newell Tools has been strengthening the company's tools business through deeper penetration into markets worldwide and the addition of two prime tool brands. In the years ahead, the company anticipates revenue synergies of $100-$150 million from Irwin and Lenox products. In addition, Stanley Black & Decker anticipates generating $1 billion in sales from Craftsman products by 2021.Over the years, the company has consistently returned significant cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Notably, in 2018, it repurchased common stock worth $527.1 million and paid cash dividends of about $384.9 million. Further, Stanley Black & Deckerincreased its quarterly dividend rate by 4.8% in July 2018.However, the company is currently dealing with adverse impacts of rising cost of sales. In the fourth quarter of 2018, its cost of sales increased 9.4% year over year primarily due to commodity inflation, unfavorable impacts of foreign currency movements and tariffs. If unchecked, rising costs and expenses can hurt its margins in the quarters ahead.In addition, for 2019, the company predicts that adverse impacts of tariffs, foreign currency woes and commodity inflation will affect earnings by 90 cents to $1.00 per share.Stanley Black & Decker currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks from Zacks  sector are Axon Enterprise, Inc  , Cintas Corporation  and Sandvik AB  . While Axon Enterprise sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Cintas and Sandvik carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see  .Axon Enterpriseexceeded estimates in each of the preceding four quarters, the average positive earnings surprise being 391.67%.Cintas surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average positive earnings surprise being 6.81%.Sandvik's earnings surprise in the las  ed quarter was 3.57%.It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

"ant to buy stocks like a master investor? Well, Peter Lynch -- one of the  of all time -- recommended buying companies that did boring things. He theorized that most stock pickers would naturally gravitate toward more exciting stocks, allowing savvy investors to find no-brainer bargains among the dull and unexciting.And what's more dull and unexciting than doing chores? Business services stocks are basically the chore-doers of the economy: Their clients outsource boring work to them. Still, while these jobs may be boring -- or even a little bit disgusting -- somebody has to do them. And services stocks  (NASDAQ: CTAS) ,  (NYSE: WM) , and  (NYSE: DAR) provide essential services that can pay off for investors. Here's why buying these stocks looks like a no-brainer.Image source: Getty Images.Washing clothes may be the quintessential chore, whether you have a machine in your home or have to lug your baskets to the local laundromat. But many businesses don't want to maintain a machine or devote staff time to laundry, and that's where uniform renter Cintas comes in.Cintas rents all kinds of uniforms to businesses as diverse as casinos, garages, and delivery companies. Cintas sends a truck around regularly to pick up the dirty uniforms and drop off clean ones. Cintas has also realized that it can use that regular visit to offer other services like restroom restocking, floor mat cleaning, and first aid kit replenishing for hardly any additional overhead.Adding those additional services and gobbling up smaller competitors in the fractured uniform rental market has propelled Cintas to huge growth over the last five years, with revenue up more than 50% and net income increasing an astonishing 183.3%. In spite of that, the stock's P/E ratio is still sitting around 24, about the midpoint of where it's been the past few years.Although Cintas -- like all business services specialists -- is considered to be a cyclical company, it recently  for 2019, suggesting that it doesn't see any major headwinds on the horizon. Cintas seems like a good bet to continue to outperform.Businesses -- and people -- make a lot of trash, and it all has to go someplace. Not only that, somebody has to take it there. That somebody often ends up being Waste Management, the largest trash hauler and landfill operator in North America.As the population increases, so does the amount of trash it generates. And since Waste Management also handles recycling, diverting more products from the garbage can to the recycle bin doesn't have much of effect on the company's bottom line.Like Cintas, Waste Management has seen massive growth in net income over the last five years: 1,120% growth on just a 6% increase in revenue! But that's largely due to a big slump in net income that hit the company in early 2014. Over the last three years, net income has gone up a more modest 68.9% -- still impressive for such a large company.Waste Management doesn't see things slowing down anytime soon. On  , CEO Jim Fish opened by telling investors, ""At this time last year, I was telling you that 2017 was arguably the best year we've seen. I'm pleased to report that 2018 results were even better.""  grew by more than 5% year over year, and Fish projected similar growth in 2019. About the only downside is that the company's rapid share price growth has pushed its dividend yield to its lowest point in more than a decade -- about 1.9%. But that's a small price to pay to buy into this amazing growth story. data by  .While Cintas and Waste Management have seen incredible growth over the past five years, Darling Ingredients hasn't kept pace. Darling is a fat renderer and animal products recycler that takes various animal waste materials -- used restaurant frying oil and bakery scraps among them; I'll spare you the others -- and turns them into useful components of animal feed, soaps, and other products.So, yeah, it's a pretty disgusting business. Lynch would love it: He thought that the only thing better than a boring business was a gross one, to really turn off prospective investors. But recently, Darling has been exploring the use of its animal products in biofuels, through a joint venture with  called Diamond Green Diesel.This biodiesel business  for Darling -- so much so, in fact, that the company has been aggressively expanding its production capacity. In October 2018, Diamond Green Diesel successfully ramped up annual production to 275 million gallons, up from 160 million gallons in 2016. But the company isn't content to stop there: It's now planning an additional expansion that will have it producing 675 million gallons per year, with an anticipated completion date in 2021.In other words, in just five years, Darling will have increased its biofuels production capacity by more than 300%. Even better, the company plans to fund this new expansion with cash from Diamond Green Diesel's operations. And with Darling's shares currently trading at about 22 times earnings -- on the low end of the company's historic range -- this looks like an excellent time to buy.Nobody would call business services an exciting sector, but smart investors know that great stocks can be found anywhere.

And yet, this is the group of companies that grew on a very bad day when the S&P 500 dropped 0.94%, Dow 30 0.87%, Nasdaq 1.18% and Russell 2000 0.82%.With a year to date return of 11.3% and a 62% earnings beat ratio so far this quarter, the industrial products sector is a mixed bag.The Office Supplies industry within industrials has returned 16.8% YTD and posted an earnings beat ratio of 100% so far. Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) ranked Ennis  and Zacks #2 (Buy) ranked Avery Dennison Corp.  are investment opportunities here. EBF earnings are expected to grow 13.95% this year after the recent upward revision pos  . Both 2019 and 2020 estimates for AVY are up post earnings. Both companies have a VGM score B.The Uniform and Related segment within industrials has returned 11.6% YTD and posted mixed results so far. Zacks #2 ranked Cintas Corp.  is an opportunity here. The company is expected to post earnings growth of 12.3% this year on revenue that will grow 6.1%.The Containers - Paper and Packaging industry within industrials has returned 10.77% YTD and generated an earnings beat ratio of 75% so far. Zacks #2 ranked Sealed Air Corp.  jumped over 9% yesterday in response to a very strong earnings report. The company has a VGM score B.The Pollution Control industry within industrials has returned 9.6% YTD and posted an earnings beat ratio of 100% so far.

Zacks #2 ranked H&E Equipment Services, Inc.  is expected to generate revenue and earnings growth of 8.9% and 9.9%, respectively in 2019. The company, which has a VGM score B, will report at the end of the month.And that isn't all. If you're willing to take a little bit of risk, there's Zacks #1 ranked Alarm Holdings  and Axon Enterprise  in the Security & Services industry. Both stocks have been smashing estimates over the past year with average four-quarter beats of 27.3% for ALRM and 391.7% for AAXN. They are expected to report by month's end, so estimates may get revised around then. Both have a growth score A.We're likely not at the bottom of the selloff, so there will be a few days of uncertainty, especially considering the fact that the U.S. and China don't appear closer to a deal. And that's one thing that could be bad news for the sector. The other factor is positive, i.e. the Fed taking a moderate stand on interest rates. So the names with positive VGM scores would be safer.Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

Shares of uniform and safety-equipment supplier  (NASDAQ: CTAS) rose just under 12% in January, according to data provided by  . The broader market, as measured by the  index, was up roughly 8%. That contrasts notably with December, when the S&P fell 9% and Cintas was down 10%. But a big shift took place toward the end of last year, shortly after the company released fiscal second-quarter earnings. that fiscal second-quarter revenue was up 7% year over year. Overall organic sales growth came in at roughly the same figure, with organic growth in the core uniform segment actually increasing 1.7 percentage points between the first and second quarters. Earnings advanced just over 30%. Although that was helped along by the recent U.S. tax law changes, the positive underlying trends here are easy to see.Image source: Getty Images.Cintas also increased its revenue and earnings guidance for the full year, suggesting that it sees no reason to be worried about the current economic environment. That's a big issue for a  industrial company like Cintas, which is highly dependent on corporate spending. Concern about economic growth was one of the main reasons that investors pushed the stock market, and Cintas, lower in December.However, the mood on Wall Street started to shift in late December, and the more upbeat view of the future lasted throughout January; that underpinned the January advance of both the S&P 500 and Cintas. However, if you track from Dec. 20 through Jan. 31, Cintas' stock advanced nearly 18% while the market gained around 9%. Cintas' January outperformance alone doesn't fully capture how well the stock has done since i  ed earnings. Investors' moods have brightened, for sure, but Cintas has clearly benefited more from its own increasingly positive view of the future.Cintas stock had a great month in January; it was even better if you go back to its fiscal second-quarter earnings release on Dec. 20. The company's improved outlook for fiscal 2019 is a key factor, as investors were clearly pleased to hear that management didn't see any material economic headwinds on the horizon that might derail the company's growth. That said, Cintas is a cyclical industrial company, and the current U.S. expansion is getting a bit extended.

"omentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the  , helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at  , a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of A. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Cintas currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of In order to see if CTAS is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this uniform rental company holds up.Looking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.For CTAS, shares are up 0.04% over the past week while the Zacks Uniform and Related industry is down 1.32% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 13.77% compares favorably with the industry's 3.41% performance as well.While any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Over the past quarter, shares of Cintas have risen 3.51%, and are up 13.52% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved 0.2% and -2.48%, respectively.Investors should also pay attention to CTAS's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. CTAS is currently averaging 490,557 shares for the last 20 days.The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with CTAS.Over the past two months, 8 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost CTAS's consensus estimate, increasing from $7.24 to $7.35 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 7 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.Taking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that CTAS is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of A. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Cintas on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"Chicago, IL -January 18, 2019 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: McCormick & Company, Inc.  , Cintas Corp.  , Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.  and Ameren Corp.  .John C. Bogle, father of the index fund, passed away at the age of 89 on Jan 16. He was known for his low-cost, buy-and-hold investing strategy and founded the Vanguard Group, the mutual fund house mostly known for their low-cost funds that track a market index rather than trying to outdo it. He said that the main appeal of these funds is that these capture nearly all of a bourses' return ably and inexpensively.Bogle always said ""Why can't managers beat the market? Where's the value added? In terms of industrywide statistics, it's just not there. One reason is because of cost. The cost is a handicap on the horse. If the jockey carries a lot of extra pounds, it's very tough for the horse to win the race.""Vanguard was formed in 1974 and began functioning the next year. Investors have put in nearly $5.3 trillion into Vanguard funds, according to the company. Most of the Vanguard funds are managed outside. Unlike other fund families, Vanguard doesn't hire employees to manage funds. Instead, the world's biggest fund family hires managers from outside. This makes it easier to replace the funds in case the manager fails to deliver. This in turn helps to control overall cost of actively-managed Vanguard funds.When Bogle launched his first fund that tracked the S&P 500 index in 1976, it was called ""the Vanguard experiment,"" which initially accumulated $11 million. It is now famously known as the Vanguard 500 Index Investor fund and has almost $441 billion in assets, noted Vanguard.Bogle had very modestly said ""I don't think I'm anything like a folk hero, but there aren't a lot of people like me in this business. Most keep a lower profile, are much more guarded in the way they speak, and much less strident in their advocacy of shareholders' values and rights. If this industry had one fox and 1,000 hedgehogs, maybe I wouldn't stand out. But if it has 1,000 foxes and one hedgehog, you're going to be more distinctive. You carry a different set of values and investment ideas. If it's unusual - even unique - you will stand out.""So, what was his simple approach toward investing? No doubt, he asked everyone to consider index funds. Having a diversified portfolio comprising stocks as well as mutual funds was also recommended. Last but not the least he said that don't be bothered about the broader market. Think long term, stay invested and ignore the noise. But, most importantly he had confirmed that growth comes from dividends.According to Bogle, dividend yield along with earnings growth primarily drives stock prices. In the 20th century, out of the stock market's 9.6% return, 4.5% came from dividend growth and 5% came from earnings growth. Meanwhile, a meager 0.1% came from adjustments in market price-to-earnings ratio, noted Bogle.Bogle added that the compounding power o  is amazing and is key to huge wealth creation by index funds. Dividend payers, thus, make for wonderful investments. The best  , undoubtedly, yield healthy returns, have strong prospects and are less susceptible to market gyrations. Their large customer base, sustainable business model, long track of profitability and strong liquidity allow them to offer sizable yields on a regular basis, regardless of market conditions.While finding solid dividend paying companies isn't easy, they certainly do exist.

Further, the company's popular brands like Craftsman, DeWalt FlexVolt, Lenox and Irwin are adding strength. Buyouts have been proving beneficial for Stanley Black & Decker too.Stanley Black & Decker has not provided any separate projection for the fourth quarter. However, a look at the yearly forecast will fairly provide a picture for the to-be-reported quarter. For 2018, the company predicts adjusted earnings of $8.10-$8.20. Notably, lower tax rates and other adjustments will benefit bottom-line results by 15 cents per share. Alternatively, lower organic growth will adversely impac  by 15 cents while headwinds related to higher input costs, induced by forex woes, tariffs and commodities, will lower earnings by 25 cents.For the Tools & Storage segment, Stanley Black & Decker anticipates organic revenues to grow in a high-single digit. Average sale surprise for the last four quarters is 2.1%. For the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $2,590 million, reflecting 6.6% increase from revenues generated in the year-ago quarter.For Industrial and Security segments, the company predicts organic revenues to remain relatively flat year over year. Average sales surprise for the last four quarters is positive 7.1% for the Industrial segment and positive 1.7% for the Security segment. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for Industrial and Security segments are pegged at $515 million and $506 million, respectively. Estimates reflect growth of 8.6% for the Industrial segment and decline of 0.8% for the Security segment from sales generated a year ago.Our proven model provides some idea on stocks that are about to release their earnings results.

Notably, the mining and construction equipment behemoth delivered a year-over-year improvement of 47% and 18% in earnings and revenues, respectively, in the third quarter of 2018. Both the top and bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Continued strength in many of its end markets and persistent focus on cost control aided results. This marked the company's seventh consecutive quarter of both top and bottom-line growth, following a string of dismal performances for four years.Notably, Caterpillar outpaced earnings estimates in the trailing four quarters, recording average positive earnings surprise of 17.10%. Consequently, investors are keen on finding out whether Caterpillar will be able to maintain the momentum in the fourth quarter of 2018 as well.Looking at the upbeat estimates for the both earnings and revenues for the fourth quarter, it seems likely that the company will deliver year-over-year improvement on both metrics. This is also supported by strong fourth-quarter projections for its Machinery, Energy & Transportation which generates a major chunk of revenues and earnings. | Let's delve deeper and analyze the factors that might influence fourth-quarter results.At the end of third-quarter 2018, Caterpillar's order backlog was at $17.3 billion, an improvement of $1.9 billion year over year aided by increase at in segments. This bodes well for performance in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total sales of $14.3 billion for the fourth-quarter indicates growth of 15.8% from the prior-year quarter.Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the Machinery, Energy & Transportation segment, which contributed approximately 94% of total revenues in third-quarter 2018, is expected to log year-over-year growth of 12% in revenues to $13.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018.For the Resource Industries segment, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is pegged at $2,786 million, a projected year-over-year growth of 26%. Sales will be driven by continued strong demand for aftermarket parts. Further, miners are resuming capital spending which bodes well for the segment.In the Construction Industries segment, continued improvement in residential and non-residential construction in North America will drive revenues. However, the recent slowdown in excavator sales in China is a concern. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Construction segment's sales are projected at $5,981 million for the to-be-reported quarter, an expected year-over-year drop of 12%.For the Energy & Transportation segment, sales to the Oil and Gas sector is likely to increase in the quarter, aided by stable  . Sales for industrial applications will remain robust, primarily backed by improving global economic conditions and higher end-user demand across most applications. Sales to the Transportation sector will benefit primarily from recent acquisitions in rail services. Power Generation sales are improving after a multi-year downturn. The segment's sales are expected to grow 22% year over year to $5,726 million in the to-be-reported quarter.Material cost inflation will continue to affect Caterpillar's margins. The impact of recently imposed tariffs was about $40 million in the third quarter of 2018 and is likely to dent its fourth-quarter margins as well. The company is also witnessing higher freight rates owing to strained capacity in the trucking industry, less efficient freight loads, and expedited freight as it continues to ramp production to meet increased demand.Given these concerns, the company's share price has slumped 20.3% over the past year while the  witnessed a decline of 23%.Nevertheless, Caterpillar has been undergoing significant restructuring and cost reduction initiatives which have been benefiting margins. In fact, the fourth quarter is anticipated to be no exception to the trend. Consequently, strong order flow along, savings from cost reduction and pricing hikes will help counter the impact of higher costs.For the to-be-reported quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Profit before Taxes for the Machinery, Energy & Transportation segment is pegged at $2,208 million, double the $1,091 million reported in the prior-year quarter. This can be attributed to a rise of 25% in the Construction segment's operating profit to $1,050 million, per the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Further, the Resource Industries segment is expected to report an operating profit of $427 million, a substantial improvement from the prior-year quarter figure of $209 million. The Energy & Transportation segment is anticipated to report operating profit of $1,068 million, a rise of 21% from the year-ago quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Caterpillar's earnings is currently pegged at $2.99 for the fourth quarter. The estimate reflects an improvement of 38.4% on a year-over-year basis.Our proven model suggests that Caterpillar is likely to beat estimates in the quarter to be reported as it has the right combination of two key ingredients.

"ohn C. Bogle, father of the index fund, passed away at the age of 89 on Jan 16. He was known for his low-cost, buy-and-hold investing strategy and founded the Vanguard Group, the mutual fund house mostly known for their low-cost funds that track a market index rather than trying to outdo it. He said that the main appeal of these funds is that these capture nearly all of a bourses' return ably and inexpensively.Bogle always said ""Why can't managers beat the market? Where's the value added? In terms of industrywide statistics, it's just not there. One reason is because of cost. The cost is a handicap on the horse. If the jockey carries a lot of extra pounds, it's very tough for the horse to win the race.""Vanguard was formed in 1974 and began functioning the next year. Investors have put in nearly $5.3 trillion into Vanguard funds, according to the company. Most of the Vanguard funds are managed outside. Unlike other fund families, Vanguard doesn't hire employees to manage funds. Instead, the world's biggest fund family hires managers from outside. This makes it easier to replace the funds in case the manager fails to deliver. This in turn helps to control overall cost of actively-managed Vanguard funds.When Bogle launched his first fund that tracked the S&P 500 index in 1976, it was called ""the Vanguard experiment,"" which initially accumulated $11 million. It is now famously known as the Vanguard 500 Index Investor  fund and has almost $441 billion in assets, noted Vanguard.Bogle had very modestly said ""I don't think I'm anything like a folk hero, but there aren't a lot of people like me in this business. Most keep a lower profile, are much more guarded in the way they speak, and much less strident in their advocacy of shareholders' values and rights. If this industry had one fox and 1,000 hedgehogs, maybe I wouldn't stand out. But if it has 1,000 foxes and one hedgehog, you're going to be more distinctive. You carry a different set of values and investment ideas. If it's unusual - even unique - you will stand out.""So, what was his simple approach toward investing? No doubt, he asked everyone to consider index funds. Having a diversified portfolio comprising stocks as well as mutual funds was also recommended. Last but not the least he said that don't be bothered about the broader market. Think long term, stay invested and ignore the noise. But, most importantly he had confirmed that growth comes from dividends.According to Bogle, dividend yield along with earnings growth primarily drives stock prices. In the 20th century, out of the stock market's 9.6% return, 4.5% came from dividend growth and 5% came from earnings growth. Meanwhile, a meager 0.1% came from adjustments in market price-to-earnings ratio, noted Bogle.Bogle added that the compounding power o  is amazing and is key to huge wealth creation by index funds. Dividend payers, thus, make for wonderful investments. The best  , undoubtedly, yield healthy returns, have strong prospects and are less susceptible to market gyrations. Their large customer base, sustainable business model, long track of profitability and strong liquidity allow them to offer sizable yields on a regular basis, regardless of market conditions.While finding solid dividend paying companies isn't easy, they certainly do exist. To help you find these businesses, we have selected four dividend payers who have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). manufactures, markets, and distributes spices, seasoning mixes, condiments, and other flavorful products.

"We have been managing a position in  (NASDAQ:  ) since the end of  .After closing that November-expiration put write for a quick and easy profit, we rolled out the trade and sold to open the December-expiration puts for even more income.When that put write expired in the money, we accepted the stock.We were initially bullish on CTAS because of its strong ties to hiring in the services sector. Because CTAS supplies work uniforms and laundry services for workers in the retail and dining industries, their success is directly tied to a strong job market.The market rallied on positive expectations for fourth-quarter earnings and a more accommodative Federal Reserve in 2019. This means employment, especially in services sectors, should continue to grow. All those new employees need uniforms, and CTAS will provide them.Most stocks, including CTAS, are still well off of their highs following the market's drop at the end of December. The market did turn around and head higher after getting some positive news from the Fed, but it is rare for the major indexes to successfully complete a ""V-shaped"" reversal without some period of consolidation.Because we are expecting the market to consolidate here for a bit, and in order to limit risk and generate income, we want to write calls against our long stock position in CTAS.From a technical perspective, CTAS looks like a strong candidate.As we mentioned earlier, we don't expect the market to turn around right away. In the short term, CTAS looks like it will consolidate sideways.CTAS has just surpassed its October lows, but $173-$175 could act as a potential area of resistance if the market gets choppy. Additionally, we wouldn't be surprised to see the price temporarily rejected near $180 per share.We only expect resistance to be a factor in the short term. So, while we think increasing our hedge by collecting some additional income is appropriate right now, we may want to buy that call back at a cheaper price if the stock drops back to support before our options expire.If the stock does not consolidate and breaks resistance, we may have some opportunity costs when the calls are exercised.However, if we do get called out of our position, the exercise price will be equal to our entry price, and we will simply keep the hefty option premiums we have been collecting since October.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Generate Income While CTAS Consolidates Below $175@2019-01-08@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/generate-income-while-ctas-consolidates-below-175-2019-01-08

"We accepted shares of Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:  ) when our MNST September 21st $62 Put Write expired in the money. Since then, we've successfully sold one covered call on MNST. Now, we'd like to do it again.MNST jumped up yesterday on positive news. If we sell calls at this point, we can collect premium that can be rolled out again if the stock drops back to a more moderate level.Back in November, news of a dispute between the  (NYSE:  ) and MNST overshadowed MNST's strong third-quarter earnings. KO acts as MNST's distributor, and KO announced it was launching its own energy drink in 2019.That news led to speculation about the health of the two companies' partnership, and the companies are heading into arbitration to determine whether KO has violated their agreement with MNST.The stock jumped yesterday after Suntrust analysts upgraded MNST from ""hold"" to ""buy."" They believe, as we do, that concerns about the KO deal have led to the stock being oversold.Our argument is that it makes much more sense for KO to see MNST as an acquisition target this year than it does to compete with energy drinks of their own. A merger like that has accretive value and it avoids the legal liability that KO is flirting with right now.However, to be clear we don't expect an acquisition to occur in the short-term, and yesterday's rally may be partially due to a short squeeze.If we look at the chart below, we see that MNST struggled in December. We think the probability for a recession or continued bear market in the 1st or 2nd quarter this year is very low. However, we don't think the market will continue higher without one or two more interruptions this month. There is too much uncertainty.MNST may be up after the upgrade from analysts, but back in November, analysts were sure the dispute between KO and MNST would cause trouble for the stock. MNST rose steadily into early December before selling off along with the rest of the market.We think continuing to collect premium against our long MNST position now that it has gapped up is a good strategy. We rarely get called out of our covered call positions, and we expect this will allow us to roll the calls out (or just buy them back later) for more income.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Analysts Upgraded MNST to Buy, and it Jumped Above $52@2019-01-09@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/analysts-upgraded-mnst-buy-and-it-jumped-above-52-2019-01-09

The company has missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the preceding four quarters, the average negative surprise being 11.96%.Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement. | For the fiscal first quarter 2019, Lindsay anticipates its irrigation operating margin performance in the United States to benefit from the strength and growth of technology products. Further, the company commenced production on the San Rafael Bridge during third-quarter fiscal 2018 which is expected to generate revenues in the quarter to be reported.Notably, the primary construction season for Northern Hemisphere countries generally corresponds with the company's third and fourth fiscal quarters. Thus, seasonality remains a concern for the fiscal first-quarter results. Further, the North American agricultural market will likely remain plagued with lower commodity prices and farm income.Lindsay's results will bear the brunt of rising steel prices as a result of tariffs. Also, strengthening of the U.S. dollar escalates the cost in the local currency of the products exported from the United States into these countries and therefore, may affect Lindsay's international sales and margins. In addition, the company will bear the brunt of elevated costs incurred in connection with its Foundation for Growth performance improvement initiative.Nevertheless, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share for the fiscal first quarter is pegged at 47 cents, reflecting year-over-year growth of around 57%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total sales of $113 million also indicates 3% decline from the prior-year quarter.Our consensus estimates indicate that sales of the Infrastructure segment will reach $22.6 million in the fiscal first quarter, indicating 6% year-over-year growth. The estimate for the Irrigation Equipment segment'ssales for the quarter to be reported is $91 million, reflecting year-over-year decline of 12%.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Lindsay is likely to beat on earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below: The Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate of 36 cents and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 47 cents, is -22.58%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . Lindsay's Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Lindsay's shares have outperformed the  's performance in the past year. The stock has gained around 3%, as against the industry's loss of 10%.Here are some other companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Cintas Corporation  has an Earnings ESP of +0.50% and a Zacks Rank #2. Its shares have gained 2% in the past year. You can see  .W.W. Grainger, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +0.31% and a Zacks Rank #3. The stock has gained 14% in a year's time.Heritage-Crystal Clean, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +1.12% and a Zacks Rank #2. The company's shares have rallied 5% during the past year.Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"Chicago, IL -January 3, 2019 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: McCormick & Company, Inc.  , Archer-Daniels-Midland Company  , W.W. Grainger, Inc.  , Walmart Inc.  and Cintas Corporation  .Wall Street may have seen a Santa Claus rally by the end of last year, but that wasn't enough to salvage a disappointing year. Investors' appetite for riskier assets like stocks took a beating in 2018, with the major bourses seeing the worst year since 2008.Few market pundits could predict such neck-breaking market gyrations in 2018 after an unusually calm 2017. From the U.S.-China trade dispute to slow economic and earnings growth, everything only added to the chaos. The fears that gripped markets in 2018 may continue to reflect in volatile price swings this year. Thus, in order to safeguard your portfolio, investing in dividend aristocrats seems prudent. After all, these stocks provide higher total returns with lower volatility.But, before we select the stocks let us look at the risks that have sent shivers down investors' spines of late -Though market bulls hope for progress in U.S.-China trade negotiations, tensions loom large. President Trump continues to threaten a tariff increase on billions of dollars worth of Chinese commodities if China fails to address U.S. demands on economic and political issues. Lest we forget, such tariffs will be paid by American companies and they will invariably pass the cost onto consumers, who account for two-third of U.S.' GDP.By the way, Trump's warnings to lessen the power of the Fed Chair also raise concern. Investors may not like a hawkish Fed, but they certainly want peace and consistency, and threatening the Fed Chair is not inducing any calm.Amid all these, an U.S. government shutdown is set to stretch this year due to a deadlock between the White House and lawmakers over the President's intention of securing financing for a wall on the border with Mexico.At the same time, dysfunction in the United Kingdom has thrown investors for a loop. No one knows what will be the impact of Brexit. In fact, if it rolls out on Mar 29 without a deal, it will most certainly hurt the global economy.Thanks to the tax cuts and a solid labor market, the U.S. economy expanded at an annual rate of 4.2% and 3.4% in the second and third quarter of last year. But, the Fed officials now expect growth to moderate over the next couple of years. Fed officials expect the pace of the economic expansion to slow down to 2.3% this year.The world's second-largest economy, China, saw the weakest economic growth last year. And this year looks even worse. China's Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for December dropped to 49.7 from 50.2 in November. This dismal reading on factory output raised concerns over a possible slowdown this year. Brexit, in the meanwhile, could surely rock Britain this year. Thus, threats of a global economic slowdown raised doubts over the longevity of the bull market.Earnings growth, in the meantime, is expected to moderate primarily due to an increase in labor and material costs pinching profit margins. Moreover, corporate profits got a boost last year due to the tax cuts, especially at the beginning of the year. However, its effects have started to wear off, and growth in 2019 doesn't look much promising.U.S. dollar has been rising for quite some time now. The US Dollar Index is up nearly 5% this year, hurting profits of America's multinational companies. This is because a strong dollar certainly makes U.S. products more expensive abroad, dampening overseas sales.With things not looking too favorable for the stock market at the start of the year, it's prudent to invest in dividend aristocrats for risk-adjusted returns. These stocks have a solid financial structure and healthy underlying fundamentals. They also outperform other dividend payers on better quality business.Hence, we have selected five dividend aristocrats to boost your returns. Such stocks also possess a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The favorable Zacks Rank should help these stocks gain further this year and beyond as well.

"omentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the  , helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at  , which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Cintas currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of In order to see if CTAS is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this uniform rental company holds up.Looking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.For CTAS, shares are up 3.03% over the past week while the Zacks Uniform and Related industry is up 1.5% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 6.57% compares favorably with the industry's 6.57% performance as well.Considering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Over the past quarter, shares of Cintas have risen 1.64%, and are up 10.12% in the last year. In comparison, the S&P 500 has only moved -4.65% and -4.45%, respectively.Investors should also take note of CTAS's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, CTAS is averaging 740,637 shares for the last 20 days.The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with CTAS.Over the past two months, 8 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost CTAS's consensus estimate, increasing from $7.24 to $7.35 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 7 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.Given these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that CTAS is a #2 (Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep Cintas on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"he manufacturing sector has held its ground this year despite impact from tariff and supply chain challenges. This momentum is likely to continue next year as well, supported by the spate of positive data coming in from the sector. Improvement in its end markets like residential and non-residential construction; mining driven by ongoing recovery in the commodities, oil and gas industry; and economic growth will continue to drive the sector.The announcement of the tariffs on steel imports into the United States earlier this year was a big blow to the manufacturing sector overall. Given that steel is a primary raw material, every manufacturing company bore the brunt of rising steel prices owing to the tariffs. Though this was mitigated to some extent with price increases, it might not always be feasible to pass on the price increase to customers. Further, the industry has been plagued with shortage of skilled laborers, higher wage costs and flaring-up transportation expenses.Despite these challenges, the manufacturing sector witnessed strong production output and continued strength in new orders this year. Per the Institute for Supply Management's (""ISM"").latest report, Purchasing Managers' Index (""PMI"") for November rose 59.3% - maintaining growth in manufacturing for the 27th consecutive months. Of the 18 manufacturing industries, 13 reported growth in November.The PMI has averaged 59.2% over the last 12 months ranging from a low of 57.3% in April 2018 to a high of 61.3% in August 2018. Notably, a reading above 50% indicates expansion in manufacturing economy. The PMI reading of 59.3% for November corresponds to an increase of 4.9% in real gross domestic product (GDP) on an annualized basis.New Orders Index registered 62.1% in November, indicating growth in new orders for the 35th consecutive month. Production Index registered growth of 60.5% in November, indicating improvement in production for the 27th consecutive month. Employment continued to expand, supporting production growth. The employment index was pegged at 58.4% in November, maintaining growth for the 26th consecutive month.Additionally, industrial production - a measure of the level of output of manufacturing, mining and utilities sectors - rose 0.6% in November. Manufacturing output remained flat while mining output rose 1.7% aided by gains in oil and gas extraction, coal mining, and support activities for mining.All the machinery industries are broadly clubbed under the Zacks  Sector, one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors. The sector's earnings rose 20% in third-quarter 2018. Per Zacks' projections, the sector is expected to log growth of 14% in earnings in the fourth quarter of 2018. In the next fiscal, the sector's earnings are expected to rise 7.4% in the first quarter, followed by 7.7% and 10.6% in the second and third quarters of 2019, respectively. (Read more:  )This sector has underperformed the S&P 500 market in recent times owing to the concern surrounding the impact of tariffs. In the past year, the sector has dipped 27.5% while the S&P 500's declined 12.4%. We believe the price performance will eventually pick up, driven by the healthy growth prospects and upbeat numbers coming from the manufacturing sector which indicate that the sector is on a firm footing.Continued improvement in residential and non-residential construction, and revival in infrastructure demand bode well for the industry. Mining companies are also resuming capital spending due to the improvement in commodity prices. Further, the recently passed tax reform is likely to act as a catalyst by expediting manufacturing investment in factories, new equipment and other capital goods.We have zeroed in on four industrial stocks which have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a VGM Score of A or B. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores.

s we get ready to welcome 2019, apprehensions about expected global economic slowdown and persisting uncertainties surrounding trade the United States-China trade war are looming over the Wall Street and creating volatility in the financial markets.Many economists believe that 2019 will be full of hurdles and the U.S. economy may witness a slowdown or recession. Some economists predict that the U.S. GDP growth is likely to decelerate over the next few quarters, which will make the economy vulnerable to external shocks.Adding to the concern is the United States-China trade tensions that are elevating stock market volatility in the near term. Washington and Beijing have agreed not to levy further tariffs or retaliation till March 2019. However, many experts believe that the mutually agreed timeframe is not adequate to enable a comprehensive trade pact between the two biggest economies. Hence, the trade woes are likely to dent investors' sentiments.Many economists also believe that the trade war is already affecting the U.S. economy. The imposition of tariffs on Chinese goods by the U.S. administration and Beijing's tit-for-tat actions are likely to mar U.S. GDP growth. Investors may expect to witness continued negotiations or even a deal to roll back tariffs. However, absence of new threats from either side is likely to cheer the Wall Street.Billionaire investor, Paul Tudor Jones, recently stated that the stock market is likely to become more volatile in 2019 and stocks could dip as much as 15% from current levels before bottoming out.Along with these factors, there is also an apprehension that the U.S. Federal Reserve will continue to hike interest rates next year. As such, it will be difficult for businesses to borrow from the market that will lead to tight financial conditions.Given the  volatility and mostly downbeat outlook for 2019, it will be prudent for investors to take precautions and include stocks in the portfolio that are fundamentally solid and belong to top-ranked industries. This is important as a rising tide will elevate all boats in an industry, as there can be broad trends in a segment that boost securities across the board.We have employed the  to find five stocks from top-ranked industries (top 10%) that are poised to performance well in 2019.

"any investors see  (NASDAQ: CTAS) as a barometer of the success of the U.S. economy overall. The company provides uniform rentals to workers as well as facilities services to companies across the country, and a healthy employment environment has helped promote substantial growth for all of its businesses. Yet with investors fearing a possible recession in the U.S., it would be reasonable to think that  .Coming into Thursday's fiscal second-quarter financial report, Cintas shareholders expected that it would keep growing at a solid pace, but they really hoped that the company would signal a bright future even with prevailing fears about the economy's strength. Cintas's numbers showed no signs of a slowdown, and executives remain optimistic about what lies ahead for the uniform rental specialist.Image source: Cintas.Cintas's fiscal second-quarter results showed how successful the company has been. Revenue came in at $1.72 billion, up 7% from year-ago levels and accelerating from its pace in the  . Net income soared 77% to $243 million, and even after making allowances for some one-time items, adjusted earnings of $1.76 per share topped the consensus forecast among investors for $1.70 per share.Signs of fundamental strength continue to shine in Cintas's quarterly report. Organic growth matched the overall 7% rise in sales, with the key uniform rental and facility services segment seeing slightly slower revenue gains of 6.6%. The first aid and safety services unit continued to outperform, with growth of 10.2% strengthening from its figures earlier in the fiscal year.Two things played a key role in goosing earnings higher for Cintas. First, a one-time gain on the sale of an investment contributed more than $69 million to pre-tax profit for the quarter. Also, tax reform kept paying dividends for Cintas, with its effective tax rate falling 9 percentage points to just over 24%.Cost containment also contributed to the company's bottom line. Gross margin for the uniform rental and facility services business climbed about 0.6 percentage points to almost 45.3%, and overhead expenses climbed at just a 5% rate, slower than Cintas's sales growth rate. Declines in interest expense were also helpful, even though they were less extensive than investors have seen in previous periods.CEO Scott Farmer kept his comments simple. ""The company is on pace to achieve another year of strong growth in revenue, earnings, and cash flow generation,"" Farmer said, and the CEO also noted that the company's annual dividend earlier this month was 26% higher than its 2017 dividend, marking the 35th straight year that  .Cintas is also optimistic about the future. With the integration of the G&K acquisition having made substantial headway, the company remains on track with most of its major strategic objectives. Executives were also largely silent about any worries about perceived deterioration in the strength of the U.S. economy.That optimism showed up in improved guidance for the full 2019 fiscal year. Revenue for the uniform rental specialist is now projected to be $55 million to $70 million higher than Cintas's previous forecast, with a new range of $6.87 billion to $6.91 billion. Earnings of $7.30 to $7.38 per share would be about $0.10 higher than what Cintas had believed three months ago that it would bring in for the fiscal year.Cintas investors were happy with the results, and the stock jumped 4% in  Friday following the Thursday-afternoon announcement. With the uniform rental company seemingly on track to sustain its recent success, Cintas has its shareholders as excited as they can be that it can escape the negative impact of a bear market and produce strong fundamental performance for 2019 and beyond.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Cintas wasn't one of them!

nvestors considering a purchase of Cintas Corporation (Symbol: CTAS) shares, but cautious about paying the going market price of $165.38/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the December put at the $160 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $1.70. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 1.1% return against the $160 commitment, or a 129.3% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to CTAS's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $160 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Cintas Corporation sees its shares decline 4.1% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $158.30 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $1.70 from $160), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 129.3% annualized rate of return.Interestingly, that annualized 129.3% figure actually exceeds the 1.2% annualized dividend paid by Cintas Corporation by 128.1%, based on the current share price of $165.38. And yet, if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downside because the stock would have to lose 4.09% to reach the $160 strike price.Always important when discussing dividends is the fact that, in general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Cintas Corporation, looking at the dividend history chart for CTAS below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 1.2% annualized dividend yield.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Cintas Corporation, and highlighting in green where the $160 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the December put at the $160 strike for the 129.3% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Cintas Corporation (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $165.38) to be 23%.

ear 2018 so far has been difficult for companies engaged in providing industrial equipment and services; metal fabrication; machinery; products made from textiles, rubber or plastics; and pollution control solutions. The Zacks  sector - which includes such industrial stocks - seems to have lost its sheen in the year.Collectively, the average share price of the constituent companies of the Industrial Products sector has declined 22.8% year to date against 25% growth recorded in 2017. Also, the sector's performance was worse than S&P 500's decline of 6.2%.The sector currently lies in the bottom 38% of the Zacks sector list - holding the 10th position out of total 16. Over the last 10 years, using a one-week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than two. (To learn more visit: About  ). In addition, our proprietary Heat Map shows that the sector's rank has remained in the bottom half of the rank list in the past eight weeks.Seeing the financial performance, the sector's earnings growth (on a year-over-year basis) over the first three quarters of 2018 was weak as well - having decelerated from 36.2% in the first quarter to 33.8% in the second and 20.2% in the third. We now expect the sector's earnings growth to be roughly 14% in the fourth quarter of 2018. Likewise, revenue growth declined from 16.1% in the first quarter to 7.3% in the third quarter. It is predicted to be 5.3% in the fourth quarter.Broader market issues, particularly straining international trade relations due to protectionism policies (imposition of import tariffs) of the United States, weighed on the sector,. Further, inflationary pressure, rising freight charges and difficulties in finding skilled labor added to the woes, largely eroding margins. Geopolitical tension, as well as unfavorable movements in foreign currencies, has adversely impacted the sector's prospects as well.Despite all the setbacks, industrial stocks benefited from lower tax rates due to the implementation of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December last year. Moreover, the strengthening housing market, infrastructural developments and growing manufacturing activities have been favoring some industrial companies. Innovation to tap customer demand kept the momentum alive for some stocks.Using  , we have zeroed in on five lucrative investment options from the Industrial Products sector that stand tall despite near-term uncertainties. : This Cincinnati, OH-based industrial uniform and other products supplier currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

 is slated to report second-quarter fiscal 2019 (ended November 2018) results on Dec 20,  .The company pulled off a positive average earnings surprise of 7.22% over the preceding four quarters. Notably, Cintas' first-quarter fiscal 2019 (ended August 2018) adjusted earnings of $1.93 per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.78 per share by 8.4%.Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Cintas believes efforts undertaken to enhance its product portfolio and improve customer relationships will drive the company's organic revenue growth in the upcoming quarters of fiscal 2019 (ending May 2019). Additionally, strength in the National Account, Fire and Uniform Direct Sale businesses will likely support the upswing, moving ahead. The company also expects that the recently-made business acquisitions will support its top-line growth in the quarters ahead.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue of the company's Uniform Rental and Facility Services, First Aid and Safety Services and All Other business segments are currently pegged at $1,380 million, $151 million and $166 million for second-quarter fiscal 2019, higher than the respective tallies of $1,308 million, $139 million and $159 million recorded in the year-ago quarter.Cintas anticipates that stellar revenues, lower commission expense (on account of Accounting Standard Update 2014-09 adoption), and reduced corporate tax expenses (due to the implementation of December 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) will strengthen its profitability in the near term.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for gross profit in second-quarter fiscal 2019 for Uniform Rental and Facility Services, First Aid and Safety Services and All Other business segments are currently pegged at $621 million, $72 million and $71 million, higher than the respective tallies of $584 million, $65 million and $67 million recorded in the prior-year period.However, rising stock-based compensation expenses (associated with the change in retirement policy), integration expenses related to G&K Services Inc. acquisition (March 2017) and cost relating to the implementation of new enterprise resource planning system might hurt Cintas' margins in quarters-to-be-reported. Moreover, material cost inflation (due to tariffs levied over U.S. imports) and soaring wage costs might weigh over the company's near-term profitability.Our proven model provides some idea on the stocks that are about to release their earnings results. Per the model, a stock needs to have a combination of a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for a likely earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  .That is not the case here as we will see below.

 has impressed investors with its recent earnings streak, having surpassed estimates in each of the four trailing quarters. The company's share price increase reflects its impressive performance, exhibiting investor optimism over the stock. On a year-to-date basis, the company has gained 7.4%, outperforming the  's growth of 0.9%.We believe that its notable traction across markets will drive growth in the upcoming quarters.Going forward, Cintas is likely to gain from effective implementation of enterprise resource planning system, integration of G&K Services assets as well as focus on enhancement of product portfolio and customer base.Acquisitions have been Cintas' preferred mode of business expansion. In fiscal 2018, the company added five acquired assets to Uniform Rental and Facility Services while three were combined with First Aid and Safety Services, and six in All Other. It's worth mentioning that the company is progressing well on the integration of G&K Services buyout with its Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment. In fact, in four years of acquisition, the G&K Services buyout is predicted to be major source of revenue growth and generate cost synergies of $130-$140 million.Over the years, Cintas has consistently returned significant cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Notably, in the first six months of fiscal 2019, the company repurchased common stock worth $447 million under its buyback program. Further, the company increased its annual dividend payments by 26.5% from $1.62 per share to $2.05 in October 2018.Further, the company's cash position is impressive, as evident from 26.2% year-over-year increase in cash flow from operating activities in fiscal 2018. For fiscal 2019, it expects to generate strong cash flow.The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks from the same industry are Superior Uniform Group, Inc.  , Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc.  and Brady Corporation  . All these stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2. You can see  .Superior Uniform Group surpassed estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters, the average positive earnings surprise being 8.23%.Applied Industrial Technologies surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average positive earnings surprise being 11.67%.Brady outpaced estimates thrice in the preceding four quarters, the average earnings surprise being 7.04%.Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

all Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Cintas (CTAS) reports results for the quarter ended November 2018. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on December 20. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the , it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.This uniform rental company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.72 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +31.3%.Revenues are expected to be $1.70 billion, up 5.5% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks  (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce  , and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).For Cintas, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Cintas will beat the consensus EPS estimate.While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Cintas would post earnings of $1.78 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.93, delivering a surprise of +8.43%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our  to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Cintas doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The company has also refocused certain commercial efforts, including realigning and enhancing its sales functions, and improvement of cost structure.

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the WisdomTree U.S. Earnings 500 Fund ETF (Symbol: EPS), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $35.95 per unit.With EPS trading at a recent price near $29.88 per unit, that means that analysts see 20.33% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of EPS's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are CenturyLink Inc (Symbol: CTL), Cintas Corporation (Symbol: CTAS), and HollyFrontier Corp (Symbol: HFC). Although CTL has traded at a recent price of $16.88/share, the average analyst target is 25.39% higher at $21.17/share. Similarly, CTAS has 23.45% upside from the recent share price of $171.84 if the average analyst target price of $212.14/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting HFC to reach a target price of $68.75/share, which is 23.19% above the recent price of $55.81. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of CTL, CTAS, and HFC:Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
  
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past.

"he  formula at  ranks a coverage universe of thousands of  , according to a proprietary formula designed to identify those stocks that combine two important characteristics - strong fundamentals and a valuation that looks inexpensive. Cintas Corporation (Symbol: CTAS) presently has an above average rank, in the top 50% of the coverage universe, which suggests it is among the top most ""interesting"" ideas that merit further research by investors.But making Cintas Corporation an even more interesting and timely stock to look at, is the fact that in trading on Thursday, shares of CTAS entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $160 per share. We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30. In the case of Cintas Corporation, the RSI reading has hit 28.8 - by comparison, the universe of dividend stocks covered by  currently has an average RSI of 34.0. A falling stock price - all else being equal - creates a better opportunity for dividend investors to capture a higher yield. Indeed, CTAS's recent annualized dividend of 2.05/share works out to an annual yield of 1.24% based upon the recent $165.07 share price.A bullish investor could look at CTAS's 28.8 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. Among the fundamental datapoints dividend investors should investigate to decide if they are bullish on CTAS is its dividend history. In general, dividends are not always predictable; but, looking at the history chart below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Cintas Becomes Oversold@2018-12-20@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/cintas-becomes-oversold-2018-12-20

n Nov 19, we issued an updated research report on  . The company is poised to gain from product innovation, growth in orders, focus on cost control and pricing actions. However, input cost inflation, weakness in rough terrain markets and the Middle East market remain headwinds.Let's analyze the factors in detail.Manitowoc reported third-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings per share of 20 cents, slumping 45% year over year. However, revenues increased 13% year over year to $450 million in the quarter, aided by improved crane shipments across all regions.Manitowoc raised full-year 2018 revenue guidance to $1.80-$1.83 billion from $1.78-$1.85 billion, indicating growth of 15% at the midpoint year over year. The company affirmed 2018 adjusted EBITDA guidance of $105-$115 million.Manitowoc continues to execute its strategy to cover cost inflation through pricing actions. Further, the company remains focused on cost controls, reducing headcount, increasing productivity and eliminating waste. It has also been taking aggressive steps to support supply-chain partners to ensure timely delivery of components.Manitowoc's focus on innovation will continue to aid it in leading the industry by providing differentiated products that add value to its customers. The company introduced the new 30-ton tractor mount National Crane at the Permian Basin International Oil Show. The response has exceeded expectations and order activity has been robust. The company anticipates good crawler demand in 2019, primarily driven by the new product introduction of MLC 100. Crawler utilization is very high and Manitowoc is gaining shares in the United States.Manitowoc's orders were $458 million in third-quarter 2018 - up 13% year over year. In Americas, demand is being led by the commercial construction and energy end markets. In Asia Pacific, growth is being driven by India, Australia, and China. The company also noted overall stable demand in Europe, with moderating demand in Western Europe. Further, backlog at the end of the quarter came in at $700 million, up 50% from the prior-year quarter, providing improved revenue visibility over the remainder of the year.Rough terrain markets have turned positive but still remains well below historical highs. Manitowoc does not anticipate a substantial increase in rough terrain markets in 2019. Further, geopolitical uncertainties and market competitions have kept the Middle East market challenging.Incremental input costs will continue to impact margins in fourth-quarter 2018, primarily due to the imposition of the tariffs on steel imports.

We have been managing a position in  (NASDAQ:  ) since  .  subscribers received an alert to take profits on the CTAS November 16th $175 Put Write on Nov. 8th. We bought back to close that naked put write, and this morning we are recommending another bullish trade on CTAS.The uniform-maker is continuing to do well, and we expect the employment outlook to increase demand through the end of the year. We are only rolling out our naked put to the December 21st expiration because that is just before the company's earnings are likely be released.If we look at a daily chart of CTAS, we can see that it crossed below the $178 level in October. The $178 level acted as resistance in March of 2018. Regular readers know that old resistance levels often become new support levels, and CTAS may be testing that level now.We continue to feel that CTAS has been oversold and still has room to move. Since CTAS came down yesterday after recovering slightly in early November, there is good amount of premium in the put options.Still, the market is swinging back and forth while it forms a bottom. With that in mind, we think a hedged entry with these short puts is the best approach.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@CTAS is Still Oversold@2018-11-21@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ctas-still-oversold-2018-11-21
"n Nov 22, we issued an updated research report on  . The company will benefit from its ongoing successful joint venture (""JV"") with Constellation Brands, Inc.  , growing preference for glass packaging and its Total System Cost approach. However, unfavorable foreign currency, substantial freight inflation, continued decline of beer in the domestic marketremain concerns.Owens-Illinois lowered adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $2.72-$2.78 for 2018 from its previous guidance of $2.75-$2.85. Unfavorable foreign currency will continue to be a headwind in fiscal 2018. Moreover, the company continues to face substantial freight inflation in the United States. Further, poor grape harvest in Europe in 2017 is affecting wine volumes in the region in 2018. The continued decline of beer in the domestic market also remains a major headwind. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 is $2.74, reflecting year-over-year growth of 3.4%.In 2019, the company anticipates top-line growth and margin expansion driven by its Total System Cost approach (""TSC"") and footprint optimization. The company expects earnings per share of around $3.00 in fiscal 2019. It anticipates about 1% volume organic growth in its legacy volumes and continued growth in the JV with Constellation Brands in the fiscal. In Europe, wine sales will be higher in 2019 due to the strong grape harvest in 2018. Further, glass packaging in Western Europe has been growing for last two years - in line with total packaging. Premium products in Europe are growing significantly faster than overall market. The company's efforts to add capacity in Europe, supply chain performance, and footprint optimization poises it well for growing volumes and expanding margins in the region.Considering the improving market demand in Mexico and Brazil, the company is adding capacity. In the United States, demand for glass is improving bolstered by favorable consumer trends and increased preference of customers for glass packaging. Non-beer categories in the United States continue to grow at low-single digits over time. Consequently, the company has been focusing on these categories by improving customer relationships, commercial and design capabilities, and converting almost 20% of its beer capacity into flexible capacity to meet non-beer customer demand. Overall, the Americas are expected to generate higher sales, profit and margin in the coming year.In Asia Pacific, growing demand in emerging markets will drive volumes. Owens-Illinois has completed its asset improvements program in the region, and expects higher volumes and lower manufacturing expense to drive margins higher going forward.Owens-Illinois continues to mitigate the impact of the ongoing decline in mega beer in the United States by positioning itself to benefit from the rapidly growing market of U.S. beer imports. It intends to achieve this through its JV with Constellation and long-term sales contracts in Mexico. The JV has exceeded expectations so far - productivity has been higher than anticipated, capital costs were considerably lesser than initially expected and earnings have been growing every year.The company has built four furnaces at the JV in just four years and is currently building a fifth furnace that is expected to come on line in the second half of 2009. The fifth furnace will help cater to the rising demand from Constellation`s adjacent brewery. With the installation of the fifth furnace, the Nava plant will be the largest, most modern glass container factory globally. The total cost of approximately $140 million, will be financed by equal contributions from both partners.Despite Owens-Illinois' deleveraging and refinancing actions in the past 12 months, its debt-to-capitalization ratio remains high at 84%. Higher interest levels will impact its margins. Further, its margins will bear the impact of the company's incremental investments in R&D in the near term.Owens-Illinois faces intense competition from manufacturers of alternative forms of packaging, such as aluminum cans and plastic containers, persists. Advantages in price, quality, and functional attributes of these alternative containers may lead to customers considering a change of suppliers or the form of packaging, which could affect Owens-Illinois. Also, continued decline of beer in the domestic market remains a major headwind.Shares of Owens-Illinois have dropped 24% in the past year, compared with the  's decline of 25%.Owens-Illinois carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the same sector are CECO Environmental Corp.  and Cintas Corporation  .

n Nov 20, we issued an updated research report on  . The company is poised to gain from pricing initiatives, focus on its Grow and Optimize strategy, acquisitions and a strong balance sheet position. However the company has to contend with elevated costs owing to damages caused Hurricane Florence, higher material and other costs, in the near term.Let's analyze the factors in detail.The company remains optimistic about general economic activity. Sonoco believes the breadth of its diversified consumer, and industrial and protective operations across a number of markets are likely to drive consistent earnings and improve returns. Further, the company will gain from pricing initiatives to counter inflation. It has recently announced price hikes in its Protective Solutions and Rigid Plastic Packaging business.Sonoco remains focused on driving inorganic growth through acquisitions. In October 2018, the company acquired the remaining 70% interest in the Conitex-Sonoco joint venture and Texpack's composite can operation in Spain, for approximately $143 million in cash. Conitex Sonoco is a vertically integrated global leader in the manufacturing of paper-based cones and tubes used in the textile industry. It will be included in Sonoco's Paper and Industrial Converted Products Segment. The Spanish composite can operation will be included in its Consumer Packaging Segment.The acquisition will assist the company in expanding manufacturing presence in the Americas, Europe, and rapidly growing emerging markets in Asia. It will also help build strong customer relationships by offering innovative packaging solutions in paperboard, textile carriers and other value-added products. The buyout will be modestly accretive to Sonoco's earnings in 2018. The company earlier completed the buyout of Highland Packaging Solutions in April 2018 and bought Clear Lam July 2017. Both buyouts contributed to Sonoco's Consumer Packaging segment's top-line in the third quarter by $31 million. These acquisitions are likely to be accretive to the company's top-line.Sonoco is on track to implement its Grow and Optimize strategy in 2018. The company remains focused on targeted acquisitions, development of new products and income prospects in the United States. It will continue to focus on optimizing businesses through process improvement, standardization, cost control and commercial excellence. Its emphasis on thermoformed plastics, flexible packaging and consolidating industrial opportunities, particularly in the emerging markets, will also aid growth.Sonoco's paper mill operations in Hartsville, SC, were temporarily shut down owing to flooding caused by Hurricane Florence. The company had also temporarily closed operations at several of its recycling operations, tube and core plants, and other operations in Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina due to the impact of the storm. All operations have now resumed production.Lost production and sales at impacted facilities due to the hurricane will impact fourth-quarter 2018 earnings by around 2-3 cents per share due to additional lost production and higher supply chain costs. Additionally, normal seasonal slowdown in the latter part of the quarter will impact earnings. For fourth-quarter 2018, the company expects adjusted earnings per share to be 75-81 cents. Compared with the prior-year quarter's earnings per share of 72 cents, the mid-point of the guidance reflects year-over-year growth of 8%.For full-year 2018, Sonoco lowered adjusted earnings per share guidance to $3.28-$3.34 from the earlier projection of $3.27-$3.37. Impact of Hurricane Florence, impact of tariffs on steel, aluminum and other products will hurt results for the year. The company is also facing inflationary cost pressure from higher freight, wages, energy and elevated cost for materials, particularly resins.Exports will continue to be affected owing to a strong dollar. Consequently, the headwinds from a strengthening dollar will affect its industrial businesses, moving ahead.Shares of Sonoco have gained around 10% over the past year, against the  's decline of 7%.Sonoco currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the same space include Enersys  , Mobile Mini, Inc.  and Cintas Corporation  . While Enersys sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Mobile Mini and Cintas carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see  .Enersys has a long-term earnings growth rate of 10%. The stock has rallied 21% in a year's time.Mobile Mini has a long-term earnings growth rate of 14%.

 has impressed investors with its recent earnings streak, having surpassed estimates thrice in the four trailing quarters. Further, the company's leading position in water heating equipment and water treatment product markets, improved product mix and robust liquidity position bode well for future growth.We believe that its notable traction across markets will drive growth in the upcoming quarters.The company's replacement market, which accounts for approximately 85% of the North American water heater and boiler volumes, has been witnessing an uptrend, thus stoking growth. For 2018, the company believes that the water heater volumes in the U.S. residential industry will shoot up 250,000-300,000 units. The volume growth will be largely driven by higher replacement demand and new construction. Also, the company expects revenues from its boiler business to grow roughly 10% in 2018.Moreover, A. O. Smith's business in China has grown significantly over the years. The water heater market in the country is expected to be fuelled by factors like growth of households, market share gain, geographic expansion and improved product mix. For full-year 2018, sales in China are anticipated to improve 3% in local currency. However, slowdown in housing sales and international trade issues will play spoilsport.Further, the company dedicatedly follows a capital deployment strategy and continually rewards its shareholders via repurchases and dividend increases. At the end of third-quarter 2018, A. O. Smith had roughly 3.2 million shares remaining under repurchase authority. Recently, it hiked quarterly dividend rate by 22%. This initiative will enable the company to retain investors' confidence in the stock.In the past month, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has lost 0.1% compared with the 's decline of 3.5%.In the past month, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has lost 0.1% compared with the  's decline of 3.5%.However, higher selling, general and administrative expenses remain a headwind for A. O. Smith. Higher developmental costs associated with new products, including expansion of air purification product portfolio, are driving its operating expenses.In addition, market prices for certain raw materials used by the company, primarily steel, have been subject to volatility. Steel prices in particular have been on the rise since February, and are expected to continue the uptrend. Rising steel costs are predicted to a major headwind in 2018, impacting margins.Some better-ranked stocks in the same space are Enersys  , Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc.  and Cintas Corporation  .

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the Invesco S&P 500 BuyWrite ETF (Symbol: PBP), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $24.68 per unit.With PBP trading at a recent price near $21.45 per unit, that means that analysts see 15.05% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of PBP's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Cintas Corporation (Symbol: CTAS), Everest Re Group Ltd (Symbol: RE), and Quest Diagnostics, Inc. (Symbol: DGX). Although CTAS has traded at a recent price of $176.83/share, the average analyst target is 19.70% higher at $211.67/share. Similarly, RE has 15.80% upside from the recent share price of $213.83 if the average analyst target price of $247.62/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting DGX to reach a target price of $110.83/share, which is 15.37% above the recent price of $96.07. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of CTAS, RE, and DGX:Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
  
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Analysts Anticipate 15% Gains Ahead For PBP@2018-11-13@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/analysts-anticipate-15-gains-ahead-pbp-2018-11-13

Total operating profit (including financial services) increased to $1.06 billion from $0.8 billion reported in the year-ago quarter.Agriculture & Turf segment's sales were up 3% year over year to $5.6 billion, primarily driven by higher shipment volumes and price realization offset by an unfavorable currency-translation impact.

This segment reported operating profit of $295 million, up a whopping 243% year over year. The Wirtgen acquisition contributed operating profit of $79 million for the quarter. The above-mentioned factors that led to sales growth were instrumental in driving the improvement in operating profit.

 (NASDAQ: CTAS) is an incredible growth story. And with the stock down over 15% from its recent highs, it's worth a close look today. But once you do that, you'll see that the uniform expert is still rather expensive by historical standards. Here's why even a double-digit price drop isn't enough to make this growth stock a good deal.The first thing you need to understand when looking at a company like Cintas is that even great companies can be bad investments. That's  , the man who helped train Warren Buffett and who is generally considered the father of fundamental analysis. To paraphrase these master investors, price is what you pay and value is what you get. Overpay and you can lose money even if a company is executing well.Image source: Getty Images.That, indeed, is the risk today with Cintas, despite a huge drop in the stock price.  , with revenue up a massive 21% year over year, driven by an acquisition. Organic revenue growth was an impressive 7%. Earnings, meanwhile, were up nearly 70%, helped along by tax law changes and lower merger-related expenses. The company followed that up with  , with revenue and earnings up 5% and 30%, respectively.Cintas has clearly been doing pretty well lately, with its core business benefiting from a growing economy and its bottom line helped along by the current administration's tax law shifts. In fact, the company made sure to point out that it has grown revenue and net income in 47 of the past 49 years when it reported fiscal 2018 earnings. (The deep 2008 to 2009 recession was the only time when it didn't grow these two metrics.) Essentially, it's been doing pretty well for a very long time. Management, meanwhile, is increasingly positive about the future, too. When it reported fiscal first-quarter earnings, it also increased its full-year earnings guidance range to $7.19 to $7.29 per share, up from the range of $7.00 to $7.15 announced just three months earlier.There really is a lot to like about Cintas' business when you look at its financial results. But as Graham would warn, a good business isn't always a good investment. To put it simply, Wall Street is well aware of Cintas' success and has put a premium price on the stock. Such a high premium, in fact, that the recent double-digit pullback isn't enough to bring its valuations back to historical levels. data by  .For example, its  is currently around 22.5 compared to a five-year average of just under 19. Its  is around 5.7 compared to a longer-term average of 5.2. And its  is nearly 3 compared to an average of 2.4. On every one of these valuation measures, Cintas looks expensive today.That said, the company's current  of 23.8 is below the five-year average of just under 26.5. While that looks good on the surface, you need to take the number with a grain of salt. Recall the tax-law change benefits mentioned numerous times in the discussion above. In fiscal 2018 alone the tax reductions added a massive $1.59 per share to earnings. That boost skews this metric, suggesting that you should pay more attention to the valuation numbers cited in the previous paragraph -- all of which suggest that Cintas is expensive today.Cintas is a great company and investors know it. That's why it's priced at a premium today, a fact that remains true even after a big stock price decline. This is a company that you may want to have on your wish list, but it isn't one to chase today if you're looking for a bargain.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"eciding what to cook for dinner is a tough enough decision for most people, let alone thinking about what stock to buy and hold for the next 50 years. Yet adding the right companies to your portfolio today can ensure you'll have enough to eat decades down the road. To make the decision as easy as popping a TV dinner into the microwave, read on to see why  (NASDAQ: CTAS) ,  (NASDAQ: NFLX) , and  (NYSE: DIS) are three set-it-and-forget-it companies you should buy today.Image source: Getty Images. You might think there's no way a  500 company could ever be termed a ""growth stock,"" but uniform renter and business-services company Cintas, which squeaks in at No. 500 on the  500, has been growing by leaps and bounds over the past five years, with a share price that's increased more than 230%. into the company's first quarter of fiscal 2019, in which revenue rose 5.4% and net income grew an eye-popping 31.9% year over year, with adjusted EPS up 30.3% to a better-than-expected $1.93 per share. While these big earnings increases were largely due to lower tax rates, there's no denying that Cintas continues to grow and gain market share in a fragmented industry. The company's fastest-growing division, first aid and safety services -- which focuses on restocking first aid kits, fire extinguishers, and safety equipment -- saw organic growth of 9% over the year-ago quarter. The strong results caused the company to raise its 2019 guidance.Surprisingly, though, the market reacted by selling off shares, which have fallen some 15% since the earnings announcement nearly a month ago. This trend could simply represent profit-taking after the stock's incredible run, but the long-term trends of industry consolidation, population growth, and continued economic strength clearly benefit Cintas, the top dog in the domestic uniform rental industry. The nearly 100-year-old company has been able to maneuver into new service offerings as times have changed, and it's positioned to continue to fuel growth through new offerings for decades to come. This dip represents an excellent opportunity to pick up shares. Fifty years is an endless investing period, for all intents and purposes, but I really do believe Netflix will stick around for the very long haul. We're living in the early years of the history of a secular entertainment legend.What started as a simple DVD-by-mail subscription service made a sudden pivot into online video streaming, with a drastic turning point marked ""  "" in my old Netflix journals. That digital service started to expand across international borders, first slowly and then with a swift bang. This was another shock for many Netflix investors, who had expected the global expansion to proceed at a more leisurely pace.Right now, the company is  into the creation of original content. The old DVD-mailing specialist is becoming an award-winning production studio, complete with  and  . The cash costs are piling up, and many critics expect these negative cash flows to continue forever. (Spoiler alert:  .)Just as these abrupt swings caught most of us by surprise, it's hard to say where and how Netflix will make its next forceful strategy shift. What's fairly certain is that there will be more of those in the quarters, years, and decades ahead. And that's what it takes to keep your company healthy, relevant, and growing for an extremely long time.Netflix has proved that it's ready to change with the shifting sands of the entertainment industry at large -- and often lead the charge into the next new era. Sign me up for that ride, please. Disney is hitting some all-time highs, but that doesn't mean the king of entertainment and media should be considered for that set-and-forget part of your portfolio. It has ring-fenced many of its properties by interconnecting them into one another so that its movies link to its theme parks, which link to it marketing. Its broadcast TV channels are supported by the whole.Although not every part may perform equally well at the same time -- some of its television properties are still trying to reclaim their footing, for example, while its movie franchises largely operate like a well-oiled machine -- it's protected from any upheavals because of their diversity. There's also  it won't continue to do so.At just 17 times trailing earnings and 16 times this years estimates,  is cheap, particularly when you consider it also trades at only 15 times the free cash flow it produces. Now, that's not a rock-bottom valuation, but it is relatively inexpensive for a company the size of Disney. Coupled with analyst expectations that the $177 billion House of Mouse will grow its earnings 10% annually for the next five years, it's a cheap stock with excellent growth prospects that you should feel comfortable owning for at least the next five decades.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Netflix wasn't one of them!

" reported disappointing third-quarter 2018 results with both earnings and revenues missing estimates.The company's adjusted earnings in the reported quarter were 61 cents per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 63 cents. However, the bottom line recorded an increase of 13% from the year-ago figure of 54 cents.The company's sales in the reported quarter rose 0.6% year over year to $754.1 million. Top-line growth was partially offset by weaker-than-expected water heater sales in the United States and China. | However, the figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $804.25 million.A.O. Smith's sales in the  segment (comprising U.S. and Canadian water heaters and boilers) were relatively flat year over year at $486.9 million. The company's pricing actions on water heaters and boilers were offset by decline in volumes of water heaters in the United States. Water treatment products contributed about $9 million to revenues and boosted the segment's growth.Segmental operating earnings fell 4.3% year over year to $105.6 million. The decline was primarily attributable to lower sales of water heaters and higher steel and freight expenses, partially offset by pricing actions. Consequently, adjusted operating margin declined 100 basis points (bps) to 21.7%.Quarterly sales at the  segment (including China, India and Europe) were up 1.5% year over year to $274.1 million. The improvement came on the back of increase in sales of water treatment and air purification products in China. However, a decline in electric water heater sales dampened growth to some extent.Operating earnings at the segment climbed 16% year over year to $39.1 million in the quarter. The lower-than-expected costs related to incentive programs in China along with lower losses in India proved beneficial. Operating margin expanded 180 bps to 14.3%.During the first nine months of the year, A.O. Smith repurchased around 1.7 million shares for $106 million. At the end of the third quarter, the company had approximately 3.2 million shares remaining under the existing discretionary repurchase authority.Exiting the quarter on Sep 30, 2018, A.O.

"We are recommending a new bullish trade on  - a company you probably know best for providing work uniforms and laundry services for workers in the retail and dining industry groups.'Ironically, this ""boring"" company has been oversold like a tech stock during the market's correction, and we think this is an opportunity like the one we have been rolling over and over on  over the last few months.CTAS started selling off a little earlier than the rest of the market following earnings on Sept. 25. Like just about everything else this season, CTAS reported better top and bottom line numbers than the average analyst had expected.Shares still lost 4% following the report, which is hard to explain fully, but it was probably a combination of a souring market and a slightly less positive outlook than had been expected. Before the stock could bounce back, the broader selloff had commenced.There are a few reasons we like this position for our income focused portfolio:1. CTAS is tied closely to hiring in the services sector which is on a continued upswing right now. All those new employees need laundry and uniforms. Since the underlying fundamentals have remained consistent, we estimate the current price makes CTAS 20% undervalued.2. From a technical perspective, CTAS is at long-term support. The most significant pivot point over the last year is at $170, which is where the stock is currently bouncing. The stock had the bad luck to report earnings just as the market was starting to roll over, which led to its current oversold condition. The last three times the stock was in this position the subsequent rally was 50% or more.3. From a fundamental perspective, CTAS looks great. Top and bottom line trends are very positive, and more importantly, operating margins are rising fast. So far this quarter, investors have favored improving internal margins to justify higher prices over greater topline growth. We expect CTAS's fundamental performance to continue supporting an aggressive buyback program in the near term - especially as the stock has corrected so much since the last earnings report.4. Finally, the premium on the options is unusually large compared to similar circumstances in the past. This situation is probably a reaction to general market conditions, but it means the premium pays an effective 11% return for a holding period half the length of our usual horizon. That makes the risk/reward of this trade very compelling and it's rare to find that kind of return in what is usually a fairly slow-moving industry group.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Trade of the Day: Cintas Corporation (CTAS)@2018-10-31@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/trade-day-cintas-corporation-ctas-2018-10-31
 month has gone by since the last earnings report for Cintas (CTAS). Shares have lost about 16.3% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Cintas due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Cintas kept its earnings streak alive by delivering better-than-expected results for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 (ended Aug 31, 2018). It recorded earnings beat of 8.4% and sales beat of 0.7% in the quarter under review.The company's adjusted earnings in the reported quarter were $1.93 per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.78. On a year-over-year basis, the bottom line increased 30.4% from the year-ago tally of $1.48 on the back of healthy segmental business and lower tax expenses.It's worth noting here that adjusted earnings per share of $1.93 exclude adverse impacts of 4 cents of expenses related to G&K buyout, completed in March 2017.In the quarter under review, Cintas' net sales were $1,698 million, reflecting growth of 5.4% from the year-ago quarter. The improvement was driven primarily by organic sales growth of 5.2%.Further, the top line marginally exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,687 million.The company has two reportable segments - Uniform Rental and Facility Services, and First Aid and Safety Services. Other businesses, including Uniform Direct Sale and Fire Protection Services, are included in All Other. Quarterly sales data is briefly discussed below:Revenues from  segment (representing 81% of the reported quarter's net sales) were $1,374.9 million, increasing 4.8% year over year.

Long-term debt roughly remained stable, sequentially, at $2,535.9 million.In the reported quarter, the company generated net cash of $163 million from its operating activities, decreasing 35.9% from the year-ago tally. Capital expenditure totaled $64.5 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 3.2%. Fall in operating cash flow and rise in capital expenditure led to roughly 48.7% decline in free cash to $98.5 million.During the quarter under review, the company used repurchased shares worth $139.5 million.Cintas remains focused on increasing the number of businesses it serves, effectively integrating G&K Services assets and execution of its enterprise resource planning system.Driven by first-quarter performance, the company has increased projections for fiscal 2019. Revenues are now anticipated to be $6.80-$6.855 billion, above previously stated $6.75-$6.82 billion. The revised guidance reflects year-over-year growth of 5-5.8%. Organic sales for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment are estimated to grow in the quarters left in fiscal 2019.Earnings are predicted to be $7.19-$7.29 per share versus $7.00-$7.15 stated earlier. On a year-over-year basis, earnings per share represent growth of 21-22.7% from the previous fiscal. Moreover, the revised projection excludes impact of G&K integration expenses of $15-$20 million.Cash flow from operation in fiscal 2019 is anticipated to exceed fiscal 2018 figure. Moreover, capital expenditure for the fiscal will likely be $275-$300 million.In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates.At this time, Cintas has a nice Growth Score of B, however its Momentum Score is doing a bit better with an A. However, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Estimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. It comes with little surprise Cintas has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). We expect an above average return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the Invesco S&P 500 BuyWrite ETF (Symbol: PBP), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $24.52 per unit.With PBP trading at a recent price near $21.64 per unit, that means that analysts see 13.29% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of PBP's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST), Cintas Corporation (Symbol: CTAS), and Everest Re Group Ltd (Symbol: RE). Although FAST has traded at a recent price of $51.67/share, the average analyst target is 15.40% higher at $59.62/share. Similarly, CTAS has 15.21% upside from the recent share price of $187.13 if the average analyst target price of $215.60/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting RE to reach a target price of $249.86/share, which is 14.76% above the recent price of $217.73. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of FAST, CTAS, and RE:Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
  
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past.

"he strong U.S. economy has helped many businesses across the nation, especially those that rely on healthy local business conditions to drive demand for their services.  (NASDAQ: CTAS) has its success tied to the U.S. workforce, as its uniform rental and facilities services divisions both prosper when more workers have jobs and companies have to keep them safe. As the economy has improved,  , and its strategic vision has worked out well recently.Coming into Tuesday's fiscal first-quarter financial report, Cintas shareholders were hoping to see the company  . The uniform rental specialist mostly met those expectations, and as it starts a new fiscal year, Cintas has high hopes for the immediate future.Image source: Cintas.Cintas' fiscal first-quarter results kept up its positive momentum. Revenue rose by 5.4% to $1.70 billion, which was slightly better than most of those following the stock were looking to see. Net income fell 2% from year-ago levels to $212.5 million, due largely to a big one-time gain in the year-earlier period, but adjusted earnings of $1.93 per share came in well above the consensus forecast among investors for $1.81 per share.Fundamentally, Cintas saw success throughout its various divisions. Organic growth overall came in at 5.2%, with the uniform rental and facility services division seeing slightly slower growth of 4.9%. Meanwhile, the first-aid and safety services division saw even sharper gains, posting an organic growth rate of 9%.Income from continuing operations soared 32%, due largely to the positive impact of tax reform. Effective tax rates dropped by more than half during the quarter, from 26.5% a year ago to 12% during this year's period. That saved Cintas more than $29 million in the fiscal first quarter alone.One key to Cintas' improvement on its bottom line has been its attention to the expense side of the income statement. Gross margin for uniform rental and facility services fell very slightly, but better margin levels for first aid and safety services helped offset that downward pressure. Most importantly, overhead expense growth came in at a pace slower than sales gains, and a nearly 20% drop in interest expense shows the efforts Cintas has made to get its balance sheet as healthy as possible.CEO Scott Farmer was generally happy with the way Cintas is faring. ""We remain focused on integrating the G&K acquisition,"" Farmer said, ""continuing the implementation of our enterprise resource planning system and increasing the number of businesses we help get Ready for the Workday,"" referring to the company's slogan. The CEO has a lot of confidence that Cintas can keep moving forward effectively as well.This is not to say that Cintas can afford to put any less effort toward making progress. For instance, the company will keep incurring some costs toward integrating G&K. However, it's likely those expenses will be far less than what it paid in fiscal 2018 toward the merger, amounting to just a $0.04 per-share hit to its bottom line.Cintas responded to its strong performance by boosting its full-year fiscal 2019 guidance. The uniform rental specialist now sees revenue coming in between $6.8 billion and $6.855 billion, up $35 million to $50 million from its previous range. Earnings from continuing operations should be between $7.19 and $7.29 per share, which was between $0.14 and $0.19 per share higher than the guidance Cintas gave last quarter.However, Cintas investors didn't seem entirely pleased with the report, and the stock fell 3% in  Wednesday following the late-Tuesday announcement. Even with a slight pullback for the stock, though, Cintas looks like it's doing everything it needs to do in order to take full advantage of the strong U.S. economy for as long as the good times last.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

egendary investor Warren Buffett advises to be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful. One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.In trading on Thursday, shares of Cintas Corporation (Symbol: CTAS) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 29.5, after changing hands as low as $183.57 per share. By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) is 39.2.

t might seem tough to find high-growth stocks in an aging bull market. However, there are still attractive stocks in the cloud, online travel, and business services industries. Today, three of our Motley Fool contributors will share their favorite high-growth plays in those markets:  (NYSE: VEEV) ,  (NASDAQ: BKNG) , and  (NASDAQ: CTAS) . Veeva Systems provides cloud services for the healthcare industry. The Veeva Vault helps companies track industry regulations, clinical trials, and prescribing habits. The Veeva Commercial Cloud is a CRM (customer relationship management) platform that helps pharmaceutical companies manage their customer relationships.Image source: Getty Images.Veeva enjoys a first-mover's advantage in this niche section of the cloud market, and it serves over 600 customers -- including  ,  , and  . Veeva's growth is boosted by the competition between these companies, which all need access to real-time industry data.Veeva doesn't face much meaningful competition in this market, and it has strong ties to  , the world's top provider of enterprise CRM solutions. Its founder and CEO, Peter Gassner, was previously Salesforce's SVP of Technology, Veeva's CRM platform is powered by Salesforce1, and Veeva's services are integrated into Salesforce's Marketing and Service Clouds.Veeva's revenue rose 23% to $185 million last year, as its non-GAAP EPS grew 27%. Analysts expect its revenue and earnings to rise 23% and 59%, respectively, this year. Unlike many other high-growth cloud companies, Veeva is also consistently profitable on a GAAP basis.Veeva's stock looks pricey at nearly 60 times forward earnings, but that  by its market-leading position and strong growth. The healthcare cloud-computing market could still grow from $20.2 billion in 2017 to $35 billion by 2022, according to Research and Markets. This stock still has plenty of room to run. One of the greatest high-growth stocks of all time is Booking Holdings, with its extensive network of online travel websites. The company previously known as Priceline Group made a huge splash when it purchased Booking.com back in 2005, and the strategy behind the deal turned out to be sheer genius. To a greater extent than its rivals, Booking identified the need to go beyond the U.S. to offer the widest possible scope of international travel deals, and the first-mover advantage it captured still keeps competitors at bay. about the slowing growth that Booking Holdings has seen recently. For instance, in its most recent quarterly report, the online travel giant said that revenue grew 17% on a 15% rise in gross bookings, but key metrics like the growth rate in the number of hotel room-nights booked on the site slowed to just 12%. That might sound like a lot, but for those who are used to seeing the 20%-plus figures the company routinely posted just a year ago, it's cause for concern. However, one thing Booking Holdings almost always does is underestimate in its guidance how well it will do in the future. With so many things going for it, Booking Holdings has the capacity to keep growing even as it commands its industry.Image source: Getty Images. When you picture a high-growth company, you probably think of an up-and-coming Silicon Valley tech start-up. What you probably don't think about is a nearly 100-year-old business services company in the Midwest that's already a member of the Fortune 500. And yet, uniform renter Cintas, based in Cincinnati, Ohio, and founded during the Great Depression, has grown shareholders' investments  or  over the last five years.Cintas' savvy management team has pursued all of the usual avenues for growth: It has boosted organic revenue by taking market share from smaller competitors in the fragmented North American uniform rental market. It's gobbled up some of those competitors, too, like its recent acquisition of rival G&K Services. And it's used its flexible core business model of delivery truck routes to offer other services besides uniform rental, including floor mat rental, restroom restocking, first aid kit restocking, and fire and safety equipment services.However, even though Cintas' share price has grown more than 300% over the last five years, the company still has room to grow. Cintas is the largest player in the market, but that market is still very fragmented, giving Cintas numerous opportunities to take market share from -- or just acquire outright -- smaller competitors. Meanwhile, demand for Cintas' non-core services like fire and safety have been growing faster than its core uniform rental business's organic growth, offering valuable additional revenue streams.With unemployment low, businesses have more need than ever for all of Cintas' services. This unlikely growth stock should continue to soar.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Booking Holdings wasn't one of them!

Cintas' favorable Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), when combined with a positive Earnings ESP, predicts a likely earnings beat.Per our proven model, a stock needs to have a combination of a positive Earnings ESP, and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 or at least 3 (Hold), for a likely earnings beat.However, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Cintas will likely continue to achieve revenue build-up by increasing penetration levels for existing customers and broadening the consumer base. Also, product-portfolio solidification efforts will likely boost the company's aggregate revenues in the quarters ahead. Moreover, the acquisition of G&K Services Inc.

all Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Cintas (CTAS) reports results for the quarter ended August 2018. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on September 25. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the , it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.This uniform rental company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.78 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +20.3%.Revenues are expected to be $1.69 billion, up 4.7% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.17% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks  (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce  , and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).For Cintas, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +2.00%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Cintas will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Cintas would post earnings of $1.67 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.77, delivering a surprise of +5.99%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our  to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Cintas appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

intas (CTAS) came out with quarterly earnings of $1.93 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.78 per share. This compares to earnings of $1.48 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 8.43%.

This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.61 billion.

Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Cintas was mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see  .It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.72 on $1.69 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $7.09 on $6.81 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.

t might seem tough to find high-growth stocks in an aging bull market. However, there are still attractive stocks in the cloud, online travel, and business services industries. Today, three of our Motley Fool contributors will share their favorite high-growth plays in those markets:  (NYSE: VEEV) ,  (NASDAQ: BKNG) , and  (NASDAQ: CTAS) . Veeva Systems provides cloud services for the healthcare industry. The Veeva Vault helps companies track industry regulations, clinical trials, and prescribing habits. The Veeva Commercial Cloud is a CRM (customer relationship management) platform that helps pharmaceutical companies manage their customer relationships.Image source: Getty Images.Veeva enjoys a first-mover's advantage in this niche section of the cloud market, and it serves over 600 customers -- including  ,  , and  . Veeva's growth is boosted by the competition between these companies, which all need access to real-time industry data.Veeva doesn't face much meaningful competition in this market, and it has strong ties to  , the world's top provider of enterprise CRM solutions. Its founder and CEO, Peter Gassner, was previously Salesforce's SVP of Technology, Veeva's CRM platform is powered by Salesforce1, and Veeva's services are integrated into Salesforce's Marketing and Service Clouds.Veeva's revenue rose 23% to $185 million last year, as its non-GAAP EPS grew 27%. Analysts expect its revenue and earnings to rise 23% and 59%, respectively, this year. Unlike many other high-growth cloud companies, Veeva is also consistently profitable on a GAAP basis.Veeva's stock looks pricey at nearly 60 times forward earnings, but that  by its market-leading position and strong growth. The healthcare cloud-computing market could still grow from $20.2 billion in 2017 to $35 billion by 2022, according to Research and Markets. This stock still has plenty of room to run. One of the greatest high-growth stocks of all time is Booking Holdings, with its extensive network of online travel websites. The company previously known as Priceline Group made a huge splash when it purchased Booking.com back in 2005, and the strategy behind the deal turned out to be sheer genius. To a greater extent than its rivals, Booking identified the need to go beyond the U.S. to offer the widest possible scope of international travel deals, and the first-mover advantage it captured still keeps competitors at bay. about the slowing growth that Booking Holdings has seen recently. For instance, in its most recent quarterly report, the online travel giant said that revenue grew 17% on a 15% rise in gross bookings, but key metrics like the growth rate in the number of hotel room-nights booked on the site slowed to just 12%. That might sound like a lot, but for those who are used to seeing the 20%-plus figures the company routinely posted just a year ago, it's cause for concern. However, one thing Booking Holdings almost always does is underestimate in its guidance how well it will do in the future. With so many things going for it, Booking Holdings has the capacity to keep growing even as it commands its industry.Image source: Getty Images. When you picture a high-growth company, you probably think of an up-and-coming Silicon Valley tech start-up. What you probably don't think about is a nearly 100-year-old business services company in the Midwest that's already a member of the Fortune 500. And yet, uniform renter Cintas, based in Cincinnati, Ohio, and founded during the Great Depression, has grown shareholders' investments  or  over the last five years.Cintas' savvy management team has pursued all of the usual avenues for growth: It has boosted organic revenue by taking market share from smaller competitors in the fragmented North American uniform rental market. It's gobbled up some of those competitors, too, like its recent acquisition of rival G&K Services. And it's used its flexible core business model of delivery truck routes to offer other services besides uniform rental, including floor mat rental, restroom restocking, first aid kit restocking, and fire and safety equipment services.However, even though Cintas' share price has grown more than 300% over the last five years, the company still has room to grow. Cintas is the largest player in the market, but that market is still very fragmented, giving Cintas numerous opportunities to take market share from -- or just acquire outright -- smaller competitors. Meanwhile, demand for Cintas' non-core services like fire and safety have been growing faster than its core uniform rental business's organic growth, offering valuable additional revenue streams.With unemployment low, businesses have more need than ever for all of Cintas' services. This unlikely growth stock should continue to soar.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"The members of Foghat were hardly the first people to dream about making easy money. And the good news is, if you pick the  stocks for your portfolio, you can let your investments do the work for you, and maybe even make you filthy, stinkin' rich over time.Three stocks with outsized prospects for doing just that are uniform renter  (NASDAQ: CTAS) , oil and gas driller  (NYSE: APA) , and natural gas pipeline operator  (NYSE: KMI) . Here's why I recommend them.Image source: Getty Images.Cintas has been growing fast -- much faster than the broader market. In fact, its stock price has soared almost 350% over the last five years, outpacing the gains shares of hot tech stocks like  and  .The share pries gains were spurred by the company's numerous growth moves. It grew its uniform rental business organically, both by expanding into new markets and by taking market share from its competitors. It also made some savvy acquisitions of smaller rivals, including G&K Services in 2017. Finally, it leveraged its existing uniform rental routes -- vans that pick up soiled uniforms and drop off clean ones -- to offer additional services like floor mat rental, restroom restocking, and fire and safety equipment delivery. All of the supplies involved are easy for its delivery drivers to incorporate into their previously scheduled stops, adding incremental revenue to its relationships with established customers.Cintas' growth is showing no signs of slowing. In  , the company's operating income was up 49.7% year over year, thanks largely to the G&K acquisition. But organic revenues grew a respectable 5.1% too. The North American uniform rental market is still very fragmented, which gives Cintas additional opportunities to grow through acquisition.While Cintas can get oil out of a work uniform, driller Apache Corporation can get it out of the ground. And it does get a lot of oil and natural gas out of the ground through its drilling operations in the North Sea, Egypt, and -- most importantly -- the Permian Basin of West Texas.The Permian Basin is red hot right now, and in 2016, Apache found a way to capitalize on the region's potential without breaking the bank. It bought 307,000 acres of land there, and -- thanks to industry misconceptions about the region's hydrocarbon potential -- only paid about $1,300 per acre for it. It called the position, which is in the Delaware Basin sub-region -- ""Alpine High."" It also called it  , because after it announced that it had found more than 3 billion barrels of oil and 75 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in the play, land prices in the area skyrocketed. Last month,  purchased 10,000 acres of Delaware Basin land at $21,500 per acre -- more than 16 times what Apache paid for its position.Given the going rates for Permian Basin land, Apache's 307,000-acre position could fetch somewhere in the neighborhood of $6 billion to $9 billion if the company decided to sell. Yet the market is valuing the  at just $16.3 billion right now. And Apache won't be selling Alpine High anytime soon. Instead, it's building out infrastructure in the area, and ramping up production, which it expects to grow at a compounded annual rate of more than 150%. This company has a growth story that's far from over, so if you like the idea of getting rich on black gold, Apache may be right for your portfolio.Over the last five years, Cintas has outperformed the market handily, while Apache's and Kinder Morgan's shares are ripe for a turnaround. Data by  .One of the reasons Apache has been slow to ramp up production from Alpine High was the lack of energy infrastructure in the region. But our next company has energy infrastructure in spades. It's Kinder Morgan, which operates the largest natural gas pipeline network in the country.Kinder Morgan is benefiting from the natural gas boom in the U.S., which has been driven by shale fracking. Luckily for the company, that boom has coincided with increasing global demand for natural gas. The International Energy Agency forecasts demand will grow by more than 45% by 2040. Given all that, the pipeline industry will need to grow its capacity significantly.Fortunately, Kinder Morgan is all about growing its capacity -- it has about $7 billion in pipeline expansions underway, including  that already has almost all of its capacity spoken for by several clients (including, incidentally, Apache). In the coming years, it anticipates adding another $2 billion to $3 billion in growth projects per year.The company also recently boosted its dividend by 60%, plus it's paying down debt and buying back $2 billion in shares. But the stock price has been languishing in the high teens for the past year. This seems like an excellent time to snap up shares.When you invest in a top stock, you let your money do the work for you, which is a pretty easy way to generate wealth. Of course, ""easy"" money isn't ""free"" money: You not only have to make the initial investment, you have to keep an eye on them, and take the risk that things won't go as planned. Given their potential for growth, though, Cintas, Apache, and Kinder Morgan all offer excellent prospects to take you on the road to riches. And you don't even have to be a rock star.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

hareholders of Cintas Corporation (Symbol: CTAS) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 0.8% annualized dividend yield can sell the January 2019 covered call at the $220 strike and collect the premium based on the $6.00 bid, which annualizes to an additional 8.5% rate of return against the current stock price (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ), for a total of 9.3% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $220 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but CTAS shares would have to climb 3.8% from current levels for that to occur, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 6.6% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Cintas Corporation, looking at the dividend history chart for CTAS below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 0.8% annualized dividend yield.Below is a chart showing CTAS's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $220 strike highlighted in red:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2019 covered call at the $220 strike gives good reward for the risk of having given away the upside beyond $220.

"on't make the mistake of  .  has historically grown roughly 3% a year, quietly eroding the buying power of stagnant or slow-growth dividends. This is why you should consider mixing in a few companies with a history of rapid dividend growth into your portfolio of higher-yielding stocks. Here are three stocks that have increased dividends by 10%, over three times the historical rate of inflation growth, in 2018:  (NYSE: ETN) ,  (NYSE: AOS) , and  (NASDAQ: CTAS) .Eaton is a diversified industrial giant with a focus on helping companies make efficient use of energy. In February, it upped the dividend by 10%. That move marks nine consecutive years of annual increases. The yield is 3% today, a full percentage point higher than what you would get from an  index fund.Image source: Getty Images.Eaton has six divisions, electrical products (33% of second-quarter revenue), electrical systems and services (28%), hydraulics (13%), aerospace (8%), vehicle (16%), and e-mobility (about 2%). Although it has exposure to a lot of different industries, it says that roughly 80% of its key end markets are  of their cycles. So it is expecting ""solid market growth for several years.""The tiny e-mobility division, meanwhile, was only started up in the first quarter, is already inking deals, and  in annual revenue by 2030 -- which would put it on par with the hydraulics, aerospace, and vehicle divisions revenue-wise. That's a huge growth opportunity.Eaton's stock price has run up lately, following strong results. But if you are looking for a combination of yield and dividend growth, it is still worth a deep dive today.A.O. Smith's biggest business is making water heaters. That's not very exciting until you consider that two of its key growth markets are Asian giants China and India, where hot water is still a luxury for many. As the populations of these countries move up the socioeconomic ladder, one of the first things they buy is a water heater. To put some numbers on that, over the past decade Smith's revenue in China has expanded by 21% annually. India, meanwhile, is  for the company, but it expects its target market there to more than double in size between 2020 and 2030. There's a lot of opportunity here. data by  .That said, the stock has fallen roughly 12% from early-year highs,  . But if you look back over the last decade, that's a normal correction for the stock. Now might be a good time for a deep dive for growth-minded investors -- earnings have expanded at an incredible 26% a year since 2010 and the company's huge opportunities in Asia suggest the good news will keep coming.The yield is relatively low at 1.2%, but that's not surprising since Smith is really a growth stock. The exciting thing for dividend investors is that the dividend has expanded at an annualized rate of 17% a year over the past decade, more than five times the historical rate of inflation growth. Moreover, the dividend has been increased for 25 consecutive years. This year's increase, meanwhile, was an incredible 29%. If you're looking to add some growth to your dividend portfolio, A.O. Smith is a stock you should be considering today.Cintas' main business is renting out uniforms, which is the reason for that bad pun in the header (sorry about that). Like Smith, it is a growth stock. Earnings have grown at 13% a year over the past decade, driven by internal investments and acquisitions. The dividend, though, has expanded at a robust 15% a year over the past 10 years and has been increased for 35 consecutive years. The last dividend increase was 22%.That said, Cintas pays only one dividend a year, with the last dividend paid at the end of calendar year 2017. Yes, technically, that wasn't in 2018, but don't get hung up on that minor detail because the outlook for another big hike at the end of this year is strong. Fiscal 2018 earnings (the company's fiscal year ends in May) were up over 30%, helped along by the  . Fiscal 2019 earnings are projected to be up over 20%. So growth is still going strong, which is effectively what backs the company's long history of big dividend hikes. There's no reason to doubt that more good dividend news is to come. data by  .That said, Cintas is one to keep on your wishlist. The stock is up 35% so far this year and  , like the price-to-sales and price-to-earnings ratios. Its yield, however, is a puny 0.75% today. But with its strong history of growth, don't write Cintas off because it can add some valuable dividend growth to a portfolio filled with higher-yielding but slower-growing dividend payers. If the yield jumps above 1%, you should start looking more closely. If it spikes above 2%, like it did during the last recession, it would likely be a great buy.Eaton and A.O. Smith are both pretty compelling opportunities today when you consider their earnings and dividend growth outlooks. Eaton has the higher yield, but Smith's rapid dividend growth helps to make up for its lower yield -- especially now that it looks like the stock might be on sale. Both are worth deep dives today for investors trying to add a little dividend growth to their portfolios. Cintas, in the meantime, is a one of those names you keep on your wishlist, hoping for a market downturn to make it a buy. But you have to make sure to keep watching for that downturn or you may miss the opportunity.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Eaton wasn't one of them!

 (NASDAQ: CTAS) stock was up roughly 33% year to date through July. It's up 50% over the past year and 325% over the trailing five years. There's no question that Cintas has rewarded shareholders very well. But that's the past, and investing requires balancing cost and value as you look to the future. In the end, investors shouldn't get overly excited about the stock right now because it's looking pretty expensive. Here's why this great company's stock isn't a great buy at this moment.I have no doubt about the quality of Cintas as a company. Revenues have grown in 8 of the last 10 years, with earnings per share higher in 9 of those years. Over that 10-year span, revenues grew 70% and earnings more than 300%. (Note that fiscal 2018 earnings received a substantial one-time boost from the tax law changes. Pulling that gain out, the earnings-per-share increase was closer to 250%, still a huge number.) And all of that from a company that makes most of its money from the boring business of renting out uniforms.Image source: Getty Images.Financially speaking, the company is fairly strong, too. Long-term debt is roughly 45% of the capital structure, not an unreasonable number for a business that's spread across 1 million customers. However, leverage is higher than it was a couple of years ago when long-term debt was closer to 35% of the capital structure.  in fiscal 2017 for $2.2 billion, including debt. Cintas is already working to return its debt levels to more historic levels, though, reducing its long-term debt by nearly 9% in fiscal 2018. Looking at the shorter end of things, a  of 2.5 times leaves little concern about the company's ability to cover its near-term bills. In addition, the company has amassed an impressive dividend record. It has increased its dividend every year for 25 consecutive years. The annualized increase over the past decade was an incredible 15%. That's roughly five times the 3%  .Looking ahead, Cintas is expecting revenue to grow around 5% in fiscal 2019, with earnings advancing as much as 25% when you take out the impact of the tax law changes. (Earnings growth will only be in the low single digits if you don't adjust for the tax impact.) The main driving force will be the benefit from the ongoing integration of the G&K acquisition. And I am highly confident that Cintas will extend its annual dividend streak to 36 years.As for the longer term, the company notes that its roughly 1 million customers account for just 6% or so of the addressable North American market. There's no reason to believe that Cintas can't keep gaining share via organic expansion and through bolt-on acquisitions like the recent G&K purchase. The outlook for Cintas as a company is quite bright.So Cintas is really hitting on all cylinders and has been for a very long time. It is a great company with a solid outlook. But great companies aren't always great investments because, usually, everyone knows they are great. That's the problem here. data by Cintas' trailing  is currently around 27, which is higher than its five-year average PE of 22. Its forward PE is roughly 28, even higher than its trailing PE. To be fair, the current earnings picture is a bit distorted by the tax law change. However, PE isn't the only metric that suggests that Cintas appears to be expensive today. For example, the current  of 7.3 times is well above the company's five-year average of 4.8 times. data by  .And the valuation concerns don't stop there. Cintas'  of roughly 3.5 is also well above its five-year average of 2.3. And  from operations per share of 23.5 is notably above the company's five-year median of 18. Meanwhile, the dividend yield, at just 0.8%, is the lowest it has been in 10 years.The only reprieve is the company's  , which is roughly equal to its five-year average of 1.9. This valuation metric measures valuation in relation to growth potential but suggests that, at best, investors are paying full price for Cintas relative to its growth prospects. However, when combined with the PE, PB, PS, and price-to-cash flow metrics above, Cintas is clearly looking pretty expensive. In other words, this is a great company, everyone knows it, and investors have bid it up accordingly.Cintas' history is clearly impressive. It also appears to have a solid future ahead. It is a great company. But that's no secret on Wall Street, and investors have bid the shares up to the point that they look overpriced. This is a great company that isn't a great investment right now because the stock has been priced for perfection. You may want to put Cintas on your wish list (it's on mine), but I wouldn't put it on my buy list today.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"ot everyone wants to be an investor who is constantly reading  and calculating their next stock buy. Some just want to own low-stress portfolios that will stand the test of time and only need to be checked periodically. Considering how much people's emotions are the biggest deterrent to investor returns, most of us would likely benefit from this strategy.Building a portfolio that is the financial equivalent of one of those ""set it and forget it"" ovens from the '90s means you have to have different selection criteria. You have to find businesses with wide economic moats and management teams that have proven themselves to be good stewards of shareholder capital. Three stocks that fit the bill are communications infrastructure real estate investment trust (REIT)  (NYSE: AMT) , trash collector  (NYSE: WM) , and uniform rental company  (NASDAQ: CTAS) . Here's why they stand out as stocks you can safely own for a decade or more.Image source: Getty Images.Wireless communication becomes further entrenched in our lives every day. I don't just mean people in the U.S., either. The penetration of cell phones and smartphones is still growing rapidly around the world. As a result, data consumption continues to grow at a breakneck pace. Meeting the demand for all this data transmission means companies need to have more and more broadcast equipment to handle the traffic, and that means more and more equipment on structures like cell towers and rooftop spires.This is where American Tower fits into the puzzle. The REIT is one of the world's largest owners of towers and other structures designed to hold telecommunications equipment, which telecom companies rent space on. For telecom companies, it's beneficial because they don't have to lay out the capital to build the tower or buy land. And American Tower can lease space to multiple clients on the same structure. This has been a very lucrative arrangement thus far, as the company has grown funds from operations (the figure REITs commonly use to report bottom-line results) by 16% annually over the past decade.American Tower has two major growth catalysts it can ride for the next decade or more: the shift to 5G wireless networks and global growth in the industry. Of the company's 170,000 or so communication sites, only 40,000 of them are in the U.S. Management is investing heavily in fast-growing markets such as India and Nigeria, where wireless data usage is up 235% and 738%, respectively, since 2010. Also, as more mature wireless networks like the one in the U.S. start the commercial rollout of 5G, it's likely going to mean telecom companies  . Combined, these two trends should give American Tower an incredibly long growth runway.Waste handling in the U.S. has to be one of the highest barriers-to-entry industries out there. The capital requirements and the political and regulatory hurdles mean that anyone trying to enter this market is in for a Sisyphean challenge. For those that are already established in this business, though, it is essentially a license to print cash from the stuff in people's garbage bins.Without a lot of competition and near-geographic monopolies in the markets it operates, Waste Management has  for its waste-collection services and tipping fees for third parties to use its landfills. Since the company isn't opening new landfills every day, the ability to increase prices is essential to revenue growth.Calling Waste Management's revenue growth modest is a generous statement. So keeping costs under control and generating high rates of return are critical for Waste Management's success. Fortunately, management has delivered on that end. The company has maintained high returns on equity over the past decade that have translated into impressive stock gains and dividend increases.Looking out over the next decade, there aren't a lot of significant threats to Waste Management's business. It's really hard to change human habits like consumption and waste, and we haven't arrived at a point at which all of our products can be manufactured from biodegradable materials. Without a significant threat to its business on the horizon, Waste Management should be able to crank out decades of earnings and cash for investors. data by Just about every hot tech company wants to have an ""X-as-a-service"" business model because it provides a recurring revenue stream and relatively high margins. Cintas has been employing that same business model for close to a century; it just calls it uniform rentals -- which, surprisingly, is an incredibly durable business.Companies like uniforms, but they hate the laundry. In most instances, it doesn't make much financial sense for a company to have an on-site uniform laundry, which is perfect for Cintas, as it can consolidate uniform services of several businesses in a single facility. Cintas has leveraged its network of central facilities and distribution network to branch out into other office services such as providing safety and security equipment and commercial and industrial cleaning services. These services tend to have surprisingly high margins --  -- and revenue tends to be steady as it obtains new clients and expands its service offerings to each client.Equally impressive is management's ability to take this business and make it an extremely shareholder-friendly stock. It produces loads of cash flow that management has used to acquire competitors, buy back stock, and grow its dividend.The threats to Cintas' business are anything that translates to fewer people requiring Cintas' services, whether that be rising unemployment rates or automation replacing humans in many everyday jobs. These are real threats, but it will still be several years before they make a significant impact on the bottom line at this company.

h, how the mighty have fallen! And, in the case of venerable industrial conglomerate  (NYSE: GE) , fallen and fallen and fallen some more.Shares fell last year when new CEO John Flannery was appointed, fell further when he announced a dividend cut, and even fell again after a gloomy Q2 2018 earnings report. Shares are now down about 25% for the year...and that's on top of 2017's 44.5% price drop.But with the company's stock price now just above a seemingly dirt cheap $13/share, many analysts are wondering if it's time to jump back into GE to capitalize on a potential turnaround. Some have cited Flannery's tenure with the company -- especially in winning divisions and markets -- as a reason for optimism; others point out how far the stock price has fallen.But if those are your criteria, I think you'll be better off ignoring GE and picking up shares of  (NYSE: APA) ,  (NYSE: MMM) , or  (NASDAQ: CTAS) instead. Here's what these three companies have that GE doesn't.Is buying GE now a bright idea? Or will it just lead to underperformance? Image source: Getty Images.Another company whose share price has fallen throughout 2017 and during much of 2018 is independent oil and gas exploration and production company Apache Corporation. Like sales numbers in some of GE's industrial divisions, Apache's production numbers were falling. Unlike GE, though, Apache seems to have a very clear path to production growth.One thing GE hasn't been able to really explain is how it will significantly grow its revenue once it sells off the divisions it's planning to dump.  in its power division are due to persistent market trends, and that outlook seems to be worsening as opposed to getting better. Even if the company's powerhouse aviation and healthcare units outperform handsomely, power is likely to be a drag on the company's bottom line.On the other hand, Apache's primary product -- oil -- is currently enjoying high demand and big margins thanks to high energy prices. As the company ramps up production at its promising Alpine High play in the red-hot Permian Basin,  to be pumping more and more black gold through 2020. The company recently revised its production guidance upward, and at Alpine High expects a compounded annual production growth rate of more than 150% from 2017 through 2020.Unlike GE, Apache has outlined a clear and actionable plan for growth, and as such looks like a better investment.The 56-year-old Flannery stepped into the corner office from his prior role as head of GE's healthcare division. Before that, he's held various positions within the company, including CEO and Chairman of GE India, and head of business development for GE. He's been with the company since 1987.I think Flannery has been doing the best he can with the bad hand he's been dealt, but that doesn't change the fact that it's a bad hand. However, there's another large company with a new CEO who's in his late 50s and started with his company back in the late '80s, who -- also like Flannery -- led one of his company's major divisions, and before that, its operations in an Asian country. And that CEO has been dealt a decidedly better hand.Meet 58-year-old Michael Roman, the new (as of July 1) CEO of materials science company 3M. Roman has worked at the company since 1988, and during his time with the company has led its industrial business group and 3M Korea. Despite the CEOs' similarities, though, the companies' performance is quite different: 3M just  and an upgraded earnings outlook in its second quarter.Although 3M's stock has underperformed the market so far in 2018, the pullback offers an opportunity to buy a growing company that seems to be in much better shape than GE.Rather than investing in a stagnant company on the hopes of future growth, why not invest in a company that's already growing by leaps and bounds? A company like uniform renter Cintas. A comparison of Cintas' and GE's revenue, EPS, and share prices over the last five years shows there really isn't much of a comparison: data by And Cintas continues to grow. In its recently completed fourth quarter of FY 2018, the company  for both revenue and EPS. It's predicting further growth in FY 2019, and management believes the company can move up the ranks of the Fortune 500, which Cintas entered for the first time this year (it's currently sitting in the #500 slot).Growth now vs. possible growth later? I'll take the former.Of course, nobody knows what's around the corner for any of these four companies. An unforeseen problem could cause Apache, 3M, or Cintas to underperform, just as some sort of radical turnaround, impressive acquisition or, frankly, a miracle could cause GE to outperform. And GE may indeed return to growth in 2019, but it's likely to be a long, hard slog until it gets there. And it seems more likely that GE will encounter headwinds than tailwinds on the way.Which is why, for smart investors, Apache, 3M, and Cintas are much more sensible choices for your portfolio.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"n recent trading, shares of Cintas Corporation (Symbol: CTAS) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $198.80, changing hands for $203.57/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 5 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Cintas Corporation, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $164.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $225.00. The standard deviation is $25.684.But the whole reason to look at the  CTAS price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with CTAS crossing above that average target price of $198.80/share, investors in CTAS have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $198.80 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

"Image source: The Motley Fool. (NASDAQ: CTAS)Q4 2018 Jul. 19, 2018 Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Cintas quarterly earnings results conference call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mike Hansen, executive vice president and chief financial officer. Sir, please go ahead. -- Good evening. Thank you for joining us tonight. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas' vice president and treasurer. We will discuss our fourth-quarter results for fiscal 2018.After our commentary, we'll be happy to answer any questions.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Cintas wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. to learn about these picks!The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.Our revenue for the fourth quarter, which ended May 31, was $1,670,000,000, an increase of 9.1% over last year's fourth quarter. The organic revenue growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 5.1%.The organic revenue growth rate for the uniform rental and facility services segment was 5.3%, and the organic growth rate for the first aid and safety services segment was 9.4%.Note that the lower rate of organic revenue growth for the uniform rental and facility services segment was expected and as we have previously communicated, was due to the inclusion for the first time of the acquired G&K Services business and organic as opposed to inorganic revenue.Reported operating income for the fourth quarter was $265 million, compared to $177 million in last year's fourth quarter. Operating income was reduced $15 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '18 and $63 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '17 by transaction and integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition. Excluding these items, our fourth-quarter operating income grew 16.4%, resulting in an operating margin of 16.8%, compared to 15.8% last year.In March, we gave fourth-quarter EPS guidance in the range of $1.64 to $1.69. That excluded G&K integration expenses, and it assumed an effective tax rate of 24%. Against this guidance, fourth-quarter EPS was $1.77.Our tax rate was slightly better than the guided 24%, and this resulted in a benefit of $0.04. The remaining beat of guidance was primarily due to higher revenue than expected.We're pleased with these fourth-quarter results and our full-year performance. Our fiscal '18 results extended our record of success. We have now grown revenue and profit 47 of the past 49 years with the only exception being the two years of the Great Recession.For the eighth consecutive year, organic growth was in the mid- to high-single-digit range, and we continue to grow revenue by multiples greater than both gross domestic product and employment.Strong execution on the fundamentals is a hallmark of Cintas but fiscal '18's achievement was especially noteworthy given that it occurred in a period of extreme change management. While delivering solid returns to shareholders in 2018, we also made significant progress on two important investments, G&K, and SAP.The first year of the integration of the largest acquisition in Cintas history required the expertise of every part of the organization, including sales, production, service, global supply chain, IT, engineering, HR, and finance. Very important tasks included winning the hearts and minds of acquired employees, whom we call partners, and earning the trust of acquired customers through our outstanding service.Our partners ran our acquisition playbook and effectively adjusted where necessary. We have now closed nearly all operations necessary to eliminate redundancies, which is 63 operations to date.All G&K locations, 148 in total, have been converted to Cintas operating systems. About 1,500 G&K trucks have been painted and rebranded as Cintas. Important integration work still remains for fiscal 2019 but after our first year of integration efforts, we are still on track for the achievement of our synergy commitments.When we acquired G&K less than 18 months ago, our debt to EBITDA ratio rose to about 3.1 times. Our commitment was to return our leverage to a target of about 2 times in three years. We are now there and are thrilled to have delivered on this commitment well ahead of expectations.Fiscal '18 was also a year of tremendous technological change. In addition to moving G&K locations to Cintas systems, we continue to convert our operating system from a homegrown system to that of SAP. And information system conversion is like an acquisition integration in that it requires the involvement of experts from all departments of the company, including operations, sales, and corporate support.The conversion of each operation to SAP is an eight-month process. Our employees are coached on change management. Data standardization activities are performed. Garments are scanned and inventoried, and employees are trained and certified.Customers are notified of changes to invoice appearance and introduced to improvements in doing business with us because of the technology enhancements.Training and care continue for two months following the go-live date of the new system. A total of 108 operations have now been converted to date, which is about 34% of the total planned.Looking ahead, fiscal 2019 will share some similarities with fiscal '18. We will continue to integrate G&K and realize more of the $130 million to $140 million in anticipated annual synergies.We expect to realize $90 million to $95 million in synergies in fiscal 2019 or $32 million to $37 million in incremental synergies. In addition, efforts will continue to convert more operations to the new SAP ERP system.Like fiscal '18, inefficiencies will exist as our partners make further progress on acquisition integration and system implementations while executing on the day-to-day for our customers.However, we expect to extend our streak of profitable growth to 48 out of the past 50 years. We will accomplish that via the solid execution our shareholders have come to expect.One important area in which fiscal '19 will differ from fiscal '18 is in capital allocation. With $600 million of acquisition debt repaid and our leverage target achieved, we returned to our historical priorities for deployment of cash, which are CAPEX, acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases.We are honored to have been recently included in the Fortune 500 as No. 500. As our CEO, Scott Farmer, has stated, this accomplishment is built on our strong sense of culture, principles and values and reflects our strong financial growth, expanding the line of products and services and innovative technologies. It's a testament to the hard work and dedication of our employee partners.We're not satisfied with being No. 500, though, and our continued progression higher into that ranking starts in fiscal '19. Our expectations for fiscal '19 are for annual revenue to be in the range of $6,750 billion to $6,820 billion.I stated earlier that in our fourth quarter of fiscal '18, we lap the one year anniversary of the acquisition of G&K. For the first time, G&K's revenue was organic as opposed to inorganic. This resulted in a lower organic growth rate due to the combination of a strongly growing Cintas legacy business and a significantly sized G&K business that historically grew slower than Cintas.We expect this lower organic growth rate to be temporary just as it was for our first aid and safety segment after it acquired ZEE Medical. With continued investment in selling resources, we expect the total uniform rental and facility services organic growth rate to hit bottom in the first quarter and then strengthen as we move through fiscal '19.We expect fiscal '19 EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $7 to $7.15. Let me make a few comments about this EPS guidance. It assumes an effective tax rate of 21.7%. Keep in mind that this tax rate can move up or down from quarter to quarter based on discrete events, including the number of stock compensation benefits.The guidance assumes a diluted share count for computing EPS of 114 million shares. It does not assume any G&K integration expenses. However, we do expect to incur these in the range of $15 million to $20 million in fiscal '19. The guidance does include the impact of a change to our Cintas partner retirement policy in which the retirement age and tenure requirements were reduced.This change results in a shorter time period over which future stock-based compensation grants will be amortized. It is a non-cash impact, and it is expected to increase stock-based compensation expense by roughly $20 million in fiscal '19.And lastly, the guidance also includes the impact of the adoption of the Accounting Standard Update 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers. With the adoption, we expect the following. Fiscal '19 revenue will be negatively affected by roughly $8 million along with the loss of the incremental operating margin associated with that revenue.SG&A, however, will benefit from the capitalization of sales rep commission payments and the subsequent amortization of those commissions over the expected service period of our contracts. This is also a non-cash impact, and we expect the net benefit to be roughly $16 million to $19 million.Overall, these last two non-cash items included in guidance will both be recorded in SG&A and generally will offset each other to have only a minor negative impact.Before I turn the call over to Paul, I'd like to say thank you to Phillip Holloman, who is retiring from Cintas this month. Phillip has been with Cintas for 22 years and has been our president and chief operating officer for the past 10 years.In our press release last month in which Scott Farmer thanked Phillip for his many contributions, Scott said, those of us who have had the privilege of working with Phillip know that Cintas is a better company because of him, and he will be missed. Thanks again, Phillip.Phillip's retirement has led to several other leadership changes at Cintas. Scott Farmer announced the promotion of Todd Schneider to the position of executive vice president and chief operating officer with the responsibility of leading all of our business divisions.Todd has been with Cintas for 29 years and has been our rental division president and chief operating officer for the last five years, leading our largest business through a very successful period and most notably, leading us through the integration of G&K.Scott also announced the promotion of Mike Thompson to the position of executive vice president and chief administration officer. Mike has been with Cintas for 24 years and has been Cintas' chief information officer for the last five years, most notably leading us through our SAP conversion.Mike will continue to lead our IT efforts and will also be responsible for our global supply chain and our safety and engineering groups. These changes are part of our normal succession planning process, and as we move into our fiscal '19 year, we remain as excited as ever about the future of Cintas.I'll now turn the call over to Paul. -- Thank you, Mike. First, please note that our fiscal fourth quarter contained the same number of workdays as the prior year fourth quarter. Looking ahead, there will be no workday differences next year as each quarter of fiscal '19 contains the same number of workdays as the comparable quarter of fiscal '18.We have two reportable operating segments, uniform rental and facility services and first aid and safety services. The remainder of our business is included in all other. All other consists of fire protection services and our uniform direct-sale business. First aid and safety services and all other are combined and presented as other services on the income statement.The uniform rental and facility services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route.Uniform rental and facility services revenue was $1,342,000,000, an increase of 10.1% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes, the organic growth rate was 5.3%.As Mike stated, the organic growth rate was negatively impacted by the inclusion of G&K and organic as opposed to inorganic revenue for the first time. We expect the organic growth rate to hit bottom in the first quarter of fiscal '19 and strengthen as we move through the fiscal year.Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 45% for the fourth quarter, compared to 44.6% in last year's fourth quarter, an increase of 40 basis points.While we continue to experience the inefficiencies that are customary with an acquisition integration and an ERP system implementation, we are realizing the expected cost synergies, which are benefiting our margins. These synergies plus better-than-expected revenue also enabled us to overcome an almost-20-basis-point increase in energy expenses.Our first aid and safety services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the fourth quarter was $147 million, which was 9.9% higher than last year's fourth quarter. On an organic basis, the growth rate for this segment was 9.4%.This segment's gross margin was 47% in the fourth quarter, compared to 44.5% in last year's fourth quarter, an increase of 250 basis points. The significant amount of margin expansion was fueled in large part due to the realization of synergies from the ZEE Medical acquisition. With the synergies now realized in full, we expect margin expansion to continue in fiscal '19 but at a normalized rate.The fourth quarter was another outstanding quarter for this segment. Organic growth continued to be strong and was benefited by penetration of existing customers and national account wins.The solid revenue growth plus expanding gross margins are evidence of the value businesses place on having Cintas manage their first aid safety and training programs to help keep their employees healthy and safe. The future of the first aid business segment remains bright.Our fire protection services and uniform direct-sale businesses are reported in the ""all other"" category. The uniform direct-sale business long-term growth rates are generally low single digits and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multimillion-dollar account. Our fire business, however, continues to grow each year at a strong pace.All Other revenue was $179 million, an increase of 1.8% compared to last year's fourth quarter. The organic growth rate was 0.2%. The fire business organic revenue growth rate was double digits.However, the strong performance was offset by a difficult revenue comparison for the uniform-direct sale business. In last year's fourth quarter, uniform direct-sale revenue included the rollouts of new uniform styles for the pilots and flight attendants of Southwest Airlines.Large rollouts such as these do not repeat each year as businesses typically rebrand every three to five years. The benefit from Southwest last year was a headwind of about $13 million to this year's fourth-quarter revenue.All Other gross margin was 43.6% for the fourth quarter of this fiscal year, compared to 42.8% for last year's fourth quarter, an increase of 80 basis points. All Other gross margin expansion was driven by the fire business.Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 28.3% in the fourth quarter, compared to 28.6% in last year's fourth quarter. SG&A benefited from favorable workers' compensation claims experience. In addition, we are getting leverage from increased revenue covering fixed costs.Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the fourth quarter benefited from the new U.S. tax legislation. The effective tax rate, excluding G&K integration expenses, was 22.1%.Our EPS guidance for fiscal 2019 assumes an effective tax rate of 21.7%. Note that the effective tax rate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to discrete items, including the number of stock compensation benefits in each period.Our cash and equivalents balance as of May 31 was $138 million. Free cash flow in fiscal '18 was $692 million, an increase of $201 million, or 41%, from the prior-year period.Capital expenditures for fiscal '18 were $271 million. Our capex by operating segment for the year was as follows: $225 million in uniform rental and facility services, $28 million in first aid and safety, and $18 million in all other. We expect fiscal '19 capex to be in the range of $290 million to $320 million.In the fourth quarter of fiscal '18, we repatriated about $110 million of international cash. We used the funds to pay down debts and to buy back stock. In the quarter, we purchased about $90 million in Cintas stock, and $410 million remaining on the share-buyback authorization approved by the board of directors. As of May 31, total debt was $2,535 million.On May 31, our leverage was 2.1 times debt to EBITDA.As Mike stated earlier, when we acquired G&K less than 18 months ago, we committed to return our leverage to a target of about 2 times in three years. We are pleased to have delivered on this commitment well ahead of expectations. We are excited to have returned to our historical priorities for deployment of cash, which are capex, acquisitions, dividend payments, and share repurchases.That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions.Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie Capital. -- Good afternoon. Thank you. The first question is just on consolidation in the space broadly. I know you've sort of outlined cost synergies.There's been another uniform deal in the space. Could you maybe touch on the revenue side? Do you expect pricing to get better in the space post-consolidation? I realize it's a local business, so there may be some nuances there. So maybe if you could just touch on that and then how to think about G&K revenue synergies? -- Sure. So from the standpoint of pricing, the pricing environment, I would say, hasn't changed much in the last 90 days since we spoke last. And quite honestly, I don't expect that the consolidation that has happened will have much of an impact on the pricing environment. It's still a very competitive environment.We face legacy like competition as well as other catalog type competitors, and so that's not going away. So I don't think that's going to have much of an impact on the pricing environment. From the standpoint of the revenue synergies, we're moving cautiously as we have as we've talked about in the past but we have begun to introduce some of the products where we can, where we have converted systems or where we have integrated routes into Cintas locations.And while it's early, and we haven't seen any notable impact, it's anecdotally positive so far. So I would say, as we continue to move through this year, we've got a lot of integration activity left, and we're going to continue to introduce Cintas products and services to those customers but I would not expect much of an impact at this point in time. -- OK. And then just on the SAP, I know you sort of gave color on the integration of the SAP and timeline but maybe you're not ready quantitatively but qualitatively, once SAP is implemented, should we expect that 28% of sales SG&A run rate to come down materially? Or how are you thinking about sort of benefits of SAP maybe just qualitatively if you want to address that? -- Yes. I think we'll see once we get through that implementation effort, which we expect to be by the end of fiscal '20. We do expect some expenses to roll off, certainly, those that are part of the integration and implementation effort. So we will certainly see some benefit from that in fiscal '21 but more than anything from that system, we like the information and the power of that information.And we're not necessarily looking for a significant cost reduction. What we are looking for is more opportunity to make our selling team more productive.So how can we create warmer leads with better information? How can we use that information to be more directive in the way we approach our customers with our various products and services? So we're not looking necessarily for a significant SG&A reduction. We really want to help our selling partners become more efficient. -- OK. Just a follow-up. I'll turn it over. Any updated thoughts on the tariffs and how that impacts you either directly or indirectly through customer demand? -- From a direct standpoint, we certainly have some impact like hangers but overall, it has not been significant. From an indirect standpoint, and when I say indirect, I mean from our vendors, it remains to be seen how they will be impacted and how that might, in turn, impact us. We're certainly keeping our eyes on that but we need a little bit more time for that to play out. From a customer perspective, too early to see much of an impact. -- OK, thank you.Thank you. Our next question will come from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. -- Hi, good afternoon, guys. -- Hi, Toni. -- So you mentioned a couple of times now you've hit your gross leverage target in this quarter. Your capital priorities are returning to historical ones. How should we think about the level of share repurchases this year or if you want to just talk directionally as sort of what the algorithm would be in that? And then also just with tax reform, how should we expect 5 times above the historical average that you've been running at? -- Well, as Paul mentioned, capex is very important to us, and we will make sure we spend and invest in the business. We also will likely be more aggressive than we were in the last two fiscal years in acquisition activity. From the standpoint of share repurchases, we have a $500,000 authorization where $410 million is remaining. And I would say that we're going to continue to do what we have done in the past, and that is opportunistic about the way we use that.And so I'm not ready to say whether that will increase where we have historically been but I would say our expectation is to get back to something of that historical type of environment. -- Terrific. And I know it might be difficult to parse this out but could you give us some color on what kind of G&K growth is incorporated into the '19 guidance? -- That is very difficult to parse out. And you may have noticed when we gave guidance, we didn't include any specific G&K information because it's pretty difficult to take the business that is so comingled into our legacy business but if you kind of think about the revenue guidance and you just make an assumption that it's flattish, that opening guidance is pretty much in the range of that 5 to 6.5 where we've been in the last few years. So we think that's right where we want to be. We believe that's kind of our sweet spot as we opened the year and feel good about it moving into this first quarter. -- That's helpful. And just lastly, historically in the fourth quarter, you've given revenue growth by product within the uniform business. Is that something that you'd be able to provide for us today? -- Yes, Toni. We do have that, and this is the mix of the uniform rental and facility services segment. The uniform rental was 50%. Dust control is 17%.Hygiene is 14%. Shop towels are 5%. Linen is 10%, and then catalog revenue was 4%. -- Thanks so much.Thank you. Our next question will come from George Tong with Piper Jaffray. -- Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. You've indicated that, over time, G&K's revenue growth can approach Cintas' historical revenue growth in the uniform rentals business. Can you think of any potential structural barriers that might prevent G&K organic growth from reaching your historical levels? And maybe talk a little bit about the initiatives you have in place to improve G&K's growth outlook over the near to intermediate term. -- I don't see any roadblocks. And George, as we move into this year, it's hard to think about that business as being separate at all. So many of the locations have been absorbed into legacy Cintas locations or have traded volume. So it's really hard to look at it separately.However, as we were working through the integration of last year, one of the biggest pieces was coming out of the closing of that deal. We had a sales team at G&K that had a tough environment, and we wanted to pull them out of their positions so that we can train them, get them to understand our systems, our products and services. There certainly were open positions that we had to fill, and that has gone very well but as we've talked about in the last several quarters in our business when you lose that new business momentum for a number of quarters, it takes a little bit of time to reverse that trend. We have done a very good job of training our new salespeople.We have seen the productivity tick up slightly each quarter throughout fiscal '18.And so the thing that will get us back to the Cintas-like levels of growth will be a combination of those sales partners being more and more productive and our ability to penetrate the G&K customers like we do with all of our other Cintas customers. So as we mentioned, we expect our first-quarter organic growth to be somewhat similar, maybe slightly lower than what we reported here in this fourth quarter for our rental business but we expect to see some improvement as we then go through the year to the point where fiscal '20, I would expect, we'd be back to our historical like levels, barring any change in the macro environment. -- Got it. That's very helpful. And then on the topic of revenue synergies and cross-selling, I know it's still very early days but can you provide a progress report on how cross-selling initiatives are progressing? And what, in your view, is the longer-term revenue opportunity from bundling? -- And I'll speak to our total business now, not just G&K but we have opportunities. When we first sell a new account, we don't normally sell everything. And so we continue to look for ways and opportunities for our drivers, who we call SSRs or service sales reps.Our SSRs and our salespeople, we look for opportunities for them to penetrate existing customers. And we're getting better at that but we can always improve and especially when it comes to getting First Aid and Safety and fire into our uniform and facility services customers. So we're continuing to work on ways to improve the efficiency there or while we are waiting for SAP to come. And once we get SAP, we do believe that that will make the visibility for all of our people better, and this should allow us to improve that penetration even more. -- Very helpful. Thank you.Thank you. Our next question will come from Manav Patnaik with Barclays Capital. -- Hi. This is actually Greg dialing in. First, just wanted to hit on the G&K guided synergies. Can you talk to the buckets that are showing up in the $35 million or so synergies you expect to realize in '19? And then what are the other buckets that are going to be seen in Year 3 and Year 4? -- Sure. I think we've talked a lot about the four buckets in the past. And as we move into year two of that integration, I would expect that we will get more production synergies. We did a lot of that heavy work in fiscal '18, and we're still not quite as efficient as we want to be in our plans but we're moving through that.And I would expect that production is a big component. We will do a lot of route optimization. And while we have only just begun that, that's going to be the largest activity that we have going on in fiscal '19. So we'll start to see some of those routing benefits.And when I talk about routing benefits, what I really mean is improved fuel utilization. We are not looking to eliminate routes. What we're really looking to do is make all of our routes more efficient and give our SSRs more time with our customers but that's going to be a big project and we will start to see some of that benefit. We have already gotten a lot of G&A benefits, and we still have some more to go but that will be a lesser component in Year 2 than the production impact.And then we'll start to see some sourcing synergies but I would expect more of those to be in that Year 3 and 4. So thinking about that prioritization, I would expect production to be the largest piece followed then by those other three where we're touching now on the routing and the sourcing and also getting a little bit more incremental G&A. -- OK. That's helpful. And then I just wanted to quickly ask how you guys are thinking about inflation pressures and what's embedded in guidance. And how you're thinking a rising labor and raw material cost backdrop, how you think about your ability to pass on that pricing to customers? -- Well, when we think about the economy as we stand today and looking forward from today, we feel like it's a positive environment. The activities are good. Our team has been fairly successful in both selling new business and in penetrating. And so it's a positive environment.There are certainly those things that you mentioned that we're keeping our eyes on.Certainly, the tariff uncertainty is a wildcard and, as I was mentioning a little bit earlier, the indirect pieces of those, we're keeping our eyes on but again, it's a wildcard about how that'll impact us. From an energy perspective and fuel perspective, we have modeled that we will see about a 20-basis-point increase in fuel in fiscal '19, and we're seeing that already in June in our prices at the pump.And from a labor perspective, we certainly are starting to see the tightening of labor. It's not affecting us widespread but it certainly is an impact. And we're keeping our eyes on how do we manage the best we can and be as efficient as we can. And one way to do that is to really work on our partner retention.That is very important for us, and it certainly makes this tighter labor market easier to deal with if we can retain our current partners. That's very important to us but those things are certainly starting to creep in. They are included in our guidance but those are things to keep our eyes on. -- OK. All very helpful. Thank you.Thank you. Our next question will come from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. -- Thanks. Good afternoon. Just following up on that last question, it looks like cotton's gotten expensive again. You considered synthetics last time.You weathered the storm pretty well though when those prices increased a few years ago. Could you just remind us how maybe this time compares to last time and how you think about that? -- Yes. I don't think we've seen the spikes that we saw last time quite yet but in any event, cotton is something that just takes a long time to get into our P&L. When you think about the standard garment that we have, certainly, the fabric is a component of that.A bigger component is the labor. And you also have things like trim and freight into our distribution centers but certainly, the fabric is a component of that, and cotton is a component of that fabric. So when you break it all down, it's not a significant amount of the cost but there is an impact but when we see these spikes, in order for it to impact our P&L, it's got to be a long time of that spike. In other words, it has to last through the production of our garments, the shipping of those into our distribution center, sitting in our DC for return, then getting out into our rental locations where it begins to amortize generally over 18 months.So in that first month of shipping into the rental location, we see 1/18 of the impact. So as you can imagine, that cotton has to spike and stay elevated for quite a while before it has a real meaningful impact, and we haven't seen any of it yet. -- You guys have referenced that the low watermark for the organic growth progression is going to be in the first quarter. I don't know if you're comfortable getting into more detail but just curious how it might compare to fourth quarter and kind of the cadence of next year. -- Yes. I'm speaking from a rental perspective now. I think it's going to be lower than this fourth quarter but then in the second quarter, should see a move upward and followed by the second half of the year that it's getting closer to the 5.5 to 6 level but we're a ways from there. I would expect, if the economy continues to perform like it is, I would expect that we should be near that top of that guidance that we gave, and that should play out quarter by quarter in the way I mentioned. -- Appreciate that. One more similar question, kind of housekeeping. You talked about the full-year tax-rate guidance and that it would fluctuate quarter to quarter. Any rules of thumb on any particular quarters that we should follow being above or below that just for the modeling purposes? -- Yes. I think that's a good question, Scott. I would expect from an EPS quarter-to-quarter perspective we're going to have ... I mentioned the change to our retirement policy and an increase in our stock-based compensation. We're going to see a good chunk of that in our first quarter, and so it's going to pressure our first-quarter margins.Because of that, we also get a benefit, a greater benefit on the tax side of things. So I expect that our first-quarter tax rate will be quite lower than the remaining three quarters, all of which will probably be closer to that 24% like range. -- OK. Thanks very much.Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Wittmann with RW Baird. -- Thanks for taking my question, guys. I was just looking at the guidance, and it looks like bridging between EPS and revenue that somewhere in the low 16s is the EBIT margin assumption that you have implicit in your guidance. I guess, with the moving pieces of roughly $35 million of cost synergies that you're expecting this year, it does look like you're putting up some incremental margins but I was just wondering how you expect this year to play out versus your normal expectation for around 30% incremental EBIT margins. Is that what's implied here, Mike? -- Implied from the low end to the high end is certainly margin improvement, operating margin improvement, and I would say, I think of it a little bit higher than you had said. I think you had said in the low 16s, I would put it more in the mid-16s and at the high end, maybe even a little bit higher than that. So ex synergy, still some nice margin improvement at the top.Now, Andrew, we talk about 20% to 30% incremental margin, and clearly, with all of the integration and implementation work that we have, this is not a normal year. And inclusive of all of that, that incremental is going to be a little bit different this year than we would normally think of.When you think about incremental, when you think about the inefficiencies of the implementation and the integration, when you think about a little bit of a higher energy number, it's not your normal incremental year certainly. -- Got it. So just in terms of like the in-specific integration costs, if you will, like the things that you weren't able to back out, now that you're more than a year into owning G&K, does that become a slight tailwind as well because you're like not relabeling garments? Or is there still or maybe more of those types of costs that are in your guidance? -- More of those types of costs are in the guidance. I mentioned earlier that one of the heavy projects is the route optimization. So I'll give you an example of a market route optimization.In a market where we've got Cintas facilities and G&K facilities that will remain open, we're going to take a look at all of the customers in that marketplace, and we are going to then take those customers in that marketplace and effectively reroute them to make all of our routes in that marketplace more efficient.Now we are certainly cautious because our goal through this process is to minimize the disruption to the customer. And so we always have to keep that in mind but we will make those routes more efficient. And sometimes, that means moving the processing of certain customers from one location to the other.And when we do that, that means we have to pull garments out of one location and transport them to the other location. That receiving location then has to rebarcode all of those garments, enter them into the system, and they have to do a little bit of that production integration all over again. That's an important part of what we're doing. And we're going to be cautious about it because, again, we want to make sure that we don't disrupt the customer or minimize that.And again, we're not looking at a route reduction. We're looking at a route efficiency opportunity but as you can imagine, moving those garments in between those facilities creates, again, the same kind of inefficiency that we talked about last year. -- I wanted to ask one final question here, and that's just regarding kind of the revenue trends in the core rental segment, specifically, just getting some subjective comments from you on the level of sales force productivity, particularly those G&K folks who stayed with you that are now more accustomed to the suite of products and services that you're selling as well as get some sense from you about the level of retention that you're experiencing in your customer base today, any comments on add-stop? Or the level of no programs would also be welcome. -- Let's see. That was a lot, Andrew. From the retention standpoint, look, we talked about it all year long and it's been better than we expected. And we are very, very pleased with that.Again, the legacy G&K business was a very good business. They took care of their customers well.We've continued to do that, and we try to make that disruption of the integration as minimal of a disruption as we can. And that's led to some real nice retention from the legacy salespeoples' standpoint. Look, they have some very good selling skills. It's just more a matter of making sure they understand our environment, our systems, our products and services and our expectations.And that can take a while to retrain and ramp up but, as I mentioned, we like the trend that we've seen in each quarter in fiscal '18, and we're encouraged by what we've seen and encouraged by the opportunity that we have moving forward.Thank you. Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel Nicolaus. -- Hi, thank you. I don't usually ask questions about M&A but given some of the commentary you made about being more selective or opportunistic in share repurchases together with the significant capacity that you now have on the EBITDA side. I was just wondering when you are looking, and I'm sure you're paying more attention to deals that are coming your way, should we expect more of the same in terms of companies more in the uniform rental business? Doesn't seem like there's a ton at least in the first aid side or is there an adjacency or something that you guys are entertaining as well? -- We would love to continue to be acquisitive in our rental business, in our first aid and safety and in our fire businesses. We like all of those opportunities, and we will have an opportunity to be more aggressive in fiscal '19 than we have been in the last few years. And those acquisitions are important to us. Would we look for a different type of opportunity? It depends on the characteristics of the business.And can it help us continue to grow? And can our current customers take advantage of that new offering?A lot of things that we would have to take into account and the value would have to be at the right place. Having said that, if those things do happen, we'll absolutely be aggressive in looking at it if we feel like it is the right opportunity. -- So is there anything like particular out of the wheelhouse that you think would surprise us? Or really, hey, you feel like this as a company that wants to stick to its knitting and that's what we should expect? -- Well, Shlomo, when we think about our business, we think about the opportunity to create value to over 1 million businesses that we currently serve and many more that we don't currently serve. And that value can come in the way of image, safety, compliance. And so there are a lot of different ways that we can provide benefits to businesses, and that also then allows us to kind of expand what we currently do, both in our current businesses and maybe then in some type of new offering.In the past, we have moved from the rental business to the first aid to a fire to document management to deep cleaning. There have been opportunities, and we've taken advantage of those. And again, if that kind of opportunities exists, we would certainly love them. I don't know if some of those kinds of services would be surprising to any of you.That I can't answer but we're not satisfied with simply staying in our swim lanes and not being aggressive in terms of adding value to our customers and to other prospective customers. -- Thank you very much.Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with J.P.Morgan Securities. -- Hi. Mike, looking back at the fourth quarter in terms of uniform rental organic revenue growth, could you tell us how G&K did versus the Cintas space? And did the upside in rental revenue growth come from G&K better than expected or the Cintas space? -- Andrew, it's really hard to pull it apart but our expectation was that we certainly still did see shrinkage in that G&K base but likely a little better just based on the top line, likely a little bit better than we had expected. I would say more of the beat of our guidance was our legacy business, and that's operating very, very well even in the midst of lots of moving parts within those locations because of the integration. I can't give you a specific number, though, Andrew. -- So did you think that G&K declines narrowed from the third-quarter declines? Because you did give us third-quarter declines of mid-single digits. -- Yes, I am guessing. I would say it's fairly similar to that third-quarter number. -- OK. Thank you very much.Thank you. Our next question will come from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair. -- Good afternoon. Can you guys hear me OK? -- Yes, I can. -- Hi. Just a couple of questions here. So with non-pharma employment continuing to grow, I'm sure you guys are benefiting from that to a degree. In thinking about new customer growth, are there any areas, other end markets or regions where you see particular strength? -- Well, first of all, I would say it's been broadly a positive environment but we talk a lot about healthcare in the last few years, and healthcare remains an exciting opportunity for us for many of our products and services. And that industry vertical continues to grow at very good levels but I would say, generally, Tim, it's been a fairly broad performance, and we're real pleased with it. -- OK. Thanks. And then on a dollar basis, can you share with us how much acquisitions added to both the uniform rental and other segments in the quarter? -- Let's see. From a dollar perspective, in the quarter, it's, let's call, at about $53 million for rental and a very small number for the others, less than $5 million, only really a couple million dollars. -- Got it, OK. And then with SAP, you've converted 34% of the base so far with plans to be complete in fiscal 2020. Where do you guys expect to be by the end of 2019 if you're willing to share? -- We've got a lot of moving pieces, and I would say we're going to make significant progress but I don't have a schedule in front of me, and I don't know that I want to get to that level of specificity just simply because it changes quite often. It changes based on what we've got going on in each market from an integration standpoint, from a customer perspective. And, as I mentioned a few times, our goal is to minimize customer disruption. And so that might mean moving a little bit from one market to another.So it's hard to pinpoint that, and I'd rather not. -- But Tim, I guess, I would add from like a modeling perspective, like we don't anticipate that in fiscal '19, the SAP expenses, anything much different than fiscal '18, so we don't expect the expense to be a headwind. -- OK, that's essentially what I was looking for. Two more quick housekeeping ones, guys, No. 1, the change to the retirement policy. Did you say higher stock comp would impact by $15 million to $20 million in 2019? -- I said $20 million roughly. -- Roughly $20 million. And you said that a big piece of that, Mike, will hit in the first quarter. How should I think about modeling that? Is it most of it in the first quarter? Half? Any detail would be helpful? -- I don't want to get into the very specific level. I don't have it in front of me nor do I want to get into that level of detail but in our first quarter, we are generally wrapping up our prior fiscal year compensation plans. And so that's generally when we provide the grants. And because of that, that is when a lot of the activity happens but I can't get into the level of detail, that level of detail that you want. -- No, that's still helpful. One last one. Did you say shares outstanding of 114 million in 2019? -- We did, yes. -- So you were at 111 million at the end of the fourth quarter. Is that increase related to the change in the retirement policy? And then could you share the cadence of how should we think about that through the year? -- We were over 111.5 million. We're modeling a little bit higher. Tim, when our stock performs as well as it does, the effect of diluted securities really starts to rise. And while there aren't additional shares out there, the effect of those securities increases.So that's why we're seeing that number at that 114 million level.All right, gentlemen, there are currently no further questions in the queue. -- OK. Thank you very much and we will be with you near the end of September for our first-quarter results but thank you for joining us, and have a great rest of your summer.[Operator signoff]When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

 (NASDAQ:  ) is primarily known as a work uniform provider, but it has become much more than that. It is one of the biggest players in the entire service industry infrastructure.From first-aid and safety to compliance training to commercial cleaning services, CTAS does more than just rent uniforms. And its traditional client base - service-oriented businesses and manufacturing firms - is where the U.S. economy is growing the most.For good or bad, most of the wage increases in the U.S. economy are coming from the service economy, not the white-collar professions. All the services that CTAS delivers are focused on the fastest growing part of the economy.Granted, CTAS stock has been on a roll, up 36% year-to-date and 62% over the past 12 months. Its price-to-earnings ratio has also gotten a bit hot here, coming in around 30 at this point.But its recent earnings report again came in above expectations in almost every category. And it has completed most of the digestion of its $2.2 billion acquisition of  last year.That can be a challenging process, but CTAS is very adept at growing through acquisition and its management team has done another great job.CTAS is also doing a great job by diversifying, yet sticking to its knitting. It knows its core clients. It has been in the business since it launched as the Acme Industrial Laundry Company in 1929.It was founded by Richard (Doc) Farmer. But in 1956 his grandson Richard (Dick) Farmer came aboard and that's when the real growth started. Dick still sits on the board to this day.And that's another aspect to CTAS stock. Cintas is still a family company with old-school values. It's not a sexy business and it will never be. It is shareholder friendly - it is a well-ensconced Dividend Aristocrat, raising its dividend every year for the past 35 years. It was built out of the Great Depression, so it found a way to succeed when many around it couldn't keep their doors open.This conservative approach has served it well. Revenue has grown eight out of the past 10 years. That means the Great Recession only slowed growth for a couple years.But this conservative approach certainly hasn't hurt CTAS stock's growth. It continues to pay down the debt it added to seal the G&K deal, and it should have that under control soon. That's not to say it overleveraged itself for the deal. It is simply carrying slightly more debt than its historical average, which is very manageable.None of its business lines are very sexy and investors have been moving into CTAS stock, so it's not a bargain. But given the momentum of the economy, the sector Cintas serves and its blue-chip management, this is one of those stocks that you can rest easy owning.Cintas stock will not only endure but it will thrive, come what may.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Why Cintas Stock Will Keep On Rolling No Matter What@2018-08-10@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-cintas-stock-will-keep-rolling-no-matter-what-2018-08-10

"his week, uniform rental giant  (NASDAQ: CTAS) reported its results for a busy 2018 fiscal year that included integrating its largest acquisition yet. The company ended the period on a strong note by beating management's fourth-quarter sales and earnings targets even as profitability jumped higher.Here's a look at how the latest results stacked up against the prior-year period:
  
Data source: Cintas' financial filings. EPS = earnings per share.Revenue jumped 10% in the core uniform rental division and by 5% in Cintas' other business lines last quarter. Profit margins improved across the board, which allowed the company to post significantly higher gross and operating earnings.Image source: Getty Images.Here are some of the key highlights from the quarter:CEO Scott Farmer commented on the broader fiscal year that included integrating Cintas' biggest buyout to date and the implementation of a new ERP system. ""We finished the year strong,"" Farmer explained, ""and beat our fourth quarter revenue and EPS guidance."" He continued, ""Fiscal 2018's financial achievement was especially noteworthy given that it was accomplished in a period of extreme change management.""While highlighting the company's ascension into the Fortune 500, Farmer said it was ""... a testament to the hard work and dedication of our employee-partners..."" The CEO predicted more gains ahead, saying, ""We look forward to climbing even higher in the ranking.""Cintas' outlook for the new fiscal year predicts revenue of between $6.75 billion and $6.82 billion as it signs more businesses up for its uniform rental services and expands beyond its current market share of around 20%. The midpoint of that forecast range corresponds to a 5% annual revenue increase. And, while that's far below this past year's 22% bounce, the growth rate no longer benefits from the temporary lift of the G&K segment acquisition.Cintas expects to book additional charges related to the G&K integration of between $15 million and $20 million this year. Excluding those expenses, adjusted earnings should rise to between $7 per share and $7.15 per share in fiscal 2019, up from last year's $5.93 per share haul.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Adjusted earnings came in at $1.77 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.67.Quarterly revenues increased 9.1% year over year to $1,669.6 million, exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,637 million. Organic growth for the reported quarter improved 5.1% year over year, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.Gross margin increased to 45.1% from 44.4% in the prior-year quarter. Operating income was $265.5 million, up 49.7% year over year. Operating income, excluding G&K transaction and integration expenses, increased 16.4% year over year, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of 16.8%.For fiscal 2018, net income and earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations were $783.9 million and $7.03, respectively, compared with $457.3 million and $4.17 last fiscal. The company reported adjusted earnings of $5.94 per share. Revenues for the year were $6,476.6 million compared with $5,323.4 million in the prior-year period. The increase was driven by an organic growth rate of 7.1%. revenues for the fiscal fourth quarter improved 10.1% year over year to $1,342.8 million and accounted for 80.4% of the total revenues. The segment recorded year-over-year organic growth of 5.3%. Also, gross margin for the segment increased to 45% from 44.6% in the year-ago quarter. | At the  segment, revenues were up 5.3% year over year to $326.8 million and accounted for 19.6% of the total revenues.

"or all the back and forth in the media about  (NASDAQ: TSLA) , no one can deny the stock's incredible performance since its IPO. Not a lot of companies have been able to produce the 1,140% return since 2010 that Tesla's stock has, and it's incredibly challenging to pick a stock with the potential to reproduce those kinds of returns.But hey, we have to try, right?So we asked three of our investing contributors to highlight a stock they think could outpace Tesla's stock. Here's why they picked  (NYSE: F) ,  (NASDAQ: CTAS) , and  (NASDAQ: IQ) .Image source: Getty Images. Surging 16 times in price since its  , Tesla has produced better returns than a lot of other stocks. Still, Tesla's recent past hasn't looked as encouraging as its distant past. So far this year, the stock has worse than flatlined. Its share price is now below where it was when Tesla entered the year -- even though Elon Musk delivered on his promise to get Tesla producing Model 3s  .If  news wasn't enough to get  going, I have to wonder if the Tesla bull run might be played out -- and if other stocks start to might put Tesla's returns to shame. If you're getting ready to switch horses, therefore, you might want to look at Ford.Yes, Ford -- the anti-Tesla. With a share price down 17% since the year began, Ford has fared even worse than Tesla this year. Perversely, though, that may set up Ford stock to outperform even more strongly in the months and years ahead.Profitable and free cash flow-positive, Ford doesn't need headlines to get its stock going, because it's  to prove its worth. With a dividend yield of 6.9%, Ford's two-thirds of the way to delivering at least average, long-term stock market returns of 10% even with zero earnings growth. If Ford delivers on Wall Street's expected 15% earnings growth, on the other hand, the stock could outperform Tesla for years to come. For a company that's been in business since 1929 and has been public for 35 years, it's incredibly surprising to see that uniform rental company Cintas has come rather close to matching Tesla's returns since it went public. Since Tesla's IPO, this stock is up 868% on a total return basis. Even more surprising is that it's been able to do so in what is normally considered a boring, slow-growth business.The boring simplicity of Cintas' business is part of the reason it's been such a great wealth-compounding stock over its lifetime. Uniform rentals and its other core services -- industrial cleaning, restroom supplies, safety and compliance equipment -- make for a recurring revenue business that doesn't require a whole lot of sustaining capital. That means the company churns out loads of free cash flow management returns to its shareholders through dividends and share repurchases that have reduced share count by 27% over the past decade.Cintas' recent acquisition of competitor G&K Services will expand the company's market share to around 20% of the nation's uniform rental services, and management thinks it can squeeze out lots of operating efficiencies as it integrates G&K into its existing infrastructure. We already saw some of the effects from this acquisition, as Cintas has been doing the same thing for close to 100 years, but it does that job incredibly well and rewards its investors consistently by returning excess cash to shareholders. That formula certainly has the potential to beat Tesla over the long haul. data by  Sometimes referred to as ""the  of China,"" iQiyi has already posted big gains since its initial public offering in March. The stock is up roughly 80% from its $18 IPO price, and while the rapid run-up might give some investors cause for concern, I think shares have lots of room to run over the long term.iQiyi has managed to rapidly grow its paid-user count, with more than 61 million people paying for premium services as of May -- compared with just 5 million paying users in May three years prior. Paid-user growth is probably the most prized engagement metric for shareholders at the moment, but the company has more than 400 million users when its ad-supported viewers are taken into account. eMarketer estimates that ad spending on online video-content in China will have climbed from roughly $10.6 billion in 2018 to $17.7 billion in 2021. That gives the company two promising avenues for continuing to deliver robust sales growth -- especially as it bolsters the content offerings on its platforms.In addition to  , iQiyi has been finding success with its original-content initiatives -- scoring hits with shows such as  and  . iQiyi's platform also offers graphic novels and video games, and it's aiming to build up a merchandise and licensing business. So there looks to be a multifaceted business evolving here -- and one that's primed to create valuable synergy and capitalize on some powerful tailwinds.It's worth pointing out that the company faces credible competition from  ' video platform. However, iQiyi is currently the market leader, and there will be room for more than one winner in the space. Right now, iQiyi operates at a substantial loss because it's spending big on content and marketing initiatives. However, with the Chinese middle class seeing rapid gains in size and purchasing power, there's a promising path for the company to become consistently profitable and deliver big returns for shareholders.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Notably, its adjusted earnings of $1.37 per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.24.Our proven model shows that Cintas' earnings will likely beat estimates even in the to-be-reported quarter.Cintas has the right combination of two key ingredients-Zacks Rank & ESP: Cintas' favorable Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), when combined with an  of +0.88%, predicts a likely earnings beat. | The company's Most Accurate estimate of $1.69 per share currently comes in above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.67.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  .It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Efficient marketing and after-sales services offered by skilled professionals will likely aid in spurring market demand for Cintas' products and services in the quarters ahead. The company also expects that its product portfolio solidification efforts will drive top-line growth, going forward. Additionally, the acquisition of G&K Services Inc. (for $2.2 billion) is expected to strengthen Cintas' near-term results.We expect that efficient implementation of the company's enterprise resource-planning program, as well as the Systems, Applications, Products (SAP) system will aid in enhancing Cintas' profitability in the upcoming quarters. Also, lower corporate tax rates will likely continue to support bottom-line growth, moving ahead.Cintas currently anticipates to generate revenues of $1.625-$1.645 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter. The company's earnings for the to-be-reported quarter are projected at $1.64-$1.69 per share. Capital expenditure for the quarter is estimated to be roughly $65 million.The Zacks Consensus Estimates for Cintas' Uniform Rental and Facility Services, and Other segments' revenues for the fiscal fourth quarter are currently pegged at $1,313 million and $178 million, respectively, higher than the corresponding tallies of $1,220 million and $176 million generated in the prior-year quarter.Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimates for Cintas' Uniform Rental and Facility Services, and Other segments' gross profit for the quarter to be reported are currently pegged at $591 million and $78 million, respectively, higher than the corresponding tallies of $544 million and $75 million recorded in the year-earlier quarter.Here are some other stocks in the  that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Atkore International Group Inc.  sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has an Earnings ESP of +1.49%.

nvestors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and  may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Cintas is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings - with the most up-to-date information possible - is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for CTAS in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.69 per share for CTAS, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.67 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for CTAS, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.88% heading into earnings season. | A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more  ).Given that CTAS has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings.

"igh-flying stocks have a lot of optimism baked into their share prices, but often that investor confidence has been earned through the type of solid operating results that could pave the way for bigger gains ahead.Below, we'll look at a few of these market darlings that three of our Motley Fool investors believe have room to extend their recent triple-digit rallies. Read on for a bullish take on  (NYSE: DPZ) ,  (NASDAQ: CTAS) , and  (NASDAQ: AAXN) . : You might think Domino's doesn't have much gas left in its rally tank after shares have doubled since mid-2015. Its core product is easily replicated, and just about every food-seller on the market, from  to  is trying its hand at home delivery.Image source: Getty Images.Yet Domino's track record suggests that its growth comes from an enduring competitive advantage rather than just a lucky cyclical spike. For example, the company has consistently gained market share in the core pizza delivery industry over the past decade. That success is due to a few factors that are difficult for rivals to match, including its strong store economics, its aggressive innovation posture, and its network of over 5,000 restaurants across the U.S.Domino's is aiming to get that number  , and its addressable market is even bigger in the international arena. The pizza chain's high debt level is a yellow flag that investors will want to keep an eye on, but for now it makes sense that management would be directing resources toward aggressively expanding its store base. The most recent quarter included accelerating sales growth and spiking profitability, after all. : Conventional wisdom says that the larger a company is, the harder it's going to be for it to grow. Well, don't tell that to shareholders of uniform rental and business services company Cintas, which despite being large enough to be a member of the  and the Fortune 500, has managed to grow its share price by more than 300% over the last five years. To put that in perspective, it's  .As the leader in North American uniform rental, Cintas has been able to fuel this explosive growth by gobbling up smaller competitors like G&K Services, and through organic expansion as well. The company has also expanded into related business services like floor mat rental, restroom and first aid kit restocking, and fire and safety equipment rental. These related businesses are easy to add, because the same delivery route can restock uniforms, floor mats, and other equipment.Even after all this growth, though, the uniform rental market remains fragmented, offering more opportunities for Cintas to continue expanding. In  , overall organic growth came in at 8%, but organic growth in the first aid and safety services segment was 10%. Cintas should continue to grow in the coming years, rewarding investors along the way. : The future was looking extremely bright for Axon Enterprises beforehand, but after acquiring its primary rival, it doesn't look like there is any impediment to the stun gun maker's forward ascent.Axon is the dominant player in the conducted electrical weapon category, with its Taser-branded stun guns entering the lexicon as the generic word for the devices. Even the act of getting shocked by one of the devices -- ""  "" -- has been colloquialized. And although stun guns still account for the majority of Axon's revenue, their ubiquity limits their future growth, so it is in body cameras and evidence management where Axon has set its sights for tomorrow.Image source: Getty Images.Axon is also the leader in body cams for law enforcement, with contracts with 37 of the 69 major cities in the U.S. Now it has  Vievu, for which it paid $4.6 million in cash and $2.5 million in stock. Together, Axon will now completely dominate the market, which continues to be a growing one as demand for greater police accountability and protection of both officers and the public grows.The third leg of Axon's pillars of opportunity is in evidence database management. Law enforcement agencies generate a lot of records and a chain of evidence, particularly with the growing use of cameras, is essential. Axon's Evidence.com helps the agencies manage all of that, while also making use of the data simpler. If you need to find a particular incident on a camera, the software can zero in on it in seconds and make it readily available.While Axon Enterprise stock has soared over 140% in just six months, these three prongs indicate shares can continue to shock investors by climbing even higher in the future.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

 is anticipated to report second-quarter 2018 results on Jul 19, before the opening bell. Dover is expected to report year-over-year growth in its bottom-line in the to-be-reported quarter despite a drop in top-line, as per our projections.In first-quarter 2018, Dover reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.16, which surged 26% year over year. Total revenues increased 6% year over year to $1.9 billion in the quarter driven by acquisitions, organic growth and favorable impact from foreign exchange, partly offset by impact from dispositions. The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both counts.Notably, Dover surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last four quarters, delivering an average surprise of 4.7%. Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement. | Our proven model cannot conclusively predict if Dover will beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time. That's because it doesn't have the right combination of two key ingredients - a positive  and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better - to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . : The company has an Earnings ESP of +0.39%. : Dover carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), which reduces the predictive power of ESP. Notably, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Dover's bookings at the end of the first quarter 2018 were worth $2.11 billion, up from $2.03 billion reported at the end of first-quarter 2017. Organic bookings increased across all of Dover's businesses with the exception of Refrigeration & Food Equipment. Backlog increased to $1.41 billion at the end of the reported quarter from $1.29 billion at the year-ago quarter end. Backed by strong bookings growth, the company is poised for an improved second-quarter 2018 performance.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total sales of $1.8 billion for the quarter indicates a decline of 10.7% from the prior-year quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Dover's earnings has gone down 6% over the last 30 days and is pegged at $1.22 for the second quarter. The earnings estimate reflects year-over-year growth of around 17%.Coming to the segments, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Refrigeration and Food Equipment segment's net sales is pegged at $408 million for the quarter to be reported, representing year-over-year decline of 4%. Retail refrigeration in the second quarter will continue to be impacted by tough comparisons related to last year's strong shipments and softer overall markets. The segment's operating earnings is projected to be around $59 million, down 11% from $66 million in the prior-year quarter.Strong bookings in Engineered Systems and Fluids and strong book-to-bill will drive organic revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates that Dover's Engineered Systems segment's revenues will reach $695 million in the second quarter, representing a year-over-year improvement of 6%. The estimate for operating earnings for the segment is currently at $116 million, a 8% rise from the prior-year quarter.For the Fluids segment, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $97 million for the quarter, representing year-over-year increase of 31% aided by strong growth in the Pumps as well as hygienic and pharma businesses.However, Dover expects to incur separation costs related to Apergy in the second quarter of 2018 in between $33 million and $35 million. This will impact the quarter's margins.Dover has underperformed the industry over the past year. Shares of the company have dropped 11% while the  gained 4%.Here are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:HD Supply Holdings, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +2.07% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The stock has gained 46% in a year's time. You can see Roper Technologies, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +0.32% and a Zacks Rank #2.

all Street ended the week with a whimper, sliding marginally into loss territory and giving back earlier gains as renewed trade-war jitters constrained sentiment that had started the day on the upswing amid strong earnings.Selling pressure grew through the afternoon, with real estate, utilities and telecoms among the decliners on the S&P 500, while consumer staples and financials hung on for gains of 0.6% and 0.2%. A flat day for the tech sector held down the Nasdaq Composite, while the Dow ended with a second straight day of losses.Positive earnings news initially supported the measures, with results from Microsoft (  ), Stanley Black & Decker (  ), Cintas (  ) and Honeywell (  ) bolstering trading.But more saber-ratting from President Donald Trump over China and trade weighed as the day rolled on. The leader told CNBC he could put duties on more than $500 billion worth of goods from the Asian nation, which would cover essentially everything China ships to the US. That came after China has seemingly attempted to devalue its currency in recent days as a retaliatory measure for an earlier salvo in the trade dispute.And it wasn't all positive with the earnings headlines, either. General Electric (  ) skidded 4.5% as the conglomerate said Q2 earnings fell year-on-year, but topped Wall Street's views. Skechers (SKX) skidded 21% after the sneaker maker's results badly missed expectations.Next week's calendar brings heavyweights Alphabet (GOOGL), Verizon (VZ) and Coca-Cola (KO). On the economic front, existing and new home sales will be released, as will the first take on Q2 gross domestic product.Here's where the markets stood by the close:US MARKETSDow Jones Industrial Average was down 6.38 points (-0.03%)S&P 500 was down 2.66 points (-0.09%)Nasdaq Composite Index was down 5.10 points (-0.07%)GLOBAL SENTIMENTFTSE 100 was down 0.07%Nikkei 225 was down 0.29%Hang Seng Index was up 0.76%Shanghai China Composite Index was up 2.04%UPSIDE MOVERS(+) TLRY (+32.96%) Extending IPO gains from Thursday(+) SAEX (+19.41%) Received approval for purchasing certain assets from Geokinetics(+) CLF (+12.56%) EPS surges 161%, sales jump(+) SLS (+3.33%) Galinpepimut-S fast tracked for multiple myeloma(+) GSK (+2.9%) Financial Times says co. mulling spin off of consumer divisionDOWNSIDE MOVERS(-) ZYNE (-24.09%) Announced public stock offering(-) SKX (-20.99%) Missed Q2 EPS estimates, issued downbeat Q3 sales and EPS guidance(-) FTD (-19.47%) Top executives leave amid restructuring, board considering a sale(-) SAUC (-16.53%) Announced stock offering(-) STT (-7.29%) Reports Q2 earnings, revenue well below Street views(-) SCOR (-1.72%) Files for secondary sale of common stockThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Close Update: Wall Street Slips Into Loss Territory as Trade Woes Overshadow Earnings Gains@2018-07-20@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/close-update-wall-street-slips-loss-territory-trade-woes-overshadow-earnings-gains-2018-07
 announced that it will increase the price of its paper-based tubes and cores by at least 6% due to the persistent rise in raw material costs. The price hike will be effective from Jul 16, relating to the shipments in the United States and Canada.Notably, Paperboard tubes and cores are elements of Sonoco's Paper and Industrial Converted Products segment. In 2017, the company's tubes and cores products were the largest revenue-producing group of products, representing around 22% of consolidated net sales in the year ended Dec 31, 2017.The price rise of tubes and cores is in response to the recent increase in costs for uncoated recycled paperboard (URB) which represents the largest input cost for tubes and cores. Also, Sonoco hiked prices to combat the rising costs of transportation. | Sonoco expects strong performance in its Paper and Industrial converted product segment in second-quarter 2018, largely driven by solid demand and benefit from a favorable price-cost relationship. However, expected cost increases in raw materials, particularly tinplate steel and old corrugate containers (OCC), might hurt earnings.Although Sonoco projects that overall price/cost will be positive in 2018, the possibility of continued volatility in key raw material prices could make pricing for their recovery more challenging. Further, the company anticipates to face elevated freight costs and increased labor costs in 2018 which also remain matters of concern.Sonoco's shares have outperformed the  with respect to price, over the past year. The company's shares have gained around 3%, while the industry recorded growth of 2%.Sonoco currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Other top-ranked stocks in the same space include Cintas Corporation  , Tetra Tech, Inc.  and ACCO Brands Corporation  . All three stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2. You can see  .Cintas has a long-term earnings growth rate of 12%. Its shares have appreciated 47%, over the past year.Tetra Tech has a long-term earnings growth rate of 13.3%. The company's shares have been up 24% in the past year.ACCO Brands has a long-term earnings growth rate of 10%.

"et's say that five years ago, you invested $8,000 in an  index fund. You'd probably be pretty pleased if you checked it today and found about $13,500 in there. On the other hand, if you'd invested in one of these stocks, you'd be sitting on more than $25,000...in one case, a lot more!But what's most interesting about these two stocks is how little the companies have in common, from their age to their size to their location to their industries. It just goes to show that the best outperformers can be found in any sector of the market. So let's take a look at these two amazing growth stories:  (NASDAQ: TSLA) and  (NASDAQ: CTAS) .These two top companies have handily outperformed the S&P. Image source: Getty Images.Tesla probably needs no introduction: Elon Musk's electric car, solar panel, and energy storage company has been hyped, trashed, analyzed, and scrutinized all over the news...and that's just in the past week.An investment in Tesla is an investment in Musk's vision of the future. But it's a very compelling vision, that has driven share prices up 214% over the past five years. That means that $8,000 invested in Tesla five years ago would be worth just over $25,000 today.But the company remains a speculative investment. While Musk claims that ""it's really looking"" like Tesla will post positive  in Q2 2018, and positive cash flow in Q3 and Q4, many analysts  . The company is still struggling to get up to speed producing the Model 3 sedans on which hundreds of thousands of people have put a $1,000 deposit. The company's longtime goal has been to produce 5,000 Model 3 units per week, but right now, it's only producing about 3,500 per week. Musk says he hopes to achieve the 5,000-per-week target by the end of June.You'll notice how many speculative words there are in that last paragraph. Tesla has grown its infrastructure, its revenue, its share price, and its profile. But  , to say the least. I own shares in Tesla because I'm still hopeful Musk's vision will pan out, and I'm thrilled with how well they've performed. However,  I'd buy in now.You might call Cintas many things, but ""cool"" or ""disruptive"" probably aren't either of them. Cintas is about the polar opposite of Tesla. Where Tesla has set up shop in hip Palo Alto, California, Cintas has made its home in staid Cincinnati, Ohio. While Tesla was founded in 2003, Cintas got its start back in 1929. And while Tesla has made its fortune in the hot new technologies of electric cars and solar panels, Cintas performs the yawn-inducing services of uniform rental and laundering, and restroom restocking.So, maybe you'd be surprised to learn that over the last five years, Cintas' performance has absolutely crushed Tesla's: data by  .Not only have Cintas' shares outperformed Tesla's by more than 100 percentage points, the company's growth trajectory has been remarkably consistent compared to the ups and downs of Tesla's. While investing in Tesla would have turned your $8,000 into just over $25,000, putting that money in Cintas instead would turn into $35,920 if you reinvested the dividend right back into the stock.While Tesla has tapped into a hot up-and-coming tech market, Cintas has grown the old-fashioned way: Gaining share in an incredibly fractured market, acquiring smaller competitors, and supplementing its core uniform rental business with other compatible business services. Sometimes those new services have paid off for the company, and sometimes they haven't -- like the underperforming document shredding business Cintas sold to  in 2015.Cintas is likely to continue to grow. As the economy improves and puts more Americans to work, more of them will need uniforms. And even after  of major competitor G&K Services last year, the uniform rental market is still fragmented, offering Cintas further opportunities to grow through acquisition. Finally, Cintas' first aid and safety services segment -- which restocks first aid kits, fire extinguishers, and other safety gear -- is growing faster than its core uniform rental business, posting 10% organic growth  compared to 6.5% organic growth for the rest of the business.Even with more-than-300% growth over the last five years, Cintas seems poised to continue expanding well into the future.The conventional wisdom would tell you that the biggest opportunities for growth are in disruptive businesses, particularly hot companies blazing trails in new technologies. Obviously, that's not entirely off the mark, and Tesla is a prime example of a company that's come a long way in the last half-decade, rewarding its shareholders in the process.But it's a mistake to ignore established -- even boring -- companies and industries when you're looking for growth opportunities. And in fact, not only has Cintas' stock outperformed Tesla's over the last five years, I'd argue it has a clearer path to growth than the headline-grabbing Tesla.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Cintas wasn't one of them!

"igh-growth stocks can actually come in all shapes and sizes. They are often expected to be brand-new, tiny companies, but in some cases, a business that's been around for nearly a century could have its best days still ahead. Sometimes it's a tech company, but in other cases, it might operate in an industry you never expected to hear associated with growth.Case in point: We asked three Motley Fool investors for their best high-growth stock ideas, and they gave us some unexpectedly insightful ideas: A small-cap upstart in a multi-trillion dollar industry,  (NASDAQ: NVEE) , nearly 90-year-old uniform supplier  (NASDAQ: CTAS) , and video game and esports giant  (NASDAQ: ATVI) . Keep reading to learn why these high-growth stocks are set to continue soaring in the years to come.Image source: Getty Images. : Since going public in 2013, infrastructure engineering and consulting company NV5 Global has already made for an incredible investment: stock price change chart. Data source: Yet even after generating nearly eight-fold gains, investors should  .With 2017 revenue of $333 million and a market cap below $800 million, NV5 is a tiny speck in the global infrastructure industry, which tops $3  in yearly revenues. But it is growing at a remarkable rate, having reported a 45% increase in sales in the first quarter, and earnings per share up 86% year over year. This led to a double-digit increase in the company's own guidance for full year sales and earnings.So what's driving the growth, and how can management keep it up? In short, a combination of organic growth, as well as acquisitions. Frankly, growth via acquisition can be very difficult to effectively sustain, but NV5's founder and CEO, Dickerson Wright, has a long history of success in his industry as a successful consolidator. And with more than 140,000 engineering firms in the U.S. alone (most of which are small, privately owned businesses) it's not unreasonable to expect Wright -- who owns over 20% of NV5 -- to continue succeeding at what he's proven good at. With global infrastructure spending set for multiple decades of growth, I'm personally invested in NV5's ability to keep it up.Trading for between 27 and 30 times company guidance for 2018 earnings, NV5 isn't a bargain-bin stock. But high-growth small-cap stocks with a heavily invested founder running the show don't often come cheap. Based on the potential for massive long-term returns, NV5 is probably worth paying a premium for. : When most people think ""high-growth,"" they're thinking tech. But it might surprise you to learn that uniform rental and business services company Cintas has actually  like  ,  , and  over the last five years: Data source: Nearly 90 years old, Cintas has grown its business the old fashioned way: by expanding its core uniform rental service into more markets; by snapping up smaller competitors like G&K Services, which Cintas bought last year; and by launching new services that are easy to add to its existing offerings.Cintas' business model -- operating a fleet of trucks that picks up dirty uniforms and drops off clean ones at business locations on a regular schedule -- has turned out to be easy to apply to other services, like floor mats, restroom supplies, and first aid and safety equipment. By cross-promoting these services, Cintas has an advantage against smaller competitors. That explains why the company's smallest division -- first aid and safety services -- has been growing at an even faster clip than the rest of the company.With Cintas the clear leader in a fractured nationwide market, there are plenty of further growth opportunities available through acquisitions or organic growth. Cintas is a strong bet for future growth. : Whether you've played an Activision-Blizzard game -- which includes franchises such as  ,  , and  , among many others -- or simply know it as a gaming stock, the company could soon become even more of a household name as esports continues to gain popularity.Newzoo, a global leader in esports and mobile intelligence, estimates the total esports audience will post 14.4% compound annual growth rate between 2016 and 2021. That growth is expected to push total audience to 380 million viewers in 2018. Further, esports revenue streams are exploding with Newzoo estimating the global esports economy will grow to $905.6 million in 2018 which would be an incredible 38% year-over-year growth -- revenue could reach $1.65 billion by 2021.Image source: Getty Images.Esports is a significant opportunity with millions of highly engaged viewers and players, and Activision Blizzard is tapping into that opportunity with its  World League, MLG Network and  League. The gaming company also has a merchandising program designed for the global gaming audience, and is taking advantage of its popular content through licensing. Overwatch's merchandising program alone has a long list of partners including  (Master Toy); NERF (Blasters); LEGOGroup (Construction), among others.Activision-Blizzard already has a wildly successful business -- including  ,  , which launches in October -- and a stock price that's soared 442% over the past five years, but if it continues to find ways to generate revenue from the surging esports economy, it could be a whole new growth story for investors.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

nvestors considering a purchase of Cintas Corporation (Symbol: CTAS) stock, but tentative about paying the going market price of $189.98/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2019 put at the $170 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $4.80. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 2.8% return against the $170 commitment, or a 4.9% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to CTAS's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $170 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Cintas Corporation sees its shares decline 10.7% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $165.20 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $4.80 from $170), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 4.9% annualized rate of return.Interestingly, that annualized 4.9% figure actually exceeds the 0.8% annualized dividend paid by Cintas Corporation by 4.1%, based on the current share price of $189.98. And yet, if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downside because the stock would have to fall 10.65% to reach the $170 strike price.Always important when discussing dividends is the fact that, in general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Cintas Corporation, looking at the dividend history chart for CTAS below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 0.8% annualized dividend yield.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Cintas Corporation, and highlighting in green where the $170 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2019 put at the $170 strike for the 4.9% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Cintas Corporation (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $189.98) to be 21%.

In other words, if we look at the number of call buyers and then use the long-term median to project the number of put buyers we'd expect to see, we're actually seeing more put buyers than expected out there in  so far today.  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Agree To Purchase Cintas Corporation At $170, Earn 4.9% Annualized Using Options@2018-06-20@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/agree-purchase-cintas-corporation-170-earn-49-annualized-using-options-2018-06-20

"The U.S.-Canada trade dispute escalated after U.S. President Donald Trump called Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau ""very dishonest and weak."" Trump had accused Canada of ""charging massive tariffs"" to U.S. businesses.The tiff involved France and Germany who criticized Trump's decision to back out of the G7 communique. Trump, in the meanwhile, threatened to double auto tariffs, marring the G7 efforts to show a united front.With Trump refusing to endorse the G7 communique, stock market gains are likely to be capped. In fact, more uncertainty is lurking as Trump is set to meet North Korean President Kim Jong Un in Singapore. Amid such ambiguity, investing in dividend aristocrats seems prudent, as they provide higher total returns with lower volatility.Trump's stinging attack on Canada jeopardized the G7's efforts to maintain free and fair trade relationships. He specifically accused Canada of imposing a 270% tariff on dairy. This has forced many U.S. dairy products from making their way to Canada from the United States. Trump, in return, has decided to slap more import tariffs on the sensitive auto industry.Trump tweeted ""PM Justin Trudeau of Canada acted so meek and mild during our @G7 meetings only to give a news conference after I left saying that, 'US Tariffs were kind of insulting' and he 'will not be pushed around.' Very dishonest & weak. Our tariffs are in response to his of 270% on dairy!""Meanwhile, Trudeau's office added that the dairy tariffs were primarily a reaction to Trump's decision to levy charges on steel and aluminum imports from Canada, Mexico and the EU. Moreover, protective measures like Canada's dairy tariff are very common throughout the world. Lest we forget, the United States has imposed tariffs to protect several of its industries, starting from the 350% tariff on tobacco to 160% on shelled peanuts.Trudeau said that Germany stood by the ""jointly agreed communique"" despite Trump's decision to back out.

 is scheduled to report second-quarter 2018 results before the opening bell on Jul 18.In the last quarter, Grainger posted earnings of $4.18 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a significant margin of around 23%. The company maintained its trend of surpassing estimates in the trailing four quarters, recording an average positive earnings surprise of 18.7%.We expect Grainger to score an earnings beat in the to-be-reported quarter as well. | Our proven model shows that Grainger has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is perfectly the case here as you will see below: Grainger has an Earnings ESP of +0.69% as the Most Accurate estimate of $3.80 is pegged higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.77. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . The company carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.The company is in the middle of a substantial transformation of the Canada business. Its focus on improving the business' cost structure through branch reductions, improving service to customers and the creation of North American centers of excellence will drive results. However, the segment continues to face rising expenses. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimates, net sales in the Canada segment are likely to dip 4% to $182 million in the second quarter. Moreover, the segment will likely report an adjusted operating loss of $21 million.The weakness in the Canada operations will be offset by continued momentum in the United States segment. Focus on pricing strategies, volume growth and an improving demand environment remain catalysts for the segment's performance in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Grainger's quarterly sales in the United States is $2.1 billion, reflecting around 7% year over year rise. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted operating income of the segment is pegged at $333 million in the second quarter.In the second quarter, Grainger is expected to benefit from improved price mix, digital marketing strategies and the impact of the tax reform. However, elevated expenses are likely to affect results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Grainger's earnings per share is pegged at $3.77 for the first quarter, reflecting year-over-year growth of 38%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total sales of $2.81 billion also indicates nearly 8% increase from the prior-year quarter.In addition, Grainger's price performance has been impressive over the past year. Shares of the company have appreciated around 80% outperforming growth of 51% recorded by the  .Here are some other companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:HD Supply Holdings, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +2.07% and a Zacks Rank #2.

ave you been paying attention to shares of  ? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 6.7% over the past month. CTAS hit a new 52-week high of $184.68 in the previous session. Cintas has gained 18.4% since the start of the year compared to the -6.4% move for the Industrial Products sector and the 16.1% year-to-date return for its peer group.The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on March 22, 2018, Cintas reported EPS of $1.37 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.24 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 1.35%.For the current fiscal year, Cintas is expected to post earnings of $5.83 per share on $6.44 billion in revenues. Meanwhile, for the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $6.97 per share on $6.79 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 19.7% and 5.42%, respectively.Cintas may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for CTAS? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Cintas has a Value Score of C. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are B and D, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 31.7X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 28.2X versus its peer group's average of 18.5X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 2.64. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective. | We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Cintas currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Cintas meets the list of requirements. Thus, it seems as though CTAS shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.Shares of Cintas have been rising, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also looking good, including KION GROUP  , HD Supply Holdings  , and Ashtead Group  , all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.However, it is worth noting that the Zacks Industry Rank for this group is in the bottom half of the ranking, so it isn't all good news for Cintas. Still, the fundamentals for CTAS are promising, and it still has potential despite being at a 52-week high.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"n May 23, we issued an updated research report on  .The business services provider aims to continually achieve revenue build-up by increasing penetration levels at existing customers and broadening the customer base to include fresh business segments. The company also identifies additional product and service opportunities for its current and future customers to expand its portfolio. Revenues have witnessed an uptrend over the past few quarters. From 2010 to 2017, revenues of the company have recorded a compounded annual growth rate of 5.2%. Third-quarter fiscal 2018 revenues increased 26.6% year over year to $1,589.1 million while organic growth improved 7.8%.The successful integration of G&K Services Inc. has expanded Cintas' customer profile and augmented its revenues. The combined company caters to more than 1 million customers with an extended product portfolio and additional processing capacity. Customer service has also improved with increased route density. The synergies from the combined operations are expected to yield $130 million to $140 million in cost savings from the fourth year of its operation. The transaction is anticipated to be accretive to Cintas' future earnings.In addition, Cintas has a strong balance sheet with adequate liquidity to meet its working capital requirements. Over the years, the company has consistently returned significant cash to its shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Its investment strategy takes a holistic view of the rapidly evolving market and deploys a dynamic capital allocation approach to focus on the relative value of the various sectors within the broader industry. With a diligent execution of operational plans, Cintas has outperformed the  with an average return of 22.7% in the last six months compared with a rise of 20% for the latter.At the same time, Cintas continues to benefit from the U.S. tax reform and provided bullish guidance for fourth-quarter fiscal 2018. Revenues are projected to be $1,625-$1,645 million. Earnings from continuing operations are expected to be between $1.64 and $1.69 per share. This assumes a fiscal fourth-quarter tax rate of 24%.However, Cintas procures raw materials from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers, making it susceptible to market risks which are beyond its control. Its first aid and fire protection services are decidedly commoditized markets and hence are subject to fierce competition. As such, the company has to continually invest in value drivers to fend off competition, which further weakens its profitability. Moreover, some customers have started to perform certain in-house services themselves instead of outsourcing them to Cintas. This resulted in some loss of businesses.Nevertheless, we remain impressed with the inherent growth potential of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock. Some other top-ranked stocks in the industry are Altra Industrial Motion Corp.  , IDEX Corporation  and Kadant Inc.  , each carrying a Zacks Rank #2.

These automatic functioning lights are highly useful to United States where the incidence of power outage is higher than any other developed country. Encouragingly, elevated usage of these lights will likely spur demand for Cintas' services, moving ahead.A survey conducted by Harris Insights & Analytics revealed that more than 34% of American adults consider their buildings unsafe during power loss.

The Roomba maker had an excellent 2017 as sales jumped 34% to $884 million with help from a strong holiday-season outing for its newest round of vacuum models.Fears of an influx of competition have pushed the stock lower lately. And those competitive threats are worth keeping an eye on, since they'll likely hurt iRobot's profitability over the short term. In fact, operating margin dipped to 8.7% of sales last year from 9.2% in 2016, and CEO Colin Angle and his team expect earnings to  , or about the time that the market leaders will become firmly established.IRobot likely won't boast anything like its current 60% market share over the long run. But, if management is right about this industry's  , and assuming the company continues pushing the robotic cleaning niche forward with design and functionality improvements, then iRobot should earn a significant chunk of a huge market. In the meantime, investors have good reasons to expect sales to cross $1 billion in 2018 to mark 20% growth over last year's impressive result.Image source: iRobot. It was little more than a decade ago that the bulk of television viewing was done on the networks' time schedule. People still gathered around the TV set at designated times to catch their favorite programs, but that decades-old dynamic has undergone a paradigm shift.Netflix first destroyed the model of the video store, allowing people to choose their movies and TV shows in advance and receive them in the mail in little red envelopes -- in the order of their choosing. The debut of streaming in 2007 not only succeeded in disrupting Netflix's own model, but sent the secular television and cable industries into decline.The company  worldwide, and with the stock gaining more than 900% over the last five years, you might think that train has left the station -- but I think Netflix is only getting started.The rate of global fixed broadband subscribers is still growing, and is expected to top roughly 1 billion by 2023. More enthusiastic estimates put that number even higher. If those figures are even close to accurate, the Netflix addressable market will continue to expand, and the company could grow its viewing base many times over from broadband customers alone. That disregards the fact that many of the company's customers will consume its content strictly from mobile sources -- which eliminates the need for wired broadband.Image source: Netflix.The company isn't stopping there. At an event last year, CEO Reed Hastings described a process developed by the company for  to achieve incredible picture quality even with slower internet speeds, like those found in many developing countries.The worldwide trend toward streaming shows no signs of slowing, and Netflix is best positioned to benefit from the cultural shift it pioneered just a decade ago.

Revenue grew by 27% year over year, to $1.6 billion. Net income from continuing operations was up a jaw-dropping 152.9% year over year.

" (NASDAQ: FB) has been one of the great investment successes of this past decade. The company's social media platform has attracted billions in advertiser spending that has propelled it to become one of the most profitable companies out there. With Congress taking a deeper look at the company's business and the recent revelations about users' data privacy (or lack thereof), though, there are likely some investors out there looking to put money elsewhere.Though Facebook's performance over the past several years will be incredibly hard to replicate, we asked three of our investing contributors to sift through financial and business models to come up with three stocks that have a shot at meeting (or beating) Facebook's returns. Here's why they picked  (NASDAQ: VRTX) ,  (NASDAQ: CTAS) , and  (NASDAQ: CGNX) .Image source: Getty Images. Baseball legend Dizzy Dean once said, ""It's not bragging if you can do it."" One company that doesn't have to brag that it can beat Facebook's returns is Vertex Pharmaceuticals. The biotech stock nearly doubled Facebook's return last year and is performing significantly better than the social media giant so far in 2018, too.Vertex currently enjoys a monopoly in treating cystic fibrosis (CF). Its drugs Kalydeco, Orkambi, and Symdeko correct malfunctions in the CFTR gene, which causes CF. Many CF patients have gene mutations that aren't addressed by these three drugs, though. However, Vertex thinks it will have effective treatments for roughly 90% of all CF patients within the next few years.The biotech plans to achieve this goal through triple-drug combinations. Vertex already has a couple of late-stage studies of one triple-drug combo under way and plans to start a late-stage study of another combo in the next few months.  and  are also developing a triple-drug combo to treat CF, but Vertex should have a significant first-mover advantage.At a healthcare conference last month, Vertex CEO Jeff Leiden  the company has a ""problem"": It's accumulating cash very rapidly. Vertex intends to address this ""problem"" by investing in innovation, both internally and through business development deals. The biotech is using its money to develop treatments for 10 other indications. Only one or two of those pipeline programs need to succeed for Vertex to continue beating Facebook's growth. Based on the statistics mentioned above, it would seem nearly impossible for any company to keep pace with Facebook. Shockingly, one company that has kept pace is on the complete opposite end of the business spectrum: uniform rental and facility services company Cintas.It seems bizarre to think that such a business could produce the kind of stock price returns reserved for Sillicon Valley tech giants. Here's the crucial thing, though. Even though Cintas will never post gaudy revenue growth numbers, it is a  . That in and of itself has led to impressive earnings growth over time. What sets Cintas apart is this. Unlike Facebook, which can plow billions into new developments, the industry in which Cintas operates is a mature one, so there is a limit to how much it can invest and expect a certain rate of return. With few other options for its cash, Cintas' management has for years elected to manufacture per-share returns with rising dividends and stock buybacks that have outpaced FacebookHere's how this works: Over the past decade, Cintas has grown net income by 120%. That's good, but when you combine it with Cintas' share buybacks that have reduced its share count, its earnings-per-share jump to 210% over that same time frame. Sprinkle a dividend that has grown 13% annually, and you get a stock posting returns better than Facebook.Cintas is a boring, reliable business that's been around for a long time and has generated great returns for its investors. I can't imagine an investor who wouldn't be attracted to this kind of stock. . Data by  . has more than quadrupled since its initial public offering in 2012. During the same period, shares of Cognex -- a manufacturer of machine vision software and systems -- have grown almost sixfold.Wait, what exactly is machine vision, you may ask? In its simplistic form, machine vision systems capture digital images that can be processed by computers to facilitate quick decision making. So for example, such a system could inspect thousands of machine parts per minute on a production line to detect and help eliminate defects in the least possible time and cost. As you might have already guessed, Cognex's business has a lot to do with automation and robotics, and that's where the stock's potential lies. , Cognex's sales jumped 39% year over year, but a net loss hit the stock. Blame it on a one-time charge under the new U.S. tax legislation -- otherwise, Cognex's net income shot up 46% year over year. 2017 was a record year for the company.Management is  , projecting sales from areas like 3D products and logistics to grow 50% annually in the near future. Meanwhile, markets like automotive and consumer electronics continue to grow at a strong clip as more and more companies are automating their processes. If you believe as I do that the artificial intelligence revolution is just getting started, don't be surprised if Cognex shares zoom past Facebook in the coming years.Motley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.

t's one thing for me to sit here from my office and write about stocks I like and don't like. While we at The Motley Feel keep track of our recommendations over time and how we perform through  , nothing compares to a stock recommendation that comes with real money behind it. Companies in which we have invested are the stock ideas we pursue with the highest conviction and are most likely to scrutinize over time.With this in mind, I thought I would share three companies that I recently added to my portfolio: uniform rental company  (NASDAQ: CTAS) , beauty and personal care product retailer  (NYSE: EL) , and  maker  (NYSE: ICE) . Here's why I think they are great investments and why they made it into my portfolio.Image source: Getty Images.To me, the term competitive advantage means a company has some special sauce that makes its business hard to disrupt. The other two companies here, Estee Lauder and Intercontinental Exchange, have more conventional competitive advantages with brands and the network effect, respectively. By most measures, Cintas doesn't have a traditional competitive advantage as its primary business is renting uniforms to businesses and providing other office and business-related products and services. It has more of an unorthodox advantage, though. Who actually wants to disrupt it?Like other bland businesses like  and  , there aren't a lot of people frothing at the mouth to get in on the uniform rental, floor care, or restroom supply business. Shame for them, and all the better for Cintas' shareholders. What has made Cintas successful is that the company has done a great job of embedding itself into the everyday operations of businesses by providing them with services that may not be well suited to have on site (think laundry or industrial cleaning equipment). This has the double effect of creating a recurring revenue stream as well as giving opportunities to cross-sell its other products such as restroom supplies and first aid equipment. As the largest player in this market, Cintas can employ the economies of scale for more efficient delivery routes and better utilization of distribution and services centers. All of that translates to higher margins.What's even more important from an investor's perspective is that Cintas has been able to turn those seemingly boring business lines into a  that management has used to generously reward shareholders over the years. Over the past decade, Cintas has grown its dividend by 244% and reduced its overall share count by 28%, which has translated into market-crushing returns. . Data by  .Hopefully, someone looking for their next great business idea doesn't read this and determine that it wants to take on Cintas, because this under-the-radar stock has been a gem for long-term investors.I'm probably the last person you want to take advice from when it comes to skin, fragrance, hair, or other beauty products. However, I don't need to know the dermatological benefits of jojoba oil to see a global brand powerhouse that has a fantastic track record of making value-creating acquisitions and leveraging its distribution and marketing savvy to generate incredible returns for investors.Jo Malone, one of Estee Lauder's signature brands. Data source: The Estee Lauder Companies.Brands can be an incredibly powerful competitive advantage over the short term that can command prices over commodity products and generate high returns. Conversely, a great brand can be very hard to preserve for long-term advantage. Trends and tastes change, and overambitious sales of luxury brands can cause a brand to lose its cachet. That's part of the appeal of Estee Lauder, though. Its suite of brands and private-label deals cover a wide range of prices and personal tastes that fit a spectrum of customers in the world of beauty and personal care. Also, by being a serial acquirer, it can restock its top-shelf offerings as pricing power erodes over time. Over the past three years, the company has acquired Editions de Parfume Frederic Malle, Kilian, Rodin, and Le Labo. You don't have to be a beauty expert to imagine the margins on these products when you glance at their online retail sites.Online sales hint at the other thing Estee Lauder does exceptionally well: selling its products in the right places. Like many of its peers, the company has a presence in department stores, specialty retail, and a burgeoning e-commerce platform, but it also is investing heavily in its own branded brick-and-mortar stores as well as travel retail (think duty-free stores in international airports). This broad presence has allowed Estee Lauder to shake off  and  .One thing that I'm less excited about is the company's valuation. By every valuation metric imaginable, shares of Estee Lauder aren't cheap. The company is going to have to deliver those double-digit growth rates for several years in a row to justify its 22 times EBITDA multiple, but management has a decade-long history of generating returns on equity of 30% or more. As much as the value investor in me grates at the idea of paying that kind of premium, Estee Lauder is a quality business worth a premium to the market.One of the most reliable competitive advantages upon which an investor can build a thesis is one with high switching costs. If you have a business that makes it prohibitively expensive to leave your product or service, then you likely have a business that will have high rates of recurring revenue and cash flow generation. That description fits Intercontinental Exchange to a T, and its role as a  maker is quite possibly the greatest example of a business with high switching costs.The easiest way to describe Intercontinental Exchange's -- also known as ICE -- business to people is to say that it is the company that owns the New York Stock Exchange. In reality, though, that is just scratching the surface of ICE. The company owns multiple equity exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange globally as well as exchanges for derivative contracts -- options and futures -- ranging from energy, agriculture, and financial instruments. What makes ICE's exchange markets so sticky for customers is that they provide liquidity (large amounts of buyers and sellers) and transparency (fast and reliable data for pricing). In exchange, ICE takes a cut of every transaction. What's more, the company can sell all of that valuable exchange data to traders.Here's the kicker for investors: It's an extremely high-margin business that generates gobs of free cash flow to reward shareholders. In 2017, ICE had a 51% operating margin and a 29% free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by revenue). All of that cash has enabled the company to make a slew of acquisitions as well as return a healthy portion of cash to its investors  .No business is immortal, but the switching costs in this one are immense (imagine a company switching from the NYSE to Chicago Stock Exchange. Oh, wait, ICE  ). That makes ICE's business incredibly hard to disrupt and an investment I think will pay off over the long haul.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Intercontinental Exchange wasn't one of them!

 , a leading business service provider, is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results after the closing bell on Mar 22. The company is likely to report higher revenues from Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products segment, accounting for lion's share of total revenues, due to improved demand for its products.This, in turn, is likely to result in higher earnings for the quarter.Cintas recorded industry-leading revenue growth over the past few quarters, with continued focus on core businesses. New business wins, deeper penetration of existing customers with more products and services, and customer retention remain key strengths of the company. In addition, Cintas identifies additional product and service opportunities for its current and future customers to expand the company's portfolio. This focused approach for steady top-line growth is likely to benefit the company in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Moreover, the successful integration of G&K Services Inc. is likely to expand Cintas' customer profile and augment its revenues. With annual revenues of approximately $1 billion, G&K Services has more than 170,000 customers in the United States and Canada. The combined company is expected to cater to more than one million business customers with an extended product portfolio and additional processing capacity. Customer service is also likely to improve with increased route density.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products segment revenues is pegged at $1,279 million, up from $993.4 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Total quarterly revenues are expected to be $1,568 million, up from $1,281 million reported in the year-earlier period.However, a persistently challenging macroeconomic environment has mostly driven customers to perform certain in-house services themselves instead of outsourcing them to Cintas. This is expected to result in some loss of businesses. In addition, significant international operations expose it to risks of fluctuation in foreign exchange rates, which in turn, is likely to impact its financial results.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Cintas is likely to beat on earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is 0.00%, as both are pegged at $1.24.

Although this increases the predictive power of ESP, we also need a positive ESP to make us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Accenture plc  has an Earnings ESP of +0.07% and a Zacks Rank #3.

(Revised)@2018-04-04@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/high-rental-uniform-sales-to-aid-cintas-ctas-q3-earnings-revised-2018-04-04
t has been about a month since the last earnings report for  . Shares have added about 6.1% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is CTAS due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Cintas posted impressive third-quarter fiscal 2018 (ended Feb 28, 2018) results backed by healthy top-line growth. Net income from continuing operations for the quarter surged 152.9% to $295.8 million or $2.66 per share from $116.9 million or $1.06 per share recorded in the year-earlier quarter. Adjusted earnings came in at $1.37 per share, which comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.24.Quarterly revenues increased 26.6% year over year to $1,589.1 million, exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,568 million. Organic growth for the reported quarter improved 7.8% year over year, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.Operating income was $200 million, up 4.2% year over year. Operating income, excluding G&K transaction and integration expenses and the one-time cash payment to employees, increased 24% year over year, resulting in an operating margin of 15.7%. revenues for the fiscal third quarter improved 30% year over year to $1,284.5 million and accounted for 80.8% of the total revenues. The segment recorded year-over-year organic growth of 6.5%. However, gross margin for the segment decreased to 44.1% from 45.1% in the year-ago quarter.At the  segment, revenues were up 14% year over year to $304.6 million and accounted for 19.2% of the total revenues. This segment includes the First Aid and Safety Services, and All Other businesses that comprise the Fire Protection Services and Direct Sale business. The First Aid and Safety Services recorded organic growth of 10%. The segment's gross margin increased to 44% from 42.9% in the year-ago quarter.Cintas has a solid financial position with adequate liquidity. At the end of the fiscal third quarter, cash and cash equivalents were $152.6 million, while long-term debt was $2,534.8 million.In the first nine months of fiscal 2018, net cash from operating activities was $660.9 million compared with $483.8 million in the prior-year period. Free cash flow in the same period increased to $464.8 million from $265.1 million reported in the year-ago period.The benefits from the U.S. tax reform in the third fiscal quarter were significant. Cintas provided specific guidance for fourth-quarter fiscal 2018. Revenues are projected to be $1,625-$1,645 million. Earnings from continuing operations are expected to be between $1.64 and $1.69 per share. This assumes a fiscal fourth-quarter tax rate of 24%. This earnings per share guidance excludes future G&K transaction and integration expenses related to the acquisition.In the recently-reported quarter, Cintas made solid progress on two significant long-term investments. The first is the acquisition of G&K. It has now closed 60 or 95% of redundant operations, and has converted 65% of G&K locations to Cintas operating systems.The second is the implementation of an enterprise resource planning system. Cintas continues to convert more operations to the system 79 so far, and the roll-out remains on schedule. It aims to be a stronger company with this new technology.Cintas continues to deliver organic growth through superior execution of its operational plans. We remain encouraged by the company's stellar quarterly performance. The fiscal fourth quarter will mark the anniversary of the G&K acquisition.In the fiscal fourth quarter, the G&K transaction and integration expenses will be incurred, as Cintas continues to integrate this significant acquisition, with a total estimate of $10-$15 million.In the past month  investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates. There has been one revision higher for the current quarter. | At this time, CTAS has a nice Growth Score of B, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. However, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Zacks' style scores indicate that the company's stock is suitable for growth and momentum investors.Estimates have been trending upward for the stock and the magnitude of this revision looks promising. Notably, CTAS has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

ne stock that might be an intriguing choice for investors right now is  . This is because this security in the Uniform and Related space is seeing solid earnings estimate revision activity and is in great company from a Zacks Industry Rank perspective.This is important because, often times, a rising tide will lift all boats in an industry, as there can be broad trends taking place in a segment that are boosting securities across the board. This is arguably taking place in the Uniform and Related space as it currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 5 out of more than 250 industries, suggesting it is well-positioned from this perspective, especially when compared to other segments out there.Meanwhile, Cintas is actually looking pretty good on its own too. The firm has seen solid earnings estimate revision activity over the past month, suggesting analysts are becoming a bit more bullish on the firm's prospects in both the short and long term. | In fact, over the past month, current quarter estimates have risen from $1.43 per share to $1.65 per share, while current year estimates have risen from $5.45 per share to $5.82 per share. This has helped CTAS to earn a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), further underscoring the company's solid position. You can see  .So, if you are looking for a decent pick in a strong industry, consider Cintas. Not only is its industry currently in the top third, but it is seeing solid estimate revisions as of late, suggesting it could be a very interesting choice for investors seeking a name in this great industry segment.It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

n Apr 3, we issued an updated research report on business services provider,  .Cintas maintains a focused approach for steady top-line growth. Revenues have been witnessing an increasing trend over the past few quarters. From 2010-2017, revenues of the company have recorded a compounded annual growth rate of 5.2%. Third-quarter fiscal 2018 revenues increased 26.6% year over year to $1,589.1 million while organic growth improved 7.8%.Cintas aims to continually achieve revenue build-up by increasing penetration levels at existing customers and broadening the customer base to include fresh business segments. Cintas also identifies additional product and service opportunities for its current and future customers to expand its portfolio.The successful integration of G&K Services Inc. is further likely to expand Cintas' customer profile and augment its revenues. The combined company is likely to cater to more than one million customers with an extended product portfolio and additional processing capacity. Customer service is also likely to improve with increased route density. The synergies from the combined operations are expected to yield $130 million to $140 million in cost savings from the fourth year of its operation. The transaction is anticipated to be accretive to Cintas' future earnings.In addition, Cintas has a strong balance sheet with adequate liquidity to meet its working capital requirements. Over the years, the company has consistently returned significant cash to its shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Its investment strategy takes a holistic view of the rapidly evolving market and deploys a dynamic capital allocation approach to focus on the relative value of the various sectors within the broader industry. Cintas has outperformed the  with an average return of 3.9% in the last three months compared with a gain of 3.4% for the latter.At the same time, Cintas continues to benefit from the U.S. tax reform and provided bullish guidance for fourth-quarter fiscal 2018. Revenues are projected to be $1,625-$1,645 million. Earnings from continuing operations are expected to be between $1.64 and $1.69 per share. This assumes a fiscal fourth-quarter tax rate of 24%.However, Cintas procures raw materials from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers, making it susceptible to market risks which are beyond its control. A continuous increase in raw material costs such as cotton also weighs on its margins. Cintas faces stiff competition from national, regional and local companies on various factors such as design, price, quality, service and convenience to the customers. Specifically, its first aid and fire protection services are decidedly commoditized markets and hence are subject to fierce competition. As such, the company has to continually invest in value drivers to fend off competition, which further weakens its profitability. Moreover, some customers have started to perform certain in-house services themselves instead of outsourcing them to Cintas. This resulted in some loss of businesses.Nevertheless, we remain impressed with the inherent growth potential of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.

"n recent trading, shares of Cintas Corporation (Symbol: CTAS) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $171.17, changing hands for $171.70/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 6 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Cintas Corporation, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $152.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $200.00. The standard deviation is $18.594.But the whole reason to look at the  CTAS price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with CTAS crossing above that average target price of $171.17/share, investors in CTAS have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $171.17 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Cintas Corporation:

"uying and holding high-quality growth stocks is a fantastic way to beat the market over the long term. But investors are often hesitant to buy growth stocks for a number of reasons, including the outsize volatility that tends to come with owning them, their seemingly high valuations, or doubt surrounding their ability to sustain growth.To that end, we asked three top Motley Fool investors to each pick a growth stock that forward-looking investors can appreciate. Read on to learn why they chose  (NYSE: NKE) ,  (NASDAQ: CTAS) , and  (NASDAQ: ATVI) .IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Despite a difficult retail environment and a rash of sporting-goods chain bankruptcies in North America over the past year and a half, Nike has been able to deliver one  by leaning on the relative strength of its thriving international and direct-to-consumer businesses.But the athletic-footwear and sportswear giant could be firing on all cylinders soon. When Nike released its fiscal third-quarter 2018 results two weeks ago, management noted that they saw a ""significant reversal of trend in North America"" toward the end of the quarter. They further predicted that their largest geography should see relatively flat sales on a year-over-year basis in the current quarter, then return to growth in the first half of fiscal 2019.Of course, shares are already up modestly so far this calendar year as the market begins to anticipate Nike's impending acceleration in growth. But I think forward-looking investors who buy now stand to be handsomely rewarded in the coming quarters once that growth becomes more evident. Some growth stocks are pretty speculative investments, but not uniform renter Cintas. Its shares have  over the past decade, and look ready to keep on growing as it benefits from current employment trends and a fractured domestic uniform-rental market.Cintas not only rents work uniforms -- the bulk of its business -- but also provides a motley collection of other business services including floor mat rental, fire and safety services, and restroom restocking. Demand in all of these niches increases as labor participation increases, and employment is up, particularly in the manufacturing, warehousing, healthcare, hospitality, and transportation sectors, in which work uniforms are common.Thanks to its size and industry-leading position, Cintas was able to  in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Year-over-year revenue was up 26.4%, while net income increased 12.9% year over year. The company seems to be absorbing competitor G&K Services, which it acquired in 2017. And the uniform-rental market is still highly fractured, which gives Cintas plenty of potential targets to acquire and continue its growth.Forward-looking investors shouldn't be scared off by Cintas' past performance. The company's growth engine looks like it'll be chugging along for years to come. (Activision Blizzard): Video games are still a relatively young art form. The first commercial screening of a movie happened in 1895. The first arcade game was released in 1970. It's not a perfect comparison, but if you think about the staggering change, remarkable growth, and increased cultural significance that the movie business has seen with roughly 75 additional years in operation, it's not hard to imagine that video games still have a lot of untapped potential. The interactive nature of video games only adds to that potential.If gaming continues to climb in popularity, and that seems like a sound bet, Activision Blizzard is in line to be one of the biggest beneficiaries. The company has a wealth of strong franchise properties, including  ,  ,  , and  , and a stable of development teams with a stellar track record of high-quality output. With these assets, the company is on track to take advantage of trends that are shaping the industry. Growth for digital downloads and in-game purchases appears to be on track to continue, and the company still has big expansion opportunities in China and other emerging markets.Activision Blizzard has growth avenues outside of traditional gaming as well. If esports takes off, the company is in position to be one of the biggest winners. The company published seven out of the 20 most watched games on  's Twitch streaming platform in 2017, and early tracking suggests a solid debut for the company's professional  . Activision is also looking to make film adaptations of its big gaming franchises and transition these properties into merchandizing juggernauts -- similarly to the way that  has built cross-medium sensations.For those looking to invest in the future of entertainment, Activision Blizzard is a standout bet.We can't absolutely guarantee that the future for these three promising growth stocks will play out as our theses suggest. But between Nike's recent turn for the better in North America, favorable employment and rental-industry trends for Cintas, and Activision's central role in the continued rise of the video gaming market, we believe they're each uniquely poised to keep on winning over the long term.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Activision Blizzard wasn't one of them!

"n Apr 3, we issued an updated research report on business services provider,  .Cintas maintains a focused approach for steady top-line growth. Revenues have been witnessing an increasing trend over the past few quarters. From 2010-2017, revenues of the company have recorded a compounded annual growth rate of 5.2%. Third-quarter fiscal 2018 revenues increased 26.6% year over year to $1,589.1 million while organic growth improved 7.8%.Cintas aims to continually achieve revenue build-up by increasing penetration levels at existing customers and broadening the customer base to include fresh business segments. Cintas also identifies additional product and service opportunities for its current and future customers to expand its portfolio.The successful integration of G&K Services Inc. is further likely to expand Cintas' customer profile and augment its revenues. The combined company is likely to cater to more than 1 billion customers with an extended product portfolio and additional processing capacity. Customer service is also likely to improve with increased route density. The synergies from the combined operations are expected to yield $130 million to $140 million in cost savings from the fourth year of its operation. The transaction is anticipated to be accretive to Cintas' future earnings.In addition, Cintas has a strong balance sheet with adequate liquidity to meet its working capital requirements. Over the years, the company has consistently returned significant cash to its shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Its investment strategy takes a holistic view of the rapidly evolving market and deploys a dynamic capital allocation approach to focus on the relative value of the various sectors within the broader industry. Cintas has outperformed the  with an average return of 3.9% in the last three months compared with a gain of 3.4% for the latter.At the same time, Cintas continues to benefit from the U.S. tax reform and provided bullish guidance for fourth-quarter fiscal 2018. Revenues are projected to be $1,625-$1,645 million. Earnings from continuing operations are expected to be between $1.64 and $1.69 per share. This assumes a fiscal fourth-quarter tax rate of 24%.However, Cintas procures raw materials from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers, making it susceptible to market risks which are beyond its control. A continuous increase in raw material costs such as cotton also weighs on its margins. Cintas faces stiff competition from national, regional and local companies on various factors such as design, price, quality, service and convenience to the customers. Specifically, its first aid and fire protection services are decidedly commoditized markets and hence are subject to fierce competition. As such, the company has to continually invest in value drivers to fend off competition, which further weakens its profitability. Moreover, some customers have started to perform certain in-house services themselves instead of outsourcing them to Cintas. This resulted in some loss of businesses.Nevertheless, we remain impressed with the inherent growth potential of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. Some better-ranked stocks in the broader industry are Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc.  , Dover Corporation  and EnPro Industries, Inc.  , each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see  .Applied Industrial Technologies has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 12%.

It topped estimates in each of the trailing four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 7.3%.EnPro Industries has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 22.3%.Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

Image source: The Motley Fool. (NASDAQ: CTAS)Q3 2018 March 22, 2018 Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Cintas Quarterly Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Hansen, senior VP of finance and chief financial officer.Please go ahead, sir. -- Thank you. Good evening, and thanks for joining us tonight. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas' senior vice president and treasurer. We will discuss our third-quarter results for fiscal 2018.After our commentary, we will be happy to answer any questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides us safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Cintas wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. to learn about these picks!I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. In a moment, we're going to share with you our third-quarter results, which represent another strong quarter of execution and performance. There's a lot of noise in our results. So we'll do our best to help you decipher the performance of the business.Before diving into the numbers, though, we thought it fitting to recognize that yesterday was the anniversary of the closing of G&K Services deal. The past year has been quite transformative for Cintas. Our employees, whom we call partners, including our partners who came to us from G&K, have done some great foundational work over the last year to position us for success going forward. We remain as excited as ever about our future.In early February, we were thrilled to be able to share with our partners a one-time cash payment. The timing couldn't have been better for us given the work done during the past year since March 21 of 2017. As our chairman and CEO, Scott Farmer, indicated in today's press release, the recently passed U.S. tax reform legislation is good for Cintas, our shareholders, and our customers.And, again, our success wouldn't have been possible without our motivated and engaged partners, and we were excited to share it with them. Moving on to our third-quarter results. Our revenue for the third quarter, which ended February 28, was $1.589 billion, an increase of 26.6% over last year's third quarter. The organic revenue growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 7.8%.The organic revenue growth rate for the uniform rental and facility services segment was 6.5%, and the organic growth rate of the first aid and safety services segment was 10%. Reported operating income for the third quarter of $200 million compared to $192 million in last year's third quarter. However, there are some items worth noting that impacted the comparability of results year over year. First, our operating income was reduced $10 million in the third quarter of fiscal '18 and $9 million in the third quarter of fiscal '17 by transaction and integration expenses related to the G&K Services acquisition.Second, operating income in the third quarter of fiscal '18 was also reduced by the one-time cash payment to Cintas partners that I just mentioned, which amounted to an expense of approximately $40 million. Excluding these two items, our third-quarter operating income was approximately $250 million, or 15.7% of revenue. This measurement is consistent with the way in which we reported our first two quarters of this fiscal year. Keep in mind that operating income includes $12 million of intangible asset amortization expense from the purchase price accounting of the G&K deal, and $5 million of incremental depreciation and implementation costs of our enterprise resource planning system, SAP.These two items total 1.2% of revenue. Reported net income from continuing operations for the third quarter of $296 million increased 152.9% from last year's third quarter. Reported earnings per diluted share, or EPS, from continuing operations for the third quarter were $2.66, compared to $1.06 in last year's third quarter. Again, there were a handful of items that impacted the comparability of net income and EPS results to prior year.First, fiscal '18 and fiscal '17 third-quarter EPS included a negative impact of $0.06 from G&K transaction and integration expenses. Second, fiscal '18 third-quarter EPS also included a negative impact of $0.24 from the one-time cash payment to Cintas partners. Lastly, more than offsetting these negative impacts was a significant benefit to EPS of $1.59 from the benefits of the new tax act. Excluding these items to provide better visibility to financial performance, net income dollars increased 24.1% and net income margin was 9.6%, compared to 9.8% last year, and EPS increased 22.3%.Note again that net income includes intangible asset amortization expense from the purchase price accounting of the G&K deal and incremental depreciation and implementation costs of SAP. These two items, net of tax, total 0.8% of revenue, or $0.12. In addition to strong execution on the fundamentals, our third quarter was one of solid progress on two important long-term investments, G&K and SAP. The integration of G&K remains on track.We have now closed 60 duplicate operations, which is 95% of the total planned closures. Also, 59% of G&K locations have been converted to the Cintas operating system. This is an increase from 47% at the end of the second quarter. The system conversions are very important, as they are necessary for us to achieve numerous operational synergies.These activities helped us in the third quarter to realize about $15 million in synergies, which is in line with our expectations. Regarding SAP, significant advancement continued in our implementation, which remains on schedule. In our third quarter, 24 operations were converted. A total of 79 operations have now been converted to date, which is about 25% of the total planned.As I have previously detailed, we have several third-quarter items, including the benefit of tax reform, that make the comparability of our full fiscal year results to prior year complex. Rather than provide full fiscal year guidance, we believe it's more beneficial, for the sake of simplicity, to provide specific guidance for our fourth quarter of fiscal '18. We expect fourth-quarter revenue to be in the range of $1.625 billion to $1.645 billion. I want to reiterate a point we have made in the past: In our upcoming fourth quarter, we will lap the one-year anniversary of the acquisition of G&K.For the first time, G&K's growth will be organic as opposed to inorganic. In the fourth quarter, we will report an organic growth rate that is the combination of a strongly growing Cintas legacy business and a significantly sized, acquired G&K business that historically grew slower than Cintas and that will have declined year over year in the fourth quarter. We expect this lower organic growth rate to be temporary just as it was for our first aid and safety segment after it acquired ZEE Medical. With the investment in selling resources having already been made to grow the G&K business, we expect the total uniform rental and facility services organic growth rate to accelerate as we move through fiscal 2019.For our fiscal 2018 quarter, we expect EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $1.64 to $1.69. Guidance assumes a fourth-quarter tax rate of 24%. We anticipate healthy fourth-quarter operating margins in excess of last year's fourth quarter. Note that while the EPS guidance excludes any future G&K transaction and integration expenses, we do expect that these expenses will be incurred in the fourth quarter as we continue to integrate this significant acquisition.We estimate that these expenses will range from $10 million to $15 million. I will now turn the call over to Paul. -- Thank you, Mike. First, please note that our fiscal third quarter contained the same number of workdays, 64, as the prior-year third quarter. However, on a sequential basis, it had one less workday than the second quarter. One less workday in a quarter adds an impact of approximately 50 basis points on operating margin due to many large expenses, including rental material cost, depreciation expense, and amortization expense being determined on a monthly basis instead of on a workday basis.Our upcoming fiscal fourth quarter will contain 66 days, the same number of days as the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year. We have two reportable operating segments: uniform rental and facility services, and first aid and safety services. The remainder of our business is included in all other. All other consists of fire protection services and our uniform direct sale business.First aid and safety services and all other are combined and presented as other services on the income statement. Uniform rental and facility services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, and towels, and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers en route. Uniform rental and facility Services revenue was $1.284 billion, an increase of 30% compared to last year's third quarter.Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes, the organic growth rate was 6.5%. Our uniform rental and facility services segment gross margin was 44.1% for the third quarter, compared to 45.1% in last year's third quarter. The reduction in margin is attributable to the inclusion in this year's third quarter of the lower margin G&K business. The margin of the G&K business has continued to decline as the top line has lowered.In addition, we continue to incur the typical conversion costs, which impact margins in the short term. While the assimilation of the G&K business continues at a great pace -- Mike mentioned 95% of duplicate operations have been closed -- more work remains. The G&K gross margins will improve to Cintas legacy levels as we further integrate this business and we increasingly realize more of the synergies. We are on track.Our first aid and safety services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products, and training. This segment's revenue for the third quarter was $137 million, which was 10.5% higher than last year's third quarter. On an organic basis, the growth rate for the segment was 10%. This segment's gross margin was 46.9% in the third quarter, compared to 44.8% in last year's third quarter, an increase of 210 basis points.The third quarter was another outstanding quarter for this business. Strong new business wins and expanding gross margins are evidence of the value businesses of all types place on having Cintas manage their first aid and training programs to help keep their employees healthy, safe, and ready for the workday. Our fire protection services and uniform direct sale businesses are reported in the all other category. The uniform direct sales business long-term growth rates are generally low single digits and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multimillion-dollar account.Our fire business, however, continues to grow each year at a strong pace. All other revenue was $167 million, an increase of 17% compared to last year's third quarter. The organic growth rate was 14.9%. All Other gross margin was 41.7% for the third quarter of this fiscal year, compared to 41.2% for last year's third quarter, an increase of 50 basis points.All Other gross margin expansion was driven by the higher-margin fire business. While uniform direct sale business growth was strong in the third quarter, note that the business will face some difficult sales-growth comparisons in the fourth quarter. Last year's fourth quarter benefited from a significant roll-out of new uniform styles for the pilots and flight attendants of Southwest Airlines. Large roll-outs such as these do not repeat each year, as businesses typically rebrand only every three to five years or so.The benefit from Southwest last year will be a headwind of about $13 million to this year's fourth-quarter revenue. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 30.9% in the third quarter, compared to 28.6% in last year's third quarter. Please note that the one-time cash payment to Cintas partners Mike mentioned earlier was recorded in SG&A. Excluding this one-time payment, this year's third quarter SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 28.4%, compared to 28.6% last year.SG&A benefited from improved receivables collections and favorable workers' compensation claims experience. On a year-to-date basis, SG&A, excluding the one-time payment, is up 50 basis points over last year. However, note that current-year SG&A is negatively impacted about 100 basis points by intangible asset amortization expense resulting from the purchase price accounting of the G&K acquisition and incremental SAP depreciation and implementation costs. We are getting leverage from increased revenue covering fixed costs and making good progress on reducing general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue.As Mike stated earlier, our third-quarter fiscal 2018 effective tax rate on continuing operations benefited from the new U.S. tax legislation. The benefit of the tax act to the third-quarter EPS was $1.59. Our EPS guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 assumes an effective tax rate of 24%.Note that the effective tax rate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on tax reserve build and releases relating to discrete items, including the amount of stock-compensation expense realized each period. Our cash and equivalents balance as of February 28 was $152 million, and we had $33 million in marketable securities as of quarter-end. Free cash flow in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 was $464 million, an increase of $200 million, or 75%, from the prior-year period. Capital expenditures for the first nine months of the fiscal year were $196 million.Our CAPEX by operating segment for the nine-month period was as follows: $163 million in uniform rental and facility services, $21 million in first aid and safety, and $12 million in all other. We expect fourth-quarter 2018 CAPEX to be approximately $65 million. As of February 28, total debt was $2.722 billion, consisting of $187 million in short-term debts and $2.535 billion of long-term debt. At February 28, our leverage was 2.3 times debt-to-EBITDA.Overall, our cash flow remains strong, and we expect our leverage ratio to decrease to approximately two times debt-to-EBITDA at May 31, 2018. That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions.Thank you. [Operator instructions] And we'll hear first from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. -- Hi, this is actually Greg calling on for Manav. Just wanted to hit on G&K first, if that's OK. Maybe I missed it, but could you give the revenue and growth rate you saw in the third quarter? And then maybe more broadly touch on any early signs you're seeing from a potential revenue-synergy opportunity? -- Third-quarter revenue was slightly over $230 million, and it was down about 4.7%. I would tell you, Greg, that being able to specifically identify that G&K revenue gets harder and harder as we have, as you heard us say, closed 60 locations and now that revenue is really starting to mix in with the Cintas locations, so getting a little harder and harder to identify. But those were the estimated third-quarter numbers. From a revenue-synergy standpoint, we think opportunities are going to be there.We are moving somewhat slowly on that because we want to make sure that through the large disruption of closing and system conversions that we maintain a very good customer relationship, and introducing new things to them in addition to that kind of disruption gets to be overwhelming sometimes. So we're moving fairly slowly on that. I would expect it will start to see some benefit in the back half of fiscal '19 and certainly in fiscal '20. But from our standpoint today, early signs are we feel pretty good about that opportunity in the future. -- OK. And then from the core Cintas side, I know it's a metric we don't look at quite as much anymore, but maybe some color on what you're seeing from the net add-stops and hiring from some of your existing customers. -- Yes, Greg. It's Paul. So the add-stops metric was positive. I think the only thing really of note was that we had some good lift in the dust mats area, carpeted mats.Wet and cold winters with a lot of snow, good precipitation definitely give us a little bit of a lift, but outside of that, nothing significant to add especially in terms of anything in the garment area. -- OK. Thanks, guys.Thank you. Our next question will come from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. -- Hey, good afternoon. Just following up on the G&K, you mentioned that it was down 4.7% in the quarter. I think last quarter you mentioned in your guidance $895 million to $915 million for the year. So I'm just wondering, is that still like a good number for the year? Or was this quarter a little bit better than what you're expecting previously? -- We have been very pleased with the performance of that G&K revenue block so far, and it was a little bit better than we expected in the third quarter. And I would say we're going to be at around $920 million for the year, which is slightly better than that range that we gave last quarter. And we continue to see very positive things from not just the revenue performance but overall performance. -- OK, got it. And this quarter, I guess the legacy Cintas organic growth decelerated for the second quarter to 6.5%. So I just wanted to get a little bit of extra color on sort of what you're seeing in that Cintas legacy business. Like, should we expect -- I guess G&K will be inorganic.So of course, the fourth quarter will be even lower. But just on the legacy Cintas business, is there something sort of driving the deceleration? Or is it just that the comps are getting harder? -- We believe that the execution and the performance of the business is still very good. We're very pleased with it. And as you probably noticed, we increased our guidance for the fourth quarter as well. So we still feel very good about the performance.Look, in every quarter, there are puts and takes. For the first half of the year, for example, we got a little bit of an energy headwind in the third quarter. Last year's third quarter was very strong. And so there are puts and takes in every quarter, but we're still in a range where we want to be, and we feel like we're operating very efficiently throughout this fiscal year.When you think about our fourth-quarter guidance, we effectively raised the bottom end about $67 million and the top end about $22 million, and, again, a bit of a signal that we still feel good about the business. And generally speaking, if we hit the top of that guidance range in the fourth quarter, I would expect that the legacy Cintas business may see a little bit of an uptick in organic growth in that fourth quarter. We won't report it that way because we're co-mingling the G&K and the Cintas business, but we feel good about it. -- Excellent. Thanks so much.Thank you. We'll now go to Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie Capital. -- Good afternoon, thank you. The first question is just if you could give us a sense of how to think about utilization across your facilities. I realize facility capacity is measured locally versus nationally, but maybe just give us some sense how many facilities are at, say, 75% plus utilization. What's underutilized in your platform? I know you're going through a consolidation as well.So just any color where are we, utilization-wise, however you want to answer that. -- Sure. Hamzah, as you mentioned, capacity is local, and there are some markets that are reaching their capacity. There are others that have plenty. When we need extra capacity, we will do certain short-term steps before building a fully new facility, like we may add a washer and a dryer to our wash alley.We may bump out our wash alley and make it even larger, and that will add capacity. And we usually do those things as we start to creep up on the capacity, and that allows us to expand the existing capacity. We'll continue to do those things we have in the last several years. But we will also add, I would say, something in the way of two to four plants per year.We have done that this fiscal year, and I would expect it will continue to do something like that into the future as we -- or if we continue to grow like we have been. Does that answer your question? -- Yes, that's very helpful. And then maybe any of you -- I know it's early days. There's low visibility. But any thoughts on the Trump tariffs and how that impacts your business either directly or indirectly and anything you're hearing from customers, anything you're hearing from your procurement guys? Just any sense, early sense of that. -- Well, we didn't fare too well in the market today. I'll start by that. I -- we're not seeing things from our customers yet. That's too early to tell.Certainly, we do have some things that we source out of China. We're keeping our eyes on it and how they may be affected by the list of things that may have a tariff. But I think it's too early to tell because we really don't know what's on and what's not quite yet, so too early to tell. We're keeping our eyes on it.Our goal will be if we do see some things that may be affected into the future, our goal is to do our best to resource or find efficiencies to offset. And I think we've done a fairly good job of that over the years. -- Great. Last question and I'll turn it over. Just any thoughts on how much of your marketplace is self-operated on the uniform side? And any change you're seeing in terms of outsourcing trends? Has that been pretty consistent? Any thoughts there? Appreciate it. Thank you. -- We haven't -- we talked a lot about the no programmer new business. So that is new customers that weren't in a uniform rental program previously. And we haven't seen a change. We're still having success in finding new businesses to put into uniform rental programs, so not much change in our third quarter relative to the previous several quarters. -- Great, thank you.Thank you. [Operator instructions] We'll go to Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. -- Thanks, good afternoon. Two questions. First one, could you comment on sales force productivity? And obviously, you're progressing nicely through your integration. Could you just talk to some of the developments you've had there and what's left to go and how it's working? Thanks -- We're seeing some encouraging signs, Scott. Our productivity has improved sequentially through this fiscal year, and that's with quite a few more salespeople certainly than a year ago as we brought on the G&K sales team. So we're seeing some encouraging productivity signs, but certainly, we have a ways to go. We still have productivity improvements to get, and we're confident that those will come over the course of the fourth quarter and fiscal '19. -- Great. I appreciate it. Then my follow-up is on CAPEX. If my numbers are right, it looks like the guidance reduced by maybe $15 million or $20 million this year.If you could please correct me on that and let me know. And where is that coming from? Is that a push-out? Is there anything changing with SAP? Or if you could tell us where -- if there is a change, where it is occurring? Thanks. -- Yes, I think it's -- more than anything, it's timing. We do have a lot going on in terms of the G&K integration, the SAP implementation. And some projects just tend to get pushed a little bit as we move through those integrations market by market. So I would just call it timing more than anything. -- OK, thanks, appreciate it. -- OK.Our next question will come from Judah Sokel with J.P.Morgan. -- Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you can give us an update on the four buckets that you've talked about in the past of cost synergies, which we had talked about, $130 million to $140 million. Where -- how are we progressing on each of those? -- So the -- let me start with the $15 million that we talked about in the third quarter. About half is G&A, and the other half would be in the gross margin. So from a G&A perspective, you probably saw in our third quarter that we're making some nice progress in terms of leveraging and getting that SG&A down from post-acquisition levels. So we're making some nice progress, and we have more to do.So, for example, we still have an IT presence from the legacy G&K team as we continue to roll off of that system. And so there will be some additional things to come, but we've made some really nice progress. The other bucket that we talked about are our production bucket. That is the cost of running our facilities.And as you can imagine, we're in the midst of closing a number of facilities and converting. And so while we have set up a lot of those synergies, there is some inefficiency that's going on right now in our third quarter, a little bit in our second quarter, certainly a little bit more in our fourth quarter as we do the things necessary to achieve those. So for example, we're doing a pretty good job of getting those locations closed and eliminating some duplicate labor and other costs. And we'll get more efficient as we move away from the integration market by market.But the production has come along very well, and we still expect the same kind of results that we put out a year ago. From a service perspective, I haven't done much of that heavy lifting yet. That -- as we've talked about in the past, we need to get on the same systems in markets before we can really start to get into route optimization. We've started some of that in some markets.We'll continue to do that in our fourth quarter but likely, even more heavy lifting in the first half of fiscal '19. But indications are we still feel good about capturing those synergies that we talked about. And the last bucket was the sourcing bucket, and we are making progress on that area as well. As you probably know, it takes longer to recognize that because we may be able to get new sourcing and new pricing but it takes a little while to purchase it, sow it out, get it into our distribution center, and get it into in-service inventory and then it starts amortizing, right.So we are making the -- some really nice progress there. It just takes more time to realize it. So all in all, Judah, I feel good about all four of those buckets. -- Those are really helpful color. And one other question about the 2019 comment that you guys had mentioned that you expect to see acceleration throughout the year. Is that purely a function of the G&K decline moderating and perhaps switching to growth? Or is that in the core legacy Cintas business also you're expecting some sort of pickup in that business? -- No, more than anything, it's seeing the G&K business begin to level and then start to grow and more than anything, seeing the productivity improve in our sales team that I mentioned a bit ago. -- Understood. Thank you very much. -- OK.We'll now hear from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. -- Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. Hey, Mike, are you seeing a positive impact in the business overall just from tax legislation just from your customers? Maybe any pickup in hiring or being easier to sell? It's now been approximately three months. I was wondering what you're seeing on that side of it. -- We're -- Shlomo, we're hearing some anecdotal things that the sentiment is good. I would say from the standpoint of impact to the P&L, probably not much yet. You still have to take the time to sell it and get people into uniform or get the mats out there. And as you know, we're kind of a weekly billing business and it takes a little time to accumulate some of that revenue.And so it just takes a little time. So I would say the impact in our third quarter has not been very significant, but sentiment seems to be pretty good. -- So would you expect that to be a lift in future quarters? -- I think certainly that if we see our customers spending some of the cash that they are getting from the tax reform, yes, I think that will be a benefit. It's hard to tell how much, but I think that will certainly be a good thing for all of us. -- OK, great. And then could you talk a little bit about just what drove some of the sequentially improved results in the other businesses? Is it -- what's going on in fire safety? Anything in particular that's going on you could call out? -- Shlomo, in fire, nothing in particular to call out. I mean, as we mentioned in kind of our remarks, that is a business that has grown very strongly organically for some time now. And the expectation is typically high single digits, about 10%. So as Mike said, sometimes, you have some puts and takes each quarter and there might be a little bit of a volatility but nothing to call out.So it's a good, strong, growing business. And then the direct sale business, they did have a very strong third quarter. They did have some nice wins, nothing to the extent of a Southwest Airlines roll-out that I mentioned in my -- in the comments, but still some nice good wins. And truth be told, last year's third quarter was a little light.So they had some nice, favorable comparisons in Q3. And as we've talked about in the prepared remarks, remember that direct sale business will have a very difficult comp due to Southwest rolling out last year. -- And if you don't mind, just a little housekeeping. What's the pro forma tax rate you're using for the $1.37 EPS number? -- It's 32% for the quarter. And so based on where we have -- had guided you previously, there's probably about $0.06 of a tax benefit in that $1.37 that is non-U.S. tax reform related. -- So pro forma tax rate and pre-tax income, you would use 32% to get down to your -- to the $1.37? -- Yes. For the quarter only, not year to date but for the quarter only. -- Got it. Thank you.Thank you. Our next question will come from Andy Whittmann with R.W. Baird. -- Great. Where will I start? I guess, let's talk about the $40 million payment to your partners. I assume that most of that was in the rental segment, but was there any amount that's notable that we should know for our models that was in the other segment? -- It was about 2.5% of revenue in each segment, Andy. -- OK, OK, 2.5% revenue in each segment, perfect. And then maybe just on the guidance, looking at it another way, it seems like -- well, it looks like if you adjust for the tax rate bump, it gives you about $0.25 by our estimates versus what you would've had previously. And yet, there's a pretty good guidance bump add that you've mentioned. I was just wondering -- it sounds like G&K revenue is ahead of plan.Can you maybe talk, Mike, about some of the other factors that helped you get the upside and maybe the significance of them? -- The good news -- I'll start with there are two more workdays and that certainly is beneficial, two more workdays than in the third quarter, same as last year though. Year over year, it's the same. But sequentially, that will help us. Andy, it's continuing to sell.It is working through the integration activities. We're going to get more leverage as we go into that fourth quarter. And we've seen some really nice things in the SG&A area. So I think it's just a lot of the execution along with some healthy revenue. -- Got it. Thanks. Maybe my last question is just trying to understand a little bit more detail on the characteristics of your growth in uniform rental. And you guys have answered this question about kind of add-stops, new business versus no programmers and all those things.But one of the questions I wanted to get a sense for you about is specifically on penetration of existing customers. If you were to break up that as a bucket of your growth, new sales in the quarter, how significant or how much of the growth rate is based on sales to existing customers in particular, whether it's through cross-sell, upsell, and maybe not including pricing? If you could just help us understand how important that is to your growth, that would be helpful. -- Certainly, Andy, it's important. It's not as big of a driver as new business and really has never been, but it is important to us. And while we haven't gotten specific in terms of magnitude, quantify magnitude, it is certainly second most to the new business effort that we have. So it's an important factor.We think there are lots of opportunities remaining in that area as -- particularly as we continue to penetrate with things like Carhartt and Chef Works garments and with our Signature Series restroom products. So still a lot of opportunity left but it's an important factor. -- Thank you for that. Maybe my last, last question. I was wondering -- you've been -- you've commented over the last couple of quarters on the pricing environment. You said it's been always competitive but you're getting some.How would you characterize the price that you realized in the third quarter versus what you've seen in the last few quarters? -- No change to speak of, remains pretty competitive, but no change from the last several quarters. -- Thanks, guys. Have a good evening. -- Thank you, you too.And at this time, I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Mike Hansen for any additional or closing remarks. -- Well, thank you very much for joining us tonight. We look forward to talking with you again in our fourth-quarter call that will happen in mid-July, and have a good evening.Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, again, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you all again for your participation.

Revenue jumped 27%, to $1.59 billion, accelerating from growth rates in recent quarters and outpacing what most investors had expected to see from the company's top line.  net income soared more than 150% from year-ago levels, to $296 million, but even after accounting for the one-time benefit, adjusted earnings of $1.37 per share topped the consensus forecast among those following the stock for $1.27 per share.Tax reform was the main reason why the bottom line grew so much before adjustments. Revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities helped to boost GAAP earnings by $1.59 per share, or about $175 million.Yet Cintas also saw solid gains from its business operations. Organic growth of 8% was consistent with what the company has produced in past quarters, with acquisitions accounting for the remainder of Cintas' overall sales gains.On a segment basis, the first aid and safety services segment was the better performer on an apples-to-apples basis, seeing organic sales grow 10% from year-ago levels. Yet the uniform rental and facility services business still did well, posting 6.5% organic growth on the segment's top line. Moreover, when you add in acquisitions, revenue from uniform rental and facility services soared by roughly 30%, even though pre-tax segment income for the unit was higher by less than 1%.Margin figures were mixed for Cintas. The uniform rental and facility services unit saw gross margin fall a full percentage point, to 44.1%, but margin from other sides of the business saw a similar-sized boost. Part of the cost increase came from Cintas' decision to pass through some of the benefits of tax reform in a one-time payment to employees, which cost the company about $40 million in total.CEO Scott Farmer praised the balanced contributions that all business parts made to Cintas' success. ""We are pleased to report strong third-quarter financial results,"" Farmer said, ""[as] each business unit contributed substantial revenue gains."" The CEO also noted that the acquisition of G&K and the long-awaited implementation of an enterprise resource planning system contributed to Cintas' progress over the past few months.Looking ahead, Cintas sees good times continuing. Farmer pointed out that as the company integrates its acquisitions and takes better advantage of technological capabilities, it'll be able to get stronger more quickly.Rather than making changes to its full-year guidance, though, Cintas chose to give specific guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter because of the uncertainties in anticipating the final impact of tax reform measures. For the quarter, Cintas expects sales of $1.625 to $1.645 billion, and that should translate to adjusted earnings of $1.64 to $1.69 per share. The earnings figure is quite a bit higher than most investors had expected, perhaps without fully encompassing the earnings boost from favorable tax rates going forward.Cintas investors were happy with the news, and the stock climbed 4% in after-hours trading immediately following the announcement. With the employment situation in the U.S. remaining favorable, Cintas should be able to keep doing well for the foreseeable future.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

 , a leading business service provider, is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results after the closing bell on Mar 22. The company is likely to report higher revenues from Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products segment, accounting for lion's share of total revenues, due to improved demand for its products.This, in turn, is likely to result in higher earnings for the quarter.Cintas recorded industry-leading revenue growth over the past few quarters, with continued focus on core businesses. New business wins, deeper penetration of existing customers with more products and services, and customer retention remain key strengths of the company. In addition, Cintas identifies additional product and service opportunities for its current and future customers to expand the company's portfolio. This focused approach for steady top-line growth is likely to benefit the company in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Moreover, the successful integration of G&K Services Inc. is likely to expand Cintas' customer profile and augment its revenues. With annual revenues of approximately $1 billion, G&K Services has more than 170,000 customers in the United States and Canada. The combined company is expected to cater to more than one billion business customers with an extended product portfolio and additional processing capacity. Customer service is also likely to improve with increased route density.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products segment revenues is pegged at $1,279 million, up from $993.4 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Total quarterly revenues are expected to be $1,568 million, up from $1,281 million reported in the year-earlier period.However, a persistently challenging macroeconomic environment has mostly driven customers to perform certain in-house services themselves instead of outsourcing them to Cintas. This is expected to result in some loss of businesses. In addition, significant international operations expose it to risks of fluctuation in foreign exchange rates, which in turn, is likely to impact its financial results.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Cintas is likely to beat on earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is 0.00%, as both are pegged at $1.24. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . |  Cintas has a Zacks Rank #2. Although this increases the predictive power of ESP, we also need a positive ESP to make us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Accenture plc  has an Earnings ESP of +0.07% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see  .Red Hat, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +2.24% and a Zacks Rank #3.Paychex Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +0.59% and a Zacks Rank #3.Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

" recently launched the Rosemount 8712EM Wall Mount Magnetic Flow Meter Transmitter, with powerful diagnostic capabilities and usability features. This latest transmitter is designed to help users in the metals and mining, water and wastewater as well as other industries to achieve easier and faster insight into their processes.The Rosemount 8712EM's diagnostic suite features high process noise detection as well as ground fault detection capabilities. In fact, its electrode coating diagnostic produces two set points that alerts when coating is present and disturbs the flow measurement. Its Smart Meter Verification ensures ultimate measurement confidence by consistently monitoring the health and performance of the meter. Further, the products' universal transmitter capability supports the operation of the 8712EM, with any existing magnetic flow meter sensor, permitting backwards compatibility with all Rosemount magnetic sensors.Separately, Emerson's ""Synthesis"" order-to-cash software was recently selected by Pin Oak Terminals - a hydrocarbon liquids storage and logistics terminal, based in Louisiana. The integration of the enterprise-level logistics solution with the terminal's back office, commercial and operational data will enable the facility to enhance asset availability as well as reduce operational costs.Emerson is well positioned to benefit from the global infrastructure growth, as its core businesses hold dominant positions in markets tied to energy efficiency and infrastructure spending. Moreover, environmental regulations are driving the need for new products, adding to the company's strength. We believe selected investment opportunities coupled with positive trends in certain business areas offer the company decent growth opportunities. In the past three months, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has returned 5.9%, significantly outperforming the  's gain of 1.3%.Meanwhile, the company remains optimistic about its Commercial & Residential Solutions segment as it is witnessing improving trends in the United States, Europe and Asian construction markets. Also, thriving Heating Ventilation and Air-Conditioning refrigeration markets and construction-related demand in key end markets is likely to prove conductive to its top-line performance. At the Automation Solutions segment, favorable trends in power and life sciences and improving MRO demand is expected to boost growth.Furthermore, the company's solid reputation for launching new products and technologies presents competitive advantage over its peers. This apart, Emerson has a solid history of clinching lucrative contracts in the energy infrastructure, which is impressive. We anticipate that such lucrative contract wins will remain a key growth driver, going ahead.Some other stocks worth considering from the same space include Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc.  , Cimpress N.V  and Cintas Corporation  . While Applied Industrial Technologies and Cimpress sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Cintas carries a Zacks Rank #2. You can see  .Applied Industrial Technologies has surpassed estimates in the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 11%.Cimpress has outpaced estimates thrice in the preceding four quarters, with an average earnings surprise of 65.2%.Cintas has surpassed estimates in the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 8.2%.The total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion - more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months.

ather than looking for a get-rich-quick scheme, investors are better off using the time-honored tradition of buying quality companies and holding them for the long term. That doesn't mean that every company will produce noteworthy gains. However, experience has shown that having one or more companies that significantly outperform can propel an entire portfolio to market beating returns -- and all it takes is a little time.With that in mind, we asked three Motley Fool investors to choose top companies that they believed had the potential to double investors' money over the next 10 years. They offered up compelling arguments for  (NASDAQ: CTAS) ,  (NASDAQ: ATVI) , and  (NYSE: CVNA) .Image source: Getty Images. Sure, a stock that doubles over the course of a decade sounds great. How about one that's  over the past decade, and looks poised for continued growth moving forward? That company is uniform renter Cintas, which is quietly benefiting from current economic trends and a fractured market.A steadily improving economy and low unemployment rates are a boon for Cintas, which not only rents work uniforms -- the bulk of its business -- but also provides a motley collection of other business services including floor mat rental, fire and safety equipment, and restroom restocking.Image source: Getty Images.Cintas certainly  in its most recent second-quarter of fiscal 2018. Revenue was up 26.4% year over year and net incomes were up 12.9% year over year. Some of that was due to the company's recent major acquisition of competitor G&K Services, which gave sales a boost and provided management the opportunity to find cost-saving synergies. And the good news is, it's still a fractured market which gives Cintas plenty of future opportunities to grow by acquisition.Looking at all this, it's clear that Cintas's shares could easily double in price over the next decade... or maybe even much, much sooner. Like Cintas, Activision has more than quintupled in the last decade, but I believe the best is yet to come.You might think that the developing and selling of video games is the profit engine that keeps the company running, and while they're still the heart and soul of the business, that's just the beginning.  , the company's multiplayer shooter game, had a stellar year in 2017 becoming the eighth billion-dollar franchise in the Activision Blizzard stable, as well as its fastest growing franchise.However, game sales is only part of the equation. Increasingly, the company generates the majority of its revenue from activity that occurs after the game is sold, like subscriptions, licensing, downloadable content, and in-game sales. Last year, Activision produced revenue of $7.2 billion, and more than $4 billion of that total was from these recurring sources. This provides the company with ongoing, predictable revenue streams. It also fosters deep engagement with users, with time per day exceeding 50 minutes for the second successive quarter.Image source: Getty Images.The company has other significant opportunities that could help the stock double. The  game was so popular, it became the basis for the company's entry into the esports arena -- the  League. Last year, the company announced that it had sold the rights to 12 franchises, garnering the company $20 million each for the city-based teams. The franchises also attracted some of the biggest names in sports, including New England Patriots' owner Robert Kraft, New York Mets chief operating officer Jeff Wilpon, and Andy Miller, co-owner of the Sacramento Kings.The League's inaugural season was such a success, it increased global demand for expansion teams, which the company will sell down the line in 2018. The company expects the  League to be profitable later this year, in its first full year of operations.With a steadily growing video game business, and a foothold in the nascent area of esports, Activision Blizzard is a solid bet to double in the next decade. Finding a stock that's poised to double over the next decade is easier said than done. One strategy for investors is to find a young company and let its explosive top-line growth fuel its stock price. And explosive growth is exactly what Carvana Co. offers investors.Carvana's retail units sold  fiscal 2017, compared to the prior year, which powered a similar 135% revenue increase. Total gross profit increased by 255% with total gross profit per unit (GPU) moving from $516 to $1,539 -- roughly halfway to its long-term $3,000 target. Management expects that explosive growth to remain: guidance calls for fiscal 2018 retail units and revenue to jump between 101% and 110%.Image source: Carvana.Management launched five new markets during the fourth-quarter alone, bringing its number of markets up to 44 at the end of 2017. Carvana expects to open between 30 and 40 new markets in fiscal 2018 which would bring its coverage of U.S. population to 55% -- a massive jump from 19.7% at the end of 2016. While Carvana works to expand its market coverage, management is also improving its customer acquisition cost. In fact, Carvana's 2017 cohort advertising expense per unit was $2,730, and that figure was a staggering $2,364 lower than the 2016 cohort expense.Selling cars isn't easy and it's a notoriously cyclical industry. But if you're looking at a 10 year timeline, it's easy to imagine Carvana's stock doubling as it rapidly expands its market coverage, improves its GPU, and continues to lower customer acquisition costs.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

" is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 20, before the opening bell. In the last reported quarter, the company had delivered improvement in both the top and bottom line.Last quarter, Milacron surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.76%. The company beat estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive earnings surprise of 12.8%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement. | Milacron recorded orders of $322 million in third-quarter 2017. In the first nine months of 2017, orders were up nearly 10%. This performance reflects continued strength in high-growth regions and a solid order book, both for Milacron's injection and extrusion product lines going into 2018.For the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is pegged at $303 million which projects growth of 5% over the $289 million in the prior-year quarter. The year-over-year improvement will be aided by continued orders and sales momentum along with strength in global markets, particularly in Asia and Europe and growth across all segments.According to our latest consensus estimates, Milacron is anticipated to post net sales of $168 million for the fourth quarter in its Advanced Plastic Processing Technologies (""APPT"") segment, reflecting year-over-year growth of 5%. Further, our consensus estimates indicate that net sales of Melt Delivery and Control Systems will reach $106 million in the quarter, a projected year-over-year growth of 5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Fluid Technologies is pegged at $29.7 million, a rise of 6% from the $28 million reported in the year-ago quarter.For the APPT segment, adjusted EBITDA will rise 7% year over year to $21.7 million. Adjusted EBITDA will be $6.7 million for the Fluid Technologies segment, a 13% year-over-year improvement. The Melt Delivery and Control Systems segment's adjusted EBITDA is projected at $34 million, a 4% growth over the prior year.Milacron continues to work on supply chain efforts to more effectively offset higher input cost. It remains behind schedule in realizing savings in the European plant consolidation. These inefficiencies resulted from high order rates in Europe that delayed ongoing plant consolidation efforts in the region as the company had to manufacture in both locations. This, along with higher input costs will affect results in the to-be-reported quarter.Further, pricing pressure remains a headwind in the APPT segment due to the combination of competition, low-growth environment in North America and broader commodity deflationary headwinds.Additionally, Milacron has a substantial debt to capital ratio of 65% at the end of the third quarter. Subsequently, higher interest expense will hurt margins.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter is 39 cents, a 17% decline from the 47 cents reported in the prior-year quarter.Our proven model shows that Milacron is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. The Earnings ESP for Milacron is +1.52%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of 40 cents is pegged higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 39 cents. A favorable Earnings ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . Milacron currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. It should be noted that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings.Conversely, stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Milacron's Zacks Rank #3 and Earnings ESP of +1.52% makes us reasonably confident of a likely earnings beat.Milacron has outperformed the  in the past six months. The company's shares gained around 22% compared with 20% growth recorded by the industry.Here are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Boise Cascade Company  has an Earnings ESP of +15.79% and a Zacks Rank #1. You can see  Boise Cascade's shares have surged 45% in the past six months.MasTec, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +3.10% and a Zacks Rank #2.

"nvestors in Cintas Corporation (Symbol: CTAS) saw new options begin trading this week, for the April 20th expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CTAS options chain for the new April 20th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $170.00 strike price has a current bid of $5.40. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $170.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $164.60 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CTAS, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $171.23/share today.Because the $170.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 56%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.18% return on the cash commitment, or 22.31% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Cintas Corporation, and highlighting in green where the $170.00 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $175.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.70. If an investor was to purchase shares of CTAS stock at the current price level of $171.23/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $175.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 4.95% if the stock gets called away at the April 20th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CTAS shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Cintas Corporation, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing CTAS's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $175.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $175.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 60%.

Cintas Corporation (Symbol: CTAS) presently has an above average rank, in the top 50% of the coverage universe, which suggests it is among the top most ""interesting"" ideas that merit further research by investors.But making Cintas Corporation an even more interesting and timely stock to look at, is the fact that in trading on Thursday, shares of CTAS entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $150.47 per share. We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30. In the case of Cintas Corporation, the RSI reading has hit 28.8 - by comparison, the universe of dividend stocks covered by  currently has an average RSI of 36.5. A falling stock price - all else being equal - creates a better opportunity for dividend investors to capture a higher yield. Indeed, CTAS's recent annualized dividend of 1.62/share works out to an annual yield of 1.03% based upon the recent $156.60 share price.A bullish investor could look at CTAS's 28.8 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. Among the fundamental datapoints dividend investors should investigate to decide if they are bullish on CTAS is its dividend history. In general, dividends are not always predictable; but, looking at the history chart below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue.According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, CTAS makes up 2.16% of the PowerShares DWA Industrials Momentum Portfolio ETF (Symbol: PRN) which is trading lower by about 2.6% on the day Thursday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Cintas is Oversold@2018-02-08@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/cintas-oversold-2018-02-08
nvestors' appetite for dividend growth is much like a game of chicken. We all want companies to grow their payouts as much as possible, but not so much that they compromise future financial stability. A company with a less-than-great dividend yield, after all, can make up for it with a higher dividend growth rate.If you're looking to add some income-generating stocks that could significantly grow their payments over the next few years, perhaps it's time to take a look at  ,  , and  .Data source: Ycharts. CAGR = Compound annual growth rate.Cintas' business is pretty much a bellwether for economic health. The company's uniform rental and facility services tend to wax and wane with the broader economy and unemployment rate. With unemployment currently just north of 4% and some robust gross domestic product figures lately, Cintas may do quite well in the coming years.More encouraging from an investor's perspective are the company's cost reduction efforts. After Cintas acquired rival G&K Services last year, management has been in integration mode trying to squeeze out as much operational synergy as possible. It noted on its most recent  that  , but there is still a lot of work left to be done.With the U.S. economy firing on all cylinders and Cintas' business still wringing out cost efficiencies, there is a clear path to increased earnings and cash flow to pay a higher dividend. As it stands, with just a 25% payout ratio, its free cash flow more than covers its dividend obligations. If the company maintains the rate of payout increases we have seen in recent years, it won't take long for its dividend to double.Image source: Getty Images.MPLX has been one of the most impressive growth stories in the master limited partner space for the past half-decade. Not only has it grown its payout by 26% annually, but it's been able to maintain incredible financial discipline and debt metrics that put it  . The one thing that was standing in its way was its corporate structure, but thanks to an agreement with parent  (NYSE: MPC) , that won't be as much of a problem anymore.Initially, Marathon owned MPLX with what is called a general partner stake. This is typically a small stake in the business, but with it come incentive distribution rights, or IDRs, which, for lack of a better term, are management fees. Early on, these IDRs gave Marathon a lot of incentive to grow MPLX's payout because it would entitle the parent to a greater percentage of MPLX's distributable cash flow. As companies with this corporate structure get larger, though, cost of capital increases and it's harder to maintain high growth rates. So Marathon and MPLX agreed to exchange Marathon's general partner stake for public limited partner shares. This lowers the cost of capital and aligns Marathon with the rest of MPLX's shareholders.With Marathon set to drop down several billion in assets to MPLX in 2018 and a slew of new organic growth projects slated to come on line, MPLX is targeting 10% distribution growth for 2018 and beyond. At that rate, it won't take too long for the payout to double, and investors even get a 6% yield for their trouble while they wait. data by  .It costs billions and billions to design and build out the capacity to manufacture a new commercial airliner. That means it can take years for a plane to become a profitable endeavor for a manufacturer. When Boeing started selling its signature 787 Dreamliner back in 2011, the company was posting huge losses on every plane built because of those up-front costs. Seven years into the manufacturing process, though, the company is starting to generate sizable profits from the sale of Dreamliners, especially the larger 787-9 and 787-10 variants that carry higher price tags.

hen someone tells me about a stock that's a great buy -- one that doubled or tripled in value over the last few years -- I assume it's some hot tech start-up.But juicy returns don't necessarily come from just young, risky, untested companies. And they also don't need to come from the tech sector. Here are three companies from non-tech industries -- trucks, airlines, and uniform rental -- that have turned $7,000 into $55,000 or more in less than 10 years.The best part is that they may still have room to run. Here's how  (NYSE: OSK) ,  (NYSE: LUV) , and  (NASDAQ: CTAS) are keeping the good times rolling for their investors.Even mature companies in well-established industries can outperform the stock market. Image source: Getty Images.The oldest company on the list, Oshkosh Corporation, was founded in 1917 after two inventors failed to sell their four-wheel-drive components to major automakers like  . The company branched out into specialty trucks like snowplows, and that's what landed it its first major U.S. military contract during WWII: building snowplows to quickly clear airstrips and military bases.Today, the company is still a major defense contractor and specialty truck maker, manufacturing garbage trucks, fire trucks, construction vehicles, and light armored military vehicles, among many others. Business is booming, and the stock is, too: A $7,000 investment in Oshkosh just nine years ago would be worth more than $77,000 today.And the company looks like it may continue its rapid growth. Oshkosh derived 26.6% of its revenue from its defense division in its 2017 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30. Increased federal defense spending may push that percentage even higher next year.Also, with talk of a big infrastructure package coming in 2018, Oshkosh's access equipment segment, which serves the construction industry, may see a similar boost. The segment accounted for almost half of Oshkosh's 2017 sales, and reported a 38.1% increase in net earnings in the most recent quarter. Oshkosh is looking like it's going to continue its growth.Low-cost air carrier Southwest Airlines hasn't been around as long as Oshkosh -- it didn't begin flying until 1971, and didn't fly outside of Texas until 1978. But its growth trajectory has been every bit as extraordinary as Oshkosh's. In 2003 -- just 32 years after its first Texas flight -- it became the country's largest air carrier based on number of domestic originating passengers, a distinction it holds to this day. It's also the second-largest U.S. carrier by market capitalization, just barely below  .Given such rapid growth, it's easy to see why a $7,000 investment in Southwest just nine years ago would be worth more than $55,000 today.But Southwest doesn't seem to be slowing down either. It plans to start offering flights from the West Coast to Hawaii this year -- possibly  to break  ' monopoly on inter-island flights in the Aloha State. Fears that other discount carriers like  or  would seriously eat into Southwest's profits haven't materialized, so Southwest is looking poised for a smooth flight into the new year.Cintas was founded in Cincinnati in 1929 by Doc Farmer, an out-of-work circus performer. He had an idea that was every bit as disruptive as low-cost airfare: He collected used rags that factories had thrown away, washed them, and sold them back to the factories. That may not sound particularly earth-shattering, but it was cheaper for his customers than constantly buying new rags.In the 1950s, Doc moved into the related business of uniform rental, and by the late 1960s, the company had begun to expand nationally. It used its existing nationwide distribution network to offer other business services, including floor mat rental, restroom restocking, and fire and safety equipment servicing. These industries are incredibly fragmented, and Cintas has been able to expand by leveraging its size and by gobbling up competitors -- like uniform renter G&K Services, which Cintas absorbed last year.Although uniform rental still makes up 81.4% of overall company revenue, those other business services like fire and safety equipment servicing are growing more quickly, with 10.7% year-over-year  in the most recent quarter. The overall business -- and its share price -- has grown by leaps and bounds as well. In fact, in just nine years, the company would have turned a $7,000 investment into more than $56,000, thanks to price increases and consistent dividend increases, like the 21.8% increase in 2017.As the market leader, Cintas should be able to continue offering investors superior returns.The most important thing to take away from the stories of these three companies is that you don't need to get in on the ground floor of a business to make money. All three companies have been around for well over 40 years -- and Oshkosh for more than 100 years -- and yet a $7,000 investment less than 10 years ago would still have produced amazing returns.These three companies look like they still have room to grow over the next 10, 40, or even 100 years. They're definitely worth a second look.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"n recent trading, shares of Cintas Corporation (Symbol: CTAS) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $163.14, changing hands for $164.06/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 7 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Cintas Corporation, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $130.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $185.00. The standard deviation is $20.128.But the whole reason to look at the  CTAS price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with CTAS crossing above that average target price of $163.14/share, investors in CTAS have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $163.14 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Cintas Corporation:

The outlook for the job market has been so good for so long that  with its acquisition of G&K last year.Coming into Thursday's fiscal second-quarter financial report, Cintas shareholders were hoping that the company would keep reaping the benefits of that acquisition, producing cost savings that could translate into higher profits. Cintas' results were encouraging, and the synergies that it has found from integrating G&K into its operations bode well for its future. Let's take a closer look at Cintas' latest numbers and what they say about its prospects.Image source: Cintas.Cintas' fiscal second-quarter results continued the  . Revenue rose 26% to $1.61 billion, which was slightly better than what most of those following the stock had expected. Net income from continuing operations was higher by 13% to $137.7 million, and that translated into adjusted earnings of $1.31 per share, topping the consensus forecast among investors for $1.27 per share.Cintas saw favorable trends play out both for its core business and its recent acquisition. Although G&K produced most of the rise in Cintas' top line, organic revenue growth came in at almost 8%, sustaining a solid pace for the company. The first aid and safety services segment saw sharper gains organically, with segment revenue rising 11%. The uniform rental and facility services business wasn't too far behind, with organic top-line gains of more than 7%.G&K's influence also made itself felt in the mix of business that Cintas got during the quarter. Uniform rental and facility services sales climbed at more than a 30% clip during the quarter, compared to just over 10% for Cintas' other businesses.Yet costs still remain a consideration for the company. In uniform rental and facility services, costs rose at a faster pace than revenue, leading to slight gross margin compression. The picture was more favorable with first aid and safety services, where costs were up less than 8%, but a 30% jump in overhead expenses also weighed on operating income and pointed to the need for further efficiency efforts.CEO Scott Farmer was nevertheless encouraged by Cintas' accomplishments. ""Our pace [in integrating G&K] increased in the second quarter,"" Farmer said, ""and we realized about $14 million in synergies, which is almost twice the amount achieved in the first quarter."" The CEO also noted that enterprise resource planning system advances showed significant progress, pointing toward an on-time implementation in the future.Cintas' enthusiasm showed up earlier in the month when it gave investors a huge dividend increase. The company said it would raise its payout by 22% to $1.62 on an annual basis. Most people don't think of Cintas as a major dividend stock because it doesn't make quarterly dividend payments, but the boost marked the 34th consecutive year that the uniform rental specialist has rewarded shareholders with a larger payout.Cintas also increased its full-year fiscal 2018 guidance once again. New projections for sales of between $6.365 billion and $6.43 billion were about $30 million to $40 million higher than its guidance three months ago. Cintas expects earnings to come in between $5.39 and $5.46 per share, higher by $0.08 to $0.09 per share. Although the numbers omit any further costs from the G&K integration, they also leave out possible favorable impacts from tax reform measures.Cintas investors were initially pleased with the results, and the stock opened higher by 2% before giving up those gains early in Friday's trading session.The U.S. economy is performing well, and as long as that continues, Cintas will be in a good position to benefit in 2018 and beyond.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"uying and holding great stocks is the best way to predictably create wealth over the long term. But few companies have effectively done so as well as Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) over the years. After all, shareholders who bought a piece of the video streaming leader shortly after its IPO in 2002 have seen the value of their investment multiplied  as of this writing.That raises the question: Are there any other stocks that feel like Netflix did in 2002?So we asked three top Motley Fool investors for their thoughts to that end. Read on to learn why they think  (NASDAQ: SPLK) ,  (NASDAQ: CTAS) , and  (NASDAQ: EDIT) fit the bill.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES With the company having over 13,000 customers at the end of last quarter, including 85 members of the Fortune 100, you might wonder if Splunk has already realized the bulk of its growth potential. But its leading operational intelligence platform is poised to continue processing mind-boggling amounts of machine data being produced by businesses around the world.To be sure, Splunk is still growing rapidly. Revenue last quarter jumped more than 34% year over year to $328.7 million,  . And the company not only raised its guidance for the current fiscal year (to between $1.239 billion and $1.241 billion), but also told investors to expect sales next year to climb another 25% to $1.55 billion.But we can't forget that earlier this year, Splunk also estimated that its total addressable market now sits at roughly $55 billion, helped by new-use cases and the expanded implementation of machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms making its platform that much more effective. Over the longer term, that would mean its customer base could grow to as much as 400,000. As such, I think investors willing to buy now and watch Splunk's growth story continue to unfold stand to be handsomely rewarded in the process. In 2002, Netflix was ""just"" a DVD rental-by-mail service, but its stock didn't really take off until years later, when it got into the related-but-not-exactly-the-same business of online streaming. That reminds me a lot of another rental company, Cintas, which has already seen stock price gains of 270% over the last five years and looks poised for even more.Cintas began in 1929 as a company that collected used rags from factories and washed and returned them for a fee. In the 1950s, it moved into the related-but-not-exactly-the-same business of uniform rental, washing the uniforms and returning them for a fee. That's the business that took off, allowing the company to set up a nationwide network of distribution centers. It used those centers to add on other related-but-not-exactly-the-same business services, including floor mat rental, restroom restocking, and fire and safety equipment servicing.These other services only represent 18.6% of overall company revenue at present but are growing more quickly than uniform rental, with 10.7% year-over-year  in the most recent quarter. So far this year, the company has upped its guidance, gobbled up competitor G&K Services, and raised its dividend by 21.8%. And while digital streaming uniforms are unlikely to ever become a thing, Cintas -- like Netflix -- is a rental company that should reward its shareholders for years to come. : As dominant as Netflix is today in streaming TV, it's easy to overlook that the company wasn't into streaming at all back in 2002. Its business revolved around a subscription plan for DVDs, which were shipped via mail. But the potential was certainly there to grow into something much larger, which is exactly what Netflix did.I think Editas Medicine is in something of a similar position as Netflix was in 2002. The company is a pioneer of gene editing using CRISPR/Cas9. This technology could  , with its ability to repair gene mutations that cause life-threatening diseases.There are plenty of other companies and researchers using CRISPR/Cas9, so what makes Editas special? It holds the licenses to patents claimed by the Broad Institute for use of the gene-editing approach in humans. If any company develops a drug using CRISPR/Cas9, it will have to pay Editas.Right now, no drugs have been approved using this gene-editing technique. However, Editas is researching use of CRISPR/Cas9 in treating several genetic diseases, including rare eye diseases, cancer, and cystic fibrosis. The company has also attracted partnerships with big drugmaker  (NYSE: AGN) and up-and-coming biotech  (NASDAQ: JUNO) .Editas isn't profitable. The company faces plenty of risks, but it has an incredible opportunity ahead -- just like Netflix in 2002.We can't guarantee, of course, that Splunk, Cintas, or Editas Medicine will live up to the lofty bar set by Netflix. But with each of their massive market opportunities and long runways for growth, we like their chances of doing just that. So for investors who don't mind buying, holding, and enduring some volatility along the way, these three promising companies could deliver life-changing returns.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

n Dec 27, we issued an updated research report on business services provider,  .Cintas maintains a focused approach for steady top-line growth. Revenues have witnessed an increasing trend over the past few quarters. From fiscal 2010-2017, revenues have seen a compounded annual growth rate of 5.2%. In second-quarter fiscal 2018, revenues increased 26.4% year over year to $1,606.4 million, primarily driven by the accretive acquisition of G&K Services Inc. Moreover, addition of new customers, strong customer retention and higher penetration of existing customers through better and innovative products and services led to organic growth of 7.7%.Cintas aims to continually achieve revenue build-up by increasing penetration levels at existing customers and broadening the customer base to include fresh business segments. Cintas also identifies additional product and service opportunities for its current and future customers to expand its portfolio.The acquisition of G&K Services has further expanded Cintas' customer profile as the combined company is catering to more than 1 billion customers with an extended product portfolio and additional processing capacity. Customer service has also improved with increased route density. The synergies from the combined operations are expected to yield $130 million to $140 million in cost savings from the fourth year of its operation.In addition, Cintas has a strong balance sheet with adequate liquidity to meet its working capital requirements. Over the years, the company has consistently returned significant cash to its shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Its investment strategy takes a holistic view of the rapidly evolving market and deploys a dynamic capital allocation approach to focus on the relative value of the various sectors within the broader industry.With a diligent execution of operational plans, Cintas has outperformed the  with an average year-to-date return of 34.5% compared with a gain of 31.8% for the latter. Cintas has also raised its earlier guidance for fiscal 2018 on favorable growth trends. Revenues are currently expected in the range of $6,365 million to $6,430 million, up from $6,325 million to $6,400 million anticipated earlier. Earnings from continuing operations are expected to be between $5.39 and $5.46 per share, up from earlier projections of $5.30-$5.38.However, Cintas procures raw materials from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers, making it susceptible to market risks which are beyond its control. A sustained increase in raw material costs such as cotton also weighs on the margins. Cintas also faces stiff competition from national, regional and local companies on various factors such as design, price, quality, service and convenience to customers. Specifically, its first aid and fire protection services are decidedly commoditized markets and hence are subject to fierce competition. As such, the company has to continually invest in value drivers to fend off competition, which further weakens its profitability. Moreover, a persistent challenging macroeconomic environment has mostly driven customers to perform certain in-house services themselves instead of outsourcing them to Cintas, which has resulted in some loss of businesses.Nevertheless, we remain impressed with the inherent growth potential of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.

eading business service provider  is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results after the closing bell on Dec 21. The company is likely to report higher revenues from Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products segment, which accounts for the lion's share of total revenues, due to improved demand for its products.This, in turn, is likely to result in higher earnings for the quarter.Cintas recorded industry leading revenue growth over the past few quarters with continued focus on core businesses. New business wins, deeper penetration of existing customers with more products and services, and customer retention remain key strengths of the company. In addition, Cintas also identifies additional product and service opportunities for its current and future customers to expand its portfolio. This focused approach for steady top-line growth is likely to benefit the company in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Moreover, the successful integration of G&K Services Inc. is likely to expand Cintas' customer profile and augment its revenues. With annual revenues of approximately $1 billion, G&K Services has more than 170,000 customers in the United States and Canada. The combined company is expected to cater more than one billion business customers with an extended product portfolio and additional processing capacity. Customer service is also likely to improve with increased route density.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products segment revenues is currently pegged at $1,296 million, up from $1,006 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Revenues from First Aid Safety and Protection segment are expected to be $137 million compared with reported revenues of $125 million in the year-earlier quarter.However, a persistently challenging macroeconomic environment has mostly driven customers to perform certain in-house services themselves instead of outsourcing them to Cintas. This is expected to result in some loss of businesses. In addition, significant international operations expose it to risks of fluctuation in foreign exchange rates, which in turn, is likely to impact its financial results.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Cintas is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is perfectly the case here as you will see below: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -4.19% as the former is pegged at $1.20 and the latter at $1.25. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . |  Cintas has a Zacks Rank #2. Although this increases the predictive power of ESP, we need a positive ESP to make us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Accenture plc  has an Earnings ESP of +0.26% and a Zacks Rank #2.

"o matter how high or low a company's dividend is at any given moment, there is no way for an investor can say that a dividend is a complete certainty. There are simply too many variables -- some that may be out of the company's control -- that could cause a management team to cut or even eliminate its dividend entirely.That said, there are some stocks where the chances of a dividend cut are incredibly low. Uniform rental company  is very much in that category. Not only has it maintained its status as a Dividend Aristocrat for more than a decade, but the company's business model and financials also suggest that investors have little to fear when it comes to Cintas' dividend. Here's a look at what Cintas does and why there is little fear of investors losing its dividend anytime soon.Image source: Cintas.Cintas has been one of the best wealth-building stocks over the long term. It has been able to maintain annual dividend increases for 34 consecutive years, which gives the stock  status. Over the past decade, it has increased its payout at a compounded annual rate of 15%. Cintas' dividend growth, coupled with share repurchases, has produced a total return of 448% over the past decade that has easily outpaced the  's total return of 117% in that same time frame.There isn't anything glamorous about Cintas' business. According to its 10-K, the company defines its business activities as ""providing a wide range of products and services...including uniforms, floor care, restroom supplies, first aid and safety products, fire extinguishers and testing, and safety and compliance training."" These are the types of must-have or must-do elements of a business that companies rarely want to do themselves. It doesn't make a lot of financial sense for a manufacturing company to spend time and resources on industrial laundry services on-site, so they contract stuff like this out to service providers such as Cintas.Luckily for Cintas, there are thousands upon thousands of companies in this position, and it gives the company an incredibly diverse customer base that is going to use Cintas' services on a regular basis. Cintas estimates that it serves over 1 million businesses worldwide, and not a single customer makes up 1% of revenue. Having such an expansive customer base means that its results aren't going to be impacted from losing any one customer at a time, which ensures a certain level of certainty when it comes to revenue.Uniforms and many of the other services that Cintas provides are very much commoditized businesses, which means that scale matters in this industry. Cintas  by a long shot. After the recent acquisition of G&K Services, Cintas has more than 30% of the uniform rental market, with the next closest competitor --  -- at only 10%. Larger market share means more efficient delivery routes and better utilization of distribution and services centers. As a result, the company can deliver a service at lower cost than many of its peers and command higher margins.
  
Data source: YCharts.  = earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. LTM = last 12 months.A business with a larger competitive moat like Cintas' is one that could easily fall victim to its own success as management rests on its laurels or makes ill-suited acquisitions. Luckily, this hasn't been an issue for Cintas. Not only has management been able to grow the business organically -- organic revenue that didn't include the G&K acquisition was up 8% in the fiscal year 2017 -- but it has also been able to make acquisitions that haven't eroded rates of return.The most considerable risk to Cintas' business is that its success is largely tied to overall economic health in North America. That hasn't been too much of a concern recently, as the U.S. has posted positive job growth for 86 consecutive months. However, when the next economic pullback comes -- they always do -- chances are Cintas' revenue and margins will likely suffer.Since we're looking at the sustainability of the dividend, what matters is whether or not the company's income statement can take a hit without compromising its dividend payment. If that 34-year streak wasn't convincing enough for you, let's dig into the company's current financials.Image source: Cintas.A straightforward number we can use to gauge the health of Cintas' dividend is its  . As it stands today, Cintas has a payout ratio of 25.4%. This means that it is paying out a quarter of its profits in the form of a dividend. At this level, it could easily raise its dividend payment without compromising its ability to invest in the business or weather an economic downturn.While payout ratio is an OK measure of dividend sustainability, it is by no means perfect. There is a lot of wiggle room in an income statement that can make earnings look better than they are, and earnings aren't a measure of the amount of cash generated or spent. So another way to look at dividend sustainability is to look at  . For the fiscal year 2017, Cintas generated $525 million in free cash flow before accounting for the one-time acquisition of G&K. The company paid a total of $142 million in dividends, which means its cash payout ratio was 26.9%. This low ratio is also promising because it gives management cash to pay down debt, make more acquisitions down the road, juice per-share returns by repurchasing stock, or maintain dividend payments through another economic downturn.Dividends are never guaranteed, but some companies you can be almost certain that they will be able to keep growing their dividend over the long term. Cintas is one of those stocks that looks like it will be able to maintain its Dividend Aristocrat status for a long time. It has a considerable economic moat around its business that keeps the competition at bay, management has been able to generate high rates of return and loads of free cash flow to support its shareholder-friendly initiatives, and there is a considerable margin of safety in its financial statements to withstand an economic downturn.Cintas' dividend yield of 1% is never going to wow anyone. Over the company's history as a publicly traded stock, the only time its dividend yield was more than 2% was during the Great Recession. Over the long haul, though, Cintas' dividend has been incredibly reliable and looks like it will continue to be that way for a long time.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"If you are a retirement and/or income investor, there is an investing commandment that you probably have never heard of, and therefore don't obey - thou shalt not live on dividends alone. It is a big mistake to just look at a high yield and buy the stock blind. That dividend growth alone may generate income that you need, but I guarantee that you are placing yourself in a higher risk category than you realize.Just because a company pays a dividend, grows its dividend regularly or is even a Dividend Aristocrat, does not mean it is going to give you the returns you need for retirement.That's because inflation is  just 3%. It is actually  . This is one of the dirty little secrets that your broker and the investing business don't want you to know. It is the fundamental reason why I created  - to inform investors that they are not properly invested. You need to generate real returns of 10% annually to retain your purchasing power.So buying a ""safe dividend"" stock that pays 3% isn't enough. That dividend growth also needs to be growing at a rate that brings your total annual return to 10%.Source: Shutterstock The first dividend aristocrat to buy that will deliver those 10% annualized returns is  (NYSE:  ). Yes, the commercials that feature the duck. However, AFL has a fantastic business focusing on high-margin insurance products in both the U.S. and Japan. That's right. In fact, Japan comprises almost 70% of its revenue.In Japan, AFL offers voluntary supplemental insurance products, including cancer plans, general medical indemnity plans, medical/sickness riders, care plans, living benefit life plans, ordinary life insurance plans, and annuities.Here at home, AFL offers products designed to protect individuals from depletion of assets comprising accident, cancer, critical illness/care, hospital indemnity, fixed-benefit dental, and vision care plans; and loss-of-income products.AFL pays a 2.12% dividend, but analysts see as much as 13% annualized growth over the next five years. That seems a bit high to me, but even 8% hits our target.Source: Shutterstock  (NYSE:  ) is not a company that sounds interesting or, for that matter, a company that most investors have even heard of. In this case, it is a dividend aristocrat with an amazing portfolio of brand names that I bet most people have actually heard of: The North Face, Vans, Timberland, JanSport and Eagle Creek.These are the very best quality outdoor clothing and gear. As specialty retailers, they are not as susceptible to the clothing retail nightmare that has been plaguing other names.Earnings are seasonable, but the TTM net income is about a billion dollars. It's 7.1% annualized expected earnings growth plus 2.65% dividend yield, brings us closer to our target. Moreover, that dividend is growing at a rate of about 18% going back five years.Free cash flow is excellent and consistent, ranging from $1 billion to $1.5 billion annually, with a payout ratio of about 47%.Source: If you pay attention to people you meet at everyday jobs, like janitors or firemen or other types of homogenous workers, you'll find the products of  (NASDAQ:  ).This dividend aristocrat makes uniforms of all shapes and varieties.

"Chicago, IL - November 2, 2017 - Stocks in this week's article  ,  ,  ,  and  .Investors on the lookout for stocks with the potential for maximum growth and value investing may consider the growth at a reasonable price or GARP strategy.This well-liked strategy helps investors gain exposure to stocks with impressive growth prospects that are trading at a discount. GARP investing employs popular value metrics - price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book value (P/B) ratio - to evaluate whether a stock is undervalued.The GARP approach prefers stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.Strong earnings growth history and impressive prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, picking stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is a preferred tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the strategy.Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.GARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics - price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios compared to value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. Moreover, the price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is another value metric that is considered.Using the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.Along with the criteria discussed in the above section, we have considered a favorable  . (Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business.) (Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks.)

bout a month has gone by since the last earnings report for  . Shares have added about 11.4% in that time frame, outperforming the market.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Cintas recorded strong fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 (ended May 31, 2017) results on the back of healthy top-line growth. Net income from continuing operations for the reported quarter was $82.2 million or $0.75 per share compared with $115.7 million or $1.06 per share in the year-earlier quarter. Adjusted earnings for the reported quarter beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $0.10.Quarterly revenues increased 23.1% year over year to $1,530.3 million, exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,509 million. Organic growth for the reported quarter improved 8.1% year over year. The superior top-line performance was primarily attributable to the addition of new customers, strong customer retention and higher penetration of existing customers through better and innovative products and services.For fiscal 2017, net income and earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations were $457.3 million and $4.17, respectively, compared with $448.6 million and $4.02 last fiscal year. The company reported adjusted earnings of $4.53 per share. Revenues for fiscal 2017 were $5,323.4 million compared with $4,795.8 million in the prior-year period. The increase was driven by an organic growth rate of 6.7%.Gross margin increased for the 15th consecutive quarter on a year-over-year basis to 44.4% from 43.9% in the prior-year quarter. Operating income was $ 177.3 million, down 11.2% year over year. Operating margin was 11.6%, lower than 16.1% in the year-earlier quarter, owing to expenses related to the acquisition of G&K Services, Inc.Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenues for the quarter improved 27.1% year over year to $1220 million. Gross margin increased 20 basis points (bps) to 44.6% in the reported quarter.Revenues from Other segment were up 9.3% year over year to $310.3 million while its gross margin improved 120 bps to 43.5%. This segment includes First Aid and Safety Services, and All Other businesses that comprise Fire Protection Services and Direct Sale business.Subsequent to the quarter end, Cintas completed the acquisition of G&K Services for approximately $2.2 billion, including acquired net debt, after receiving all the requisite regulatory approvals.

With over 8,000 employees serving over 170,000 customers from 160 facilities in North America, it reported annual revenues of $978 million in fiscal 2016.G&K Services would operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cintas and is likely to retain its existing brand name.

ncome investors like  because the combination of current income and growth potential offers an attractive risk-reward relationship. Yet even some companies that have amply demonstrated their commitment to giving dividend growth to their shareholders don't always pay out as much as they could. In particular,  (NYSE: SHW) ,  (NASDAQ: CTAS) , and  (NYSE: TR) could all double their dividends without endangering their ability to earn enough to cover payouts and reinvest in growth initiatives.Sherwin-Williams has been a huge success story for investors over the years. Dividend investors have to be happy about the fact that the paint specialist has managed to boost its dividend every single year for 39 straight years, with the most recent increase coming in February.However, what shareholders probably  entirely satisfied with is the size of those increases. Sherwin-Williams only managed a $0.01 per-share boost to its quarterly payout, and the current yield is less than 1%.Image source: Sherwin-Williams.Sherwin-Williams paid less than 30% of its earnings over the past 12 months in dividends, and  . A healthy housing market continues to drive interest in consumer paint, and with the company's merger with fellow paint peer Valspar now complete, Sherwin-Williams has greater capacity to take advantage of favorable industry conditions. Doubling the dividend would put Sherwin-Williams in line with the average market dividend yield of around 2%, while still leaving its payout ratio low enough to be sustainable.Slightly more encouraging on the dividend front is Cintas. The company specializes in uniform rental and other business services, and it has a long history of annual dividend increases that dates back 34 straight years. Yet with a dividend yield of less than 1%, Cintas isn't letting its shareholders participate fully in its growth.Still, Cintas has put more effort into dividend growth than some of its peers. Last year's boost to its annual payout amounted to 27%. With  , Cintas is seeing a favorable environment in the job market translate into stronger fundamental business conditions. A current payout ratio of almost exactly 30% leaves Cintas room to consider a much larger increase later this month, which is typically when the company has rewarded its shareholders. Even a doubling of the dividend would leave Cintas with a typical 2% yield and a sustainable payout ratio of 60% of earnings.Finally, Tootsie Roll Industries is well-known for its namesake candy. The stock has also been a tasty treat for its longtime shareholders, because the company has made increases to its dividend each year for 51 straight years. The only downside: a lackluster yield of just 0.95%, and sluggish past dividend growth of just 3% in its March 2017 payout increase.Of these three stocks,  . Current consumer trends favor healthy eating, and Tootsie Roll remains focused on its candy offerings. With much of Tootsie Roll's business coming from impulse buys at checkout aisles, the decline of brick-and-mortar shopping in favor of online purchases has also crimped Tootsie Roll's sales growth. Yet with the company paying out just a third of its income, Tootsie Roll could afford to reward its shareholders better even if its fundamental business is unable to grow earnings substantially in the immediate term.Tootsie Roll is controlled by family shareholders, while Sherwin-Williams appears determined to remain fiscally conservative in light of its recent merger and concerns about future industry conditions. Cintas is the most likely to double its dividend, although it's likely to take a few years to get there. Keep your eyes on the uniform-rental specialist to see whether shareholders get a bigger payday later this month.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

ast week was a good one for income investors, as the beginning of this year's final earnings season brought a raft of dividend raises from a variety of stocks.There were too many increases to fit into one installment of this article series. So, as ever, I've picked three lifters I think particularly distinguish themselves --  (NASDAQ: CTAS) ,  (NYSE: CCL) (NYSE: CUK) , and  (NYSE: V) .Image source: Getty ImagesOut of this week's trio, business services veteran  is the only Dividend Aristocrat -- i.e., one of the few publicly traded companies that has raised its regular dividend at least once annually for a minimum of 25 years in a row. Cintas is extending its streak to 34 years with a 22% hike in its annual distribution to $1.62 per share. data by  .Cintas has been doing  . In its first quarter of fiscal 2018, net profit came in at $1.48 per share, 13% higher on a year-over-year basis. Revenue rose 27% to hit $1.61 billion. The company's core uniform-rental and facility-services business grew robustly, thanks in no small part to its recently consolidated acquisition of peer uniform company G&K Services.Meanwhile, both operating and free cash flow have risen substantially. The latter more than doubled in fiscal 2017 to over $473 million, far more than enough to cover the $142 million in dividend payments for that year. The company is a solid and effective cash generator and it's now bulked up with the G&K consolidation. I wouldn't worry at all about Cintas maintaining its Dividend Aristocrat status.The company's once-a-year dividend is to be handed out on Dec. 8 to stockholders of record as of Nov. 10. The payout ratio on it is a very modest 27%, while the yield would be 1.1%. By comparison, the average yield of dividend-paying stocks on the  is 1.9%.Carnival Cruise Lines just declared its second hike of the year, boosting its quarterly payout by 13% to $0.45 per share. As usual, the same rate will be paid in U.S. dollars to holders of the company's common stock (ticker symbol CCL) and its American depositary shares (CUK).Although the company's current-quarter results are sure to be affected by the recent storms and devastation in the Caribbean, fundamentals are very much on the rise. Carnival posted an 8% year-over-year improvement in its top line for Q3 -- the highest quarterly revenue growth rate  -- to $5.5 billion. Adjusted net profit leaped to $2.29 per share from the year-ago quarter's $1.92.Higher ticket prices fueled much of the growth, aided by the company's seemingly endless rollout of new features and services for its passengers.Q3's free cash flow came in at just over $1 billion, nearly topping the company's all-time quarterly record. On a trailing-12-month basis FCF approached $2.4 billion, more than enough to cover the period's dividend payouts and share buybacks. This is a company in fine shape; I'd expect more dividend raises in the very near future. data by  .Carnival's upcoming distribution will be paid on Dec. 15 to investors of record as of Nov. 24. It would yield 2.7% on both of the company's U.S.-listed stocks. The payout ratio comes in just under 20% on Q3 adjusted net profit.Another chunky raise came from Visa, which lifted its quarterly dividend by 18%. The payment-card giant will begin paying its shareholders nearly $0.20 per share.Visa is, and will almost certainly continue to be, a top player in credit and debit card transactions, and it's catching up fast in the digital segment. Last year it sewed up its acquisition of peer Visa Europe, and it's signed several agreements with top players in new payments modes. This has helped the company deliver several  of better-than-expected revenue and profitability growth.The company will report Q4 earnings on Oct. 25, and on average, analysts are expecting 10% growth on the top line and 15% for net profit. Visa has been handily topping estimates lately, so a significant beat wouldn't be a big surprise.Since Visa is quite frugal with its dividend, it tends to spend much of (or even more than) its FCF on share buybacks. I've  that this isn't an encouraging strategy; for investors it would be much better to get a little more coin with a higher dividend. Regardless, Visa is a cash-generating machine and should remain so, thus I'd rate the new payout as more than sustainable. data by  .Visa's next dividend is to be dispensed on Dec. 5 to shareholders of record as of Nov. 17. It yields a theoretical 0.7%. The payout ratio on the company's Q3 profit is a low 23%.The coming weeks should bring even more dividend increases.

The return of blue-collar jobs is something I've been talking about and keeping a close eye on for some time now, and one related company that I've also been watching closely recently reported earnings that blew the Street's expectations out of the water. Source:  (NASDAQ:  ) is a leading provider of corporate identity uniform programs, and it also provides pretty much everything else a company could ever need - entrance and logo mats, restroom supplies, promotion productions, first aid and safety products, carpet and tile cleaning and more.It operates more than  in North America, including six manufacturing plants and eight distribution centers.Need something? Just give CTAS a ring and they'll hook you right up.There are many reasons why I like company, but one of the most important is that it is a proxy for blue collar jobs as well as other key industries:As I mentioned, Cintas reported a strong fiscal-first-quarter report at the end of September, allowing the shares to surge to a new 52-week high. Adjusted earnings of $1.48 a share came in better than estimates of $1.30 a share, and revenue increased 27% year-over-year to $1.61 billion, which was also ahead of expectations of $1.57 billion.The company saw solid growth in its two main business segments, with uniform rental revenue increasing 8% and first aid and safety revenue gaining 9.2%.Management also raised their guidance for the full fiscal year, forecasting revenue of $6.325 billion-$6.4 billion and earnings of $5.30-$5.38 a share. These estimates even include $10-$15 billion in lost revenue as a result of the hurricanes affecting Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico.It should also be noted that three months ago, Wall Street was modelling for EPS of $4.84, and just before the release of the report analysts were up to $5.21.It's clear the Street underestimated the company, and the shares reaped the rewards as a result.CTAS stock is already up more than 28% so far in 2017, but I expect it to continue outperforming as the economy keeps picking up steam - remember, a strong jobs market is great for this company.

ividends that grow long term can be a source of great cash flow and overall returns for investors who can find stocks that are built to last.

We asked three of our investors for their top growth  to buy this month and  (NASDAQ: MELI) ,  (NASDAQ: CTAS) , and  (NYSE: BEP) were at the top of the list.Image source: Getty Images. :  If dividends are great -- and they are -- then more dividends must be even better. That's why, when you're looking to buy a dividend stock, you need to keep one eye on the future, and focus not just on what dividend a company is paying today, but how much bigger that dividend might grow tomorrow. And I don't know of many stocks that have the potential to grow dividends bigger, or faster, than MercadoLibre, the Argentinean e-commerce giant.Currently, MercadoLibre's dividend isn't much to look at.  . But consider the possibilities.Right now, the payout ratio of MercadoLibre's dividend is a mere 18.4%, meaning that for every $5 MercadoLibre earns, it pays out less than $1 in dividends. (The next payout comes due on Sept. 30, by the way). That's an amount MercadoLibre can easily pay, and lends some assurance that, whatever else might happen to the stock, the company is unlikely to cease paying dividends anytime soon. In fact, the one time MercadoLibre  its dividend, in 2015, it quickly made up the difference the following year, such that the average dividend paid out from 2014 through 2016 actually grew slightly.I see every reason to believe MercadoLibre's dividends will keep on growing in future years. Why? For one thing, the low payout ratio leaves ample room for MercadoLibre to increase its payout should it so desire. For another, the company is growing so fast -- sales are up 71%, in local currency, over the first half of last year -- that growth in earnings and dividends are almost certain to follow. (  ): There are many businesses that rely on strength in the job market for maximum success. Many workers have to wear uniforms for their jobs, and Cintas has focused much of its business on providing work uniforms for sale or rent to employees of its corporate clients. A  lately, including a 27% jump in revenue that lifted net income by nearly a fifth in its most recent financial report. Those gains were led by uniform rentals and facility services, with the less economically sensitive first aid and safety segment lagging behind, but still producing double-digit percentage growth. Cintas also saw better results in the coming fiscal year, increasing projections despite hurricane-related losses.From a dividend perspective, Cintas isn't a typical favorite stock among income investors. The company's yield is just 1%, and it makes payments annually rather than quarterly. Yet Cintas has boosted its dividend every year for 34 straight years, including a whopping 27% rise in 2016. With a new announcement likely to come in October, investors are optimistic that Cintas will continue to be a dividend growth leader and bring its yield more in line with the market average among dividend stocks. There may be dividends that will grow faster than Brookfield Renewable Partners, but there are  . The company is one of the biggest yieldcos in North America, owning hydroelectric power plants and other renewable energy assets. The cash generated from these assets are then used to acquire new growth projects and pay out a dividend. Long term, management aims to generate total returns of 12% to 15% and dividend growth of 5% to 9% annually.The difference between Brookfield Renewable Partners and other yieldcos is that it aims to grow organically. Most yieldcos want to issue shares and debt to get bigger and bigger, so the strategy is a departure from most in the industry.Another advantage Brookfield Renewable Partners has is that it's able to buy a number of different renewable energy assets. Hydro plants are an underappreciated asset in renewable energy, and there are plenty of opportunities to buy wind and solar plants with attractive returns around the world. Brookfield Renewable Partners' current yield of 5.7% makes it a high-yield stock, but the dividend growth of 5% to 9% each year makes this a dividend to own for the long haul.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"n recent trading, shares of Cintas Corporation (Symbol: CTAS) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $140.50, changing hands for $144.01/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 6 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Cintas Corporation, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $117.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $160.00. The standard deviation is $15.82.But the whole reason to look at the  CTAS price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with CTAS crossing above that average target price of $140.50/share, investors in CTAS have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $140.50 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Cintas Corporation:

"he U.S. economy has been strong recently, and job growth has played a key role in the recovery since the 2008 recession.  (NASDAQ: CTAS) has benefited from an improved job market, and  have helped the uniform rental and facility services specialist get into a better position to take advantage of the opportunities that favorable industry conditions for its customer base will bring.Coming into Tuesday's fiscal first-quarter financial report, Cintas shareholders wanted to see signs that the company would be able to sustain the  . Cintas was able to give investors most of what they wanted, and the future looks bright even with some one-time obstacles that it will have to overcome. Let's look more closely at Cintas and what its most recent report means for long-term investors.Image source: Cintas.Cintas' fiscal first-quarter results reflected the upbeat environment for the company's clients. Revenue of $1.61 billion was up 27% from the year-ago quarter and was better than the consensus forecast for $1.57 billion. Net income from continuing operations climbed 18% to $161.1 million, and after making adjustments for some acquisition-related expenses, adjusted earnings of $1.48 per share were far better than the $1.31 per share that most of those following the stock had expected.Looking more closely at Cintas' results, the company maintained solid growth in its core business. Even taking out the impact of the G&K Services acquisition, overall organic growth on the top line amounted to more than 8%. That growth was fairly evenly split between Cintas' two main business categories, with first aid and safety services seeing a nearly 12% organic rise in sales while the larger uniform rental and facility services category came in closer to 8%.Even so, uniform rental and facility services remained the most important component of Cintas' success. Revenue from the segment rose by close to a third, and a similar rise in expenses allocable to the unit helped boost its contribution to overall profitability. The other category, which includes first aid and safety, saw more sluggish growth of just 10% in sales, but costs rose at a slower pace that enabled the unit to have a larger contribution to the rise in operating income. General administrative and selling expenses jumped at a more than 30% rate, weighing on profits somewhat and explaining why bottom-line growth was slower than the added sales that Cintas brought in.CEO Scott Farmer was quite pleased with how things are going. ""The integration of G&K continues to proceed as expected,"" Farmer said, ""and we remain on track to meet the acquisition's financial and non-financial objectives."" The CEO also pointed to the ongoing Ready for the Workday initiative to boost client counts and provide a more complete suite of services to existing customers.Cintas is optimistic about its ability to keep growing. A favorable economic environment has its customers in a good position to consider greater investment in workforce development, and that has positive implications for the company going forward.In response, Cintas was able to boost its guidance for fiscal 2018 even in the wake of hurricane-related problems. The company now expects full-year revenue of $6.325 billion to $6.4 billion, up between $40 million and $55 million from previous estimates. Adjusted earnings of $5.30 to $5.38 per share represent an increase of roughly $0.15 from past guidance. Those measures include an estimated $10 million to $15 million in lost revenue stemming from the loss of business in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and surrounding areas. Early assessments suggest a $0.05 to $0.08 per share reduction in earnings for the year, but even so, the resulting figures point to double-digit percentage growth for Cintas for the remainder of the year.Cintas investors were happy about the results, and the stock climbed more than 5% on Wednesday following the Tuesday afternoon announcement. As long as the employers that help support Cintas' business remain healthy, then the uniform rental and services specialist will be in a great position to keep capitalizing on demand and boosting its own growth.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Organic growth for the reported quarter improved 8.3% year over year. The superior top-line performance was primarily attributable to the accretive acquisition of G&K Services Inc. Moreover, addition of new customers, strong customer retention and higher penetration of existing customers through better and innovative products and services also led to incremental organic growth.Gross margin increased for the 16th consecutive quarter on a year-over-year basis to 45.9% from 45.5% in the prior-year quarter. Operating income was $249.1 million, up 22.1% year over year. Operating margin was 15.5%, slightly lower than 16.1% in the year-earlier quarter, owing to transaction expenses related to the acquisition of G&K Services. | Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenues for the quarter improved 31.9% year over year to $1,311.8 million.

Free cash flow for the first three months of the fiscal year increased to $191.8 million from $79 million in the year-ago period.With superior quarterly performance, Cintas increased its earlier guidance for fiscal 2018. Revenues are currently expected in the range of $6,325 million − $6,400 million, up from $6,270 million − $6,360 million anticipated earlier. Earnings from continuing operations are expected to be between $5.30 and $5.38 per share, up from earlier projections of $5.15 − $5.25. The guidance, however, includes the preliminary estimates of the negative effect due to Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma affecting Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico and surrounding areas.Cintas continues to deliver organic growth through superior execution of its operational plans. We remain encouraged by the company's strong quarterly performance.Cintas currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the industry include Superior Uniform Group, Inc.  , NV5 Global, Inc.  and PageGroup plc  , each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

nvesting over a multidecade time frame can be incredibly difficult because we don't know what the future holds. Need proof? Three of the market's beloved  weren't even public companies in 2000. While there is a pretty good chance all of these stocks will be great wealth-generating stocks over the long haul, there is no guarantee that some company five to seven years from now won't completely disrupt them just like they did to so many others on their ascent.If you want to find investments that are likely to last for a decade or more, a great place is to look at those boring, simple businesses that do something incredibly difficult to replace or disrupt. Three companies that fit this description well are uniform rental company  (NASDAQ: CTAS) , household product manufacturer  (NASDAQ: WDFC) , and trash handler  (NYSE: WM) . Here's why these three stocks have what it takes to succeed over the long haul.Image source: Getty Images.Cintas, WD-40, and Waste Management don't seem like they would have a lot in common. Renting and cleaning uniforms, marketing and distributing lubricants and cleaners, and handling trash aren't exactly businesses with a lot of overlapping interest. At their core, though, these companies products and services all have this in common: They are repeat purchases for something essential that isn't easily replicated or replaced.In the case of Cintas, the company's suite of business services provide something that few companies want to do on their own like laundry and deep cleaning for facilities. Uniforms and buildings get dirty on a rather regular schedule, which creates a customer base that routinely employs the company's services. This business benefits immensely from economies of scale as few other service providers have the logistics network of Cintas to deliver on these services.Like Cintas, Waste Management's trash collection fleet and its landfills have a  . When it comes to removing waste, a company has to have some place to dispose of it properly, and the regulations for landfills give existing landfills a near geographic monopoly. So, in most markets, Waste Management can sign up customers for long-term service contracts that provide predictable revenue and cash flow streams.WD-40 may sell products versus a recurring service that Cintas or Waste Management provides, but these products are both ubiquitous and repurchased at regular intervals. Management estimates that more than 80% of households in the U.S. have that iconic blue and gold can on a shelf, and higher-use customers like maintenance specialists tend to go through a lot of it. Add that to the company's suite of cleaning products, and you have a large product base with lots of recurring revenue. There are plenty of other lubricant and maintenance products out there, but that WD-40 brand carries a lot of cachet.These three companies are nowhere near the only businesses that benefit from recurring sources of income. What sets these three apart, though, is the ability of their respective management teams to turn these revenue streams into high rates of return for investors.The first element that makes this possible is controlling costs. Cintas and Waste Management have a bigger challenge here because they own and operate large logistics networks with lots of capital tied up in fleet vehicles and facilities, but both have managed to produce consistent EBIT margins for decades. WD-40 has the immense benefit of having little to no capital tied up in manufacturing. Rather, the company contracts all production to third parties to keep costs down and to focus on marketing and distribution. data by  .One thing that you may have also noticed is that these aren't exactly what you would call high-growth industries, so spending a lot on organic growth is likely going to result in diminishing returns. Operating in mature markets like these either mean a company has to grow through acquisitions or by returning high amounts of cash to shareholders. In this case, both Cintas and Waste Management will acquire smaller competitors from time to time to grow their respective customer base. Cintas' recent acquisition of competitor  is a great example.Beyond these kinds of acquisitions, however, these companies take their free cash flow and return it to shareholders through either increasing dividends or share repurchases. data by  .Cintas, WD-40, and Waste Management aren't companies that are going to blow you away with double-digit growth every quarter, but what they will do is provide slow and steady growth that translates to high rates of return, a slowly declining share count, and reliable dividend increases. Those are the kinds of traits that lead to compounding wealth over time. data by  .Imagining what the world will look like a decade from now is incredibly hard. Just think back to 2007 and think how different things are today. These three businesses, though -- uniforms, maintenance and cleaning products, and handling trash -- probably aren't going to change much in that time frame. So if you are looking for stocks to hang on to for a decade or more, these look like great options.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

n Aug 24, we issued an updated research report on business services provider,  .Cintas maintains a focused approach for steady top-line growth. Revenues have witnessed an increasing trend over the past few quarters. From 2010-2017, revenues of the company have witnessed a compounded annual growth rate of 5.2%. Cintas aims to continually achieve revenue build-up by increasing penetration levels at existing customers and broadening the customer base to include fresh business segments. Cintas also identifies additional product and service opportunities for its current and future customers to expand its portfolio.The acquisition of G&K Services Inc. is further likely to expand Cintas' customer profile and augment its revenues. The combined company is likely to cater to over one billion customers with an extended product portfolio and additional processing capacity. Customer service is also likely to improve with increased route density. The synergies from the combined operations are expected to yield $130 million to $140 million in cost savings from the fourth year of its operation. The transaction is anticipated to be accretive to Cintas' future earnings.In addition, Cintas has a strong balance sheet with adequate liquidity to meet its working capital requirements. Over the years, the company consistently returned significant cash to its shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Its investment strategy takes a holistic view of the rapidly evolving market and deploys a dynamic capital allocation approach to focus on the relative value of the various sectors within the broader industry. Cintas has outperformed the  with an average year-to-date return of 16% compared with a gain of 11.8% for the latter.However, Cintas procures raw materials from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers, making it susceptible to market risks which are beyond its control. A continuous increase in raw material costs such as cotton also weighs on its margins. Cintas faces stiff competition from national, regional and local companies on various factors such as design, price, quality, service and convenience to the customers. Specifically, its first aid and fire protection services are decidedly commoditized markets and hence are subject to fierce competition. As such, the company has to continually invest in value drivers to fend off competition, which further weakens its profitability. Moreover, a persistent challenging macroeconomic environment has mostly driven customers to perform certain in-house services themselves instead of outsourcing them to Cintas. This resulted in some loss of businesses.Nevertheless, we remain impressed with the inherent growth potential of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock. Other stocks in the industry worth considering include Barnes Group Inc.  , Graco Inc.  and Superior Uniform Group, Inc.  , each carrying a Zacks Rank #2. You can see  .Barnes has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 9%.Graco has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 10.5%. It topped estimates in each of the trailing four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 23.95%.Superior Uniform Group has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 13.5%.

"n recent trading, shares of Cintas Corporation (Symbol: CTAS) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $133.14, changing hands for $133.15/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 7 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Cintas Corporation, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $97.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $160.00. The standard deviation is $21.247.But the whole reason to look at the  CTAS price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with CTAS crossing above that average target price of $133.14/share, investors in CTAS have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $133.14 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Cintas Corporation:

eading business service provider  is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results after the closing bell on Sep 26. In the last reported quarter, its adjusted earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10 cents. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Cintas has completed the acquisition of rival, G&K Services Inc. With annual revenues of approximately $1 billion, G&K Services has over 170,000 customers in the United States and Canada. The successful integration of G&K Services is likely to expand Cintas' customer profile and augment its revenues. The combined company is expected to cater to over one billion business customers with an extended product portfolio and additional processing capacity.Customer service is also likely to improve with increased route density. The synergies from the combined operations are expected to yield $130 million to $140 million in cost savings and the transaction is anticipated to be accretive to Cintas' earnings in the full year of its operation.Furthermore, Cintas recorded industry leading revenue growth over the past few quarters with continued focus on core businesses. New business wins, deeper penetration of existing customers with more products and services and customer retention remain key strengths of the company. In addition, Cintas also identifies additional product and service opportunities for its current and future customers to expand its portfolio. This focused approach for steady top-line growth is likely to reap benefits in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Cintas has a strong balance sheet with adequate liquidity to meet its working capital requirements. Over the years, the company has consistently returned significant cash to its shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Its investment strategy takes a holistic view of the rapidly evolving market and deploys a dynamic capital allocation approach to focus on the relative value of the various sectors within the broader industry.However, a persistently challenging macroeconomic environment has mostly driven customers to perform certain in-house services themselves instead of outsourcing them to Cintas. This is expected to result in some loss of businesses. In addition, significant international operations expose it to risks of fluctuation in foreign exchange rates, which in turn is likely to impact its financial results.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Cintas is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate of $1.23 and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.26, is -2.54%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . |  Cintas currently carries a Zacks Rank #2. While this increases the predictive power of ESP, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Alcoa Corporation  , with an Earnings ESP of +6.80% and a Zacks Rank #1. You can see  .Altra Industrial Motion Corp.  , with an Earnings ESP of +2.92% and a Zacks Rank #1.Allegion plc  , with an Earnings ESP of +0.25% and a Zacks Rank #2.If the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

ugust is widely believed to be a bearish month for the stock market. However, market participants shouldn't fear a stock market correction, simply because July has been pretty strong and 2017 has turned out to be an encouraging year so far. Upbeat corporate earnings and the economy's breezing past the $19 trillion mark for the first time ever will surely help the broader markets fend off any negative sentiments in August.In fact, historically, August has traditionally been a bullish month for the Nasdaq. This calls for investing in some rock-solid stocks listed in the tech-heavy index for solid gains.As the Dow Jones entered August, it braced itself for a two-month stretch known for stock market declines. August has been the worst month for the blue-chip index for the past two decades, with an average decline of 1.4%.The Dow has also endured major turbulences in August since the bull market began after the 2008-09 financial crisis. In 2015, the Dow tanked 6.6% in August on fears of a slowdown in the world's second-largest economy, China. Such apprehensions emerged after Beijing devalued its currency. Similarly in 2013, the Dow tumbled 4.4% in August due to Syria's use of chemical weapons and weak earnings releases by Macy's and Walmart. Fear of Greece defaulting on its debt affected the Dow in Aug 2011.The S&P 500 is also preparing itself as it enters the historically soft month of August. The index, on an average, has gained a meagre 0.08% over the past 50 years in the month, as per data from Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White. Performance-wise, September is second to August in terms of the worst performing months.The S&P 500 usually puts up a weak performance in August as the month follows the presidential elections. Sometimes in August, the benchmark index had posted negative returns while almost all other months registered positive results.August is vacation time and investors often view the indices critically before making investment plans for the rest of the year. So, the slightest of negative tidings spook investors, resulting in increased market gyrations.August has also been a weak month for a very specific reason. In the month, farmers usually withdraw substantial funds from Wall Street to purchase seeds. This outflow of funds results in an underperformance by the stock market. And why? Such high outflows negatively impact the psyche of Wall Street investors and traders.But, the stock market's strong July performance might dispel some of the negative sentiments that emerge in August. All major indices saw their best performance in July since February, banking on healthy corporate earnings results and growing optimism on the strength of the economy. Such a positive momentum is expected to continue in August as well.Total Q2 earnings for the companies listed in the S&P 500 index are expected to be up 9.2% from the same period last year on 5% higher revenues. Secondly, an above-average proportion of companies are already beating EPS and revenue estimates (read more:  ).The U.S. economy, on the other hand, rebounded in the second quarter and more than doubled from the first quarter.

Heading into August, the benchmark index has gained more than 10%.Even though stocks have entered their worst month of the year, July's stellar show is expected to ward off any serious downturns. The Nasdaq, in fact, has done well in August in the large majority of years from 1990 to date. The Nasdaq has overcome the dot-com crash and has yielded gains as much as 4.7% or more on an average in August. Banking on such positives, investing in fundamentally sound firms listed in the tech-laden index seems to be judicious.We have, thus, selected five such stocks that that not only boast a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) but also have a  of 'A' or 'B.'

Unless you are truly investing for the long-term - and by that, I mean 10 years at a minimum - you expose yourself to a much higher degree of risk. That's why the best stocks to buy if you're a conservative investor are those that are durable, so you can hold them for years and expect them to easily bounce back anytime the market throws a tantrum. Source: ShutterstockSwing trading and using options are perfectly acceptable ways for more aggressive investors to achieve returns, but you have to know that when you do that, you're introducing a number of risks that, if not handled properly, could end up setting you back.But the longer the time frame you have for investing, the better off you are positioning a large part of your portfolio with a buy-and-hold mantra in mind. After all, there has been no 30-year rolling period in which the market did not provide a positive return.So if you are investing for the long-term and seeking market-beating returns without taking on too much risk, let me show you the way. Please read on as I explore seven all-weather stocks to buy that should serve conservative investors well for the next 30 years. Healthcare 3.5% (NYSE:  ) was once a piece of  (NYSE:  ), which completed the spinoff of the research-based pharma outlet that's home to well-known drugs such as Humira and Tricor.I'm not keen on pharma and biotech these days, since most stocks in the healthcare sector are highly overvalued. However, you  have exposure to this sector. It has too appealing a combination of growth and income to ignore.ABBV (including its business' performance within Abbott) is one of the most consistent stocks you can buy for the long-term. It's developing new products in the arenas of virology, neuroscience, immunology and oncology.Financially, it's hard to argue with 13% anticipated growth in earnings per share this year. We also enjoyed a 12% dividend increase in 2016, maintaining AbbVie's status as a  , and another one should hit later this year. Financials (Insurance/Conglomerate) N/A (NYSE:  ) is, in a way, more than one stock.For one, Berkshire Hathaway is an insurance company that operates among several brands, including Geico, United States Liability and the namesake Berkshire Hathaway. Insurance is a fantastic, and very reliable, business if underwriting is done with care. Collect premiums, make sure you don't pay out more than you take in, invest the rest, watch it all grow.Then there's Berkshire's other subsidiary companies, which include the likes of See's Candies, Fruit of the Loom Companies and Lubrizol.The cherry on top is Warren Buffett himself, who is one of the greatest investors of all time, and whose stakes in companies like  (NYSE:  ) more often than not work out wonderfully for both the Oracle of Omaha and shareholders alike. Industrials 1% (NASDAQ:  ) is another Dividend Aristocrat that belongs on this list.It's funny that I would choose Cintas considering I hate clothing retailers, but then, CTAS isn't exactly your typical retailer. Instead, CTAS designs and makes uniforms for all sorts of industries, including specialized equipment for dangerous work such as firefighting.CTAS is a cash flow business, throwing off modest but consistent earnings growth of about 7% annually, and analysts think that could grow to as much as 12% expansion going forward.There's not much in the way of yield here, as Cintas pays out roughly 1% based on its annually paid dividend, but investors sitting on 265% gains in five years don't seem to mind. Besides, the income has more than doubled over the same time period.CTAS has a defensible position. And nobody else is really assaulting Cintas' market. Consumer Discretionary 1.5%Ever wanted to buy into an empire? Then buy  (NYSE:  ).Sure, I think ESPN has huge problems, but I think it'll either be spun off or sold outright. Yet, DIS owns the world right now, with all of its Marvel films, its occasional Pixar film and the constantly expanding universe of Star Wars. Better still, Disney's resorts division is wholly immersing itself in … well, the immersive experience trend, where it's able to use its story-telling prowess to make guests feel like they're playing a part in fictional universes.Disney is synonymous with family entertainment, with a global brand name, enough content to power it for the next 30 years and one of the best stock out there.Among these seven stocks, I think Disney and one still to come are tied for the best chance of providing the highest returns over time. Energy 3.9%The energy sector has been bludgeoned over the past few years, but you still can't go without any exposure to this space. It  recover. At some point, producers will buckle - whether it's OPEC or some of the smaller U.S. firms that for now insist on drilling, drilling, drilling.That's why I think you can't go wrong with any of the big names, though among those, my favorite stock to buy is  (NYSE:  ).Exxon has assets all across the world, and has its hands in every part of the E&P cycle, or that it has great financials … all of which are strong enough to cement the bull case. But XOM also has a wild card in the form of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Exxon's former CEO who obviously was chosen to enhance U.S. oil production around the globe via Exxon's deal with Russian state-owned  (OTCMKTS:  ).Even if rumors about  (though I don't think they will), Exxon Mobil is the biggest, most powerful oil and gas play on the planet. If it goes, everything else probably went first. Utilities 4.8% (NYSE:  ) represents utilities in this portfolio of all-weather stocks to buy.National Grid is a primary provider of electricity and gas infrastructure in the U.S. and the U.K. As a utility, it is able to count on a certain amount of revenue because it is a monopoly, and has regulated rates. It has fantastic net margins and ROE, and offers a dividend of nearly 5%.Shares have cooled off thanks in large part to movements in the British pound this year, though the chart looks a bit worse than reality thanks to a big special dividend a couple months back. This is a great opportunity to get into the stock for the long-term. NGG boasts solid financials, a never-ending need for its product and additional upside when the British pound recovers. Consumer Discretionary N/AWhile the auto parts sector has been hit by a big selloff lately, that's good news for those looking at stocks to buy for the next 30 years. (NYSE:  ) is a phenomenal choice right now, and might be one of the most misunderstood bargains on the market.AZO has plunged nearly 35% this year, in part on the heels of a disappointing fiscal third-quarter earnings report that saw comps decline. That has analysts panicking and lumping it in with the rest of the retail space, but AutoZone is suffering from other macro issues, as well as a hit thanks to the timing of tax refunds this year.However, new and used cars will need parts for a long, long time. Even though car sales have been on the decline of late, they'll rise again in the next cycle. Every car ages, and every car needs parts. With more than 5,000 locations, AZO has plenty of footprint - not to mention diagnostic and repair programs you can't get via  (NASDAQ:  ). How convenient.Despite the worries, AZO still is expected to grow earnings 8% this year and next on low-single-digit revenue expansion. That's not great, but that also doesn't look like a dying retailer to me. Expect AutoZone to bounce back once the market gets over its hysteria.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@7 All-Weather Stocks to Buy for the Next 30 Years@2017-07-25@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-all-weather-stocks-to-buy-for-the-next-30-years-2017-07-25

"cquisitions are important events in the lives of companies, and they often involve accepting short-term pain in the hope of long-term gain.  (NASDAQ: CTAS) recently completed the  , complementing its uniform rental business and expanding its exposure to facility services, and investors were looking forward to seeing how the merger would impact the company's financials.Coming into Thursday's fiscal fourth-quarter financial report, Cintas shareholders expected substantial sales gains and modest earnings growth. The company delivered on the top line, and  with Cintas' net income despite some one-time charges related to integrating G&K's operations. Let's take a closer look at Cintas to see how it did and what lies ahead.Image source: Cintas.Cintas' fiscal fourth-quarter results had good news and bad news for those following the stock. Sales came in at $1.53 billion, up 23% from year-ago levels and matching the consensus forecast among investors. Reported net income fell almost 30% to $82.1 million, but after accounting for one-time items, adjusted earnings of $1.18 per share topped the $1.10 figure that most investors were looking to see.Taking a closer look at the number, Cintas broke out the impact of the G&K acquisition. Organic sales growth from Cintas' legacy operations came in at 8%, with G&K adding another $188 million to the company's top line. Transaction and integration costs of $63.7 million sent the G&K division to a loss, but without those impacts, the unit would have added $0.05 per share to quarterly profits.Cintas saw its strongest performance from its primary uniform rental and facility services segment. Sales there jumped 27%, and segment gross margin rose slightly. Cintas lumped the rest of its revenue into its ""other"" category, which enjoyed a 9% rise in sales and saw even better gross margin improvement. Cintas said that its organic growth from uniform rental and facility services was 8%, while first aid and safety services sales climbed at a 9% rate. Overhead expenses climbed at a slightly faster pace than revenue, eating into operating margin gains, but Cintas' legacy business had favorable moves in interest expense that helped support its bottom line.CEO Scott Farmer celebrated a successful report. ""Our strong finish to the fiscal year helped us to achieve a seventh consecutive year of organic growth in the mid to high single digits,"" Farmer said, and the CEO noted that revenue growth has dramatically exceeded the pace of gross domestic product and labor market growth in the U.S. economy.Cintas thinks that the future is brighter than ever for the company going forward. In Farmer's words, ""Significant opportunities exist in all of our businesses. In addition, long-term investments such as the S&K acquisition and the implementation of an enterprise resource planning system contribute to a long runway for continued growth.""However, Cintas' initial guidance for fiscal 2018 was mixed in some investors eyes. The company posted revenue projections between $6.27 billion and $6.36 billion, which was well short of the consensus forecast for $6.45 billion. Yet Cintas expects earnings from continuing operations to come in between $5.15 and $5.25 per share, which is well above the $4.90 that those following the stock came into the day expecting.Cintas has high hopes for G&K. Expectations include contributions to earnings of $0.15 to $0.17 per share, with sales of $870 million to $900 million. Synergy-related savings should produce $50 million to $55 million in upward impact on earnings, offsetting the greater interest expense incurred from borrowing to finalize the acquisition.Cintas investors seemed to be generally pleased with the report, and the stock climbed 2% in after-hours trading following the announcement. If the economy keeps doing well, then Cintas will be in a position to keep benefiting from strong employment trends and grow its business more aggressively in the future.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Cintas wasn't one of them!

"intas Corporation  is a worldwide industry leader in supplying corporate identity uniform programs, entrance and logo mats, restroom supplies, promotional products, first aid, fire protection products, and industrial carpet cleaning. More importantly, the company will be releasing its Q4 earnings report today after the closing bell.Cintas Corporation sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and operates in the ""Uniform and Related"" industry, which currently sits in the top 17% of the Zacks Industry Rank. Also, the company has defeated its earnings projections in eleven of its past twelve fiscal quarters, including a surprise of 4.72% last quarter.Cintas' consistency in beating its earnings projections, along with its strong Zacks Rank and positive Earnings ESP of 0.93%, should allow for investors to feel a sense of optimism before its quarterly report is released.If that's not enough, here are three additional reasons to be bullish on Cintas Corporation:1. Cintas recently completed the acquisition of rival G&K Services Inc., which collected annual revenues of around $1.0 billion and served over 170,000 customers in the U.S. and Canada. The integration of G&K Services is expected to expand Cintas' customer profile and augment its revenues.The combined company is likely to serve over one billion customers with an extended product portfolio, while customer service is also likely to improve with increased route density. The synergies formed by the acquisition and combined operations are expected to yield around $140 million in cost savings, which should boost Cintas' earnings.2. Cintas Corporation exhibits extensive growth prospects, which bodes well for the stock as we near its report date. For example, Cintas features a RoE of 23.75% and net margin of 10.25%, both of which compare favorably to the industry averages of 12.01% and 7.12%.Furthermore, Cintas Corporation is projected to real in an impressive $1.51 billion in revenue, which would represent 18.67% year-over-year growth.3. Cintas Corporation is projected to increase its year-over-year revenue growth in specific-and vital-divisions of the company. For example, revenues for first aid and safety protection for Q4 2016 stood around $119 million. According to our exclusive consensus estimates, Cintas is expected to earn around $131 million in the same division for Q4 2017, which would signify 10.09% year-over-year growth.Additionally, revenues for the rental uniforms and ancillary products division for Q4 2016 sat at $930.5 million. Cintas is projected to earn around $1.3 billion in the same division this quarter, which would represent a massive 39.7% year-over-year growth.Zacks just released a Special Report to guide you through a space that has already begun to transform our entire economy...Last year, it was generating $8 billion in global revenues.

eading business service provider  is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results after the closing bell on Jul 20. In the last reported quarter, adjusted earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5 cents. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Our proven model shows that Cintas is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it possesses the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is perfectly the case here as you will see below: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate of $1.09 and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.08, is +0.93%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . |  Cintas currently carries a Zacks Rank #2. This combined with a positive ESP increases the predictive power of ESP and makes an earnings prediction likely.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or #5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.With continued focus on core businesses, Cintas recorded industry leading revenue growth over the past few quarters. New business wins, deeper penetration of existing customers with more products and services and customer retention remains key strengths of the company. In addition, Cintas also identifies additional product and service opportunities for its current and future customers to expand its portfolio. This focused approach for steady top-line growth is commendable.Cintas has completed the acquisition of rival, G&K Services Inc.

The synergies from the combined operations are expected to yield $130 million to $140 million in cost savings and the transaction is anticipated to be accretive to Cintas' earnings in the full year of its operation. Although the transaction is not likely to have any direct impact on the impending quarterly results, it is likely to attract favorable contracts from existing as well as new customers and improve the top line.Cintas has a strong balance sheet with adequate liquidity to meet its working capital requirements. Over the years, the company has consistently returned significant cash to its shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Its investment strategy takes a holistic view of the rapidly evolving market and deploys a dynamic capital allocation approach to focus on the relative value of the various sectors within the broader industry.In order to enhance shareholder value, Cintas has modified its share repurchase program. Under the new share repurchase program, the company doubled its share authorization tally to enable the repurchase of an additional $500 million worth of stock over a period of time. The additional shares over its existing $500 million share repurchase authorization could be repurchased through a slew of open market transactions.

"n recent trading, shares of Cintas Corporation (Symbol: CTAS) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $125.71, changing hands for $126.04/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 7 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Cintas Corporation, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $97.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $145.00. The standard deviation is $18.517.But the whole reason to look at the  CTAS price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with CTAS crossing above that average target price of $125.71/share, investors in CTAS have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $125.71 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Cintas Corporation:

reat  have a few things in common: a long-standing commitment to reliable payout increases, enough free cash flow to keep the quarterly checks coming, and a core business with staying power for the long run.A few companies are hitting all of these marks without becoming obvious choices for income investors. We asked three of The Motley Fool's top investors to share their favorite unsung dividend heroes. Read on to see why they selected  (NYSE: LAZ) ,  (NASDAQ: CTAS) , and  (NASDAQ: NTES) .Image source: Getty Images. It may be a global investment bank that many pass over, but Lazard sits comfortably in fourth place on the league tables, below household-name firms like  ,  , and  . While its core  is inherently cyclical -- investment banks earn advisory fees that ebb and flow with mergers and acquisitions and capital-raising activity -- the company has a fast-growing asset management business that has diversified and de-risked its revenue mix.The asset management arm, which now manages approximately $215 billion of client capital, generates about 43% of total revenue. Advisory services contribute most of the remainder, or more than 55% of revenue each year.Investment banking and asset management are attractive businesses because they require little capital investment to grow. Instead, growth comes by way of hiring new people, growing headcount to increase the volume of business that Lazard can complete each year. Thus, Lazard can send virtually all of its earnings out to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. In 2016, the company paid regular and special dividends that gave it a yield of 7.5%. Including repurchases, total capital returns added up to roughly 10% of the company's market cap last year.Shares trade at about 14 times last year's earnings, an attractive multiple for a company that should be able to reliably pay out a total yield above 5% for a very long time to come. Some of the greatest stocks out there are connected to utterly boring businesses. That's exactly what you get from Cintas.The company specializes in corporate uniform rentals and so-called facility services, a term that includes restroom cleaning operations and weekly shipments of freshly sanitized mops. It's the kind of business that nobody really wants to do but needs to be done, so Cintas steps up like a champ.The boredom doesn't stop there. This mundane business has generated annual sales growth of 5.2% over the last five years while earnings rose 19.5% on average. Here's a chart to illustrate those fundamental growth trends: data by  .Cintas generates $366 million of annual free cash flows on sales of $5.1 billion these days, and 39% of that spendable cash is returned to shareholders in the form of dividend checks. Don't let me bore you with stories of Cintas' equally generous share buyback policies, which absorb most of the remaining cash flows every year. Cintas has reduced its total share count by 17% over the last five years, or 34% in a decade.No, you're really here to learn more about Cintas' dividend habits. There, the company has increased its annual payouts without fail in every year since 1984, come what may. Sure, the current yield stands at a skimpy 1.1%, but that's only because share prices have skyrocketed in recent years. It's hard to maintain a generous dividend yield when share prices have tripled in five years. The payouts only doubled over the same period, after all.Uninspiring business operations, totally predictable dividend boosts, solid-as-a-rock growth on both the top and bottom lines...Cintas is the walking definition of a boring stock.And sometimes,  . On American shores, the name NetEase might be familiar to hardcore video game fans or investors who keep a close eye on the technology sector, but it's still relatively unknown compared to other companies operating in the video game and online services spaces. Much of that likely has to do with the fact that the company is based out of and mostly operates in China, but its stock packs a combination of growth potential and returned income that deserves attention from stateside investors.NetEase is partnered with American companies including  and  for the distribution of hugely popular games like  and  , but it also releases popular domestic video game properties and runs social and e-commerce platforms.

The company only began distributing dividends in 2014, but it's delivered payout increases in each subsequent year, and the annualized cost of distributing its current quarterly dividend represents just 25% of trailing free cash flow -- indicating that it has plenty of room to continue payout increases down the line.Trading at roughly 17 times forward earnings estimates, NetEase looks like a worthwhile stock for investing in Chinese internet and video game growth, and the fact that it will pay you to own it further sweetens the pot.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"nvestors in Cintas Corporation (Symbol: CTAS) saw new options become available this week, for the July 21st expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CTAS options chain for the new July 21st contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $125.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.95. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $125.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $123.05 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CTAS, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $126.40/share today.Because the $125.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 59%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.56% return on the cash commitment, or 24.76% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Cintas Corporation, and highlighting in green where the $125.00 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $130.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.00. If an investor was to purchase shares of CTAS stock at the current price level of $126.40/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $130.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 3.64% if the stock gets called away at the July 21st expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CTAS shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Cintas Corporation, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing CTAS's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $130.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $130.00 strike represents an approximate 3% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

"Short sellers have been busy preparing for a decline in the market. According to the latest short interest report, aggregate short interest on the  component companies has increased by 2.4%. That might not sound like much, but that increase registers as one of the largest moves in the past six months. Source: ShutterstockThe increase in shorts suggests that the market may continue to buck the normally negative seasonality that comes as the calendar changes to the month of June and the market climbs the ""Wall of Worry.""We have filtered through the technical and short interest trends of the S&P 500 companies to find potential short squeeze stocks. These are the stocks that show the highest probability of seeing the shorts press stock prices higher as they are forced to close losing positions.As usual, we like to profile three companies that stand out from our models' perspective as short squeeze stock candidates. So here's a look at the three best opportunities we see right now. (NASDAQ:  ) shares saw a tepid reaction to their earnings news last quarter as the outlook for the stock wasn't as exciting as investors had hoped. Since then, VRSN has been trading in a relatively tight range outlined by $90 and $91.50.Short sellers have increased their positions slightly, resulting in a short interest ratio of 16.2. This is in the top 1% of short interest ratios within the S&P 500.The fact that short sellers are betting against a company that is up roughly 19% year-to-date and is in one of the stronger performing sectors puts Verisign right on top of the list of stocks to benefit from a short covering rally.Look for a move above $92 to send the shorts into the market to cover their losing bets on VRSN, which will help this short squeeze stock target a range between $97.50 and $100.Another stock that got no love from a good earnings report is  (NASDAQ:  ). Since their report in April, the stock has been range-bound between $51 and $53 as traders have been backing off the stock.In Garmin's case, we're watching the technical picture closely as GRMN is getting ready to benefit from rising support. The 50- and 100-day moving averages are ascending and creeping up to $51. This should add a technical catalyst to break the stock higher.We've seen some analyst activity of late that should help Garmin stock. After earnings, a number of firms began raining targets on this underloved stock. We expect additional activity on this front, which will help to spark buying.A break above $53 will likely act as the catalyst for the next short covering rally on Garmin stock. In fact, our models target the covering rally to elevate this short squeeze stock to the $56-$58 range.The jobs market is still showing signs of expansion and businesses are growing. This is good for companies like  (NASDAQ:  ) that provide a variety of services from uniforms to industrial products that make companies run.The stock saw a nice rally after its latest earnings report, which was followed almost immediately by a ""sell the news"" selloff to support at the Cintas' 100-day moving average.Short sellers have been closing their positions in CTAS, but the stock's short interest ratio still registers a 9.4, well within the range of readings that our models designate as bullish with the potential of a covering rally.We just saw the stock move back above its 50-day moving average within the last week. This trendline is also moving higher, which our models designate as bullish. The move above this trendline and a break above $126 should combine for the next round of short covering to push Cintas stock higher.We're expecting to see the covering rally push shares of CTAS above $130. For this reason, it would be a good idea to keep an eye on this, as it is one of the most promising short squeeze stocks to buy.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@3 Short Squeeze Stocks to Buy Before Summer Starts@2017-05-31@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-short-squeeze-stocks-to-buy-before-summer-starts-2017-05-31

"""Dividend Aristocrats"" is the moniker bestowed upon companies that have raised their annual dividend for more than 25 years running. This is a pretty exceptional record for many reasons. First, it means that these companies have been so successful that they not only have lots of free cash flow, but that free cash flow is either growing or so enormous that the company can afford dividend growth. Source: Second, Dividend Aristocrats have also figured out how to manage their free cash flow. Free cash can be used for many things, including growing the business, paying dividends or repurchasing stock.That the companies are comfortable enough with present and future expected free cash flow projections that they increase that dividend every year says a lot about their future. That future seems to have only good macro news ahead.With that in mind, here are the three Dividend Aristocrats with the highest five-year annualized dividend growth rate. (NASDAQ:  ) is one of those wonderfully boring Dividend Aristocrats. Most people probably have no idea what CTAS even does and, frankly, neither did I.Get this: It provides uniforms for businesses  . It seems silly, but somebody has to do it, and some uniforms have special requirements, like being fire-resistant. The company is only 50 years old.CTAS is in solid Peter Lynch stalwart territory with 7% earnings growth expect for FY18 and 12% annually for the next five years.The five year annualized dividend growth rate for Cintas is  , and it now has an annual payment of $1.33 per share. Now, that barely comes to a 1%. So you have to decide if CTAS will continue to rise significantly in price - despite trading at 28x earnings - to make up for that small dividend yield. (NYSE:  ) is one of America's granddaddies. Back in 1891, the company was founded, and today it is the name behind many of America's packaged food staples. You know the names: Jennie-O, Skippy, Muscle Milk, SPAM!, Lloyd's, Hormel Chili … the list goes on and on.HRL has a very important business - convenient canned and packaged foods that millions of people will always need. They are cheap, easy to buy and store and get the job done when you're hungry. Hormel has more than $650 million of cash and only $250 million in debt - chump change by most standards. Many companies with their long history draw down tons of debt to keep growing.HRL has a five year annualized dividend growth rate of 18.9%, and only paid about $296 million in dividends in FY16, from FCF of $737 million. It's a bit anemic on the earnings, only growing at 5%, and HRL stock is pricey at 20x earnings. I was also surprised to learn of another Dividend Aristocrat that I had not heard of before:  (NYSE:  ).If you're hip to these names, you know that VFC has made its bones on high-quality outdoor and sports apparel. I think I see The North Face stamped on more than 75% of the gear when I go hiking.Margins are pretty impressive as retailers go, and these items tend to be priced for the serious enthusiasts. Thus, cash flow is good and dividend increases are no surprise. Five-year annualized dividend growth rate is 18.4%, and it is currently $1.68 per year, or about 2.92%.Earnings have been a bit erratic, yet with FCF of about $1.3 billion in FY16, and only $950 million in FY15, VFC still keeps its payout ratio in the 50-60% range.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@3 Dividend Aristocrats With the Highest Growth Rates@2017-07-11@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-dividend-aristocrats-with-the-highest-growth-rates-2017-07-11

n May 30, we issued an updated research report on business services provider,  .Based in Cincinnati, OH, Cintas provides specialized services to various types of businesses throughout North America. The company designs, manufactures, implements corporate identity uniform programs, and provides entrance mats, restroom supplies, promotional products and first aid and safety products for diversified businesses.Cintas has outperformed the Zacks categorized Linen Supply & Related industry with an average year-to-date return of 8.3% compared with a gain of 5.9% for the latter. Revenues have steadily increased over the past few quarters. Cintas aims to continually achieve revenue build-up by increasing penetration levels at existing customers and broadening the customer base to include fresh business segments. The company also identifies additional product and service opportunities for its current and future customers to expand its portfolio. This focused approach for a steady top-line growth is commendable.The acquisition of G&K Services Inc. is further likely to expand Cintas' customer profile and augment its revenues. The combined company is likely to cater to over one billion customers with an extended product portfolio and additional processing capacity. Customer service is also likely to improve with increased route density. The synergies from the combined operations are expected to yield $130 million to $140 million in cost savings from the fourth year of its operation. The transaction is anticipated to be accretive to Cintas' future earnings.In addition, Cintas has a strong balance sheet with adequate liquidity to meet its working capital requirements. Over the years, the company consistently returned significant cash to its shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Its investment strategy takes a holistic view of the rapidly evolving market and deploys a dynamic capital allocation approach to focus on the relative value of the various sectors within the broader industry.However, Cintas procures raw materials from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers, making it susceptible to market risks which are beyond its control. A continuous increase in raw material costs such as cotton also weighs on the margins. Cintas faces stiff competition from national, regional and local companies on various factors such as design, price, quality, service and convenience to the customers. Specifically, its first aid and fire protection services are decidedly commoditized markets and hence are subject to fierce competition. As such, the company has to continually invest in value drivers to fend off competition, which further weakens its profitability. Moreover, a persistent challenging macroeconomic environment has mostly driven customers to perform certain in-house services themselves instead of outsourcing them to Cintas, which resulted in some loss of businesses.Nevertheless, we remain impressed with the inherent growth potential of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. Some better-ranked stocks in the industry include Regal Beloit Corporation  , EnerSys  and UniFirst Corporation  , each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see  .Regal Beloit has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 9%. It topped estimates twice in the trailing four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 1.5%.EnerSys has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 9.5%. It surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 5.1%.UniFirst has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 10.0%. It surpassed estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 2.1%.Did you miss Apple's 9X stock explosion after they launched their iPhone in 2007?

nvestors considering a purchase of Cintas Corporation (Symbol: CTAS) stock, but cautious about paying the going market price of $125.26/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the November put at the $115 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $2.45. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 2.1% return against the $115 commitment, or a 4.6% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to CTAS's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $115 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Cintas Corporation sees its shares fall 8.2% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $112.55 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $2.45 from $115), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 4.6% annualized rate of return.Worth considering, is that the annualized 4.6% figure actually exceeds the 1.1% annualized dividend paid by Cintas Corporation by 3.5%, based on the current share price of $125.26. And yet, if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downside because the stock would have to lose 8.15% to reach the $115 strike price.Always important when discussing dividends is the fact that, in general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Cintas Corporation, looking at the dividend history chart for CTAS below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 1.1% annualized dividend yield.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Cintas Corporation, and highlighting in green where the $115 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the November put at the $115 strike for the 4.6% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Cintas Corporation (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $125.26) to be 18%. For other put options contract ideas at the various different available expirations, visit the  page of StockOptionsChannel.com.In mid-afternoon trading on Wednesday, the put volume among S&P 500 components was 763,322 contracts, with call volume at 763,322, for a put:call ratio of 0.76 so far for the day, which is above normal compared to the long-term median put:call ratio of .65. In other words, if we look at the number of call buyers and then use the long-term median to project the number of put buyers we'd expect to see, we're actually seeing more put buyers than expected out there in  so far today.  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Agree To Purchase Cintas Corporation At $115, Earn 4.6% Annualized Using Options@2017-05-31@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/agree-purchase-cintas-corporation-115-earn-46-annualized-using-options-2017-05-31
he best place to find great investments is often where no one else is looking. While everyone and their grandmother follows heavyweights like  and  , there's a wide world of overlooked stocks that garner little attention.We asked three of our contributors to discuss stocks that don't get the attention they deserve. Here's why  (NASDAQ: CTAS) ,  (NYSE: BBY) , and  (NASDAQ: CLDX) are three top stocks that you may be ignoring. Too many investors look to industries like technology or biotech for market-crushing growth stocks when you can find them in boring businesses. Consider Cintas. At its core, it is a uniform rental company that has also branched out into some ancillary segments such as cleaning services, first aid and safety equipment sales, and compliance services. It's a business that hasn't changed drastically over the past 100 years, yet Cintas' stock has more than doubled over the past three years and has more than tripled the  over that period on a total return basis.None of those businesses are anything to write home about, but what makes the company a fantastic investment is its focus on generating returns for investors over the long term. Cintas maintains modest revenue growth, high margins, and exceptional returns on equity. It also generates a lot of free cash flow that can be used to pay a fast-growing dividend and buy back stock. data by  .Two other elements make Cintas worth a look as a long-term investment. One is that the founding family owns a considerable stake -- a little over 20% -- and the company has increased its dividend payments every year for 32 years straight. Traits like that are positive signs when you want to make an investment with a multidecade time horizon.Cintas is a resilient business, and its prospects very much wax and wane with the overall health of the economy. Perhaps once robots have replaced all humans in the workplace, then the need for uniform rental and cleaning services will no longer be necessary. We're still a long ways away from that happening, and that makes Cintas a compelling investment that you may not have considered before now. It can be easy to ignore the entire retail industry given the growth of e-commerce, but throwing out the baby with the bathwater would be a mistake. Consumer electronics retailer Best Buy has managed to consistently improve its bottom line over the past few years by slashing unnecessary costs, even as it began price-matching Amazon to kill the practice of showrooming. Sales growth has been inconsistent, in part due to a lack of exciting new products, but Best Buy is in a far stronger position today than it was in a few years ago.Image source: Best Buy.This profit growth comes despite major investments in e-commerce, which have helped Best Buy drive consistent double-digit online sales growth. The company ships online orders out of its more than 1,000 stores, helping to cut down on average shipping times and better compete with Amazon. Online sales surged 20.8% in fiscal 2017.With annual adjusted earnings per share of $3.56 and $2.56 billion of excess cash on the balance sheet, Best Buy stock trades at a cash-adjusted P/E ratio of just over 11. This cash will help it fund $3 billion of share buybacks over the next two years, enough to buy back one-fifth of all outstanding shares. Further earnings growth will be more difficult going forward, with much of the low-hanging fruit already picked when it comes to cost-cutting. But Best Buy is well positioned to be competitive in a world where consumers are increasingly shifting online. Long-term investors looking for a stock that could more than double over the next couple years might want to revisit or become acquainted with this clinical-stage biotech stock.Celldex Therapeutics fell out of favor a little over a year ago when its brain cancer candidate, Rintega, performed as expected but technically failed its trial because patients in the standard treatment control group did surprisingly well. Although the company has completely switched gears to focus on new drug candidates entirely unrelated to Rintega, an  of just $224 million makes this one of the most overlooked stocks in biotech right now.The company's largest near-term catalyst is a clinical trial with glembatumumab vedotin, or glemba, for the treatment of patients with an extremely difficult to treat form of breast cancer. The patients also have tumors with glemba's target protein on their surface. Once glemba finds its target, it's invited inside the cell where it unleashes a super-lethal dose of chemo.In a previous study, similar patients survived more than twice as long without signs of disease progression than those receiving standard treatments. An ongoing trial should finish enrolling 300 of these patients in September, and if the results fall in line with previous observations it would probably lead to an eventual approval and a soaring stock price.While I'd say glemba's potential as a breast cancer treatment alone makes Celldex stock a buy, there's plenty more in the pipeline. Glemba itself is in three other mid-stage clinical trials, one sponsored by the company for skin cancer, plus two investigator-sponsored trials for rare malignancies.Beyond glemba, immune stimulator varlilumab, is in a combination study with the blockbuster drug Opdivo as a possible combination therapy for treatment of a variety of tumors types. Further down the road, it's has a handful of drugs aimed at various targets in early-stage clinical trials.The company finished 2016 with $189.8 million in cash and liquid assets after burning through about $128.5 million last year. This should be enough to keep the lights on while waiting for glemba's breast cancer trial results. Add it all up and this is one biotech stock worthy of far more attention than it's been getting lately.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"ost companies are sensitive to the health of the overall economy, but  (NASDAQ: CTAS) in particular has to rely heavily on employment trends in the workplace. With its core uniform rental business, the more workers are in the workforce, the more demand Cintas sees for its products. Coming into its fiscal third-quarter financial report, Cintas investors expected the company to find ways to produce modest growth and keep its positive momentum tied to that of the U.S. economy. For the most part, Cintas delivered on that promise, and it sees a bright future for itself going forward.Let's take a closer look at Cintas to see how it did and what's coming up in the future.Cintas goes beyond uniforms to provide safety equipment as well. Image source: Cintas.Cintas' fiscal third-quarter results continued a steady pace of growth for the company. Revenue was up 5.3% to $1.28 billion, which roughly matched what most investors were looking to see from the uniform services specialist. GAAP net income was up just 1% to $118.6 million, but adjusted earnings from continuing operations of $1.08 per share was slightly more than the consensus forecast for $1.07 per share.A closer look at Cintas' results adds some color to the company's corporate picture. Uniform rental and facility services revenue outperformed the overall gains for the company as a whole, posting top-line gains exceeding 6%. The first aid and safety services business saw more modest 5% growth, and the all-other catchall segment brought up the rear with a 2% growth rate. On the bottom line, though, only the uniform services business posted pre-tax profit gains, while first aid dropped about 3% and the all-other segment posted a more than 20% drop.The biggest problem was the rise in its overhead expenses, which is a theme that has occurred time and time again for Cintas. Selling and administrative expenses jumped at more than a 9% clip during the quarter, and that led to compressed operating margin figures for the company. Acquisition costs were also a headwind that Cintas had to fight as it continued to prepare for its acquisition of G&K Services. Still, with organic growth trends continuing to stay in the range of 7%, it is capitalizing on its opportunities well.CEO Scott Farmer was happy about the results. ""[Our gross margin improvement] and our industry-leading revenue growth are indicative of a healthy company,"" Farmer said, ""with significant opportunities ahead."" Farmer also pointed to synergies from the acquisition of ZEE Medical in helping to support the first aid and safety services segment.Cintas anticipates that the coming year will continue to be lucrative for the company. Indeed, now that the acquisition of G&K is complete, Cintas expects to reap annual synergies of $130 million to $140 million by the fourth full year after the acquisition. That could produce a nice profit boost in the long run.However, Cintas' success has created some short-term uncertainties. In response to the fact that achieving cost savings from synergies between G&K and Cintas will require time and effort, Cintas decided to pull its guidance for the remainder of fiscal 2017. That will leave investors without clear direction about where the company sees itself moving in the near term, but it also gives Cintas flexibility to take one-time charges as appropriate in order to set up its integration process in a way that will produce the most success in the long run.Investors were generally happy with how Cintas did, and the stock has climbed to new all-time highs in response to the report. Looking ahead, if the U.S. employment picture continues to look strong, then Cintas should be in a prime position to capitalize and keep moving forward with its growth efforts well into the future.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

" major misconception in investing is that the only stocks that beat the market over time are smaller, fast-growing companies in red-hot industries. You know what I'm talking about, the tech unicorns or the breakout biotech stocks. This mentality overlooks some of the best market-crushing stocks: Companies that barely make the headlines, but continually generate high rates of returns that reward shareholders.If you need proof that investing in companies like this are great investments, consider these five companies: water heater manufacturer  (NYSE: AOS) , household maintenance marketer  (NASDAQ: WDFC) , uniform rental specialist  (NASDAQ: CTAS) , cosmetics and hygiene product manufacturer  (NYSE: EL) , and aftermarket automotive parts retailer  (NYSE: AZO) . Over the past decade, all of these companies have more than doubled the total return of the  . Here's a quick breakdown of why these companies are able to continuously generate market-crushing returns.Image source: Getty Images.At first glance, it's not easy to see what these disparate businesses have in common. The phrase ""I need a water heater, a replacement alternator, some eyeliner, and a chef's coat"" only exists in the setup to some bizarre prank. It's not the specific products or services that these companies sell that unites them. Rather, it's the traits of those sales that make them compelling. data by  .There are three basic traits that all of these companies share: They are all in repeat-purchase or recurring-revenue businesses, they sell high-margin products or services, and the capital requirements for their businesses are modest. Perhaps the one company in the group here that doesn't completely fit that mold is A.O. Smith. After all, consumers aren't buying new hot water heaters every six months. That said, more than 80% of boilers and water heaters sold in North America are replacements for older systems rather than new construction. This makes sales in the business remarkably consistent.With a well-established consumer base and consistent demand in place, each of these companies has incredible pricing power that leads to high margins. For WD-40 and Estee Lauder, that pricing power comes down to their high-value brands that command a high price point. For Cintas and A.O. Smith, it's providing and essential product of service where they are market leaders. And for AutoZone, well, selling aftermarket parts for vehicles is akin to printing money (this is coming from a person whose family was in the automotive repair business for a long time). It's no surprise, then, that all of these companies have gross margins of 40% or more. data by  .All of these things are great, but what puts all of these companies over the top is that their respective businesses don't require a lot of reinvested capital. WD-40 is the shining example of this. It doesn't even manufacture its own products -- they are contracted out and manufactured by third parties instead. Over the past 20 years, the company has only spent $65 million on capital expenditures.While the rest of these businesses certainly aren't on the same level of asset-light businesses as WD-40, all of them are able to maintain their current operations with little capital improvements. What is also important here is that all of them are in relatively mature markets, so investing in growth is minimal. As a result, each of these companies generates loads of free cash flow on a regular basis without anywhere to reinvest it.The best way to show this is free cash flow to assets. This metric shows how much cash the company makes for every dollar of assets in the business. In this case, all of these companies consistently generate $0.08 to $0.15 in free cash flow annually for every $1 of assets on the books. You may get better results from software companies, but for basic products and services like these, being able to convert free cash flow at those rates is a remarkable accomplishment. data by  .With so much free cash flow, and few places to reinvest without running into the laws of diminishing returns, what better way to use it than give it back to shareholders? Dividend policies aside -- Cintas paid a special dividend in 2015 after the sale of a business line, and Estee Lauder went from an annual dividend to a quarterly dividend in 2013 -- all but AutoZone have more than doubled their dividend payments over the past decade and each has payout ratios of less than 50%, which suggests there is still plenty of room to grow those payouts.What AutoZone lacks in a dividend payment, it makes up for with share repurchases. While all of these companies have used share repurchases to reduce share counts and increase per-share value for shareholders, AutoZone really takes the cake here as it has bought back more than half of all shares outstanding over the past 10 years. data by  .The one-two punch of dividends and share repurchases can go a long way toward growing shareholder value, especially when businesses like these are in mature or constrained markets.If you are on the hunt for market-crushing stocks, chances are you will look at the high-flying, newsworthy companies that analysts espouse for their ability to disrupt the status quo. In reality, though, companies that keep the status quo can be just as valuable for your portfolio. No one is going to think you are a Wall Street soothsayer for owning stocks in cosmetics, auto parts, work uniform rentals, or hot water heaters. But if you want to grow wealth over time, it's hard to argue with what A.O. Smith, WD-40, Cintas, Estee Lauder, and AutoZone have to offer.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"n recent trading, shares of Cintas Corporation (Symbol: CTAS) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $125.71, changing hands for $125.88/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 7 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Cintas Corporation, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $97.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $145.00. The standard deviation is $18.517.But the whole reason to look at the  CTAS price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with CTAS crossing above that average target price of $125.71/share, investors in CTAS have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $125.71 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Cintas Corporation:

usiness services provider  recorded strong third-quarter fiscal 2017 (ended Feb 28, 2017) results on the back of healthy top-line growth. Net income from continuing operations for the reported quarter improved to $118.6 million or $1.08 per share from $117.3 million or $1.05 per share in the year-earlier quarter. Adjusted earnings for the reported quarter were $1.11 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5 cents.Quarterly revenues increased 5.3% year over year to $1,281.1 million, exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,279 million. Organic growth for the reported quarter improved 6.5% year over year. The superior top-line performance was primarily attributable to the addition of new customers, strong customer retention and higher penetration of existing customers through better and innovative products and services.Gross margin increased for the 14th consecutive quarter on a year-over-year basis to 44.2% from 43.1% in the prior-year quarter. Operating income was $194.7 million, up 0.9% year over year. Operating margin was 15.2%, slightly lower than 15.9% in the year-earlier quarter, owing to transaction expenses related to the acquisition of G&K Services, Inc.Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenues for the quarter improved 6.1% year over year to $993.4 million. The segment accounted for 77.5% of the total revenue, with year-over-year organic growth of 7.3%. Gross margin increased 100 basis points (bps) to 45.0% in the reported quarter.Revenues from Other segment were up 2.9% year over year to $287.7 million, while its gross margin improved 130 bps to 41.6%. This segment includes the First Aid and Safety Services, and All Other businesses that comprise the Fire Protection Services and Direct Sale business. The First Aid and Safety Services recorded solid gross margin improvement of 260 bps to 44.8% due to synergies from the acquisition of ZEE Medical in fiscal 2016.Subsequent to the quarter end, Cintas completed the acquisition of G&K Services for approximately $2.2 billion, including acquired net debt, after receiving all the requisite regulatory approvals.Headquartered in Minneapolis, MN, G&K Services operates as a branded uniform and facility services program provider in the U.S. and Canada. With over 8,000 employees serving over 170,000 customers from 160 facilities in North America, it reported annual revenues of $978 million in fiscal 2016.G&K Services would operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cintas and is likely to retain its existing brand name. The successful integration of G&K Services is likely to expand Cintas' customer profile and augment its revenues. The combined company is likely to cater to over one billion business customers with an extended product portfolio and additional processing capacity.Customer service is also likely to improve with increased route density. The synergies from the combined operations are expected to yield $130 million to $140 million in cost savings from the fourth full year following the acquisition.

eading business service provider  is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2017 results after the closing bell on Mar 22. In the last reported quarter, adjusted earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.With continued focus on core businesses, Cintas' revenues have steadily increased over the past few quarters. It aims to achieve revenue build-up by increasing penetration levels at existing customers and broadening customer base to include fresh business segments. The company also identifies additional product and service opportunities for its current and future customers to expand its portfolio. This focused approach for steady top-line growth is commendable.Cintas has further received the regulatory approvals for the acquisition of rival G&K Services Inc. With annual revenues of approximately $1.0 billion, G&K Services has over 170,000 customers in the U.S. and Canada. The successful integration of G&K Services is likely to expand Cintas' customer profile and augment its revenues. The combined company is likely to cater to over one billion business customers with an extended product portfolio and additional processing capacity.Customer service is also likely to improve with increased route density. The synergies from the combined operations are expected to yield $130 million to $140 million in cost savings and the transaction is anticipated to be accretive to Cintas' earnings from the second year of its operation. Although the transaction is not likely to have any direct impact on the impending quarterly results, it is likely to attract favorable contracts from existing as well as new customers and improve the top line.However, a persistent challenging macroeconomic environment has mostly driven customers to perform certain in-house services themselves, instead of outsourcing them to Cintas. This has often resulted in some loss of businesses in the past and is likely to lead to lower earnings in the to-be-reported quarter as well.In addition, the company procures raw materials from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers, making it susceptible to market risks. The volatility in raw material costs such as cotton may weigh on the margins in the upcoming quarterly results. Also, U.S. and foreign trade policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, trade sanctions, and limitations on the imports of certain types of goods, particularly after Brexit, are likely to affect its profitability.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Cintas is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it lacks the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is currently pegged at 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . |  Cintas currently carries Zacks Rank #2. Although this increases the predictive power of ESP, the company's 0.00% ESP makes an earnings prediction uncertain.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or #5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Conagra Brands, Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +4.44% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see  .Hawaiian Holdings, Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +3.61% and a Zacks Rank #3.Constellation Brands, Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +0.73% and a Zacks Rank #3.Before looking into the stocks mentioned above, you may want to get a head start on potential tech IPOs that are popping up on Zacks' radar.

Operating income was $194.7 million, up 0.9% year over year.

"n recent trading, shares of Cintas Corporation (Symbol: CTAS) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $119.50, changing hands for $119.51/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 10 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Cintas Corporation, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $92.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $135.00. The standard deviation is $17.283.But the whole reason to look at the  CTAS price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with CTAS crossing above that average target price of $119.50/share, investors in CTAS have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $119.50 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

"ince President Donald Trump's surprise victory in November, Wall Street has been scrambling to identify businesses that have the most to gain under the new administration. The stock market's broad advance to record highs suggested that investors saw winners almost everywhere they looked. But as Trump's ""America First"" themes translate into actual policies, it should become clearer which companies could be the biggest beneficiaries.We went hunting for potential America First stocks, using several criteria. To start, we wanted companies that derive the vast majority of their sales domestically and stand to do well if Trump makes good on his promise to sharply boost U.S. economic growth.Then we looked for businesses that would benefit from specific Trump themes--for example, ramping up job creation and stoking wage growth, which could spur consumer spending; increasing outlays for infrastructure projects; and promoting U.S. exports. Other considerations included Trump's pledge to cut corporate tax rates and his vow to eliminate what he considers excessive business regulation.We came up with seven companies that we think qualify as great America First investment ideas. Three major caveats: First, there's no guarantee that Trump's policies will emerge as promised. Second, even if they do, there's no assurance that they will work as touted--unintended consequences could turn some likely business winners into stunned losers. Third, record- high stock prices may already reflect much of any bump in the profitability of America First companies.That said, here are our seven picks.Data is as of February 28, 2017, unless otherwise indicated. Click on symbol links in each slide for current share prices and more.This could be the ultimate Trump stock. The company is the second-largest U.S. producer of ""aggregates""--the cement, asphalt, sand and other raw materials used in construction. Nearly all of Martin Marietta's 2016 sales of $3.6 billion were made in the U.S. The firm has been riding high for the past four years as demand from infrastructure projects has surged. Earnings per share reached $6.63 in 2016, up from $1.83 in 2012. The stock has doubled since February 2016.The question now is whether growth can remain stellar far enough into the future to justify a higher share price. The controversial U.S.-Mexico border wall would be one source of demand. But bulls are also betting that Trump is serious about funding a huge new program to fix roads, bridges, airports and other infrastructure. That could mean a long growth streak for Martin Marietta. One project already under way: Congress in 2015 funded a jump in highway construction through 2020. If Trump and Congress agree on much more of the same, Martin Marietta should win big. The company last year raised its dividend for the first time since 2008 and pledged a ""return to consistent dividend growth.""Should the job market get the kind of boost Trump has promised, Cintas could be a major beneficiary.It's the largest provider of uniforms for businesses, with 25% of the U.S. market in industries such as hotels, casinos, food-service firms and manufacturers. Cintas's market share will grow to 31% when it completes a $2.2 billion deal to buy rival G&K Services (  ) this year. About 90% of Cintas's business is domestic. Even in the sluggish economy of the past seven years, the firm shone. Analysts expect sales in the fiscal year that ends this May to reach $5.2 billion (excluding G&K's revenues), up from $3.5 billion in fiscal 2010. They see earnings of $4.60 per share in the current year, compared with $1.40 in 2010.Besides its main business of renting (and cleaning) uniforms, Cintas has added other fee-producing services, such as providing first-aid supplies to clients on its routes. Brokerage Robert W. Baird says the purchase of G&K will give Cintas ""unprecedented scale"" as well as cost-saving opportunities, and Baird expects annual percentage earnings growth in the ""high teens"" through 2020. Cintas also boasts a strong balance sheet and has raised its dividend for 33 straight years. It did so even during the 2007-09 recession, despite a temporary profit slump.The retailer's earnings and stock price have had phenomenal runs as the U.S. housing market has recovered from its 2006-12 plunge. And the nation's largest home-improvement retailer remains in great shape to benefit if Trump's policies boost domestic job growth and wages, providing Americans with more to spend on their abodes.About 90% of the firm's $95 billion in annual sales are made in the U.S., with the rest in Canada and Mexico. To its credit, Home Depot's leadership ended a foray into China in 2012, after Chinese consumers rejected the do-it-yourself improvement concept.Since then, Home Depot has focused heavily on improving efficiency in its U.S. operations, helping to drive profits to record levels. The company earned $6.45 per share in the fiscal year that ended January 31, up 18% from the previous year. Wall Street expects profits to rise by 12% in the year that ends next January. Even if higher mortgage rates slow home construction somewhat, Home Depot derives 65% of sales from home-maintenance spending, compared with 35% from new building, according to research firm Morningstar. Also, aging housing stock coupled with aging baby boomers should provide a ""solid demographic driver"" of home-improvement sales long term, CFRA Research says.BofA may actually be the closest thing to ""America's bank."" With $2.2 trillion in assets, it is second only to JPMorgan Chase (  ) in size. But unlike its biggest rivals, BofA is mostly a homebody: 88% of its revenue comes from U.S. operations, including credit cards, small-business loans and its Merrill Lynch brokerage subsidiary.BofA nearly collapsed during the 2008-09 financial crisis, but it was saved by the government's massive bank-bailout program (the company has repaid Uncle Sam). BofA remade itself by jettisoning bad mortgages, slashing costs and refocusing on its basic businesses. Customers stuck with it: BofA's deposits have surged to $1.26 trillion, from $805 billion in 2007.Now earnings are rebounding at a healthy pace. Profits rose by 14% in 2016, and analysts on average expect a 16% gain in 2017. Key to the outlook is the assumption that the Federal Reserve will continue to slowly raise short-term interest rates, allowing BofA (and other banks) to boost earnings by hiking the rates it charges for loans faster than the rates it pays on deposits. Given its dependence on the U.S. economy, the bank could also gain from any Trump policies that speed growth and lessen financial regulation. Brokerage Keefe, Bruyette & Woods says that overall, BofA has ""the best earnings trajectory of its peers.""If Trump's centerpiece idea is to strengthen U.S. manufacturing, Hershey could be the litmus test.The company's chocolate is as American as a brand can be, holding 46% of the U.S. market. And Hershey still does a huge portion of its production in its namesake Pennsylvania town, where Milton Hershey set up shop in the early 1900s. In 2016, the firm racked up $7.4 billion in sales, 88% in the U.S. and Canada. Its brands extend well beyond chocolate, including Bubble Yum, Good & Plenty, Jolly Rancher and Twizzlers.Food rival Mondelez International (  ) highlighted the value of Hershey's pantry last summer by offering to buy the company for $107 per share, or $23 billion. The bid was rejected by the philanthropy that Milton Hershey set up to hold 80% of the voting power of the company's stock. Hershey could argue that it does very well alone: The company gets high marks for generating strong shareholder returns over the past 10 years. And new CEO Michelle Buck took over on March 1 with a promise to cut at least $100 million in costs in each of the next three years to further bolster profits. The cuts could also free up cash for new-product development and growth overseas. Any Trump lift to the economy could be extra sauce on the sundae for Hershey.Like Home Depot, Masco is a bet that Trump will find a way to get more money into the pockets of American consumers. Masco is a major producer of home-improvement and building products, so it should benefit from policies that underpin economic growth and lift incomes. Masco's Behr house-paint line is the number-one brand for do-it-yourselfers, with 28% of the market. The company is also a leader in plumbing products, under the Delta, Peerless, Hansgrohe and other brand names; cabinetry (KraftMaid, Merillat); and windows (Milgard). About 80% of sales are domestic.A big part of Masco's appeal lies in a corporate overhaul undertaken in 2014, says Morningstar. New leadership has built a ""stronger and more consistent"" business by cutting costs, focusing on the company's most profitable lines and expanding sales of Behr paint to professional painters, Morningstar says. Excluding one-time items, profits surged by 27% in 2016, to $1.51 per share, as sales rose 3%, to $7.4 billion. Analysts expect earnings to rise 23% in 2017 and 12% in 2018, further strengthening the firm's already-solid balance sheet.Trump's America First plan has two pieces that are bullish for defense contractor Raytheon: a pledge to pump up U.S. military outlays and a promise to boost U.S. exports. Raytheon faced four years of slowly declining revenue from 2011 through 2014 amid Pentagon cutbacks. But a turnaround began in 2015, and Trump and Congress are expected to feed the recovery by increasing defense spending, including for such Raytheon specialties as missiles, electronics, radar and cybersecurity. With foreign business accounting for 30% of its sales, Raytheon isn't as pure of an America First play as the other companies on this list. But brokerage RBC Capital says that the company should benefit from continued ""intense demand"" from foreign governments for its missiles and anti-missile systems.In 2016, Raytheon's earnings rose 10.2%, to $7.44 per share, as sales edged up 3.5%, to $24.1 billion. Analysts expect flat earnings in 2017, but they see profits rising to a record $8.30 per share in 2018, thanks in part to Raytheon's order backlog of nearly $37 billion. What's more, RBC notes, Raytheon has a long history of rewarding shareholders with dividend increases and stock buybacks, which should continue thanks to the company's healthy finances.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@7 Great America First Stocks to Own Under Trump@2017-03-02@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-great-america-first-stocks-own-under-trump-2017-03-02
"nvestors in Cintas Corporation (Symbol: CTAS) saw new options begin trading this week, for the April 21st expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CTAS options chain for the new April 21st contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $115.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.50. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $115.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $113.50 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CTAS, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $118.84/share today.Because the $115.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 69%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of CTAS stock at the current price level of $118.84/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $120.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 3.25% if the stock gets called away at the April 21st expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CTAS shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Cintas Corporation, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing CTAS's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $120.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $120.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Sealed Air's fourth quarter is likely to be the strongest quarter of the year, with organic sales growth of approximately 3%. Growth in the quarter will be primarily driven by accelerated volume in both Food Care and Product Care. Sealed Air expects improved performance in both its top and bottom line in the fourth quarter, driven by its consistent efforts to build a robust pipeline for its innovative solutions and capitalize on end market growth opportunities.Moreover, the company is likely to gain from its acquisitions, focus on growth opportunities, effective cost management and savings from restructuring.

he Federal Reserve maintained interest rates in February, providing no update on the next hike. The Fed's reluctance in raising rates should stand in good stead for dividend aristocrats.President Donald Trump's travel ban, in the meanwhile, could result in a possible rise in erratic share price movement this month. The stock market has also, traditionally, seen weak results this month, especially after an election. In such a scenario, investing in dividend aristocrats seems prudent as they provide higher total returns with lower volatility, which are undoubtedly the 'holy grail' of investing.As widely expected, the Fed has kept rates unchanged following a two-day policy meeting on Feb 1. The central bank kept its benchmark overnight lending rate target at a range of 0.5% to 0.75%. The bank had lifted rates by a quarter percentage point in December, marking the second hike in more than 10 years.In fact, the central bank penciled three quarter-point moves this year in December. More importantly for investors, the central bank didn't drop any hints of raising rates in the March meet, placing the probability of such a move at only 18%, according to CME Group.In this case, high quality  have become more appealing as their stock prices don't suffer when rates aren't rising. Conversely, bond markets, which tend to benefit from a rise in interest rates, have lost its lure.The Fed's positive view of the economy and Apple Inc.'s  stellar earnings helped stocks rally a little higher on Feb 1. However, investors have not yet recovered from the blow of Trump's immigration ban. An executive order by Trump banned immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries, including legal residents and visa holders. Trump had earlier fostered expectations that his administration will be business friendly and therefore should bode well for the equity market. This decision has drawn congressional criticism and widespread protests. These protectionist measures may also cloud the path for pro-business initiatives as several world and corporate leaders condemn the ban.Airlines bore the brunt as well as several airports across the country saw violent protests, disrupting operations to a great extent. Tech firms also faced obstacles in sourcing labor from foreign lands. Trump's first press conference since July also disappointed investors due to lack of policy detail. He severely criticized pharmaceutical companies over high drug prices, dealing a blow to leading biotech stocks.Such uncertainties make dividend paying stocks more attractive as they tend to outperform when the broader markets are subject to gyrations. Notably, the month of February has traditionally seen weak numbers just after the election.February has been the weakest month for stocks over the past four decades, averaging just a 0.06% gain. In fact, in post-election years, February tends to be weaker. The average return has decreased 1.85% since 1977.Lest we forget, markets have gone 74 days without a 1% daily decline, hence, the seasonality pattern increases the odds of a wider decline in February.Dividend aristocrats outperform other dividend payers on better quality business. This category of stocks reflect a solid financial structure and healthy underlying fundamentals. Such stocks are immune to market vagaries and have also raked in excellent risk-adjusted returns over the last decade. In fact, in the last one year, the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index rallied 19.6%, above the S&P 500's 17.5%.Dividend Aristocrats generated an annualized return of 9.7% over the past 10 years, easily topping the broader market's 6.3% rate. During this period, dividends accounted for 31% of the market's total return, highlighting their importance in determining total shareholder return.We have, thus, selected five such dividend aristocrats to boost your returns. Such stocks also possess a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The favorable Zacks Rank should help these stocks gain further this year as well.

 is scheduled to report its fourth-quarter and full-year 2016 figures after the opening bell on Feb 8, 2017.Over the last one month, iRobot's shares recorded a return of 8.75%- outperforming 7.38% return provided by the Zacks categorized  industry.Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.iRobot believes that the robust momentum of its U.S. business and strategic marketing programs would fuel top- and bottom-line growth in the quarter-to-be-reported. Notably, rise in demand of the premium home robotics products would likely boost the company's aggregate sales in the quarter under review. For instance, increased consumer adoption of the company's robot - Roomba - is expected to supplement the company's Asian market sales in the quarter.Notably, iRobot is poised to grow on the back of meaningful innovations, strategic marketing programs and diligent restructuring initiatives.However, certain headwinds, such as fall in customers' brand loyalty, emergence of an unfavorable political outcome in the market or sluggish global economic growth might be serious setbacks.Based on the existing market conditions, iRobot projects earnings in the range of 36 to 44 cents per share and revenues in $202-$207 million band for the fourth-quarter.Our proven model does not conclusively show that iRobot is likely to beat earnings this quarter.

 is scheduled to report its fourth-quarter and full-year 2016 results before the opening bell on Feb 2, 2017.Xylem's stock is currently underperforming the Zacks categorized Machinery-General Industrial industry. Over the last three months, shares of this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock recorded a return of 4.90% - weaker than 17.55% return provided by the Machinery-General Industrial industry.However, this Zacks Rank #4 stock has witnessed a positive average earnings surprise of 1.74% for the trailing four quarters.Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Certain industry specific headwinds might hurt Xylem's top- and bottom-line results in the quarter under review.For instance, dismal pricing conditions in the energy market are currently hurting Xylem's dewatering business. Choppy  might further hurt the sales of oil companies and, hence, significantly lower the extent of Greenfield investments made within the sector. This would ultimately reduce the investments made by oil companies and hence weigh over the near-term sales generated by producers of heavy equipment, machinery parts and steel products like Xylem.Also, Xylem's operating margin is highly sensitive to continuous price fluctuations of major inputs like nickel, copper, aluminum, plastics, seals, bearings, motors and fabricated parts.Each business segment of Xylem faces stiff competition. Extensive business rivalry increases the bargaining power of customers and thus, exposes the company to risks of market share loss. In order to retain competitive power, Xylem is forced to make heavy innovation and turnkey project investments, which add to its near-term aggregate debt level. Even so, the appreciating U.S. dollar is enhancing the competitive power of smaller companies operating in low-cost nations, thereby increasing revenue and margin loss risks for Xylem.Xylem's business is also largely dependent on third-party suppliers as well as commodity and contract manufacturing market conditions. The company accrues different types of components, raw materials and input parts from these entities. Xylem is likely to face severe supply chain challenges and would fail in providing accurate services to customers, if the third-party suppliers are unable to provide the required materials on time. Notably, adverse climatic conditions such as heavy floods and droughts might give rise to severe operational challenges to the company.Based on the existing conditions, the company anticipates generating revenue worth $3.8 billion for full-year 2016. While expects to report earnings within the range of $2.02-$2.04 per share for the whole-year.Over the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the stock has been revised downward for both 2016 and 2017.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Xylem is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as we will see below. Xylem currently has an Earnings ESP of -3.08%.

"Chicago, IL - February 03, 2017 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include  (NYSE:  -  ),  (NYSE:  -  ),  (NYSE:  -  ),  (NASDAQ:  -  ) and  (NYSE:  -  ).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations. The Federal Reserve maintained interest rates in February, providing no update on the next hike. The Fed's reluctance in raising rates should stand in good stead for dividend aristocrats.President Donald Trump's travel ban, in the meanwhile, could result in a possible rise in erratic share price movement this month. The stock market has also, traditionally, seen weak results this month, especially after an election. In such a scenario, investing in dividend aristocrats seems prudent as they provide higher total returns with lower volatility, which are undoubtedly the 'holy grail' of investing.As widely expected, the Fed has kept rates unchanged following a two-day policy meeting on Feb 1. The central bank kept its benchmark overnight lending rate target at a range of 0.5% to 0.75%. The bank had lifted rates by a quarter percentage point in December, marking the second hike in more than 10 years.In fact, the central bank penciled three quarter-point moves this year in December. More importantly for investors, the central bank didn't drop any hints of raising rates in the March meet, placing the probability of such a move at only 18%, according to CME Group.In this case, high quality  have become more appealing as their stock prices don't suffer when rates aren't rising. Conversely, bond markets, which tend to benefit from a rise in interest rates, have lost its lure.The Fed's positive view of the economy and Apple Inc.'s stellar earnings helped stocks rally a little higher on Feb 1. However, investors have not yet recovered from the blow of Trump's immigration ban. An executive order by Trump banned immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries, including legal residents and visa holders. Trump had earlier fostered expectations that his administration will be business friendly and therefore should bode well for the equity market. This decision has drawn congressional criticism and widespread protests. These protectionist measures may also cloud the path for pro-business initiatives as several world and corporate leaders condemn the ban.Airlines bore the brunt as well as several airports across the country saw violent protests, disrupting operations to a great extent. Tech firms also faced obstacles in sourcing labor from foreign lands. Trump's first press conference since July also disappointed investors due to lack of policy detail. He severely criticized pharmaceutical companies over high drug prices, dealing a blow to leading biotech stocks.Such uncertainties make dividend paying stocks more attractive as they tend to outperform when the broader markets are subject to gyrations. Notably, the month of February has traditionally seen weak numbers just after the election.February has been the weakest month for stocks over the past four decades, averaging just a 0.06% gain. In fact, in post-election years, February tends to be weaker. The average return has decreased 1.85% since 1977.Lest we forget, markets have gone 74 days without a 1% daily decline, hence, the seasonality pattern increases the odds of a wider decline in February.Dividend aristocrats outperform other dividend payers on better quality business. This category of stocks reflect a solid financial structure and healthy underlying fundamentals. Such stocks are immune to market vagaries and have also raked in excellent risk-adjusted returns over the last decade. In fact, in the last one year, the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index rallied 19.6%, above the S&P 500's 17.5%.Dividend Aristocrats generated an annualized return of 9.7% over the past 10 years, easily topping the broader market's 6.3% rate. During this period, dividends accounted for 31% of the market's total return, highlighting their importance in determining total shareholder return.We have, thus, selected five such dividend aristocrats to boost your returns. Such stocks also possess a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The favorable Zacks Rank should help these stocks gain further this year as well. You can see  .

t has been about a month since the last earnings report for Cintas Corp.  . Shares have lost over 5% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Cintas recorded relatively modest second-quarter fiscal 2017 (ended Nov 30, 2016) results on the back of healthy top-line growth. The company's net income was $123.5 million or $1.13 per share from continuing operations compared with $115.5 million or $1.03 per share in the year-earlier quarter. Adjusted earnings for the reported quarter were $1.15 per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $0.01.Quarterly revenues increased 6.4% year over year to $1,296.9 million, exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,292 million. Organic growth for the reported quarter improved 5.7% year over year. The superior top-line performance was primarily attributable to the addition of new customers, strong customer retention and higher penetration of existing customers through better and innovative products and services.Gross margin for the reported quarter was 44.1% compared with 43.3% in the prior-year quarter. Operating income was $202.9 million, up 1.3% year over year. Operating margin was 15.6%, slightly lower than 16.4% in the year-earlier quarter.Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenues for the quarter improved 7.2% year over year to $1,005.6 million. The segment accounted for 77.5% of the total revenue, with year-over-year organic growth of 6.5%. Gross margin increased 80 basis points to 44.7% in the reported quarter.Revenues from Other segment were up 3.5% year over year to $291.4 million. This segment includes the First Aid and Safety Services, and All Other businesses that comprise the Fire Protection Services and Direct Sale business. The First Aid and Safety Services recorded organic growth of 3.3%, while its gross margin increased 290 basis points to 46.1% due to improved sourcing and leverage from existing warehouses. The All Other segment recorded organic revenue growth of 2.8%, although gross margin decreased to 38.5% from 39.6% in the year-ago quarter due to macroeconomic volatility.Cintas has a solid financial position with adequate liquidity. At the quarter end, cash and cash equivalents were $143.6 million, while long-term debt was $1,044.8 million.Net cash from operating activities was $301.7 million for the first six months of fiscal 2017 compared with $265.0 million in the prior-year period.

The company currently expects revenues in the range of $5.180 billion to $5.225 billion compared with earlier projection of $5.160 billion to $5.225 billion. Earnings from continuing operations are expected to be within $4.57-$4.65 per share, up from $4.55-$4.63 anticipated earlier. The guidance, however, has not taken into consideration any potential deterioration in the U.S. economy, future share repurchases or any future financial impact from the acquisition of G&K.Since the earnings release, the stock has witnessed a mixed trend in fresh estimates. There have been two revisions in either direction. | At this time, Cintas stock has a nice Growth score of 'B', though it is lagging a lot on the momentum front with a 'D'. Following the same course, the stock was also allocated a grade of 'D' on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, stocks has an aggregte VGM score of 'C'. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.The company's stock is suitable soley for growth investors based on our styles scores.While estimate revisions have been mixed, the magnitude of these revisions has been net zero. However, as the stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), we are looking for an above average return in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

n Jan 10, Zacks  updated the research report on business service provider  .Cintas recorded relatively modest second-quarter fiscal 2017 results on the back of healthy top-line growth. Net income from continuing operations for the reported quarter improved to $123.5 million or $1.13 per share from $115.5 million or $1.03 per share in the year-earlier quarter.Quarterly revenues increased 6.4% year over year to $1,296.9 million, exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,292 million. Organic growth for the reported quarter improved 5.7% year over year. The superior top-line performance was primarily attributable to the addition of new customers, strong customer retention and higher penetration of existing customers through better and innovative products and services.Cintas has outperformed the Zacks categorized  industry in the last three months with an average return of 5.6% compared with 5.0% by the latter. Revenues have steadily increased over the past few quarters. Cintas aims to continually achieve revenue buildup by increasing penetration levels at existing customers and broadening the customer base to include fresh business segments. The company also identifies additional product and service opportunities for its current and future customers to expand its portfolio. This focused approach for a steady top-line growth is commendable.In Aug 2016, Cintas inked a definitive agreement to acquire rival G&K Services, Inc.  to fuel its growth momentum. The combined company is likely to cater to over one billion business customers with an extended product portfolio and additional processing capacity.

"any successful businesses aren't in sexy industries, and  (NASDAQ: CTAS) is a good example of how companies can make money from the most pedestrian of tasks. Cintas specializes in uniform rental services, along with a host of ancillary niches such as first aid and safety products.Coming into Thursday's fiscal second-quarter financial report, Cintas investors were optimistic that the company could produce ongoing growth in its top and bottom line. Cintas delivered on those hopes, but shareholders didn't seem satisfied with its complete picture, sending the stock downward after the results came out. Let's look more closely at what Cintas reported, and what it means for the future.Image source: Cintas.Cintas' fiscal second-quarter results were more or less in line with what most investors wanted to see. Revenue climbed 6.4%, to $1.30 billion, which was slightly higher than the consensus forecast among those following the stock. Net income from continuing operations climbed 7%, to $123 million, and that produced adjusted earnings of $1.15 per share, matching what most investors were looking to see after taking into account one-time transaction expenses related to the  (NASDAQ: GK) transaction.Looking more closely at Cintas, the company's various segments all posted solid top-line growth, but saw different performance in segment profits. The key uniform rental and facility services division saw revenue rise by more than 7%, making it the best performer of Cintas' three major segments. The first aid and safety services division saw more modest 4% gains in sales, and the all other businesses unit brought up the rear, with 3.5% sales growth.In terms of bottom-line performance, the only segment that grew profits was uniform rental, with gains of 5% on a pre-tax basis. Profits inched lower by less than 1% at first aid and safety, but fell by more than a third in the all other category.Once again, Cintas saw its overhead costs rise as a percentage of total revenue, which weighed slightly on its margin figures and offset solid improvement in its gross margin. Cintas said that the increase, which amounted to nearly an extra percentage point-and-a-half in overhead, was due largely to strategic investments in its enterprise resource planning system, as well as its Ready for the Workday branding campaign. Medical expenses also rose, along with a boost in resources used to drive sales in the first aid and safety business.Nevertheless, there were some positive signs for Cintas. Organic growth stayed solid at 5.7%, including a 6.5% growth rate for the uniform rental and facility services segment.CEO Scott Farmer was particularly pleased with the way that Cintas boosted its internal efficiency in terms of cost of goods sold. ""This is our 13th consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin improvement,"" Farmer said, and the CEO also pointed to ""the significant opportunities that exist for us"" as it looks to extend its streak of double-digit earnings growth for a seventh straight year.Cintas continues to see plenty of reason to be optimistic about its future prospects. The acquisition of G&K represents a good growth opportunity for Cintas, and the deal appears to be still on track to close early in 2017.Cintas also raised its guidance slightly for fiscal 2017. The company now expects sales of $5.18 billion to $5.225 billion, which raises the bottom end of its previous range upward by another $20 million. Similarly, Cintas now expects earnings per share to come in between $4.57 to $4.65 per share, which is $0.02 higher than its previous guidance from last quarter. That works out to growth of roughly 12% to 14% in earnings per share from continuing operations.Nevertheless, Cintas investors didn't seem happy with the news, sending the stock downward by 3% in after-hours trading following the announcement. Given how well the company has done lately, it's possible that shareholders are simply discounting the potential for further gains until there's greater certainty about the economic environment for 2017 and beyond. Nevertheless, Cintas seems confident for now that its fundamental business remains strong.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"hen it comes to dividends, longevity is typically an investor's best friend. And few businesses have done a more admirable job to that end than the group affectionately dubbed ""dividend aristocrats"" -- that is, the companies in the S&P 500 that have increased their respective dividends for at least 25 consecutive years.But that doesn't mean investors should blindly purchase shares of these companies. To the contrary, we asked three Motley Fool contributors for names of dividend aristocrats they absolutely refuse to buy. Read on to see why they named  (NASDAQ: CTAS) ,  (NYSE: WMT) , and  (NYSE: ADM) :IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. One reason investors choose Dividend Aristocrats for their portfolios is because they believe they are the best  for generating both current income and future potential growth. However, many investors don't realize that there's no minimum dividend yield to be a Dividend Aristocrat, and Cintas is one example of a member of the prestigious list that just doesn't pass my test for sufficient income.Cintas pays dividends annually rather than quarterly, and despite a long track record of 34 straight years of increases in that payout, the uniform rental and business services specialist has never been what I would call generous with its dividends. It took a serious decline during the financial crisis to send the stock's yield above the 2% mark, and throughout much of its history, dividend yields like the current 1.1% have been typical.There's no question that Cintas has grown dramatically. That has made it a strong-performing stock, and if those favorable conditions continue, Cintas will likely keep doing well. For growth investors, therefore, the company is worth a closer look. However, for income investors, the stinginess Cintas has shown in its dividend policy makes it a Dividend Aristocrat that, in my view, doesn't pay enough income to those who need it. Wal-Marthas increased its payout every year since it first declared a $0.05-per-share annual dividend in 1974 -- something that shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone who has watched the retail juggernaut disrupt and dominate its industry for decades.It's also no mystery that Wal-Mart's brick-and-mortar business is being threatened by the rise of e-commerce. As a result, the company is making strategic investments in bolstering online sales, including shelling out $3.3 billion to acquire Jet.com earlier this year. And those investments appeared to show promise in Wal-Mart's most recent quarter; e-commerce sales and gross merchandise volume climbed 20.6% and 16.8%, respectively, marking an improvement from the 7% year-over-year growth it demonstrated in the first quarter of this year.But one quarter doesn't make a sustained trend. And Wal-Mart has much more work to do as it plays catch-up with online competitors like  (NASDAQ: AMZN) , whose product sales were already roughly six times that of Wal-Mart's e-commerce platform last fiscal year. And Amazon in particular shows no signs of slowing its pace; net product sales last quarter grew an impressive 21% year over year, to $22.3 billion, even from its significantly larger base.That's not to say Wal-Mart can't make more progress. But I would much rather put my money to work in a business that's not hindered by its massive brick-and-mortar presence as today's consumers predictably shift their shopping habits online. Buying a Dividend Aristocrat may not be good enough if you're getting modest dividend increases and a small yield, and the stock isn't too attractive from a valuation standpoint, either. Case in point: Archer Daniels Midland.As a processor and seller of agricultural commodities, ADM's earnings are tied closely to crop prices, which tend to be unpredictable and volatile. ADM's net income shrank almost 25% during the first nine months of the year. Moreover, the company operates on thin margins since it has little control over crop prices, and its core operations are capital-intensive. ADM's operating margin has remained under 5% in the past decade, and it's just about 2% for the trailing 12 months.The market, though, has reacted positively despite ADM's tepid operational performance, pushing the stock up almost 25% this year. Part of it might have to do with the optimism around ADM's ethanol business backed by a favorable mandate on fuel blending. However, the U.S. Energy Information Administration expects ethanol production to continue to exceed consumption in 2017, which could cap ADM's profits.Given the challenges in ADM's business and the stock's current valuation, I'm not too sure if it's a good idea to buy now. data by  .That looks pricey, and ADM's dividend yield of 2.6% isn't too attractive, either. Furthermore, ADM raised its dividend by a modest 7% last year after increasing it by 17% in 2014, suggesting increased pressure on profits. Of course, ADM deserves credit to have made it onto the Dividend Aristocrat list despite operating in a volatile business, but for now, you can find better dividend stocks out there in terms of both yield and growth potential.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

usiness services provider  recorded relatively modest second-quarter fiscal 2017 (ended Nov 30, 2016) results on the back of healthy top-line growth. The company's net income was $123.5 million or $1.13 per share from continuing operations compared with $115.5 million or $1.03 per share in the year-earlier quarter. Adjusted earnings for the reported quarter were $1.15 per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.Quarterly revenues increased 6.4% year over year to $1,296.9 million, exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,292 million. Organic growth for the reported quarter improved 5.7% year over year. The superior top-line performance was primarily attributable to the addition of new customers, strong customer retention and higher penetration of existing customers through better and innovative products and services.Gross margin for the reported quarter was 44.1% compared with 43.3% in the prior-year quarter. Operating income was $202.9 million, up 1.3% year over year. Operating margin was 15.6%, slightly lower than 16.4% in the year-earlier quarter.Cintas barely outperformed the Zacks categorized  industry in the last three months with an average return of 6.1% compared with 5.6% for the latter.Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenues for the quarter improved 7.2% year over year to $1,005.6 million. The segment accounted for 77.5% of the total revenue, with year-over-year organic growth of 6.5%. Gross margin increased 80 basis points to 44.7% in the reported quarter.Revenues from Other segment were up 3.5% year over year to $291.4 million. This segment includes the First Aid and Safety Services, and All Other businesses that comprise the Fire Protection Services and Direct Sale business. The First Aid and Safety Services recorded organic growth of 3.3%, while its gross margin increased 290 basis points to 46.1% due to improved sourcing and leverage from existing warehouses. The All Other segment recorded organic revenue growth of 2.8%, although gross margin decreased to 38.5% from 39.6% in the year-ago quarter due to macroeconomic volatility.Cintas has a solid financial position with adequate liquidity. At the quarter end, cash and cash equivalents were $143.6 million, while long-term debt was $1,044.8 million.Net cash from operating activities was $301.7 million for the first six months of fiscal 2017 compared with $265.0 million in the prior-year period. Capital expenditures in the quarter were $76 million. Free cash flow for the first half of fiscal 2017 increased to $146.5 million from $143.2 million in the year-ago period. | Cintas updated its guidance for fiscal 2017. The company currently expects revenues in the range of $5.180 billion to $5.225 billion compared with earlier projection of $5.160 billion to $5.225 billion. Earnings from continuing operations are expected to be within $4.57-$4.65 per share, up from $4.55-$4.63 anticipated earlier. The guidance, however, has not taken into consideration any potential deterioration in the U.S. economy, future share repurchases or any future financial impact from the acquisition of G&K.Cintas continues to deliver organic growth through superior execution of its operational plans.

The rebalancing is carried out every year in December.

In place of these exiting stocks Cintas Corporation  , Hasbro, Inc.  , Hologic, Inc.  , and KLA-Tencor Corporation  will be added to the pool.Coming back to Whole Foods, the stock has been under pressure due to stiff competition, food price deflation, an aggressive promotional environment and waning store traffic.

Further, the stock has also underperformed the NASDAQ-100 index that recorded a growth of 6.6% over the same period.The company has been grappling with waning comparable-store sales (comps) performance since the past five quarters.

"here's been a lot of news surrounding uniform renter  (NASDAQ: CTAS) in the past couple of months. From the company's announced acquisition of a major competitor to a big dividend increase, the company's situation is certainly changed -- in a good way.Here are three reasons Cintas might deserve a spot in your portfolio.Cintas rents uniforms to businesses of all types. Image source: Getty Images.Cintas is the undisputed market leader in North American uniform and floormat rental, with nearly a million customers. And while the company also has a burgeoning fire and safety business, the rental business comprises 77% of the company's revenue.The total North American market for uniform rentals is worth approximately $16 billion, and Cintas controls about 25% of it. To put Cintas' size in perspective, its three largest competitors in this space --  (NYSE: ARMK) ,  (NYSE: UNF) , and  (NASDAQ: GK) -- combine to control only about another 25%. The rest of the market is fragmented among many other smaller local or regional players.But Cintas is about to get even larger with the full acquisition of G&K, which was  . G&K controlled about 6% of the overall North American uniform rental market; this move is expected to add 170,000 new customers to Cintas. That should result in the company's controlling nearly one-third of the entire North American market.This is great for Cintas, because it solidifies its standing in the undisputed top spot. Size and scale really matter in this kind of route-based service business, since the fixed cost of deliveries can be spread out, while there isn't much room for differentiation in the product. So even though Cintas paid a premium of about 20% for G&K, it expects that investment to pay off. Specifically, the company expects to achieve cost synergies of $130 million to $140 million within four years of the transaction's close, and accretive to EPS within two.Earlier this month, Cintas' board of directors approved a $1.33-per-share annual dividend. That represents an impressive 26.7% increase over the prior year's annual dividend of $1.05 per share.Cintas Chairman and CEO Scott D. Farmer explained that the company's strong performance led directly to its strong dividend:Although this was the highest-ever percentage increase in Cintas' dividend, the company has regularly upped its annual dividend by double-digit percentages. In fact, Cintas has raised its dividend by at least 18% in four of the past five years, including 2016.In spite of all this recent positive news, the stock price has been on the decline, from a high of more than $119 per share in September to just over $105 as of the market close on Oct. 27. That means the stock is currently trading at a discount to the price prior to the G&K acquisition announcement, a deal that should almost certainly add value to the company.While I wouldn't go so far as to call the company ""undervalued"" -- its PE has been  by its 2015 sale of Shred-It, and its enterprise value-to-EBITDA multiple is merely in line with its peers Aramark and G&K -- the fact that it's trading lower today than before it announced the G&K acquisition may indicate short-sightedness on the market's part. With the company's new-and-improved annual dividend payable in December to shareholders of record as of Nov. 4, 2016, now may be an excellent time to jump in and reap the benefits.I like to invest in ""top dog"" companies that are market leaders. Cintas not only qualifies but has also become an even bigger dog through its acquisition of G&K. And while the full fruits of that acquisition may not show up on the bottom line for a few years, the company's attractive dividend and history of dividend increases give investors a compelling reason to stick around. Cintas is a buy.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

s expected, last week -- the first full week of the final earnings season of 2016 -- was full of dividend raises. Companies large, small, and in between announced improvements in their distributions, many doing so on the back of quarterly earnings releases. There were plenty to choose from; as usual, I've whittled my choices down to three notables.The most prominent name in the payment card business,  (NYSE: V) , is also a frequent dividend-raiser. It likes to hike its quarterly payout once per year, and last week it declared its 2016 raise: an 18% lift to just under $0.17 per share.The company has done well enough lately to justify such a raise. In its most recently reported quarter, it  as the sole credit card brand accepted at Costco Wholesale registers after the retailer ended its deal with  . It also replaced its rival as the brand stamped on Costco's proprietary credit cards.This has given a boost to Visa's results, in addition to the company's recent absorption of its onetime partner, Visa Europe (despite the same brand names, the two companies were separate entities until  last year). In the card giant's Q4, both revenue and adjusted net profit rose, beating analyst expectations. data by  .The company's operating cash flow was down by over $1 billion at the end of fiscal 2016 compared to the previous year, totaling $5.57 billion. But its investing activities are minimal, so there's plenty of free cash flow left over to pay a dividend. I wouldn't worry about the viability of the card giant's payout.Visa's newly raised dividend is to be paid on Dec. 6 to investors of record as of Nov. 18. At the current share price, it would yield 0.8%. That's significantly below the 2.1% average of dividend-paying stocks on the S&P 500.One of the country's many regional banking groups, Ohio-based  (NASDAQ: HBAN) , is a frequent -- albeit somewhat cautious -- dividend payer. True to form, the company has bumped its quarterly dividend by $0.01 per share to $0.08, although that modest increase still represents a 14% improvement over the previous payout.The market had generally turned bearish on Huntington Bancshares following the bank's announcement at the beginning of the year that that it would buy fellow regional FirstMerit. The price of the cash-and-stock deal was $3.4 billion, a generous 32% premium to FirstMerit's market value and more than twice the average premium paid for similarly sized regionals. data by  .But fears about the destructive effects of the acquisition on Huntington Bancshares' finances receded after the company passed, with flying colors, its annual stress test run by the Federal Reserve. The Fed also approved the bank's capital allocation plans, which included the dividend hike and a capital raise to assist with funding the FirstMerit buy.Going forward, with FirstMerit in its portfolio the bank should start profiting from its extended reach. Although its finances will be dented somewhat by the acquisition, the capital raise should help, plus the company has easily been able to afford its dividend for some time now. So I think this new payout is safe.Huntington Bancshares will distribute said payout on Jan. 2 of next year to shareholders of record as of this Dec. 20. The dividend yields a theoretical 3% on the company's share price.For the 33rd year in a row, business services stalwart  (NASDAQ: CTAS) is upping its annual distribution. This maintains the company's status as a dividend aristocrat, i.e., a stock that has raised its payout at least once annually for a minimum of 25 years in a row.This year's model is a juicy 27% hike to $1.33 per share.That follows a fiscal year (2016) that broke records for revenue and per-share net profit. It also comes on the heels of a Q1 2017 that was also encouraging, with revenue and especially net profit showing very healthy year-over-year gains -- by 8% to $1.29 billion for the former, and by 30% to over $138 million for the latter.Both line items beat the average analyst estimates. data by  .Much of the improvement was due to the  of Cintas' core uniform rental and facility services business segment, which saw a 6.5% increase in revenue, with costs rising only 4.3%.Acquisitions ate into free cash flow in fiscal 2016, but the company remains well in the black in terms of FCF. It has managed to pay its distribution for over three decades, and we should fully expect it to maintain its dividend aristocrat status going forward.Cintas' once-per-year payout will next be dispensed on Dec. 2 to stockholders of record as of Nov. 4. At the most recent closing stock price, it would yield 1.3%.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

he NASDAQ-100 Index, a pool of 100 of the largest domestic and international non-financial companies listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market based on market capitalization, as part of its annual re-ranking process has decided to remove  . This decision will take effect from Dec 19, 2016.The re-balancing and re-ranking of the index is done every year in December, to compare the index members with other leading non-index members. To this effect, NASDAQ reshuffles the stocks in the index to include new members that meet the eligibility criteria and remove the ones that are no longer eligible.Other companies that are slated to exit the index, as part of this year's re-balancing, are NetApp Inc.  , Stericycle Inc.  and Whole Foods Market Inc.  . To replace these, stocks like Cintas Corporation  , Hasbro Inc.  , Hologic Inc.  and KLA-Tencor Corporation  will be added to the pool.Coming back to Bed, Bath & Beyond, the company's stock underperformed the NASDAQ-100 index in the past one year. While the NASDAQ-100 index recorded growth of 7.9% in the timeframe, shares of Bed, Bath & Beyond declined 7.9%.Not only this, we noticed that the stock has lagged the Zacks categorized Retail - Miscellaneous/Diversified industry, which has grown 11.2% over the past one year.The underperformance in Bed, Bath & Beyond's stock price can be attributed to its dismal top-line performance for almost 12 quarters, only with the exception of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. Also, the company has an average negative earnings surprise of 1.5% for the trailing four quarters. The company's results continue to bear the impact of sluggish mall traffic and high promotional costs. Further, due to its exposure to global markets, the company remains prone to various risks associated with international operations like currency headwinds.Further, the company's forecast of soft comparable sales (comps) and weak margin trends will continue to hurt results throughout fiscal 2016. While comps are expected to bear the impact of lower transactions, margins will continue to be hurt by soft merchandise margins and a rise in coupon cost. This is likely to weigh on the company's bottom lines.However, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company remains focused on strategic initiatives like store expansion, eCommerce enhancement and improvement of customer services, which remain as growth catalysts. Moreover, the company's constant shareholder-friendly moves are noteworthy.You can see  .How would you like to see our best recommendations to help you find today's most promising long-term stocks?

 has been on a bit of a cold streak lately, but there might be light at the end of the tunnel for this overlooked stock. And for technical investors there is some hope when looking at CTAS given that, according to its RSI reading of 25.43, it is now in oversold territory.RSI stands for 'Relative Strength Index' and it is a popular indicator used by technically focused investors. It compares the average of gains in days that closed up to the average of losses in days that closed down; readings above 70 suggest an asset is overbought, while an RSI below 30 suggests undervalued conditions are present.Yet, CTAS's low RSI value isn't the only reason to have some optimism over a coming turnaround, as there has been plenty of positive earnings estimate revision activity as of late. This is especially true when investors take a deep dive into some of these estimate revision stats and recent changes to Cintas's earnings consensus.Over the past two months, investors have seen 9 earnings estimate revisions move higher, compared with none lower, at least when looking at the key current year time frame. And the consensus estimate for CTAS has also been on an upward trend over the past 60 days, as estimates have risen from $4.43/share two months ago to just $4.60/share right now.If this wasn't enough, Cintas also has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)which puts it into rare company among its peers. So, given all of these factors, investors may want to consider getting in on this stock now (or holding on), as there are some favorable trends that could bubble up for this stock before long.

eading business service provider  is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2017 results after the closing bell on Dec 22. In the last reported quarter, adjusted earnings comfortably exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents. Cintas has beaten estimates in each of the last four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 5.54%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Cintas aims to continually achieve revenue build up by increasing penetration levels at existing customers and broadening customer base to include fresh business segments. The company also identifies additional product and service opportunities for its current and future customers to expand its portfolio. This focused approach for steady top-line growth is commendable.In order to fuel its growth momentum, Cintas has inked a definitive agreement to acquire rival G&K Services Inc. The combined company is likely to cater to over one billion business customers with an extended product portfolio and additional processing capacity. Customer service is also likely to improve with increased route density. The synergies from the combined operations are likely to yield $130 million to $140 million in cost savings and the transaction is anticipated to be accretive to Cintas' earnings from the second year of its operation. Although the transaction is not likely to have any direct impact on the impending quarterly results, it is likely to attract favorable contracts from existing as well as new customers and improve the top line. | However, a persistent challenging macroeconomic environment has mostly driven customers to perform certain in-house services themselves, instead of outsourcing them to Cintas. This has resulted in loss of businesses.In addition, the company procures raw materials from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers, making it susceptible to market risks. The volatility in raw material costs such as cotton may weigh on the margins in the upcoming quarterly results. Also, U.S. and foreign trade policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, trade sanctions, and limitations on the imports of certain types of goods, particularly after Brexit, may adversely affect its profitability.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Cintas is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it lacks the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is currently pegged at 0.00%.

s part of its annual routine, benchmark index Nasdaq, Inc.  recently re-ranked the NASDAQ-100 index in accordance with the quadruple witch expiration of the quarter. The reshuffled index will include four new companies replacing an identical number of companies from the previous list and will be effective from Dec 19, 2016.The NASDAQ-100 index comprises the 100 largest non-financial companies that are listed on the Nasdaq. Since its inception in 1985, the NASDAQ-100 index has offered an average return of 3,731% and act as benchmark for various financial instruments such as options, futures and funds. The index is re-ranked every December to coincide with quadruple witching, which refers to the third Friday of every calendar quarter, when market index futures, market index options, stock options and stock futures expire, usually resulting in increased volatility.Business services provider  is a notable inclusion in the refurbished list. The stock has outperformed the Zacks categorized Linen Supply & Related industry in the past month with an average return of 10.7% compared with 8.4% for the latter. In addition, it has a Value Growth Momentum score (  ) of 'B'. Our research shows that stocks with a VGM score of 'A' or 'B', when combined a favorable Zacks Rank offer the best investment opportunities for investors. Furthermore, Cintas has long-term earnings growth expectation of 12.4% compared with 2.8% for the industry.Cintas started fiscal 2017 on a positive note, recording solid first-quarter results on the back of healthy top-line growth. Both earnings and revenues improved year over year and beat the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate.While quarterly revenues increased 7.9% to $1,294.1 million, organic growth improved 5.7% year over year. The superior top-line performance was primarily attributable to the addition of new customers, strong customer retention and higher penetration of existing customers through better and innovative products and services.Cintas aims to continually achieve revenue build up by increasing penetration levels at existing customers and broadening the customer base to include fresh business segments.

The current earnings per share guidance represent a year-over-year improvement of 11.2-13.2%. The bullish guidance looks quite enterprising for the investors. In addition, healthy organic growth over the past few quarters has lent stability to the revenues and has enabled the company to comfortably beat the earnings estimates for a positive earnings surprise of 5.5% over the trailing four quarters.We remain encouraged by the inherent growth potential of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.

Moreover, the company's strategic approach toward project execution and lately, new inorganic investments, are anticipated to bear fruit in the to-be-reported quarter. For instance, acquisition of Tideland Signal Corporation in Feb 2016 is expected to supplement Xylems' sales in the coastal and ocean markets. Furthermore, the company believes that the initiatives undertaken to curb operational costs would help in expanding its margins going ahead.However, our observations indicate that the company might fail to surprise in third-quarter earnings due to certain headwinds.

One interesting put contract in particular, is the May 2017 put at the $95 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $2.30. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 2.4% return against the $95 commitment, or a 4.3% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to CTAS's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $95 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Cintas Corporation sees its shares fall 10.1% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $92.70 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $2.30 from $95), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 4.3% annualized rate of return.Worth considering, is that the annualized 4.3% figure actually exceeds the 1.3% annualized dividend paid by Cintas Corporation by 3%, based on the current share price of $105.77. And yet, if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downside because the stock would have to fall 10.06% to reach the $95 strike price.Always important when discussing dividends is the fact that, in general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Cintas Corporation, looking at the dividend history chart for CTAS below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 1.3% annualized dividend yield.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Cintas Corporation, and highlighting in green where the $95 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the May 2017 put at the $95 strike for the 4.3% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Cintas Corporation (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $105.77) to be 20%.

Shutterstock photoLegendary investor Warren Buffett advises to be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful. One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.In trading on Thursday, shares of Cintas Corporation (Symbol: CTAS) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 29.9, after changing hands as low as $105.42 per share. By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) is 48.1. A bullish investor could look at CTAS's 29.9 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. The chart below shows the one year performance of CTAS shares:    Looking at the chart above, CTAS's low point in its 52 week range is $80.00 per share, with $119.94 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $105.67.CTAS makes up 2.77% of the iShares Edge MSCI Multifactor Industrials ETF (Symbol: INDF)The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Cintas Corporation is Now Oversold@2016-10-27@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/cintas-corporation-now-oversold-2016-10-27
n Oct 12, Zacks  updated the research report on business services provider  .Headquartered in San Francisco, CA, ABM provides engineering, janitorial, parking, and facility solutions to commercial, industrial, institutional, and retail facilities. ABM has developed a platform to deliver an end-to-end service model to its clients by realigning its operational structure to an on-site, mobile and on-demand market based structure. This realignment has improved its long-term growth prospects and provides higher margin opportunities by enabling it to better deliver end-to-end services to its clients across urban, suburban and rural areas. The company further expects to extend its global footprint and strengthen its position in existing markets through both inorganic and organic growth across the industry verticals.The company has embarked on a Vision 2020 Plan that outlines its vision for the next five years and hinges on three primary phases, the first of which is aimed to increase the efficiency of the company through diligent execution of the operating plan and stringent cost-reduction activities. The second phase will focus on driving growth across the realigned verticals through effective realization of the cost savings from procurement, account management and other organizational changes. The final phase of the transformation will include accelerated growth impetus from the vertical alignment and account planning systems with a continuous focus on additional cost savings.ABM is currently focusing on the second phase of the plan and remains confident of achieving $40-$50 million in savings through operational efficiencies by the end of 2017. These systematic and strategic plan of actions are likely to help ABM to fuel its growth momentum.With strong third-quarter fiscal 2016 results and steady progress in its Vision 2020 plan, ABM has also updated its fiscal 2016 guidance. For fiscal 2016, ABM expects adjusted income from continuing operations in the range of $1.70-$1.75, up from $1.55-$1.65 expected earlier.

Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@FTC, AMAT, EW, CTAS: Large Inflows Detected at ETF@2016-10-07@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ftc-amat-ew-ctas-large-inflows-detected-etf-2016-10-07

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the SPDR S&P 500 Buyback ETF (Symbol: SPYB), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $53.36 per unit.With SPYB trading at a recent price near $48.63 per unit, that means that analysts see 9.72% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of SPYB's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Fiserv Inc (Symbol: FISV), Mead Johnson Nutrition Co (Symbol: MJN), and Cintas Corporation (Symbol: CTAS). Although FISV has traded at a recent price of $99.16/share, the average analyst target is 10.93% higher at $110.00/share. Similarly, MJN has 10.71% upside from the recent share price of $79.85 if the average analyst target price of $88.40/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting CTAS to reach a target price of $117.70/share, which is 10.57% above the recent price of $106.45. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of FISV, MJN, and CTAS:Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
  
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past.

"mage source: Cintas.Providing uniforms for clients' employees is a major business need that  (NASDAQ: CTAS) serves, and many people still think of Cintas as being a uniform specialist. Yet the company has diversified its product offerings recently, and that has helped open up new opportunities for growth.Coming into Tuesday's fiscal first-quarter financial report, Cintas investors had hoped that the business services company would be able to sustain and accelerate its growth. Cintas' results were encouraging, and investors responded with another big push upward for its shares. Let's take a closer look at the latest from Cintas, and what its most recent quarter says about its prospects going forward.Cintas' fiscal first-quarter results fed on the positive trends that the company has experienced lately. Revenue was up 8%, to $1.29 billion, and that was slightly higher than most of those following the stock had expected to see. Net income from operations soared 30%, to $138.1 million, and that led to adjusted earnings of $1.26 per share. That was fully $0.18 higher than the consensus forecast among investors.Taking a closer look at Cintas and its results, there were, again, several factors contributing to the company's success. The uniform rental and facility services business boosted its top line by 6.5%, and the segment's direct costs rose just 4.3%, helping to expand its overall gross margin. Once again, Cintas' other business division grew at a faster pace of 13%, but a higher 8% growth rate in costs for that division limited its competitive advantage over its uniform counterpart. Selling and administrative costs climbed at a slightly disturbing rate of more than 10%, but efficiency gains helped Cintas improve its operating margin and net margin figures.Cintas also sustained its past practice of using both internal business growth and strategic acquisitions as ways to accomplish its long-term goals. Organic growth for the company was 5.7%, or roughly three-quarters of Cintas' total growth rate.In keeping with past practice, CEO Scott Farmer limited his comments about Cintas to a fairly pedestrian recounting of financial numbers. ""We achieved record revenue and [earnings per share],"" Farmer said, ""and increased EPS by double-digits for the sixth consecutive year.""Moreover, Cintas sees its momentum building into the new fiscal year. Farmer pointed to early activity in the fiscal first quarter as confirming its strong performance going forward, and the CEO argued that the ""solid start positions us for another year of record-breaking results.""In response to its encouraging results, Cintas boosted its guidance for the 2017 fiscal year. In particular, revenue projections inched higher as Cintas pushed the lower end of its previous guidance range up by $10 million, now expecting sales of between $5.16 billion and $5.225 billion for the fiscal year. Earnings-per-share projections increased by roughly $0.20 to a new range of $4.55 to $4.63 per share, which would mean that the company could see growth of as much as 13%.Looking forward, one wildcard will be what impact Cintas' proposed acquisition of  (NASDAQ: GK) will have. Cintas announced the $2.2 billion deal in mid-August, saying that it expected the deal to open up additional processing capacity and route density, which should produce cost savings and greater operational efficiency. Expected to close by next February, the G&K Services merger should boost Cintas' earnings by the second year after the deal is completed. Going forward, the extent to which G&K integrates into Cintas' operations will play a pivotal role in determining the future course of the combined post-merger entity -- assuming that the two companies get all the necessary approvals to merge.Cintas investors were happy about the company's results, sending the stock upward by more than 4%, and approaching another all-time record high. With strong tailwinds from favorable employment trends and economic strength, Cintas will have investors watching to see just how much it can take advantage of good conditions to produce faster profit growth.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

 , a leading provider of data protection and information management services, is set to release its third-quarter 2016 results on Nov 1. Last quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 11.32%. It has posted an average negative earnings surprise of 2.24% over the past four quarters.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Iron Mountain's diversified revenue base remains a positive. In addition, a strong product portfolio, increasing market share, an aggressive acquisition strategy and a promising international business are the other growth catalysts.In Aug 2016, the company announced the buyout of information management operations of Santa Fe Group A/S in 10 regions in both Europe and Asia. The deal values the operations at nearly $30.2 million. This apart, in the last quarter, the company had declared that the synergies from the Recall acquisition are being achieved faster than expected. Management said that it expects to achieve over 80% of the synergies expected from Recall by 2017, this year itself. It also reiterated its long-term goals. Moreover, the company's entry into the data center market could be another growth driver.This apart, a highly-leveraged balance sheet, volatile currency environment and competition from the likes of Cintas Corporation  and others remain overhangs.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Iron Mountain is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below : Iron Mountain's Earnings ESP is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 58 cents. : Iron Mountain's Zacks Rank #2 when combined with a 0.00% ESP, makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. | Here are a couple of stocks that you may consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:NN Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +4.35% and a Zacks Rank #1.

usiness services provider  started fiscal 2017 on a positive note, recording solid first-quarter results on the back of healthy top-line growth. The company reported first-quarter fiscal 2017 (ended Aug 31, 2016) net income of $138.1 million or $1.26 per share from continuing operations compared with $106.2 million or 93 cents per share in the year-earlier quarter. Adjusted earnings for the reported quarter were $1.12 per share, which comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents.Quarterly revenues increased 7.9% year over year to $1,294.1 million, exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,289 million. Organic growth for the reported quarter improved 5.7% year over year. The superior top-line performance was primarily attributable to the addition of new customers, strong customer retention and higher penetration of existing customers through better and innovative products and services.Gross margin for the reported quarter was 45.1% compared with 43.7% in the prior-year quarter. Operating income in the quarter was $207.0 million, up 11.6% year over year. Operating margin was 16.0%, slightly higher than 15.5% in the year-earlier quarter. | Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenues for the quarter improved 6.5% year over year to $999.6 million. The segment accounted for 77.2% of the total revenue, with year-over-year organic growth of 5.9%. Gross margin increased 120 basis points to 45.9% in the reported quarter.Revenues for First Aid and Safety Services were up 25% year over year to $125 million, largely due to the Zee Medical acquisition. This segment recorded organic growth of 5.4% and accounted for 9.7% of the total revenues. Segment gross margin increased to 45.8% in the reported quarter from 42.3% in the year-ago quarter due to improved sourcing and leverage from existing warehouses. The All Other segment recorded revenues of $294.5 million, representing 22.8% of total revenues of the company.During the reported quarter, Cintas inked a definitive agreement to acquire rival G&K Services Inc.  to fuel its growth momentum. The transaction is expected to be completed within the next four to six months, subject to the fulfillment of mandatory closing conditions and regulatory approvals.According to the terms of the agreement, Cintas would acquire all the outstanding shares of G&K for $97.50 per share, which represents a premium of about 19% to its closing price on Aug 15. The transaction equates to total enterprise value of approximately $2.2 billion, including acquired net debt.Headquartered in Minneapolis, MN, G&K operates as a branded uniform and facility services program provider in the U.S. and Canada. With over 8,000 employees, serving customers from 165 facilities in North America, it reported annual revenues of $950 million in 2015.Post acquisition, G&K would operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cintas and is likely to retain its existing brand name. The combined company is likely to cater to over one billion business customers with an extended product portfolio and additional processing capacity. Customer service is also likely to improve with increased route density.The synergies from the combined operations are likely to yield $130 million to $140 million in cost savings and the transaction is anticipated to be accretive to Cintas' earnings from the second year of its operation.Cintas has a solid financial position with adequate liquidity. At the quarter end, cash and cash equivalents were $99.2 million, while long-term debt was $1,044.6 million.Net cash from operating activities was $157.6 million for the reported quarter compared with $143.1 million in the prior-year period. Capital expenditures in the quarter were $78.6 million compared with $62.6 million in the year-earlier quarter. Free cash flow for the quarter decreased marginally to $79.0 million from $80.4 million in the year-ago period.Buoyed by the healthy first-quarter fiscal 2017 results, Cintas increased its guidance for fiscal 2017. The company currently expects fiscal 2017 revenues in the range of $5.160 billion to $5.225 billion, up 5.2-6.5% year over year. Earnings from continuing operations are expected to be within $4.55-$4.63 per share, up from $4.35-$4.45 per share anticipated earlier. The current earnings per share guidance represents a year-over-year improvement of 11.2-13.2%. The guidance, however, has not taken into consideration any potential deterioration in the U.S. economy, future share repurchases or any future financial impact from the acquisition of G&K.Cintas continues to deliver organic growth through superior execution of its operational plans. We remain encouraged by the company's strong quarterly and fiscal performance and its bullish guidance.Cintas currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the industry include CBIZ, Inc.  and The Hackett Group, Inc.  , both carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see  .CBIZ has a solid earnings history, beating earnings estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters. The stock is currently trading at a forward P/E of 15.1x.With long-term earnings growth expectations of 17.5%, Hackett Group is another star performer in the Consulting industry.Beyond this Analyst Blog, would you like to see Zacks' best recommendations that are not available to the public?

eading business service provider  is scheduled to report its first-quarter fiscal 2017 results after the closing bell on Sep 27. In the last reported quarter, earnings comfortably exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6 cents. Cintas has beaten estimates in each of the last four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 5.69%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Cintas procures raw materials from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers, making it susceptible to market risks. The volatility in raw material costs such as cotton may weigh on the margins in the upcoming quarterly results. Also, U.S. and foreign trade policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, trade sanctions, and limitations on the imports of certain types of goods, particularly after Brexit, may adversely affect its profitability.In addition, Cintas faces stiff competition from national, regional and local companies on various factors such as design, price, quality, service and convenience to the customers. Specifically, its first aid and fire protection services are decidedly commoditized markets and hence are subject to fierce competition. As such, the company has to continually invest in value drivers to fend off competition, which further weakens its profitability. Moreover, a persistently challenging macroeconomic environment has mostly driven customers to perform certain in-house services instead of outsourcing these services to Cintas, which have resulted in loss of business. | The company's significant international operations expose it to the risks of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, which in turn may materially impact its financial results. The company's international operations are also exposed to risks of local legislation and unstable political conditions, which may present new challenges. These factors undermine the growth potential of Cintas to some extent.During the to-be-reported quarter, Cintas inked a definitive agreement to acquire rival G&K Services Inc.  to fuel its growth momentum. The transaction is expected to be completed within the next four to six months, subject to the fulfillment of mandatory closing conditions and regulatory approvals.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Cintas is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it lacks the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, currently stands at 0.00%. Cintas carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). The Sell-rated stocks (#4 or #5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:IHS Markit Ltd.  has an Earnings ESP of +22.22% and Zacks Rank #1. You can see Intel Corporation  has an Earnings ESP of +2.82% and Zacks Rank #2.BlackRock, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +0.20% and Zacks Rank #2.Beyond this Analyst Blog, would you like to see Zacks' best recommendations that are not available to the public?

Its agencies operate in all the major markets across the globe and provide an extensive range of services, which are grouped into four fundamental disciplines: Traditional Media Advertising, Customer Relationship Management, Public Relations and Specialty Communications.In order to spur growth, Omnicom has started to use open-source technique to access the current information in the market. The increasing demand for media services, speedy growth of technologies and massive proliferation of channels are likely to translate into incremental revenues in the future.Omnicom is also witnessing a healthy performance in developed markets like the U.S. and developing markets like Asia. The measures undertaken by the company to reduce costs have helped it to boost earnings. The company is expanding its global footprint and is moving into new service areas. It is also building upon its digital and analytical capabilities by investing in agencies and partnering with innovative technology companies in key markets. Omnicom's operations are diversified across technology platforms, thus lowering its dependence on any one product in these dynamic technological markets. All these initiatives augur well for the long-term growth and stability of the company.Omnicom is currently concentrating on strengthening its business and expanding its client base globally through the acquisition of complementary companies. During the second quarter of 2016, the company acquired Rabin Martin, a global health strategy consulting firm. Rabin Martin's high-profile client base will augment Omnicom Public Relation's already strong healthcare offerings. Omnicom also acquired BioPharm Communications, a leading communications agency that serves 17 of the 25 major pharmaceutical companies across the globe. The acquisition will enable Omnicom to expand its leadership position in a highly competitive data-driven healthcare market.We expect the company to witness higher revenues in the imminent future on the back of such acquisitions and remain impressed with the focused growth initiatives of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock. Some other favorably ranked stocks in the industry include The Hackett Group, Inc.  , Accenture plc  and Cintas Corporation  , each carrying the same Zacks Rank as Omnicom. You can see  .Hackett has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 17.5% and is currently trading at a forward P/E of 21.8x.Accenture posted an average positive earnings surprise of 3.2% in the trailing four quarters, beating estimates thrice.

"Looking for consistent, double-digit dividend hikes?Bad news: your job is getting harder.According to  es, US companies collectively increased their dividends by $6.0 billion in the third quarter (net of cancellations).Sounds great, right? Too bad that number has plunged from the $7.3 billion in hikes announced in the second quarter-not to mention the $10.0 billion of increases rolled out in the third quarter of 2015.The bottom line? Dividend growth is slowing-and faster than most investors think.Worse, your odds of getting whacked by a  are on the rise: the number of companies slashing their payouts hit 667 in the 12 months ended September 30, up 55.5% from the previous 12-month period.There was a time when you could find safe, outsized dividend growth by simply picking from the list of Dividend Aristocrats (or the S&P 500 companies that have raised their payouts for 25 years or more).But these days, many of these so-called aristocrats are pretenders, dribbling out wimpy 1 cent-a-year dividend hikes, just enough to keep their membership in the club.I'm looking at you,  (  )  (  ) and  (  ).But don't worry, because today I've got four stocks that still throw off hefty dividend hikes regularly. And unlike many Dividend Aristocrats and utility stocks, they're cheap right now.Better yet, I expect all four to announce double-digit payout hikes right away  so you can look forward to a nice near-term pop in the share price, too. (  )  Plenty of income-seekers dismiss industrial stocks because of their low dividend yields and potential for higher volatility.That's too bad, because there are still bargains to be had in the industrial space. And you can offset any volatility and quickly boost the yield on your initial buy if you focus on industrials that regularly deliver big, steady payout increases.Take Cintas, which trades at a reasonable 17.0 times trailing-twelve-month earnings. The stock's forward dividend yield is just 0.9% today, but the stars are aligned for Cintas to drop a big dividend hike on shareholders later this month.How do I know?Because that's exactly what's happened in the past: the company has hiked its payout for  and those increases are no small beer: in the past decade, Cintas's dividend has risen 17% annually, on average (the company pays dividends once a year). It also handed investors a nice $0.85 special dividend in December 2014.The result? A nice, smooth climb in the share price:The company's business is simple: it supplies uniforms and cleaning services to commercial clients. But its scale (it has over one million customers, 400 facilities and 10,000 delivery trucks) makes it tough for competitors to elbow their way in.Right now, Cintas is firing on all cylinders: in its recently released quarterly results, earnings per share () soared 35% from a year ago, to $1.26, easily topping the consensus forecast of $1.08. Revenue jumped 7.9%, to $1.29 billion, also beating the Street's estimate of $1.28 billion.With numbers like those, I'm looking for a 20% payout hike from this one in the next week or two. That makes now the time to buy.If you didn't know  (  ),  the company that owns the track where the Kentucky Derby is run every year, is publicly traded, you're not alone. It boasts a market capitalization of just $2.4 billion, so it doesn't get a lot of analyst attention (just five cover it as I write this).And even if you  know of the stock, you may not know that it goes well beyond the historic racetrack, with four other tracks, six casinos and an online gambling arm also under its umbrella.Like Cintas, Churchill has a low current yield of 0.8% and pays dividends annually. But its dividend-growth record makes the payout worth the wait: in the last six years, Churchill has juiced the dividend by 130%, helping drive a 278% rise in the share price:The Kentucky Derby is growing, with attendance up 3% from last year's record, and the company's online division is benefiting from the explosive growth of mobile gaming.The analysts that cover CHDN are calling for a 55% profit increase for all of 2016, putting a dividend hike of at least 15% on the table. Churchill usually announces dividend increases with its third-quarter results, which are due out October 27, so you'll want to make a move before then. (  )  isn't as cheap now as it was at the beginning of the year, before the stock went on a big run that raised its P/E ratio to 23.8 while cutting its forward yield to 2.2%.But it's still a great buy, because thanks to its explosive dividend growth (850% in the past decade!).Continued dividend increases - easily achievable thanks to its 49% payout ratio - put a floor under the share price and drive further upside.That floor gets even thicker when you add the rising earnings the company is reporting thanks to its shift away from volatile areas like smartphones and PCs and toward making chips for cars, industrial equipment and communications gear.The shift is nicely smoothing out TXN's revenue stream, providing a nice backstop to earnings (and dividends):I expect the next dividend hike to come any day now, and I think the stock still has plenty of room to run, so now's the time to get in. (  )  makes the world's top-selling drug, anti-inflammatory Humira, which hit $14 billion in sales last year. But that success has rattled some investors' nerves, because Humira will start losing patent protection in late 2016.That's good news for us, because this overblown fear has served up a buying opportunity: AbbVie trades at 18.2 times its last 12 months of earnings, a big discount to rivals  (  )  at 22.3,  (  ), at 34.9.Why do I say overblown? Because AbbVie has patents on everything from Humira's formulation methods to how it's delivered that will keep a generic rival on the sidelines for  -till 2022.Meantime, the company boasts a strong pipeline, which it's bolstering through R&D and acquisitions. Its latest buys include lung-cancer treatment Rova T, which AbbVie feels could post annual sales of $5 billion, and three-year-old cancer drug Imbruvica, which could deliver another $3 billion.The stock yields 3.6% today, and AbbVie has raised its payout 42% since being spun off from  (  ) in 2013.AbbVie posted strong Q2 results in July and upped its guidance for the full year to $4.73 to $4.83 in adjusted EPS from $4.62 to $4.82. The midpoint of the new range is 11.4% higher than 2015.Look for AbbVie to announce a dividend hike of at least that size when it next reports earnings on October 28.All 4 of these stocks are great picks now, but even with their regular payout hikes, they just can't deliver enough income to achieve what every investor should be shooting for: a  -with no need to sell shares.This is important for two reasons: it lets you leave a lasting legacy for your kids and grandkids, and a portfolio built this way is far more durable during market downturns. That's because you won't have to sell shares at fire-sale prices just to pay the bills.Instead, you can kick back and let the dividend checks roll in until the market turns up again.Most investors know this is the right way to look at retirement. The problem is that even a million dollars in Dividend Aristocrats yielding 2% and 3% doesn't generate enough income to make it happen.That's where the 6 investments I've found come in. They're from 3 ignored asset classes known to throw off safe yields of 6%, 7%, 8% and more.In fact, these 6 investments are so safe I've made them the cornerstones of my ""No-Withdrawal"" retirement portfolio. .The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@4 Stocks to Buy for Big October Dividend Hikes (CTAS, CHDN, TXN, ABBV)@2016-10-10@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/4-stocks-to-buy-for-big-october-dividend-hikes-ctas-chdn-txn-abbv-2016-10-10
 data by  . The merger transaction values G&K Services at $2.2 billion, including the assumption of debt. However, while Cintas is paying a pretty hefty premium to acquire the company, it believes the deal will be accretive to earnings per share in the second full year after the transaction closes. Further, Cintas anticipates realizing $130 million to $140 million of annual synergies by the fourth full year after closing. In addition to that, Cintas believes that the merger with G&K Services will provide it with additional processing capacity, which will enable it to improve customer service.Both companies are coming off of strong years, with each reporting their fiscal year-end results recently. In late July, Cintas  that its fiscal 2016 revenue was up 9.6% to $4.9 billion, which was above the high end of its guidance range. Earnings, likewise, were above the high end of its guidance range, coming in at $4.09 per share, which was well above last year's total of $3.46 per share. Further, Cintas offered an optimistic outlook for fiscal 2017, with its revenue expected to grow by 5% to 6.5%, while earnings were projected to increase by 6.4% to 8.8%.Meanwhile, G&K Services reported record fiscal 2016 earnings this morning. Overall, earnings rose 22.4% to $3.61 per share to go along with a 42% increase in cash flow from operations, which set a record at $134 million. Meanwhile, revenue was up 4.3% to $978 million. While the company is clearly doing well on its own, it couldn't refuse Cintas' offer price, which was 20% above its all-time closing high and at a rather lofty 14 times EBITDA multiple. Cintas is paying a premium price for a premium business. Because of that, the G&K transaction won't be immediately accretive to earnings. That said, it has the potential to deliver robust cost savings over the next few years, which is what has investors excited about the deal.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

"mage source: Cintas.All good rallies must come to an end, and Tuesday saw the stock market fall back from its record close earlier in the week. Major market benchmarks fell about half a percent, as market participants seemed nervous about the potential for the Federal Reserve to move forward with interest-rate increases despite tepid economic expansion. Inflation data released Tuesday morning didn't indicate any substantial pricing pressure, but with the international macroeconomic picture continuing to be cloudy, investors appear to have positioned themselves to deal with whatever the future might bring.Nevertheless, some individual stocks had impressive performance on Monday, and among the biggest gainers were  (NASDAQ: CTAS) ,  (NASDAQ: PNK) , and  (NYSE: CST) .Cintas rose 5% after announcing that it would buy fellow uniform and facilities services company  in a deal worth $2.2 billion. The all-cash deal will give current G&K Services shareholders $97.50 per share, and the companies expect the merger to close late this year or early next year. Cintas expects to realize synergy-related savings of $130 million to $140 million annually within four years after closing, and Cintas CEO Scott Farmer indicated that the companies' ""dedication to customers, employee-partners, and shareholders"" should ""build a great foundation for a successful combination.""

The casino company said on Monday afternoon that it had authorized a $50 million buyback program, with the intent of funding the program without raising any additional debt.The new program comes just three months after Pinnacle had authorized an earlier $50 million repurchase, but within just a couple months, Pinnacle had already bought back 4.53 million shares to use up every penny of the previous authorization. Combined with the original program, Pinnacle could see its total share count drop by as much as 15%, if it fully implements the just-authorized buyback at prices similar to where the stock currently trades.Finally, CST Brands gained 6%.

The energy sector continues to outperform thanks to a fourth day increase in oil, while material stocks are buoyed by the weaker dollar.During an interview on Fox Business Network, NY Fed President William Dudley said that a September rate hike was ""possible"" as the economy is edging closer towards the point...when it would be appropriate to raise rates further.

This sentiment was echoed by Atlanta Fed president Dennis Lockhart, keeping shares under pressure, while at the same time driving Treasury yields higher and undermining interest rate-sensitive sectors like telecoms and utilities.In economic news, consumer prices were unchanged last month, but increased an anemic 0.1% excluding food and fuel prices.Housing starts were up 2.1% but permits fell 0.1%, while industrial production increased 0.7% and capacity utilization rose to 75.9% from 75.4%, both better than Wall Street expectations.Here's where the markets stood at the close:US MARKETSDow Jones Industrial Index was down 84.03 points (-0.45%)S&P 500 was down 12.00 points (-0.55%)Nasdaq Composite Index was down 34.90 points (-0.66%)GLOBAL SENTIMENTFTSE 100 was down 0.68%Nikkei 225 was down 1.62%Hang Seng Index was down 0.09%Shanghai China Composite Index was down 0.49%UPSIDE MOVERS(+) GK (+17.74%) To be acquired by Cintas (  ) for $2 billion, or $97.50 per share(+) ANTH (+7.89%) Data and Safety Monitoring Board gives go-ahead for study of sollpura for cystic fibrosis(+) DKS (+7.05%) Reported better-than-expected Q2 results and raised FY16 EPS outlookDOWNSIDE MOVERS(-) HAIN (-26.31%) Announced a delay in Q4 and FY16 results to review revenue associated with certain concessions was accounted for in the correct period.(-) EVOK (-11.92%) Q2 loss narrows from year ago, but did not report quarterly revenue(-) HTBX (-11.29%) Reported a narrower-than-expected Q2 loss but with no revenueThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Close Update: Stocks Pressured by Hawkish Fed-Speak@2016-08-16@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/close-update-stocks-pressured-hawkish-fed-speak-2016-08-16
 , a leading provider of data protection and information management services, is set to release its second-quarter 2016 results on Aug 4. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 6.25%. The company has posted an average negative earnings surprise of 1.95% over the past four quarters.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Iron Mountain's diversified revenue base is a positive. It is noteworthy that more than 95% of the Fortune 1000 companies are on Iron Mountain's client list. In addition, its strong product portfolio, increasing market share, and promising international business are the primary growth catalysts. Moreover, the company's entry into the data center market is also likely to be a growth driver.Furthermore, the company had recommenced merger and acquisition activities since the fourth-quarter 2015. In the second-quarter 2016, the company closed the acquisition of Recall Holdings.However, the costs of integrations are expected to weigh on the financials, especially as it already has a highly leveraged balance sheet. The company also had to dispose certain assets in connection to Recall Holdings acquisitions. This included both tangible and intangible assets, in 13 cities across the U.S for nearly $80 million, subject to adjustments.This apart, volatile currency environment and competition from the likes of Cintas Corporation  and others remain overhangs. | Our proven model does not conclusively show that Iron Mountain is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below : Iron Mountain's Earnings ESP is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 52 cents. : Iron Mountain's Zacks Rank #3 when combined with a 0.00% ESP, makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are a couple of stocks that you may consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:GlycoMimetics Inc.  with an Earnings ESP of +13.64% and Zacks Rank #1.U.S. Silica Holdings, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +8.70% and a Zacks Rank #2.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

nvestors eyeing a purchase of Cintas Corporation (Symbol: CTAS) stock, but cautious about paying the going market price of $107.46/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the November put at the $97.50 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $1.45. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 1.5% return against the $97.50 commitment, or a 4.8% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to CTAS's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $97.50 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Cintas Corporation sees its shares fall 9.1% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $96.05 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $1.45 from $97.50), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 4.8% annualized rate of return.Worth considering, is that the annualized 4.8% figure actually exceeds the 1% annualized dividend paid by Cintas Corporation by 3.8%, based on the current share price of $107.46. And yet, if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downside because the stock would have to lose 9.14% to reach the $97.50 strike price.Always important when discussing dividends is the fact that, in general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Cintas Corporation, looking at the dividend history chart for CTAS below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 1% annualized dividend yield.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Cintas Corporation, and highlighting in green where the $97.50 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the November put at the $97.50 strike for the 4.8% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Cintas Corporation (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $107.46) to be 21%.

In other words, if we look at the number of call buyers and then use the long-term median to project the number of put buyers we'd expect to see, we're actually seeing more put buyers than expected out there in  so far today.  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Agree To Purchase Cintas Corporation At $97.50, Earn 4.8% Annualized Using Options@2016-07-28@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/agree-purchase-cintas-corporation-9750-earn-48-annualized-using-options-2016-07-28
Image source: Getty Images.I have a confession. I love  . There is something reassuring about receiving those dividend payments: No matter what a company's stock price is doing, the payments can help keep you from making an irrational decision at the worst time.Also, it's hard to argue with the power of reinvested dividends over time. Making the most of your dividend investments means investing in top-quality stocks that have the ability to stand the test of time and pay you an ever-increasing amount of cash.So let's take a look at three companies that fit this bill rather well --  (NYSE: HEP) ,  (NYSE: NGG) , and  (NASDAQ: CTAS) -- and see why you might want to consider them for your own portfolio. data by  .Not all master limited partnerships are alike. There are a few distinct traits that separate the great MLP investments from the average ones. One of the better investments in this industry is Holly Energy Partners.What makes Holly Energy rather special compared to so many others is the way its parent organization,  (NYSE: HFC) , manages it. The company's business is a very predictable one, as it owns several pipelines and storage tanks that are used to source crude oil for HollyFrontier's oil refineries, or distribute refined petroleum products to wholesale customers. It also helps that 100% of Holly Energy Partners' services are fee-based contracts, so there is no direct exposure to oil and gas prices.The way Holly Energy Partners manages its capital also makes it compelling. Too many general partners make risky moves like trying to pay out too much of the company's cash flow, or relying too much on debt and equity markets to fund their expansion. Holly Energy Partners, in contrast, is known for being conservative with both its payout and its debt levels. This past quarter was a great example: The company's distribution coverage ratio -- the most common metric for measuring an MLP's dividend sustainability -- was 1.67. In an industry where a coverage ratio of 1.2 or greater is considered excellent, Holly Energy Partners is giving itself plenty of room to grow its payout in the future, as well as reinvest in the business. I should also note that past quarter was the 46th consecutive quarter with a distribution increase.Despite this rather solid reputation, shares are trading at a pretty attractive price. Shares of Holly Energy Partners today carry a 6.1% distribution yield. That's a decent yield for a solid, reputable dividend payer.Investors like utility stocks because they are regulated businesses that face little competition. However, even utilities can be impacted by the ups and downs of commodity prices. That is what makes National Grid such an interesting investment for dividend investors. Unlike most utilities which sell a product like electricity, gas, or water to customers, National Grid just owns the distribution infrastructure that delivers electricity and gas. The company's bread-and-butter business is owning transmission lines in the U.K. and the U.S. and charging power generators and utility companies to use the network. Think of it as a tollbooth business model that generates gobs of cash that can be given back to shareholders.One thing to note is that the company doesn't pay a consistent quarterly dividend. Rather, the company pays two biannual dividends, one of which -- the interim dividend -- is considerably lower than the annual dividend. However, over the years these two dividends have increased on an annual basis that mostly tracks the United Kingdom Retail Prices Index.The company's dividend yield has been on a bit of a decline in recent years and investors have pushed up the price of the stock, but shares of National Grid still yield 4.3% today. No one would blame you if you waited for a pullback in this stock because of that decline in yield, but today's yield is still a pretty good entry point.Everyone wants to get in on exciting businesses that are changing the way we do things or disrupting an industry. The irony is that some of the best investments are the ones which many would consider boring. Take, for example, Cintas. The company's bread-and-butter business is uniform and floor-mat rental for businesses and professionals. Call it boring all you want: It's a business that has generated incredible returns on equity for more than 25 years. That sort of performance won't bore your portfolio. data by  .Cintas has a very low dividend yield of 0.98%, which may not sound like much for a dividend stock, but keep this in mind: The company has more than doubled its dividend in the past 10 years.If you want to really get a deal on shares of Cintas, one thing to remember is that the company's business very much follows unemployment trends -- higher unemployment means fewer uniforms needed means lower profits. If you are a patient investor, you can wait for a time of higher unemployment to get a better price on the stock, but the company's high rate of returns suggests that it's a decent addition to anyone's portfolio.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. And we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in-the-know investors!

mage source: Polaris Industries.Wednesday continued the bull market run that the stock market has seen over the past two weeks, with the Dow Jones Industrials once again setting another all-time record high and the S&P 500 also following suit. Gains that came in roughly between 0.25% and 0.5% for the major market averages stemmed largely from positive news on the earnings front, which featured strong results from the technology and financial industries. Many stocks contributed to the market's overall gains, but some of the biggest contributors included  (NASDAQ: MRVL) ,  (NYSE: PII) , and  (NASDAQ: CTAS) .Marvell Technology rose 14% despite posting what many considered to be mixed results in its fiscal fourth-quarter financial report on Tuesday night. The tech company dealt with substantial contractions in sales and adjusted earnings, which fell by 28% and 56%, respectively, but the bottom-line figures of $0.11 per share were better than most investors had expected. The more important factor in Marvell's upward move was that the company has put processes in place to try to bring a federal probe into its accounting practices to an end, and the idea that the company is successfully moving toward higher-potential areas like data centers and cloud computing are driving enthusiasm about the stock. Marvell still has a long way to go, but the rebound thus far reflects the restructuring efforts that have gone well for the company.Polaris Industries gained 9% after reporting its second-quarter results. The maker of snowmobiles, motorcycles, and off-road vehicles didn't seem to have a stellar quarter, with sales climbing just half a percent and earnings falling by more than a quarter to $71.2 million, or $1.09 per share. Yet those results were still better than those following the stock had anticipated, and Polaris argued that the quarter was a success given product recall, a weaker environment for retail sales generally, and tough comparisons against an extremely strong quarter during the year-ago period. Shareholders also celebrated the coming introduction of 2017 model year products, and strength in the motorcycle segment managed to overcome weaker results in the snowmobile and off-road vehicle division to produce overall top-line gains. Looking forward, Polaris hopes to reestablish its strong reputation, and despite a downgrade in earnings guidance, shareholders are willing to put the past behind the company and look toward better times down the road.Finally, Cintas climbed 10%. The company's second-quarter earnings report featured double-digit percentage sales growth and a 17% rise in net income, and earnings of $1.08 per share beat the consensus forecast by $0.08. Extremely strong growth in the first aid, safety, fire protection, and direct sales unit outpaced Cintas' core uniform rental business, but the company did a good job of growing both by developing its internal businesses and by making smart strategic acquisitions. Cintas expects further growth in the coming fiscal year, and investors are confident that as long as the job market stays healthy, Cintas shares can remain a good investment.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

"Image source: Cintas Corporation. Shares of  (NASDAQ: CTAS) rose as much as 11.9% early Wednesday, and traded up 9.9% as of 3:30 p.m. EDT after the specialized business-services company released stronger-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter 2016 results. Quarterly revenue climbed 11.3% year over year, to $1.27 billion, including healthy organic growth of 6.7%. On the bottom line, net income from continuing operations grew 17.3%, to $118 million, and -- thanks, in part, to stock repurchases over the past year -- earnings per diluted share from continuing operations increased an even better 25.6%, to $1.08. Analysts, on average, were only anticipating quarterly earnings of $1.00 per share on revenue of $1.25 billion.That brought full fiscal-year 2016 revenue to $4.9 billion, up 9.6% over fiscal 2015, and above the high-end of Cintas' guidance for revenue in the range of $4.86 billion to $4.89 billion. Full-year earnings from continuing operations came in at $4.09 per share, up from $3.46 per share in 2015, and also above guidance that called for full-year EPS of $3.98 to $4.03.Cintas CEO Scott Farmer lauded the initiation of the company's first national-branding campaign, which includes its new tag line, ""Ready for the Workday,"" which speaks to the company's efforts to branch out from the uniform business for which it's primarily known. Farmer elaborated: Cintas also offered an early look at the year ahead. Fiscal 2017 guidance calls for revenue of $5.15 billion to $5.225 billion, representing growth of 5% to 6.5% over fiscal 2016, and earnings per share of $4.35 to $4.45, or year-over-year growth of 6.4% to 8.8%. Here again, Wall Street is modeling fiscal 2017 revenue and earnings of $5.18 billion -- slightly below the midpoint of guidance -- and $4.32 per share, respectively.In the end, this is a fairly cut-and-dry case of Cintas offering a gratifying combination of a strong end to its fiscal year, and an encouraging forecast for the one ahead. Assuming Cintas can sustain this momentum and keep widening the scope of its business, it's no surprise to see shares touching a fresh 52-week high today.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

At fiscal end, cash and cash equivalents were $139.4 million, significantly down from $417.1 million in the prior-year period. The year-over-year decrease was largely due to cash utilization for stock repurchases during the quarter. Cintas repurchased $759 million worth of shares in fiscal 2016, including $276 million in the reported quarter. Long-term debt at fiscal 2016 end was $1.1 billion compared with $1.3 billion at fiscal 2015 end.Net cash from operating activities was $465.8 million for fiscal 2016 compared with $580.3 million in the prior-year period.

"Cintas rents uniforms to businesses big and small. Source: Getty Images.The past five years have been nothing short of stellar for  (NASDAQ: CTAS) . The stock has soared, handily outperforming the S&P, and also fellow uniform renters  (NASDAQ: GK) and  (NYSE: UNF) : data by But when a stock has a tremendous run like that, it's only natural to wonder if it's overvalued. And that's proving to be a very tricky question to answer. By one common measure, it is. By another, it's not. Let's see if we can figure out the real truth.When assessing a stock's value, the first places to look are standard valuation metrics. The most prominent of these is the price-to-earnings ratio, which measures the stock's price against the company's annual earnings. A stock with a lower multiple than its peers is, generally speaking, more likely to be undervalued. I've compared Cintas' current P/E ratio with its uniform rental peers, as well as  (NYSE: ARMK) , a food service provider that also has a sizable uniform-rental division.Data source: Yahoo! Finance. Chart by author.Cintas has the lowest P/E of the bunch. That might be a sign that it's undervalued.But not so fast: If the stock's P/E has been consistently lower than that of its peers, this may not be anything to get excited about. However, this doesn't seem to be the case. Over the past 10 years, the stock's P/E has generally been more or less in line with those of its peers, and only recently has it dropped: data by So the P/E ratio indicates that Cintas may currently be undervalued. But it would be small-""f"" foolish to base an assessment on a single metric -- because another common metric tells a very different story.That other valuation metric is the lengthily named metric of enterprise value to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization -- usually shortened to EV/EBITDA, or just called the enterprise multiple. Again, a lower number often means a company may be undervalued.Surprisingly, Cintas has the highest enterprise multiple of the group -- although it, Aramark, and G&K are clustered fairly closely together: data by That's a very different story than the P/E ratios tell. In fact, this could indicate that the stock is actually overvalued, relative to its peers -- particularly UniFirst, whose enterprise multiple is much lower than those of the others. Two metrics, different stories. Let's try to figure out why.Well, the enterprise multiple may show different results than the P/E ratio because it takes debt into account, which P/E does not. So the first thing we should check is whether Cintas is carrying an unusually high debt load, in which case it may not be undervalued at all.Here is a chart showing the debt-to-equity ratios of these four companies: data by UniFirst isn't carrying any debt at all, which explains its very low enterprise multiple. And while Cintas is carrying some debt, its debt ratio isn't out of line with those of its peers -- although Aramark's sure seems to be. So there must be another explanation for the disparity.Digging into Cintas' income statement provides the key as to why these valuation metrics are telling such different stories. You'll notice in the chart showing the companies' relative P/E ratios that Cintas' drops sharply at the end of 2015, from over 25 to just above 15. There's a reason for that: The company sold its stake in Shred-It during its Q2 2016, which ended last Nov. 30.That sale added more than $200 million to the income statement, categorized as ""income from discontinued operations, net of tax,"" and which was factored in after taxes and interest, which affected the company's reported net income (and thus, its P/E ratio), but not its EBITDA.In other words, the P/E ratio has been artificially depressed by this large sale, which isn't showing up in the enterprise multiple. So the enterprise multiple is -- at least for now -- a better metric to look at. It also means that Cintas doesn't seem to be undervalued right now.Even if a stock isn't undervalued by traditional metrics, that doesn't mean it's not still a good company, or a buy. In fact, you should always look beyond valuation metrics when deciding whether a stock is worth your money. Otherwise, you could get misled by numbers that aren't telling the whole story -- like Cintas' P/E.Cintas is still a company with  and a good track record of strong growth and creating value for its shareholders. However, UniFirst, with its comparatively low P/E, low enterprise multiple, and zero debt, seems to also be worth a closer look -- because when picking stocks, you should always take a closer look.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Source: Getty Images. I wouldn't blame you if you'd never heard of  (NASDAQ: CTAS) , despite its status as a member of the S&P 500. The company's primary business is renting uniforms and floor mats to other businesses. Not exactly the most exciting (or visible) line of work.The company's performance, on the other hand, has been anything but dull. Not only has it handily trounced the S&P over the past five years, but it's also beaten the performance of smaller rivals such as  (NYSE: UNF) and  (NASDAQ: GK) : data by But that doesn't necessarily mean smooth sailing from here on out. Owning even a strong company like Cintas carries some risk. Here are three of the biggest risks to shareholders.Generally speaking, as a company gets larger, its growth rate slows down, but Cintas has been bucking that trend with strong earnings and revenue growth in recent years. The company's compounded annual revenue growth since 2011 has been 4.5%, and its compound annual growth of net income has been an impressive 13.1% : data by But rapid growth can't continue forever, especially when Cintas isn't the only company in this space. The North American uniform rental market is very fragmented, and there are lots of smaller players. Cintas controls about 25% of it overall. Rivals UniFirst and G&K Services control 9% and 6%, respectively, with the uniform division of  (NYSE: ARMK) controlling an additional 10%. That leaves fully half of the market consisting of smaller local or regional players.You might expect that these smaller companies would have an advantage over Cintas, at least in terms of growth. But since the Great Recession, Cintas' EPS growth (the blue line in the following chart) has outpaced its smaller industry peers: data by This strong growth profile may already be priced into the stock, given that its enterprise value to EBITDA ratio is the highest of its peer group. If that's true, and growth slows down, the stock price will take a hit. Which is definitely a risk for a company that has come so far, so fast.To combat any potential slowing of growth, Cintas has been branching out into new business lines since 2002, when it introduced a restroom supply business. Document shredding and fire protection offerings soon followed in 2003.These other business lines make up a very small piece of Cintas' revenue pie. The core uniform/floor mat rental business still contributes 77% of the company's revenue, with another 10% coming from uniform sales. Only the remaining 13% or so comes from these new ventures, which include first aid kits.But expanding into new lines of business -- even on a limited basis -- is risky. Cintas found this out firsthand when divested its document shredding business last year after it failed to meet its growth expectations. For now, the remaining new ventures are highly profitable, sporting a 44.1% profit margin overall. But that's no guarantee of continued success. They, too, could fail to grow as anticipated, or face new competition, leaving the company headed for slower growth and tougher times.It stands to reason, of course, that periods of high unemployment -- recessions, for example -- would be particularly tough on a company like Cintas. After all, fewer employees need fewer uniforms. And sure enough,  .But this could become a further problem for Cintas -- indeed, for any uniform renter -- if automation technology begins to replace human workers in traditionally uniformed professions. For example, if a delivery truck becomes automated, or replaced by a drone, there won't be any need to rent a uniform for the driver. Receptionists, cashiers, warehouse employees: Anyone whose job becomes automated is one less employee needing a uniform... and one less customer for Cintas.Of course, that's a long-term problem (although some believe it's coming sooner rather than later), so it's unlikely to affect the company's fortunes in the short term. But if automation seriously begins eating into its profits, or if other technological or economic factors start to have a major impact on overall employment, you can expect Cintas' performance to suffer.Cintas is a strong company, but it isn't immune to risks. A changing labor market, untested new ventures, and slowing growth could have an impact on the company's fortunes, and the fortunes of its shareholders. For now, Cintas seems to be avoiding these potential pitfalls and cruising to continued success. But there are a few things investors should keep an eye on to gauge whether Cintas is vulnerable to these risks.The easiest to track is the unemployment rate, which has been dropping steadily over the past several years. If it reverses course, instead ticking upwards over multiple quarters in succession, that would be a red flag for Cintas. Investors should also watch the profit margins of the company's non-core business lines, as weakness there will have an impact on the bottom line. Finally, check in on the company's core revenue and earnings growth every quarter for signs of a prolonged slowdown, which might indicate that the company's days of rapid growth are nearing an end.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

"nspite of the optimistic start by the big banks this earnings season, looking at projected estimates in our  for the still-to-report 464 companies, total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be down 8.6% on the back of a 5.6% decline in revenues. It seems the quarter is on track to be the fifth consecutive quarter of earnings decline.The earnings season is yet to take off for the industrial products sector (one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors), with companies gearing up to play the beat-and-miss game this week. The report reveals that the sector's earnings are projected to fall 8.6% this quarter. Though still in the negative territory, the projected decline is much narrower than the 22.2% plunge witnessed in the first quarter. The decline will be more broad-based, with 9 out of the 16 Zacks sectors expected to remain in the negative territory.Industrial production increased 0.6% in June, after declining 0.3% in May. In the second quarter, industrial production suffered its third consecutive quarterly decline, falling at an annual rate of 1%. Industrial demand remained challenged in the quarter, hurt by the weak global oil & gas markets. Capacity utilization is decreasing, reflecting slow industrial capex spending. On the positive side, market conditions were favorable in the U.S. construction space.The International Monetary Fund (""IMF"") has reduced its growth projections for the U.S. economy by 20 basis points (bps), to 2.6% for 2016. As per the organization, overall activity remains strong in the United States, supported by still-easy financial conditions and strengthening housing and labor markets. However, a stronger dollar and weaker  continue are likely to weigh on manufacturing activity, curtailing investment in mining structures and equipment.With plenty of companies coming out with their results starting this week, let's see how it unfolds for these three industrial players that are going to report their first-quarter numbers on Tuesday, Jul 19, 2016. , the provider of maintenance, repair, and operating (MRO) supplies, beat both on earnings and revenues in the last quarter. The company has an average earnings beat of 7.24% in the trailing four quarters. | While the company will benefit from acquisitions and focus on restructuring activities, weak monthly sales, lower oil and gas prices, currency headwinds and weak macroeconomic conditions in Canada will weigh on near-term results.

"Cintas rents uniforms to workers in a diverse group of industries, including oil and gas. Image source: Getty Images.Any way you slice it,  (NASDAQ: CTAS) is having a great year. The uniform rental and facilities services company has posted three straight quarters of solid top- and bottom-line growth and is predicting a sixth straight year of double-digit earnings growth.However, in order to maintain its top dog status in a competitive and fragmented industry, Cintas is shaking things up a bit. Here are two of the company's major initiatives and what to expect from them in the coming months and years.Cintas has been more than just a uniform renter for over a decade. The company offers a diverse array of services including first-aid kit restocking, restroom supply, and fire system maintenance. This diversification has helped the company maintain its impressive growth story over the years by contributing to its high margins and allowing it to generate more revenue from its existing customer base. In this manner, it's similar to competitor  (NYSE: ARMK) , which offers food service and facility cleaning services in addition to its uniform rentals.The diversity of its customer base is also a boon to Cintas. By supplying uniforms to a wide variety of industries -- including oil and gas, casino gaming, and manufacturing -- Cintas is able to weather downturns in a single industry that might result in fewer uniform purchases from that industry. Aramark, which services schools, healthcare environments, and sports and entertainment venues, has a similarly diverse customer base.A good example of how this affects the company is the current state of the oil and gas industry. With fuel prices low, many energy companies are being hit hard. That's resulting in lower demand for uniforms from that sector to the tune of about 40 basis points, according to Cintas Vice President and Treasurer Paul Adler. However, Cintas actually comes out ahead, because the lower prices means it's spending about 50 basis points less on fuel for its fleet of vans. If Cintas had heavier exposure to the energy industry, this would have been a net negative instead of a net positive.Cintas has announced plans to generally broaden its offerings and its customer base, but it hasn't specified if that will involve introducing new services in addition to ramping up existing ones.As CFO Mike Hansen said in the company's recent Q3 , many potential customers don't realize how diverse Cintas' offerings actually are. ""We've had many customers over the years say to us, 'Gosh, I didn't know you did that. I didn't know that you did first aid and safety. I didn't know that you had fire protection services. I didn't know you had chemical cleaning services,'"" he said. ""And the more we heard this, we kept thinking, 'We need to educate.'""So, the company has decided to educate potential customers by launching a national branding campaign using the tag line ""Ready for the Workday."" The campaign is expected to ramp up over the next several months and be fully operational by the second quarter of 2017. According to Hansen, it's the largest branding campaign the company has ever launched, and it will be the first to feature TV ads.Improving brand awareness nationally should help Cintas meet its goals of sustained growth. And Hansen thinks now is the perfect time to do just that. ""Now is a great time to do this because we've got some businesses that are really doing well and executing well,"" he said. ""We've got a lot of ... fairly new products and we want to get the word out to many, many businesses in North America that when those businesses have issues, need problems solved, think about calling Cintas.""The company is being up front about the fact that -- as with most branding campaigns -- the full impact won't be able to be assessed for at least a year after its launch. But the company is wise to flex its financial muscles in this manner. In a fragmented industry full of smaller players for whom a national branding campaign isn't an option, getting the word out is a wise use of company resources.Even if Cintas was just planning ""more of the same,"" it would still be an attractive investment, since the stock has handily outperformed the market and competitor Aramark since Aramark's NYSE debut in 2013: data by  .Luckily for shareholders, management isn't content with ""more of the same""; it's planning additional efforts to diversify and attract new customers.True, there's no guarantee these efforts will pay off. The company's national ""Ready for the Workday"" branding campaign could flop, or fail to have the anticipated impact on the bottom line. New business lines could fail to perform as anticipated, like the company's recently divested document shredding service did. And economic trouble will always be a potential problem for even a well-diversified company like Cintas.However, the potential risks to a branding campaign and diversification are low compared to the potential positive impact, and it's good to see Cintas ""making hay while the sun shines""; its business is strong. Investors should have confidence that the good times will keep rolling for the company.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

 data by If that investment method sounds appealing to you, here are three stocks that you should either have on your radar or add to your portfolio today.Sometimes when you look at a business model that is simple, yet generates strong returns, you have to wonder why more companies don't try to jump in on the action.  '(NASDAQ: CTAS) uniform and floor mat rental business is definitely one of those. While the company has some ancillary businesses, renting out and maintaining uniforms and floor mats generates the bulk of its revenue and profits. The rental and service aspect of that business model is key, because it establishes steady revenue streams, rather than the lumpiness that can come with straight sales.What is even more impressive is that the company has been able to turn this rather simple concept into a steady, high-return business. Cintas has generated annual returns on equity in the high teens for more than 20 years, with the exception of the 2008-2010 recession -- and even then, its worst return was 7.5%. Those high rates of return have allowed the company to steadily raise its dividend for 33 years, and reduce its overall share count by close to a third over the past 10 years. (Note: That dip near the end of the dividend payment chart is because the company paid an additional special dividend in 2014 that had no bearing on its regular dividend). data by Cintas' current 1% dividend yield isn't anything that will turn your head, but that is in part because the company's stock is a little expensive now. So today may not be the most opportune time to buy this stock, but it's certainly worth putting on your radar for the future.For industrial manufacturers, there are always going to be times of feast and times of famine. These inevitable ups and downs can turn off some investors, but there are companies that do a better job of wading through the down times than others. One way is by building up a large order backlog that can keep your operations busy whether times are good or bad.  (NYSE: BA) , with $480 billion worth of orders for commercial planes alone, can assure investors that it won't be suffering from a lack of work any time soon.That steady stream of orders on older and newer plane models gives the company some wiggle room when figuring out the kinks related to bringing a new aircraft to market. Sales of those new planes have led to some lumpy returns over the years, but the big takeaway here is that the company has mostly been able to maintain returns on capital employed in the the double digits for the past 20 years, which has allowed the company to increase dividends and reduce share count. data by Boeing's share price doesn't necessarily look cheap or expensive today. Its current enterprise value to EBITDA ratio of 9.4 times is pretty much in line with where the company has traded over the past decade. With a better than 3% dividend yield, though, they do have a certain amount of appeal.In recent months, moderately recovering  sent shares of oil and gas companies much higher compared to the lows that we saw at the beginning of the year.  (NYSE: XOM) , a company that doesn't typically see huge gains over short periods, is up 20%. Some investors may feel that means they missed the boat on ExxonMobil. Looking a little deeper, though, it appears there could still be room to run for this energy industry stalwart.The reason that it makes a compelling dividend investment in the first place is that it's probably the best in the business when it comes to allocating capital efficiently and generating returns through the ups and downs of the energy market. Even amid the recent drubbing of the energy market, ExxonMobil generated a return on equity in the high single digits, and that's the first time in over 25 years that it has fallen below 10%. With oil prices slowly creeping back up, you can pretty safely assume that ExxonMobil will see better returns ahead.Even though its stock has recovered a bit in recent months, it's still pretty cheap compared to its historical valuations. On a price to tangible book basis, Exxon's stock is trading at levels we haven't seen in more than 20 years. Plus, at about 3%, its dividend yield is in the highest neighborhood it has been in the 2000s. data by Considering ExxonMobil's track record for generating returns over the long term, the stock looks somewhat attractively priced today.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

I Bet You'll Love These 3 Stocks@2016-07-17@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/dividends-i-bet-youll-love-these-3-stocks-2016-07-17
eading business service provider  is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2016 results after the closing bell on Jul 19. In the last reported quarter, earnings comfortably exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10 cents. Cintas has beaten earnings estimates in each of the last four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 4.5%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Cintas is expected to achieve broad-based revenue growth in the quarter with the continued improvements in the pricing environment and higher operational efficiency. The company aims to continually achieve revenue buildup by increasing the existing customer penetration level and broadening the customer base to include business segments that are not historically served. The company is expected to capitalize on the growth prospects in the rental first aid and direct sale businesses. Leveraging its well-equipped infrastructure resources, Cintas is also expected to capitalize on its scale advantages to augment competitiveness. Furthermore, a more favorable pricing scenario and cost-streamlining initiatives are expected to drive incremental margins.During the quarter, Cintas collaborated with Google's Advanced Technology and Projects Group to explore the opportunities to upgrade Jacquard - a smart garment technology developed by the latter. Jacquard enables conductive fibers to be woven into textiles, connecting interactive apparel wirelessly to devices, software platforms, and cloud services. The collaboration aims to develop Jacquard-enhanced uniforms likely to be promoted by Cintas in the future. Although the collaboration is not likely to make any significant contribution in the soon-to-be-reported quarter, its impact on attracting potential revenue contribution from other clients is irrefutable.In addition, Cintas has a strong balance sheet with adequate liquidity to meet its working capital requirements. The company also generates strong operating cash flow, which helps maintain its cash reserves. The company has consistently returned cash to its shareholders through stable dividend payouts and share repurchases. In addition, Cintas has easy access to commercial paper and long-term debt markets on favorable interest rate and other terms, which has historically provided it with adequate sources of liquidity. | Despite the company's inherent strength, our proven model does not conclusively show that Cintas is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it lacks the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is currently at 0.00%. Cintas' Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) reduces the predictive power of ESP.

"intas shows that uniforms don't have to be boring. Image source: Cintas resort collection catalog.Many investors think of  (NASDAQ: CTAS) as a specialist in providing uniforms for workers, but it has sought to expand its influence to provide a wider range of the materials that people need in order to do their jobs effectively and efficiently. The rise in employment levels in the U.S. economy has had a positive influence on Cintas' business, and coming into Tuesday's fiscal fourth-quarter financial report, investors were expecting solid growth from the company. Cintas' actual results turned out even better than most shareholders were hoping to see, and prospects for even faster growth in the future are creating a great deal of excitement about the uniform provider. Let's look more closely at what Cintas said about its quarter and whether it can build up even more momentum in the future.Cintas' fiscal fourth-quarter results once again continued the company's long string of encouraging financials. Sales jumped more than 11% to $1.27 billion, which easily outpaced the 9% growth rate that most of those following the stock were expecting. Net income from continuing operations was up an even stronger 17% to $118 million, and that produced adjusted earnings of $1.08 per share, beating the consensus forecast by $0.08 per share.Looking more closely at the financials that Cintas released, you can see several positive influences that added up to its impressive growth. The uniform rental and facility services division posted solid sales growth of 8%, making up more than three-quarters of Cintas' overall revenue, and cost-containment measures managed to hold the rise in the direct costs of the segment to just 5%. Cintas' Other category had much faster growth of almost 22%, although gross margin was slightly lower for the first-aid, safety, fire-protection, and direct-sales unit. Net margin climbed by half a percentage point to 9.3%, showing the payoff from efforts to rein in expenses and bolster profitability.Cintas also maintained a healthy balance between growth from acquisitions and from internal sources. The company said that its organic growth in revenue was almost 7%, which also accounted for differences in the number of workdays in the quarter and any impacts from foreign currency exchange-rate changes.CEO Scott Farmer was pleased with how the fiscal year ended. ""We achieved record revenue and [earnings per share] in fiscal year 2016,"" Farmer said, and ""we have increased EPS by double-digits in six consecutive years."" The CEO went on to attribute the Ready for the Workday campaign as a key contributor to Cintas' success, along with the ability to deploy cash toward internal investment as well as dividend increases and buybacks of more than three-quarters of a billion dollars for the full year.The uniform-rental and related services provider expects even better conditions to prevail in its 2017 fiscal year. The company gave initial guidance for sales of between $5.15 billion and $5.225 billion for the year, which would represent growth from final fiscal 2016 figures of 5% to 6.5%. Similarly, earnings per share guidance of $4.35 to $4.45 per share would represent year-over-year growth of between 6% and 9%. Even better, the guidance includes the negative impact from there being one less work-day in fiscal 2017 compared to the preceding leap year.One question that some investors will have for Cintas is whether more extensive dividend increases could be coming in the future. Right now, Cintas yields just over 1%, and its dividend represents only about a quarter of what it brings in as earnings. Moreover, Cintas is one of the few companies that pays dividends annually rather than on a quarterly basis. So far, investors haven't seemed to mind the way that Cintas allocates its capital, but income investors would still prefer to see more opportunities to see Cintas return money to shareholders.Cintas investors celebrated the company's positive report, sending the stock soaring more than 3% in after-hours trading following the announcement and breaking the $100 per share mark for the first time. As long as the employment market keeps performing well, then Cintas will have an opportunity to keep growing and share its success with its shareholders.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

 , a leading provider of data protection and information management services, is set to release its first quarter 2016 results on Apr 28. In the last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.79%. The company has posted an average negative earnings surprise of 2.97% over the past four quarters.Iron Mountain's diversified revenue base is a positive. It is noteworthy that more than 95% of the Fortune 1000 companies are on Iron Mountain's client list. In addition, its strong product portfolio, increasing market share, and promising international business are the primary growth catalysts. Moreover, the company's entry into the data center market is likely to be a growth driver.Furthermore, the company had recommenced merger and acquisition activities since the fourth quarter. But the costs of such initiatives are expected to weigh on financials, especially as it already has a highly leveraged balance sheet. Additionally, Iron Mountain has already started preparations for the integration of Recall Holdings which might also have some negative impact on its financials in the to-be-reported quarter. The acquisition is expected to be closed by May 2, 2016.Also, volatile currency environment and competition from the likes of Cintas Corporation  and others remain overhangs.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Iron Mountain is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below : Iron Mountain's Earnings ESP is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 48 cents. : Iron Mountain has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which when combined with a 0.00% ESP, makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are a couple of stocks that you may consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Silicon Motion Technology Corp.

"Image source: Getty Images.Investors appreciate the value of dividend income, and many people look closely at the list of Dividend Aristocrats to guide their decision-making about which stocks to buy for their own portfolios. Before you simply copy the Dividend Aristocrats list, however, you should know that just because a stock is a Dividend Aristocrat doesn't mean that it will meet your needs as an income investor. In particular, what many people don't realize is that becoming a Dividend Aristocrat has nothing to do with how much of a dividend a stock pays. That can lead to some surprising results when you look more closely at the list.In order to become a member of the Dividend Aristocrats, a stock has to develop a long track record of successfully growing its dividend over time. The threshold for membership is 25 straight years of higher dividend payments. There are roughly 50 Dividend Aristocrats in the S&P 500, and each year, new stocks that meet the requirements get added to the list, while those that failed to sustain their dividend-increase streaks are eliminated.The problem with the Dividend Aristocrats is that there's no minimum dividend yield requirement. As long as a company boosted its payout, the relative  of that payout isn't important for purposes of membership. The three stocks that you'll see below have extremely low dividend yields. That doesn't mean that they're terrible stocks overall, but it does make unsuitable for income investors who want to concentrate on getting above-average levels of income from their investment portfolios.The worst-yielding Dividend Aristocrat by far is  (NYSE: BCR) . The medical instrument maker has a dividend yield of less than 0.5%, which is less than half the yield of the next-lowest Dividend Aristocrats. Even with that low yield, though, Bard has a long 45-year track record of increasing its payout, and that's enough to get it on the list.Fundamentally, however, Bard has plenty of earnings power, and that has produced double-digit returns over the long haul for shareholders. For instance, in its most recent quarterly results, Bard said that it expects full-year earnings in excess of $10 per share. In that light, even the just-boosted $0.26 per share quarterly payout that Bard makes amounts to barely 10% of the company's earnings. Retained profits have driven success in terms of capital appreciation, producing average annual total returns of more than 15% since 1996. Bard has been a great investment even if it has been the worst Dividend Aristocrat in terms of dividend yield.Next up is uniform specialist  (NASDAQ: CTAS) . The company pays an annual dividend, and its most recent $1.05 per share distribution last November represents a 1.1% yield at current prices. To be fair, the boost represented a more than 20% jump from last year's regular dividend, accelerating from what used to be minimal annual increases to satisfy the Dividend Aristocrat requirements. The company has a 33-year history of delivering rising dividends to investors.For Cintas, a recovering job market has helped power its results. With the company's ""Ready for the Workday"" branding campaign, Cintas hopes to grow every aspect of its business, ranging from its well-known uniform offerings to its first aid, safety, and fire-protection equipment. Average 20-year returns of about 10% aren't quite as attractive as other Aristocrats. But understanding that Cintas pays out less than a fifth of its earnings in the form of dividends shows that income investors aren't getting everything that the uniform specialist could afford to pay points toward the potential for long-term share-price growth.Finally,  (NYSE: SHW) has a long history as a Dividend Aristocrat, with 38 years of consecutive annual dividend increases. Yet the paint specialist's yield is less than 1.2%, making some income investors feel like Sherwin-Williams doesn't get the job done from an income standpoint.As with C.R. Bard, Sherwin-Williams has put up strong total returns in excess of 15% over the past 20 years and 30 years. However, Sherwin-Williams pays a larger proportion of its earnings as dividends, with a payout ratio approaching 30%. Now that the company is seeking to expand through the acquisition of rival  , Sherwin-Williams hopes that it will be able to accelerate its own organic growth and take full advantage of both its own paint-store sales and its partnerships with other retail outlets to maximize overall revenue. Despite global economic headwinds, Sherwin-Williams has growth prospects -- even if its dividend hasn't kept up with its share price.Dividend Aristocrats are often strong stocks, but with some, current yields can leave something to be desired. If you're strictly looking for maximum income from dividends, then Sherwin-Williams, Cintas, and C.R. Bard aren't the ideal Dividend Aristocrats for your portfolio.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

"t's been an amazing decade for growth stock investors, as long as they're buying into the right growth stocks.  - the original Motley Fool newsletter service - has come through with some pretty impressive picks over the years.They haven't all been winners. You don't swing for the fences twice a month - the newsletter service sends its members two dozen recommendations over the course of the year - without striking out from time to time. However, if you have enough big winners they can be more than enough to deliver overall market-thumping results.Let's go over some of  's biggest winners over the past 10 years. - 3,128% since 6/15/07The leading premium video service is in a good place these days. The undisputed champ of premium video had 81.5 million streaming subscribers worldwide as of the end of March, and it's expecting to close out the current quarter with 84 million accounts.That certainly wasn't the case in the springtime of 2007. It had introduced streaming earlier in the year, but that was limited to a catalog of 1,000 titles that could only be viewed on a PC. No Macs. No smart TVs. No mobile gadgetry. Netflix's primary business was renting out DVDs by mail, and that didn't seem like a very promising niche as traditional video rental chains were closing down.Netflix went on to build on its initial success in digital video, and now its streaming platform has won Oscars and Hollywood's attention. Netflix has more than $12 billion committed to streaming content obligations, and it doesn't seem as if anyone is even close as it expands into new international territories.- 723% since 11/18/08 The world's most valuable consumer technology company has been rolling since the 2007 introduction of the iPhone. Apple just seems to know what consumers want, often before they even know they want it.Smartphones were mostly for corporate types before the iPhone arrived, and Apple redefined the computing market when it rolled out the iPad tablet. Apple is coming off of its first year-over-year decline in iPhone sales, but it's hard to bet against the class act of Cupertino. Apple has a long track record of innovation, and that means more than just the inevitable iPhone 7 rolling out later this year.- 690% since 11/16/12 Electric cars have always made sense, but it's Tesla Motors that has been making it cool. Tesla's Model S isn't cheap, but supply can't seem to keep up with demand as aspiring Tesla owners have to wait for months on a waiting list after making an initial deposit.Tesla isn't afraid to do things differently. It doesn't sell cars through a traditional dealership model. It has been building out a global network of charging stations that it makes available to Tesla owners at no charge. Just a few weeks ago it introduced the Model 3, a more accessible electric sedan that should hit the market in late 2017 at a starting price near $35,000. It got 325,000 people to offer up a refundable $1,000 deposit for the car. Tesla isn't afraid to dream big, and big stock gains have followed.  - 586% since 6/18/10Booking travel online has been burning traditional travel agents for years, but the leading websites haven't always been rewarded for being disruptive. Priceline went public just as the dot-com bubble was peaking, and when the market collapsed the ""Name Your Own Price"" company got clobbered. Priceline's stock sank so low that it executed a reverse split to prop it back up to a respectable price. recommended Priceline in 2010, just as it was overtaking  for the lead in hotel reservations. Priceline's success has come as a result of moving beyond its original model where folks would submit how much they were willing to pay for travel bookings. It has been a serial acquirer, snapping up European giant Booking,com, comparison shopping darling Kayak, and even restaurants reservation giant OpenTable.- 532% since 3/20/08 When something is boring they say it's like watching paint dry, but paint has been anything but boring for investors in Sherwin-Williams. Top-line growth may not be impressive at Sherwin-Williams. Revenue has grown in the single digits in each of the past four years for the paints and coatings specialist, but the stock has benefited from the real estate market's revival and the recovery encouraging folks to spruce up their homes.- 414% since 12/19/08 The leader in family friendly entertainment has been a fairy tale investment in recent years, but this pick didn't start as a recommendation for Disney. It was actually Marvel that got the newsletter service's nod in 2008, a year before Disney would buy the comic book giant in a $4 billion stock deal.Just as the newsletter service's earlier recommendation of Pixar would eventually roll into Disney, we've seen that the media giant isn't afraid of cutting 10-figure checks to land compelling franchises. It's most recent purchase is Lucasfilm, culminating in Disney reviving the Star Wars series.- 363% since 12/19/08 Cintas is the top dog in corporate uniform rentals. It also provides several other workforce-related products and services. This may not seem like a very scintillating industry, but international expansion and sector consolidation in a highly fragmented space have helped deliver improving financials.Cintas has come through with six consecutive years of improving net profit margins. It also only helps that Cintas has managed to boost its dividend every single year since going public in 1983.- 167% since 5/21/10 The beer company behind Samuel Adams has been brewing big gains for its shareholders. Despite naming its signature label after one of the country's founding fathers, Boston Beer didn't launch until 1984 when Jim Koch found his great-great grandfather's brewing recipe in the family attic.Samuel Adams helped usher in the era of craft brews, and it's been able to maintain its indie identity despite seeing its stock and the number of indie craft brewers in the marketplace soar.The key to finding many of these great performers early is to find companies that are disrupting established industries. We've seen that with Netflix in reshaping the way we consume video content and Tesla in making plug-in electric vehicles aspirational. Sometimes it's just a matter of finding market leaders that are gobbling up the competition in a synergistic shopping spree. We've seen that with Disney, Cintas, Priceline, and McKesson.Growth opportunities are always out there, and the only thing more exciting to a growth stock investor than the past is the future. How many big winners will  single out in the next 10 years?There will be a fair share of stocks that don't pan out. We know that. The key is finding a handful of winners that will more than offset the declines. We can toast to a great decade for growth stocks, but the future is what ultimately really gets growth investors going.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Unfortunately, the same can't be said for its bottom line, which was lower year over year because of weaker margins. That's partially because the company isn't integrating Shred-it quite as fast as expected, which is leading it to lower full-year guidance just a bit.
  
Data source: Stericycle.  Acquisitions continued to be the story at Stericycle. CEO Charlie Alutto led off the company's conference call discussing the results by saying:As Alutto notes, the Shred-it acquisition drove strong revenue growth during the quarter. However, earnings growth was muted due to the timing of the expected synergies from that transaction, which was evidenced by the higher SG&A costs. COO Brent Arnold pinpointed the problem on the call, noting that the company has ""reassessed the original timeline associated with the reroutes and onsite-to-offsite conversions."" He also said the company still remains ""confident in our ability to achieve the full $73 million in  -Shred-It synergies.""Given the slower-than-expected synergy capture, Alluto provided an update to the company's guidance for 2016:That's a bit weaker than the prior guidance, which called for revenue growing to a range of $3.65 billion to $3.72 billion, with non-GAAP earnings growing to a range of $5.28 to $5.35 per share.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Source: Over the long run, the  has booked an average  this month, according to the estimable Dr. Edward Yardeni.If tactical investors want to swim against the tide, they need to find stocks to buy that are poised not just for outperformance, but for  - because in May, you could historically beat the market by treading water!Helpfully, we can use price momentum and seasonality to identify stocks with better-than-average outlooks this month. Shares that are making golden crosses, setting new 52-week highs or overcoming key technical levels are more likely to maintain their upside price momentum. Stocks with a history of strong seasonal returns are also worth checking out as potential short-term market-beaters.And, of course, it's always good to have a fundamental catalyst or two.After screening the S&P 500 for stocks with technical strength and strong seasonality, these five names that look like some of the best stocks to buy this month:Click to Enlarge  Sentiment is high on  (  ) on fundamentals alone. Amazon recently delivered a blowout quarter on the back of its web services unit, which sent AMZN shares sky-high.As a result, the technicals are following suit.Fresh off the buy signal of a golden cross, AMZN stock thought about testing support at its 50-day moving average - and then didn't even get all that close. The stock bounced out of the near-test to put a new 52-week high in sight. The 200-day moving average is also making new highs.In addition to the upside momentum, AMZN enjoys life as the summer months start to roll in.

Revenues and gross margins also headed higher, thanks to strength in Uniform Rental and Facility Services, as well as First Aid and Safety Services. And for fiscal 2016, the company now says it will see earnings growth of 18.8% to 20.3% on revenue growth of 8.6% to 9.2%.Beyond the positive seasonality and good fundamental feelings, CTAS is exhibiting technical strength.

"Two explosions hitting Brussels Airport and another at a Belgian metro train station have killed at least 26 people and wounded at least 130 more. This follows the capture of one of the Paris bombing suspects from that horrific incident last November. According to authorities, at least one of the explosions was a suicide bombing.Acts like these, largely believed to be the work of the Islamic State (IS), remind those of us in the Western world that terrorism is still very real, dire and ongoing. Brussels, the capital of the Western European country that had been discovered to be a nest of Islamic terrorist activity after the Paris attacks, is responding in full force, and Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel has derided the violence as ""blind, violent and cowardly"" and appealed for calm after the attacks. Security measures are being increased at airport terminals across Europe.Back home, we're seeing lower futures as a result of this, especially in the Airline and Travel industries, which also took a hit following the Paris incident. Headwinds for these markets had already been in effect with fears of the Zika virus, among other challenges. But ultimately, it should be clear to everyone that terrorist attacks like these are designed to disrupt commerce in the West and society as a whole. This fall will mark the 15th anniversary of 9/11, but psychological wounds about the incident remain to this day.The Dow is down roughly 50 points ahead of the bell this morning as America wakes up to this tragic news. All European markets closed down for Tuesday, as did the euro. But it's tough to separate pragmatic investment strategies at this early time, literally before the smoke has cleared.In any case, other market focuses are taking a back seat at this hour. Keeping in Europe a moment, Germany's Ifo Institute has published its latest monthly business confidence index, and the results were better than they had been for the past three months, which were all down. Analysts had expected a more modest rise than the one reported. Global trade and finance concerns seem to have abated… not accounting for this latest terrorist event on the continent.In the U.K., a stronger Consumer Price Index (CPI) than expected also reversed a negative reading last time around. This was also an indication of strengthening economics, at least in the strongest countries of broader Europe. Again, we'll have to wait and see what effect today's explosions will have.Although we are no longer ""officially"" in earnings season, we do receive quarterly results from 3 S&P 500 countries after the bell today: Nike (  ), Cintas (  ) and Red Hat (  ). Here at Zacks, we look at earnings data like this as forward benchmarks for Q1 earnings season, which gets into full swing in the next few weeks.Mark VickerySenior EditorWant the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"mage: Cintas.Few people think about the uniforms that employees have to wear to work, but  has made it its business to provide the clothing and other essentials that workers need to do their jobs. Coming into Tuesday's fiscal third-quarter financial report, Cintas investors were hoping that the company would be able to continue to grow by adding new customers and looking for smart ways to expand its reach. The results that Cintas posted were better than most investors had expected, and the company also boosted its guidance for the fiscal year once again. Let's take a closer look at the latest from Cintas and what lies ahead for the company going forward. Cintas' fiscal third-quarter results gave investors more of the good results they've seen recently. Sales climbed almost 10% to $1.22 billion, which was nicely ahead of the $1.20 billion consensus forecast among investors following the stock. On the bottom line, Cintas also produced success, posting a 17% rise in net income from continuing operations to $117.3 million. That produced earnings of $1.05 per share, which was a dime per share higher than investors had expected to see.A closer look at Cintas' numbers shows some of the success stories going on throughout the company. As we've seen in recent quarters, growth in the key uniform rental and facilities segments was sluggish at just 6%, but that pace is faster than we've seen lately. Gross margins for the segment expanded thanks to slower increases in costs of goods sold. For the Other category, which covers first aid, safety, fire-protection, and direct-sales, revenue jumped 24%, although a 26% rise in costs led to a slight decline in segment gross margins. Overall operating margins improved despite a 10% jump in overhead expenses, and reductions in interest expense helped boost profit margins as well.CEO Scott Farmer looked at the quarter in the context of broader efforts. ""We recently initiated our first national branding campaign,"" Farmer said, ""and introduced our new tag line, 'Ready for the Workday.'"" The CEO pointed to strong organic growth even in the acquisition-led Other segment of 12% as showing the demand for First Aid, Safety Services, and other needs beyond the uniform business.In response to its better than expected results, Cintas once again decided to boost its guidance for the full 2016 fiscal year. The company now expects that it will bring in between $4.86 billion and $4.89 billion in revenue, which takes the upper half of the previous guidance range and extends it upward by about $10 million. Similarly, earnings from continuing operations are now expected to be between $3.98 and $4.03 per share. That's up between $0.13 and $0.15 per share from previous guidance, accelerating from its previous pace of increase. The new figures imply growth rates of about 9% on the top line and between 19% and 20% on the earnings side.Perhaps the biggest long-term threat to Cintas stems from its exposure to the employment market. Even though efforts to broaden the company beyond its uniform segment have given Cintas much-needed diversification, the company still watches metrics like workday-adjusted revenue growth closely. Given that uniform rental revenue relates directly to the number of workdays in a given period, Cintas clearly recognizes that it benefits from favorable conditions in the workplace. If unemployment stops falling, then a reversal of fortune for the U.S. economy could have an outsized impact on Cintas' business.For now, though, Cintas investors were happy about the company's results, and the stock rose more than 1% in after-hours trading following the announcement. Cintas' combination of taking advantage of favorable conditions and making smart strategic moves to capture new opportunities should continue paying dividends well into the future for shareholders.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

eading business service provider  is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2016 results after the closing bell on Mar 22. In the last reported quarter, earnings exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents. The company has beaten earnings estimates in each of the last four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 3.8%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.With continued improvement in the pricing environment and higher operational efficiency, Cintas is expected to achieve broad-based revenue growth in the quarter. Cintas aims to continually achieve revenue buildup by increasing penetration levels at existing customers and broadening the customer base to include business segments that are not historically served. The company is expected to capitalize on the growth prospects in the rental first aid and direct sale businesses. Leveraging its well-equipped infrastructure resources, Cintas is also expected to capitalize on its scale advantages to augment competitiveness. Furthermore, a more favorable pricing scenario and cost-streamlining initiatives are expected to drive incremental margins.Cintas is now better focused on its core operations with the divestiture of Shred-it International Inc. and its document imaging and retention services (Storage) business. These asset sale transactions are likely to rationalize operations and result in incremental earnings with relatively lesser operating expenses.In addition, Cintas has a strong balance sheet with adequate liquidity to meet its working capital requirements. The company also generates strong operating cash flow, which helps maintain its cash reserves. The company has consistently returned cash to its shareholders through stable dividend payouts and share repurchases. Further, Cintas has easy access to commercial paper and long-term debt markets on favorable interest rate and other terms, which has historically provided it with adequate sources of liquidity.Despite inherent strength, our proven model does not conclusively show that Cintas is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it lacks the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is currently 0.00%. Cintas' Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, its ESP of 0.00% makes a surprise prediction difficult. On the other hand, Sell-rated stocks (#4 or #5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:AptarGroup, Inc.  , with an earnings ESP of +2.78% and Zacks Rank #2.Achaogen, Inc.  , with an earnings ESP of +1.75% and Zacks Rank #2.Bruker Corporation  , with an earnings ESP of +7.14% and Zacks Rank #2.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

It is noteworthy that more than 95% of the Fortune Array000 companies are on Iron Mountain's client list. In addition, its strong product portfolio, increasing market share, aggressive acquisition strategy and promising international business are the primary growth catalysts. Moreover, the company's entry into the data center market is likely to be a growth driver.Last year, the company had declared its plans to acquire rival company Recall Holdings, which is expected to generate strong synergies in the next couple of years. However, the cost of acquisition and integration is expected to weigh on financials, especially as it already has a highly leveraged balance sheet.Also, volatile currency environment and competition from the likes of Cintas Corporation  and others remain overhangs.Currently, Iron Mountain has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the same sector include CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust, Inc.  and Lamar Advertising Co.  , both sporting a Zacks Rank #Array (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

n Mar 24, Zacks  updated the research report on business services provider  .Cintas provides specialized services to all types of businesses throughout North America. The company designs and manufactures corporate identity uniform programs, and provides entrance mats, restroom supplies, promotional products and first aid and safety products for diversified businesses.Cintas aims to continually achieve revenue build-up by increasing penetration levels at existing customers and broadening the customer base to include fresh business segments. The company also identifies additional product and service opportunities for its current and future customers to expand its portfolio. To ensure solid organic revenue growth through new account sales, the company regularly provides advanced training to the sales force. Its team of skilled service professionals frequently visit customers, thus strengthening personal relationships, and facilitating a platform to launch additional products and services. This focused approach for steady top-line growth is commendable.The company recently recorded strong third-quarter fiscal 2016 results on the back of healthy organic growth. Net income from continuing operations was $117.3 million or $1.05 per share compared with $100.3 million or 85 cents per share in the year-earlier quarter. The healthy year-over-year increase in earnings was primarily attributable to solid top-line growth. The reported earnings for the quarter comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10 cents.Quarterly revenues increased 9.7% year over year to $1,216.1 million and exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,202 million. Organic growth for the reported quarter improved 6.8% year over year. The superior top-line performance was largely driven by the addition of newer customers, higher product prices and greater penetration of existing customers through better and innovative products and services.Buoyed by the healthy third-quarter fiscal 2016 results, Cintas revised its guidance for the fiscal year. The company expects fiscal 2016 revenues in the range of $4.860 billion to $4.890 billion, up 8.6%-9.2% year over year. Earnings from continuing operations are expected to be within $3.98-$4.03 per share, which represents a year-over-year improvement of 18.8%-20.3%.We remain encouraged with the strong quarterly performance and bullish guidance of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. Other stocks in the industry worth reckoning include The Hackett Group, Inc.  and Exponent Inc.  , both carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and CBIZ, Inc.  , sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

hareholders of Cintas Corporation (Symbol: CTAS) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 1.3% annualized dividend yield can sell the August covered call at the $85 strike and collect the premium based on the $3.90 bid, which annualizes to an additional 8.4% rate of return against the current stock price (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ), for a total of 9.7% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $85 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but CTAS shares would have to climb 5.3% from current levels for that to occur, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 10.2% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Cintas Corporation, looking at the dividend history chart for CTAS below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 1.3% annualized dividend yield.Below is a chart showing CTAS's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $85 strike highlighted in red:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the August covered call at the $85 strike gives good reward for the risk of having given away the upside beyond $85. (  ). We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Cintas Corporation (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $80.71) to be 19%.

"mage source: Cintas.Millions of American employees wear uniforms for their jobs, and that has led to a niche industry to provide those uniforms to workers.  has become a giant in the industry, and coming into Monday's fiscal second-quarter financial report, Cintas investors had high hopes that the company would benefit from generally favorable trends in the U.S. economy promoting job growth. Cintas' results were solid, and the company believes that the future could be even brighter for the rest of its fiscal year. Let's look more closely at how Cintas did during the quarter and why investors are celebrating its latest results. Cintas' fiscal second-quarter results continued the growth momentum that the company produced last quarter. Revenue rose 8.5% to $1.22 billion, which was just slightly above the figure that most investors had expected to see. Cintas' news on the bottom line was even better, with an 11% rise in net income to $115.5 million. That worked out to earnings of $1.03 per share, which was $0.03 above the consensus forecast among investors.Looking more closely at the numbers, Cintas enjoyed success throughout its business. Uniform rental and facilities services sales rose more than 5%, which was slightly slower than in the previous quarter, but costs associated with the segment rose at a slower 4% pace that led to a slight widening in operating margins. The company's Other category, which now includes the first aid, safety, fire protection, and direct-sales businesses, saw revenue climb 21%, and margins for the unit remained relatively steady.CEO Scott Farmer tried to highlight the facets of Cintas' recent success. ""Our solid start to fiscal year 2016 was followed by a second quarter of excellent financial results,"" Farmer said. ""We are pleased to again report strong increases in organic revenue, operating income, and EPS.""As we've seen in past quarter, Cintas was happy enough with its results that it decided to increase its guidance for the remainder of the fiscal year. The company narrowed its revenue guidance toward the top end of its previous range, raising its lower bound by $25 million and now expecting sales of between $4.825 billion and $4.88 billion. Cintas also pushed up its earnings guidance by $0.02 to $0.04 per share, with a new expectation for the bottom line of $3.83 and $3.90 per share during fiscal 2016.Still, Cintas is being conservative in its expectations. In particular, the company is careful to state that its guidance doesn't include any potential deterioration in the U.S. economy, which some are now concerned could result from the Federal Reserve's recent decision to increase interest rates. In the past, tightening cycles from the central bank have been associated with economic slowdowns and specifically with weaker performance in the job market. If employment starts to get less robust, then Cintas could see the impact quite quickly in its uniform rental business.One area where Cintas wasn't conservative is with its dividend. The company said in October that it would boost its annual dividend by more than 23% to $1.05 per share. The move extended Cintas' streak of annual dividend increases to 32 straight years, and the size of the boost from the Dividend Aristocrat stood out from companies that were less aggressive in sharing their good fortune with shareholders.Cintas stock responded favorably to the positive news, opening up about 2% following the announcement. By providing a good read on the health of the U.S. job market, Cintas' results could bode well for other economically sensitive companies as earnings season begins in the next few weeks.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

 and Rexam PLC  announced the terms of a recommended cash and share offer by Ball UK Acquisition Limited (Bidco), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ball, for the entire issued and to be issued share capital of Rexam on Nov 19.A day after the announcement, Ball Corporation confirmed that the European Commission (EU) has entered into a period of market testing which has been extended to Jan 22, 2016 based upon commitments proposed by Rexam and Ball Corporation. These commitments have been recommended with a view of obtaining EU Commission clearance for the deal.Ball Corporation expects that necessary regulatory clearances for the deal will be received by the first half of 2016. Per the talk among Ball Corporation and Rexam, they will work on a package of remedies to settle competition concerns.In early 2015, Ball Corporation had confirmed its offer to acquire Rexam. The pending acquisition of Rexam for a cash and stock deal valued at $8.4 billion (£5.4 billion) will create the world's largest consumer packaging supplier.The combined company would employ a workforce of about 22,500 people on five continents and have revenue of about $15 billion. This merged company will be better positioned to serve the combined customer base through supply chain efficiency, manufacturing excellence and increased product innovation.The acquisition will not only counter competition from other packaging rivals but also facilitate production of sustainable, innovative and low-cost packaging solutions. Moreover, it will reduce warehousing and transport costs.However, the EU started an in-depth investigation to assess whether the proposed transaction will reduce competition in the beverage can and aluminum bottle manufacturing industry in the European Economic Area (EEA).During the third quarter conference call, Ball Corporation slashed its 2015 free cash flow guidance to $550 million, excluding cash costs for the proposed Rexam acquisition. The acquisition, which is currently pending due to regulatory reviews, is on track, while concern regarding successful integration of the deal remains a headwind.Moreover, the company expects multiple-growth capital projects to benefit its results for 2016 and beyond. However difficult year-over-year volume comparisons, and aluminum premium headwinds may hurt growth.Broomfield, CO-based Ball Corporation is the largest manufacturer of beverage cans in North America. It also supplies aerospace as well as other technologies and services to the government and customers.Currently, Ball Corporation has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the sector are Cintas Corporation  and Belden Inc.  , both carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ? Today, you can download  .

eading business service provider  is scheduled to report its second-quarter fiscal 2016 results after the closing bell on Dec 21. In the last reported quarter, Cintas' earnings exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.During the soon-to-be-reported quarter, Cintas completed the sale of its investment in Shred-it International Inc. The company received $578 million in proceeds from the divesture. In addition, Cintas is likely to receive up to $34 million in additional consideration in the future, subject to certain holdback provisions. The transaction will be reflected in the impending quarterly results. The divestiture is expected to rationalize operations and reap synergistic benefits in the long run.With a continued improvement in the pricing environment and higher operational efficiency, Cintas is expected to achieve broad-based revenue growth in the quarter. Cintas aims to continually achieve revenue buildup by increasing penetration levels at existing customers and broadening the customer base to include business segments that are not historically served. The company is also expected to capitalize on the growth prospects in the rental first aid and direct sale businesses. Leveraging its well-equipped infrastructure resources, Cintas aims to capitalize on its scale advantages to augment its competitiveness. Also, a more favorable pricing scenario and cost streamlining initiatives are expected to drive incremental margins.In addition, Cintas has a strong balance sheet with adequate liquidity to meet its working capital requirements. The company also generates strong operating cash flow, which helps maintain its cash reserves. The company has consistently returned cash to shareholders through stable dividend payouts and share repurchases. In addition, Cintas has easy access to commercial paper and long-term debt markets on favorable interest rate and other terms, which has historically provided it with rich sources of liquidity.Despite some solid fundamentals, our proven model does not conclusively show that Cintas is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key ingredients for a success recipe. Expected Surprise Prediction or  , which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is currently pegged at 0.00%. Cintas' Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) when combined with a 0.00% ESP reduces the predictive power of ESP. Note that stocks with a Zacks Ranks of #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold) coupled with a positive ESP have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings.

n Nov 30, Zacks  updated the research report on waste management firm  .Stericycle reported relatively sedate third-quarter 2015 results with adjusted earnings of $1.08 per share, flat year over year and woefully short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10 cents. GAAP net income for the reported quarter was $41.8 million or 47 cents per share compared with $82.8 million or 96 cents per share in the year-earlier quarter. The significant year-over-year decline in earnings despite healthy top-line improvement was primarily due to high operating, acquisition and integration expenses.However, a significant portion of Stericycle's historical growth is attributable to the successful integration of acquisitions in both domestic and international markets. The company is continuously on the lookout for strategic acquisitions that will enhance market share and expand its geographic base. The acquisition pool of the company remains robust in multiple geographies and lines of business. International growth rates are expected to accelerate due to increasing customer adoption of multiple services and expansion into new lines of business.The global acquisition strategy increases Stericycle's customer base, by providing a long-term growth platform for selling multiple services. Whether the customer is a large hospital system or a retail chain, Stericycle provides multiple services to help them improve their operations and achieve their goals. As customers adopt these multiple services, they can almost triple their revenues in the long run.Stericycle has also closed the acquisition of information destruction services provider Shred-it International for $2.3 billion in cash from Cintas Corporation  and its other partners. With Shred-it on board, Stericycle is expected to enhance its core compliance solutions portfolio and offer specialized services, thereby augmenting its value proposition to clients. The transaction is anticipated to result in cost synergies to the tune of $20-$30 million by 2018, leading to accretive earnings. Earnings per share is expected to increase by at least 10% in 2016 and by the high-teens in 2018, generating robust cash flow and over $1 billion in EBITDA in 2016 through improved margins and debt repayment.We believe that the current acquisition will serve this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock in good stead, expand its global client base and generate incremental revenues.A couple of stocks in the broader Industrial Goods sector that are worth a look include Waste Management, Inc.  and CBIZ, Inc.  , both carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"nvestors in Cintas Corporation (Symbol: CTAS) saw new options begin trading this week, for the January 2016 expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CTAS options chain for the new January 2016 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $90.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.70. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $90.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $88.30 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CTAS, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $91.97/share today.Because the $90.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of CTAS stock at the current price level of $91.97/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $92.50. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 3.08% if the stock gets called away at the January 2016 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CTAS shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Cintas Corporation, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing CTAS's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $92.50 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $92.50 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

taying true to its commitment for sustainability initiatives and cleaner environment, premier waste management firm  recently expanded its compressed natural gas (CNG) fleet in the greater Phoenix area by adding four solid waste collection trucks. The natural gas vehicles replaced diesel-powered trucks in the region to bring the tally of cleaner and environment-friendly vehicles in Arizona to 34.CNG is arguably the cleanest fuel available for heavy-duty vehicles. Vehicles that run on CNG emit almost zero particulate emissions and reduce smog-producing nitrogen oxide emissions by 50% relative to diesel trucks. For every vehicle that is converted to natural gas, the use of diesel fuel is cut by about 8,000 gallons per year on an average. This decreases greenhouse gas emissions per truck by more than 22 metric tons per year. Additionally, it offers cost advantages over traditional fuels and enables vehicles to make less noise than those running on diesel.Furthermore, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) data, deployment of a new CNG collection truck is equivalent to planting over 600 mature trees each year. Republic Services operates 178 collection trucks within the Phoenix area and about 280 across Arizona. Based on EPA calculations, Republic Services' CNG powered fleet in Arizona is likely to significantly reduce carbon emissions and the benefits achieved from it is equivalent to planting 20,400 mature trees. Across the country, the company operates a fleet of more than 2,200 CNG vehicles and 38 natural gas fuelling stations, saving approximately 18 million gallons of diesel fuel annually.Republic Services is the second-largest domestic non-hazardous solid waste company in the U.S. It provides non-hazardous solid waste disposal services for commercial, industrial, municipal and residential customers through a network of collection companies. The company is presently focusing on a series of high-quality acquisition opportunities, primarily of recycling assets that have the potential to drive healthy long-term growth in its top 25 markets. Republic Services operates 66 recycling centers globally and processes roughly 5 million tons of recyclable material annually.Republic Services currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the industry include Waste Management, Inc.  , Cintas Corporation  and Exponent Inc  , each carrying a Zacks Rank # 2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

remium aerospace component maker,  has penned a deal to acquire Breeze-Eastern Corporation for approximately $206 million in cash. As per the agreement, TransDigm will make a tender offer of $19.61 per share to Breeze-Eastern for purchasing its all of the outstanding shares by Dec 3, 2015.Post-acquisition, Breeze-Eastern will operate as an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of TransDigm. Whippany, N.J.-based Breeze-Eastern possesses expertise in offering lifting and pulling devices for all types of military and civilian aircraft. The company, having over 170 employees, is a pioneer in manufacturing of proprietary rescue hoists, winches and cargo hooks and weapons-handling systems equipment.Breeze-Eastern boasts a customer base comprising of top-notch firms like The Boeing Company  , Sikorsky, AgustaWestland, Airbus as well as the U.S. government. The company serves different platforms like Airbus A400M transport, HH-65 Dolphin, UH-60 Blackhawk and CH-47 Chinook. Notably, Breeze-Eastern has huge exposure to military markets, with roughly 75% of revenues garnered from there.For some time, TransDigm has been eyeing proprietary aerospace businesses with strong aftermarket scope, as 90% of its net sales are generated by proprietary engineered products. Since 70% of Breeze-Eastern's revenues are reaped from aftermarket sales, this acquisition will likely augment TransDigm's top line, going forward.Additionally, this buyout mirrors the company's prudent strategy of bolstering its foothold in the niche markets of highly engineered proprietary aerospace components. We believe such deals, being in sync with the company's core operating strategies, bode well for the long term.TransDigm currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Shutterstock photoI nvestors concerned with limiting risk while building wealth over time should take a look at big-cap stockPaychex (  ). The provider of payroll and human resources services is benefiting from steady job growth and an increase in clients seeking help in navigating ObamaCare reforms.The stock is up 17% this year, easily outperforming the S&P 500, which is up only slightly. Paychex is at a new high and in a buying range above a 51.82 buy point of a long base.In addition, Paychex boasts a respectable long-term dividend growth rate of 6%. The current annual payout of $1.68 a share works out to an annualized yield of about 3%, above the S&P 500 average of around 2%.Paychex has a Composite Rating of 94, based on five IBD metrics. That rating puts it among the leaders in the Commercial Services-Outsourcing industry group, which has risen 22 places in the past six weeks to No. 41 out of 197 as of Wednesday's IBD.Cintas (  ), a supplier of company uniforms, is probably Paychex's closest competitor in the group. It boasts a Composite Rating of 90, a whopping 64% long-term dividend growth rate and solid stock-price gains this year.But the key word for Paychex is stability. It leads the group with a five-year Earnings Stability Factor of 1 on a scale of zero to 99, with zero being most stable. Profit in the fiscal year that ends in May is expected to rise 10% to $2.04 a share, followed the next year by an 8% increase, equal to the company's three-year earnings growth rate.Furthermore, its annual pretax margin of nearly 39% and return on equity of about 38% dwarfs Cintas' and suggests that Paychex has the firepower to keep raising its dividend.Paychex most recently raised its quarterly payout on July 9, a hike of 4 cents or 11%, to 42 cents a share. Also, while many companies slashed their dividends during the 2008-09 recession, Paychex held its steady -- and Cintas actually raised its own.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Top Dividend Stock Paychex Rewards Patient Investors@2015-11-18@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/top-dividend-stock-paychex-rewards-patient-investors-2015-11-18

Additionally, a stronger U.S. dollar hurt revenues by $7.9 million compared with the third quarter of 2014.Gross profit went up 67.7% to $18.3 million from $10.9 million reported last year. Gross margin increased 240 basis points (bps) to 18.9%. Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) increased to $13.3 million from $6.9 million in the year-ago quarter. Operating income was $3.7 million, compared with $3.4 million in the prior-year period. Operating margin declined 140 bps year over year to 3.8%.Adjusted EBITDA (Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) was $7 million, up 55% from $4.5 million in the year-ago quarter. EBITDA margin was 7.2% compared with 6.8% in the prior-year quarter.Manitex ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $4.4 million, flat with the 2014-end level. The company reported cash used for operations of $5.5 million in the nine months ended Sep 30, 2015, compared with $1.7 million in the comparable period last year.Manitex's total debt increased to $195.6 million as of Sep 30, 2015 from $112.3 million as of Dec 31, 2014. The company reported total backlog of $88.9 million as of Sep 30, 2015, down 12.9% from $102.1 million as on Sep 30, 2014.Manitex remains optimistic and prepared for a change in the cycle and product demand. The company also continues to focus on integration and execution of new acquisitions along with the strengthening of its balance sheet.On Nov 9, Manitex's subsidiary PM Group opened a subsidiary, PM Middle East, in the Jebel Ali Free Zone in Dubai, strengthening its presence in the region. The expansion of PM into this new region will provide the opportunity to grow the customer base. PM's growing international presence will help it to cross-sell its products and thereby drive growth.Manitex reduced its debt by $23.1 million since the beginning of 2015 and expects to further improving the debt ratios before the year ends.Bridgeview, IL-based Manitex International is a leading provider of engineered lifting solutions including boom truck and rough terrain cranes, rough terrain forklifts, special mission oriented vehicles, container handling equipment and specialized trailers.Manitex currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

When you think of industrials, it’s easy to think of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. But that index takes a very narrow view of this important sector.None of the seven industrials with great fundamentals that we feature here — Northrup Grumman (NOC), National Presto (NPK), Southwest Airlines (LUV), Cintas (CTAS), AMERCO (UHAL), AO Smith (AOS) and Matson (MATX) — aren’t in the average.And where the DJIA is basically breakeven for the year-to-date, these stocks average a 33% gain, with much more to come.As the economy improves, these are the firms that will be on the leading edge of that rebound. They’re already doing well through difficult times; imagine how well they will perform when the economy is easier to navigate.And all these companies are focused on the U.S. economy, so a strong dollar won’t have much effect on their earnings. And those that do have exposure abroad have used to leverage growth and diversify market risk. It’s icing on the cake.Northrup Grumman (NOC) is one of the nation’s leading defense contractors. And the biggest recent news for the company is that it won the next-generation bomber contract, beating out competitors Boeing () and Lockheed Martin ().The long-term contract for the new Long Range Strike Bomber (LRS-B) is for 100 planes with a total value of $60 billion to 80 billion. Of course, BA is already protesting the decision, but if anything happens, it won’t hurt NOC. BA will try to get a secondary contract, citing national security issues for concentrating such a major project in one firm’s hands.But NOC earned the contract, having built the B1 and B2 stealth bombers and establishing itself as one of the leaders in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for the armed services, particularly the Navy and Air Force.Beyond this headline win, NOC is a key partner on the new F-35 fighter and has a number of crucial UAV contracts. The UAV sector is one of the key growth sectors in most of the armed services’ budgets going forward. NOC is the best play on new automated military.National Presto (NPK) is an interesting company. It has had the likes of value investors extraordinaire Warren Buffett and Benjamin Graham as investors. It’s a debt-free firm in a debt-laden world. And it combines three sectors that hardly seem like they would work as one company — household products, ammunition and absorbent products (adult incontinence products).Yes, that’s quite a heady mix, but somehow NPK is making it work. It’s up 54% year-to-date even as naysayers have been trying to say why this bumblebee can’t fly.It has had problems with its absorbent products division, and many say that management has focused too much money and energy trying to get that division to work while not using that time on energy for the two other growing sectors.But the fact is, the household goods and ammunition divisions are doing very well without much time and energy. And the company pays a special dividend of around 7% that most analysts don’t talk about.What’s more, high insider ownership of the stock means that management has its money where its mouth is. They don’t make money unless the company is making money. That’s always an encouraging sign.Southwest Airlines (LUV) is so successful, it’s hard to believe it’s actually an airline.Its Q3 numbers released in late October were very impressive. Earnings continue to rise, and it expanded capacity without sacrificing profitabilty. As a matter of fact, monthly load factor rose, as did year-to-date load factor.The number of trips flown and the length of the trips also increased. Given the low fuel prices, this helped boost revenue growth by almost 11%.LUV is near its 52-week highs but its reasonably priced. And because it continues to be the most liked discount airline, it will continue to pull passengers, even when pricing becomes more of a challenge.As the industry consolidates, LUV has found a very strong brand that it can succeed with for many years to come. It has battled through much tougher times than these and continues to operate from a position of strength inside its sector and in the industry in general.Cintas (CTAS) continues to make mundane sectors fun for investors. Fundamentally, it supplies what it calls corporate identity uniform programs. It also provides logo mats, restroom supplies, as well as first aid, safety and fire protection products and services.CTAS is kind of a corporate drycleaner and cleaning service all wrapped into one. You have certainly seen its trucks dispatched from one of its 400 distribution centers across the U.S. and Canada deliver uniforms to hospitals, hotels, restaurants and any number of other businesses around virtually every town in America.It even runs a contest for  where people vote on their favorite commercial bathrooms. The contest just ended and the 2015 winner will be announced soon.But beyond all this, CTAS stock is rock-solid. And while it isn’t going to be a double-digit grower, Cintas is very dependable, quarter after quarter, year after year.Amerco (UHAL) is another ubiquitous North American company that doesn’t really get much respect on Wall Street.This year has been a big one for UHAL, up 43% year-to-date. But it isn’t necessarily that more people are using the rental trucks and storage units. They are, but the real story here is the other divisions that aren’t always as obvious as the trucks and storage buildings.Amerco also operates a property & casualty insurance business and a life insurance company.These businesses are important because insurance companies essentially hold big piles of cash in short-term investments like U.S. Treasuries. If claims are made, they can liquidate those positions easily and pay off the claims.When interest rates rise, it means the insurance companies make more money off of the cash. And UHAL will certainly be hauling in a lot more cash when the Fed decides to hike rates.AO Smith (AOS) makes water heaters.Now that doesn’t sound like the kind of business where you want to put your growth capital to work, but it’s actually a very good long-term growth investment.The water heater business is especially attractive when you are one of the top consumer and commercial water heater makers and you sell into growing home-owning economies like China and India.This is one company on the list that is seeing significant growth beyond U.S. borders. In AOS’s most recent quarter, China sales rose 11%. U.S. sales rose 6%. And overall revenue was up 45% year-over-year.Water heaters aren’t fancy, but they are important products. And whether you’re in a developing nation or a developed one, access to hot water is important. AOS is growing along with the global economy.Matson (MATX) has been in the shipping business for 130 years. This Hawaii-based firm started shipping goods from the mainland U.S. to Hawaii, which was very good business and continues to be a solid revenue source.Since then, it has grown a major international shipping and logistics firm. It recently expanded operations to Alaska, which has been very helpful in recent quarters.When economies are strong, shipping is a great place to be. And when the holiday season arrives, it’s also a cyclically strong time for shippers, as goods begin to flow from Asian manufacturers to North American consumers.Given the improving U.S. economy, this should be a strong season as well as bullish long-term trend. And given MATX’s long experience in the industry, it’s no surprise the company is coming off another strong quarter. And the stock is up 50% year-to-date with a 10% bump in just the past week because of its recent quarterly numbers.MATX is taking off.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@7 Industrials With Great Fundamentals@2015-11-09@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-industrials-great-fundamentals-2015-11-09

Net sales declined roughly 3.1% due to a strong U.S. dollar, which also reduced the value of the company's international sales. However, Middleby's recently executed acquisitions more than offset the currency impact, supporting the quarterly sales by 11.5%.Middleby's cost of sales in the quarter rose 12.4% year over year to $271.8 million, representing 60.5% of total revenue.Gross profit margin decreased 70 basis points (bps) year over year to 39.5%, mainly due to lower margins from the Commercial Foodservice Equipment Group business.Selling and distribution expenses totaled $44.5 million, up 5.9% year over year.

" shocked investors this week when it reported subpar results after the closing bell on Thursday. Revenue and earnings came in well below the company's guidance when it was unable to clean up after being affected by weak foreign currencies, lower hazardous-waste volumes, and higher unanticipated expenses.
  
Data source: Stericycle.  Stericycle came up quite a bit short of its history and  this quarter. CEO Charlie Alutto led off the company's conference call discussing the results by saying that:While Alutto is positive on the company's longer-term fundamentals, he's not quite so bullish in the short term. In the question-and-answer session of the call he warned that ""we think that the slowdown which we saw accelerate in the third quarter is going to actually get worse in fourth quarter and then level off in 2016."" The big unknown is that given the fact that the company didn't see the slowdown coming in the first place, it really remains to be seen if volumes will indeed level off next year as it now expects to see.With the weakness in industrial waste, it does seem like the company's recently closed acquisition of information destruction services provider Shred-it International from  and its partners is a smart play. Not only will it enable the company to move away from a weak spot in the market, but it gives it another market to drive growth. In discussing that transaction on the call, CFO Brent Arnold said, ""The acquisition team is off to a quick start, driving operational synergies and laying the groundwork for long-term growth."" In addition, management pointed out that it was especially excited about the cross-selling opportunities given that less than 20% of its current customers utilize Shred-It, which is a number they expect to increase in the future.One thing that's worth noting is that Cintas never really fully integrated Shred-It into its business because it was an investment that Cintas co-owned with other partners. So, it will be interesting to see how the business performs now that it is under new management that is focused on integrating it into its service offerings to customers.Stericycle's management team also provided insight into its current guidance for 2015 and its preliminary guidance for 2016. The company expects to generate revenue approaching $3 billion this year, with non-GAAP earnings in a range of $4.38 to $4.41 per share. That's a bit muted from its previous guidance due to the weakness in industrial hazardous waste.However, looking ahead to 2016, it sees growth resuming, thanks in part to the addition of Shred-It. For the full year, the company forecasts revenue in the $3.65 billion-$3.72 billion range, with non-GAAP earnings growing to a range of $5.28 to $5.35 per share.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

The company will incur pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $65 million, most of which will represent cash costs, reflecting a $10 million increase from its prior guidance. The increase is due to further cost reduction actions planned as part of the business model transformation underway within Retail Branding and Information Solutions (RBIS) segment.Avery Dennison's new strategy for RBIS is focused on accelerating growth through a more regionally-driven business model that is more competitive, faster, and less complex. The company is implementing a multi-year plan to streamline decision-making and eliminate management layers, while further consolidating its manufacturing footprint, to reduce costs across the global organization.For 2016, Avery Dennison projects pre-tax savings (net of transition costs) of approximately $60 million from restructuring actions within RBIS. The execution of these actions will allow the business to be more competitive in the less differentiated segments of the market, which will help achieve RBIS' financial targets, including an operating margin of 10% to 11% by 2018.At present, Avery carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks worth considering in the same sector are Advanced Emissions Solutions, Inc.  , Belden Inc.  and Cintas Corporation  .

remium industrial goods company  reported robust results for fourth-quarter fiscal 2015.Quarterly adjusted earnings (with stock-based compensation adjustments) came in at $2.73 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.01 by 35.8%.On the other hand, reported earnings for the quarter came in at $2.50 per share, which was higher than the year-ago quarter figure of $1.91 per share.Better-than-expected results were driven by a rise in net sales and strong performance of proprietary products. However, earnings were partially offset by an increase in interest expenses and certain acquisition-based costs.For full-year fiscal 2015, earnings came in at $9.01 per share compared with $7.76 reported at fiscal 2014-end.Net sales for the quarter were $809.8 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 26.1%. The top line also exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $798 million.The year-over-year increase in net sales was attributable to solid contribution from the acquired firms - Telair Cargo Group and the aerospace businesses of Franke Aquarotter GmbH and Pexco LLC. About $139.1 million of the net sales were garnered from these buyouts, while the rest was reaped from organic sales.For full-year fiscal 2015, net sales amounted to $2707.1 million compared with $2372.9 million earned in the prior year.TransDigm's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) escalated 24.7% year over year to $363 million.During the quarter under review, TransDigm completed the acquisition of PneuDraulics, Inc. for $325 million.TransDigm ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $714 million compared with $819.5 million as of Sep 30, 2014.

"ividend investors thrive on stocks that make rising payouts over time, and with conditions in the U.S. economy as favorable as they've been lately, hundreds of companies have recently been able to reward their shareholders with higher dividends. Yet even amid the large group of  making payout increases, a few still stand out for the size of their increases and the consistency of their dividend growth over the long run.In the following slideshow, you'll learn how  ,  , and  have given their shareholders higher dividend payouts going forward. In addition, you'll learn a little bit more about the business prospects these companies have, in order to help you and other dividend investors figure out whether the payout increases they've made are sustainable or represent just a flash in the pan that could easily give way to reversals in the future.If you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings. But a handful of little-known ""Social Security secrets"" could help ensure a boost in your retirement income. In fact, one MarketWatch reporter argues that if more Americans knew about this, the government would have to shell out an extra $10 billion annually. For example: one easy, 17-minute trick could pay you as much as $15,978 more... each year!

"he days are getting shorter, and the temperatures lower as we start heading toward winter. Yet there's plenty of sun shining on investors in select companies, as we saw a number of dividend hikes last week related to earnings season.It was one of those weeks when there were too many stocks to choose from among the blowing leaves. So I've grabbed three of the more intriguing ones floating in the air, which are:Among our current trio,  , a provider of uniforms and other products and services for corporate clients, enacted the highest dividend raise in terms of percentage. It boosted its annual payout nearly 24% to $1.05 per share.That's entirely in character for Cintas, as it's one of the few, the proud, the dividend aristocrats. This is a small, exclusive club of stocks that have lifted their distributions at least once annually for a minimum of 25 years running. data by Doing so this time around probably wasn't too tough for the company. Its most recently reported quarter was successful, with top and bottom lines beating expectations. The former saw a 9% annual rise to almost $1.2 billion, exceeding the average analyst forecast of $1.17 billion, while the latter was $106 million ($0.93 per share, versus a projection of $0.90).Meanwhile, free cash flow has risen considerably over the years, topping $480 million in fiscal 2015. That year, Cintas paid a total of just over $200 million in dividends ... and those included a special payout that, when combined with the regular dividend, totaled well above the current $1.05 per share. So the company can easily afford its new payout, and then some.Cintas' upcoming dividend is to be paid on Dec. 4 to shareholders of record as of Nov. 6.Also landing -- albeit barely -- in the double-digit percentage raise club is this paper and pulp company.  increased its quarterly distribution by 10% to $0.44 per share.Although not an aristocrat, the company is a habitual dividend payer, having doled them out consistently for nearly 70 years.This latest boost, however, came not long after International Paper reported a decline in revenue, and increased spending on capital projects in its most recently reported quarter. Those factors overshadowed other, more positive developments, such as a net profit that rose 41% on a year-over-year basis to $227 million.The company's free cash flow figure has swung around violently over the past few quarters, landing $239 million in the red in that quarter. Yet if we look at that figure on an annual basis, it has hovered within a more consistent range over the past few years, from just over $1.5 billion to a little more than $1.8 billion. data by Meanwhile, the total dividend payouts over that stretch ranged from $427 million to $620 million, amounts that were comfortably below free cash flow and thus easily affordable. The company's recent bottom line performance bodes well for the development of free cash flow, which should be able to at least support the dividend going into the proximate future.International Paper's upcoming dividend is to be paid on Dec. 15 to shareholders of record as of Nov. 16.Shifting to the energy sector,  , a master limited partnership, has declared a 13% increase in its quarterly distribution to just under $0.60 per unit.That was the good news.

In Q3 2014, those figures came in a bit higher, at $217 million and $20.2 million, respectively. data by Hopefully, a set of recent asset acquisitions -- it has accumulated a few of late -- will improve those numbers significantly. The partnership certainly believes they will; due to these buys, the partnership now says it expects to post attributable EBITDA of $185 million to $190 million for 2015. Previously, it had anticipated the range would be $169 million to $179 million.The partnership's business has a solid foundation, and it has been expanding thanks to those asset additions.

I've got 15 stocks that have popped up on my breakout screen today. When the market is falling apart, I don't get 15 stocks on the radar, I get one or two tops. That tells me there are plenty of pockets of this market that are taking off and looking to hit new highs.

Advance operates over 5,200 stores, over 100 Worldpac branches and serves approximately 1,300 independently owned Carquest branded stores in the United States, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Canada.Shares of Advance auto have led the charge since bottomed out in April near $140. The August volatility pulled shares down from what was then a 52-week high over $190. The rough market in September saw the stock trade in the $170s yet it still maintained a bullish tilt by trading above its 50-day moving average for most of the month. Killer earnings helped shares spike up to new highs where it sits today, a few percentage points shy of $200.Chemtura is a global specialty chemicals company with leading positions in diversified markets. They build the chemistry that makes other products more durable, safer, cleaner and more efficient. Major industries served include transportation, building & construction, and energy & electronics. They are committed to global sustainability and engineering chemical solutions that meet their customers' evolving needs.This stock has been butting up against resistance at the 52-week just below $31 for the last week or so. An overbought commodity channel index came down a tick as shares retreated from the highs to support just below $30. That level held for CHMT, giving us very bullish footing here.

Its Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products segment rents and services uniforms and other garments, including flame resistant clothing, mats, mops and shop towels, and other ancillary items; and provides restroom cleaning services and supplies, and carpet and tile cleaning services.While a few of these other charts have been setting up for a breakout, shares of CTAS are breaking out right now. The top just below $90 was met with a week of heavy selling in late August that tested the bottom end of the range for most of the year down near $80. Buyers stepped in and have since pushed shares on through to new highs above $91.

Save for a month long consolidation in September shares have either been rallying or retracing all year long. The latest rally this month through the highs to just below $30 may be stalling out here a little bit. With the CCI coming back from 300 to 112, I think I'd wait a day or two and try to get a fill closer to $29 even.MaxLinear, Inc. is a provider of highly integrated, radio-frequency analog and mixed-signal semiconductor solutions for broadband communications applications.

After a steady run from late 2014 to June of this year, shares of MXL retraced down to a key Fibonacci retracement level in August. Finding buyers and bouncing there, this next leg higher approaches the previous peak. A breakout here would mean a potential intermediate price target above $18. You do have to be careful of a reversal at these levels as well though with the CCI nearing 200.Don't believe the hype.

aste management firm  recently completed the acquisition of information destruction services provider Shred-it International from business services provider  and its other partners for $2.3 billion in cash. Shred-it will operate now as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Stericycle.Since its inception in 1988, Shred-it emerged as one of the leading paper shredding companies in the world, offering service to over 400,000 customers in 15 different countries. The company specializes in tailored document destruction services that allow businesses to comply with legislation, while ensuring that confidential business information is kept secure at all times. For the 12-month period ending March 2015, Shred-it generated pro forma revenues of $726 million.In April 2014, Cintas completed the divestiture of its Document Shredding business by forming a new partnership with the shareholders of Shred-it. The two companies merged to create a new firm that operated under the Shred-it name. Cintas had a 42% ownership stake in this entity, while the remaining 58% was owned by the shareholders of Shred-it.Incorporated in 1989 and headquartered in Lake Forest, IL, Stericycle is a leading provider of regulated medical waste management and product recall and return services in the U.S. It operates a national medical waste management network that caters to medical schools, hospitals, and other healthcare providers.Medical waste includes single-use disposables like needles, syringes, gloves, and other supplies that have been in contact with blood or other body fluids, blood products and other items that can spread infection. The company operates in the U.S., Argentina, Canada, Mexico, Chile, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Romania, with a spread-out network of processing or combined processing and collection sites.With Shred-it on board, Stericycle is expected to enhance its core compliance solutions portfolio, thereby fuelling its future growth opportunities. The strategic purchase will expand its operational infrastructure and enable it to capitalize on route-based logistics know-how. The acquisition is likely to create a new operational platform for Stericycle and offer specialized services, thereby augmenting its value proposition to clients.The transaction is anticipated to result in cost synergies to the tune of $20-$30 million by 2018, leading to accretive earnings. Earnings per share is expected to increase by at least 10% in 2016 and by the high-teens in 2018, generating robust cash flow and over $1 billion in EBITDA in 2016 through improved margins and debt repayment.A significant portion of Stericycle's historical growth is attributable to the successful integration of acquisitions in both domestic and international markets. The company is continuously on the lookout for strategic acquisitions that will enhance its market share and expand its geographic base. We believe that the current acquisition will also serve the company in good stead, expanding its global client base and generating incremental revenues.Stericycle currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

"e are all surfers in search of that perfect wave but it keeps eluding us. One rides a wave on the hope that it is the best the ocean has to offer and that it will carry you all the way to shore.Similarly, momentum investors try to find the perfect stock to ride on the highs. The momentum investment strategy assumes that stocks that have performed well in the past will hold onto that impetus and ensure a smooth ride into the future as well. It also believes that the low-performing stocks have a tendency to be true to their name. Basically, it means that trends exist and they persist.As such, momentum stocks tend to be the high-performing ones that have delivered gains in the past and continue to hold promise.It is true that finding a momentum stock is a much easy task in a raging bull market but rough tides often have more thrills in the offing. The challenge is to sail on the crest of one wave and jump onto the next before it crashes. Momentum investing can be profitable but timing is of utmost importance here.However, nothing comes easily in life. Momentum investing generally involves more risk as it deals in high-return stocks. Some investors are also of the opinion that past performance does not guarantee future growth. Even Warren Buffet had once said, ""The investor of today does not profit from yesterday's growth.""Is momentum investing risky? Yes. Should you avoid this strategy then? No. Momentum investment is not necessarily for everyone but cautious investments are likely to deliver desired results. Betting on stocks just based on their price movement would be foolhardy. But when the filter of fundamentals is added to this, the risk level is somewhat checked.There is no perfect way to ride a wave. But if you master the art of surfing, even rough waters become smoother.Here is where our new  comes into play. It takes into account many factors including volume change and performance relative to its peers and thus makes stock picking for momentum investors a much easier task. Back-tested results show that stocks with Style Scores of 'A' or 'B' when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) offer the best upside potential.Below is a list of stocks that not only carry a favorable Zacks Rank #1 or #2 but also boast a momentum score of 'A'. These stocks have beaten the S&P this year and are trading near their 52-week highs. The ones that remain near their highs are even more remarkable in markets like this and are noteworthy.Moreover, these stocks have witnessed positive earnings estimate revisions for the full year over the past few weeks, suggesting that brokerage firms are bullish on these stocks as we move into the fourth and final quarter of the year.Here we present four such stocks that are nice additions for your portfolio at this point:Long Island City, New York based  is a passenger carrier that that focuses on providing high-quality customer service. The low-fare, low-cost carrier operates primarily on point-to-point routes. Continuous route expansion, higher codesharing agreements and innovative service launches will likely continue to act as catalyst for the company.Zacks Rank #1Increase in share price (YTD): 63%EPS Surprise (trailing 4 quarter average): 3%Change in Full-Year Estimate Revision (over 60-days): 3.3%Year-over-year earnings growth: 167.5% (vs industry average of 8.6%) provides passengers and cargo air transportation services primarily in the United States.

any investors like to look for momentum in stocks, but this can be very tough to define. There is great debate regarding which metrics are the best to focus on in this regard, and which are not really quality indicators of future performance. Fortunately, with our new  we have identified the key statistics to pay close attention to and thus which stocks might be the best for momentum investors in the near term.This method discovered several great candidates for momentum-oriented investors, but today let's focus in on  (  ) as this stock is looking especially impressive right now. And while there are numerous ways in which this company could be a great choice, we have highlighted three of the most vital reasons for CTAS's status as a solid momentum stock below:While any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics-such as performance over the past three months or year-- and comparing these to an industry at large can be very useful.And in the case of CTAS, the results are quite impressive. Cintas has beaten out the industry at large over the past 12 weeks by a margin of 1.1% to negative 2.2% while it has also outperformed when looking at the past year, putting up a gain of 30.6%. Clearly, CTAS is riding a bit of a hot streak and is worth a closer look by investors.While looking at price performance or full year earnings can be essential to understanding a momentum stock, you shouldn't forget about the current quarter EPS and the trend in estimates there. This change can signal how a stock might perform in the next earnings season which is obviously vital for momentum investors.Right now, CTAS is seeing a nice trend over the past month when it comes to this quarter's earnings estimate projections. In the time frame, EPS estimates for Cintas have gone up by 0.4% compared to an industry average move of 0.0%, suggesting that not only is CTAS heading in the right direction, but it is seeing an increase relative to the industry too.While the great momentum factors outlined in the preceding paragraphs might be enough for some investors, we should also take into account broad earnings estimate revision trends. A nice path here can really help to show us a promising stock, and we have actually been seeing that with CTAS as of late too.Over the past two months, 8 earnings estimates have gone higher compared to none lower for the full year, while we are also seeing 8 upward revisions for the next year compared to none lower in the same time frame. These revisions have helped to boost the consensus estimate as two months ago CTAS was expected to post earnings of $3.83 per  share for the full year, though today it looks to have EPS of $3.89 for the full year now, representing a solid increase which is something that should definitely be welcomed news to would-be investors.Given these factors, investors shouldn't be surprised to note that we have CTAS as a security with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)  and a Momentum Score of 'A'.  So if you are looking for a fresh pick that has potential to move in the right direction, definitely keep CTAS on your short list as this looks be a stock that is very well-positioned to soar in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

n Sep 29, Zacks  updated the research report on waste management firm  .A significant portion of Stericycle's historical growth is attributable to the successful integration of acquisitions in both domestic and international markets. The company is continuously on the lookout for strategic acquisitions that will grow market share and expand its geographic base. The acquisition pool of the company remains robust in multiple geographies and lines of business. International growth rates are expected to accelerate due to increasing customer adoption of multiple services and expansion into new lines of business.The global acquisition strategy increases Stericycle's customer base, by providing a long-term growth platform for selling multiple services. Whether the customer is a large hospital system or a retail chain, Stericycle provides multiple services to help them improve their operations and achieve their goals. As customers adopt these multiple services, they can almost triple their revenues in the long run.Stericycle has recently inked a definitive agreement with business services provider Cintas Corporation  and its other partners to acquire information destruction services provider Shred-it International for $2.3 billion in cash. With Shred-it on board, Stericycle is expected to enhance its core compliance solutions portfolio and offer specialized services, thereby augmenting its value proposition to clients. The transaction is anticipated to result in cost synergies to the tune of $20-$30 million by 2018, leading to accretive earnings. Earnings per share is expected to increase by at least 10% in 2016 and by the high-teens in 2018, generating robust cash flow and over $1 billion in EBITDA in 2016 through improved margins and debt repayment.The transaction is likely to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2015, subject to the fulfilment of customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. Post-acquisition, Shred-it will operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Stericycle. We believe that the current acquisition will serve this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock in good stead, expand its global client base and generate incremental revenues.A couple of stocks in the broader Industrial Goods sector that are worth a look include Graham Corporation  and Graco Inc.  , both carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

remium diversified machinery company,  is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2015 results before the opening bell on Sep 30. Over the last four trailing quarters, the company reported a negative average earnings surprise of 2.26%. However, in third-quarter fiscal 2015, the company reported earnings of 63 cents per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 18.9%. Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Actuant holds a high brand value in the market. Backed by certain strategic initiatives associated with growth and cost savings, the company aims to generate superior results in the to-be reported quarter. Further, the company's capital deployment policy reflects a strong cash position. However, the company remains aware of the fact that new contracts and acquisitions can only enhance its top-line results from fiscal 2016 onward.Also, Actuant anticipates external market headwinds such as strong U.S. dollar and lower demand in the general industrial, oil & gas, mining and agricultural markets to adversely affect its financial performance in the quarter under review.Based on the current scenario, the company expects sales in the range of $290-300 million and earnings within 26-31 cents for fourth-quarter fiscal 2015. For full-year 2015, Actuant projects revenues in a range of $1.24-1.25 billion; while lowering its earnings guidance range to $1.55-1.60 per share from the previous projection of $1.65-$1.75.Our proven model does not conclusively state that Actuant is likely to beat earnings in the quarter under review. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) for an earnings beat. That is not the case here as we will see below. Actuant has a 0.00% Earnings ESP for the quarter, as the Most Accurate estimate of 28 cents stands in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Actuant's Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) when combined with a 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Cintas Corporation  , with an Earnings ESP of +1.00% and a Zacks Rank #2.NN Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +2.86% and a Zacks Rank #2.Allegion plc Ordinary Shares  , with an Earnings ESP of +1.30% and a Zacks Rank #3.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

n Sep 30, Zacks  updated the research report on business services provider  .Cintas started fiscal 2016 on a strong note by recording solid first-quarter results on the back of healthy top-line growth. The company reported first-quarter fiscal 2016 (ended Aug 31, 2015) net income of $106.2 million or 93 cents per share compared with $105.9 million or 89 cents per share in the year-earlier quarter. The reported earnings for the quarter comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents.Quarterly revenues increased 8.8% year over year to $1,198.9 million and exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,174 million. Organic growth for the reported quarter was healthy at 6.8%. The superior top-line performance was primarily attributable to the addition of newer customers and higher penetration of existing customers through better and innovative products and services.Cintas aims to continually achieve revenue build-up by increasing penetration levels at existing customers and broadening customer base to include business segments that are not historically served. The company also identifies additional product and service opportunities for its current and future customers to expand its product portfolio and ensure solid organic revenue growth. For augmenting its long-term margins, Cintas is focusing more on its core competency areas by expanding its businesses across key regions. Additionally, the company's newly-introduced customized product range is successfully catering to the needs of its clients.During the quarter, Cintas acquired ZEE Medical -- a van-based provider of occupational first aid and safety products, training and services, for approximately $134 million in cash. The strategic move by the company was aimed to expand its presence in North America in the first aid, safety, training and emergency products. This acquisition is expected to be accretive to future earnings and also likely to generate annual revenues of $110 million to $120 million. With this acquisition, the company identifies additional product and service opportunities for its current and future customers to expand its geographical footprint.Consequently, Cintas revised its guidance and expects fiscal 2016 revenues in the range of $4.80 billion to $4.88 billion, up 7.2%-9% year over year. Earnings from continuing operations are expected to be within $3.79-$3.88 per share, which represents a year-over-year improvement of 13.1%-15.8%.Over the years, the company has consistently returned significant cash to its shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The company's investment strategy takes a holistic view of the rapidly evolving market and deploys a dynamic capital allocation approach to focus on the relative value of the various sectors within the broader industry. We remain encouraged by such focused attempts of the company to maintain a steady growth curve.Cintas currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Some other stocks in the broader industry include FTI Consulting, Inc.  , The Hackett Group, Inc.  and Lionbridge Technologies Inc.  , each carrying the same Zacks Rank as Cintas.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

n Sep 24, Zacks  updated the research report on leading comprehensive waste management services provider  .Waste Management is executing well on its initiatives to refocus on the core business activities and instil price and cost discipline to achieve better margins. The company aims to focus on improving customer retention by providing better service and higher value solutions.At the same time, Waste Management's successful cost reduction initiatives have helped it in accomplishing remarkable gross margin expansion and EBITDA growth. The company is undertaking several steps to further boost its margins - one of which is by charging for recycling glass. Glass packaging is the third-largest market in the recycled material packaging segment, and is expected to grow at a steady pace in the coming quarters. With its new strategy, Waste Management stands to gain on two fronts - from the growth in the addressable market and also from the additional revenues arising from recycling glass.In the last reported quarter, the company completed the acquisition of Deffenbaugh Disposal, which is likely to be accretive to earnings going forward. The acquisition of Deffenbaugh at an undisclosed price will further help Waste Management to replace revenues lost from the divesture of Wheelabrator. With 1.7 million tons of waste and recyclable material collections in 2013, Deffenbaugh is a strategic fit for Waste Management and will enable it to focus on its core businesses. The transaction also enables Waste Management to extend its geographic footprint and make a foray in the attractive market of Kansas City, where it has limited presence.Furthermore, the company has a dominant market capitalization and a steady annual dividend policy. Waste Management plans to return significant cash to shareholders through healthy dividends and share repurchases in the future quarters as well. These initiatives boost shareholders' returns in the long term.Waste Management currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Other stocks that look promising and are worth a look in the broader Services Industry include Republic Services, Inc.  , The Hackett Group, Inc.  and Cintas Corporation  , each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

 is scheduled to report third-quarter 2015 results before the opening bell on Sep 3. Last quarter, the company posted a positive surprise of 6%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Our proven model shows that Greif is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. , which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate (42 cents) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate (41 cents), stands at +2.44%. This is very meaningful and a leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for the shares. Greif has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) and 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. The Sell-rated stocks (#4 and 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Greif's Zacks Rank #3 and +2.44% ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat.Although Greif reported dismal second-quarter results, we believe that this provider of industrial packaging products and services is poised to benefit from its strategic transformation plan that will allow it to better align resources. The company has sold its non-core assets and operations that are no longer in line with its business portfolio. This will be accretive to earnings and help in addressing capacity issues.Greif is also moving forward with its growth initiatives. The company is pursuing three investment opportunities in its paper operations with the installation of a modern shoe press at the Riverville, VA mill, an additional corrugating machine and a new specialty coating line in Massillon, OH. Further, solid progress is being achieved on the modernization and debottlenecking investments at the Riverville mill. Full installation will take place in the third quarter. This project will add an incremental 55,000 ton of annual container work capacity at Riverville.Here are some other stocks that you may want to consider as our model shows that they too, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Avery Dennison Corporation  has an earnings ESP of +1.19% and a Zacks Rank #3.Cintas Corporation  has an earnings ESP of +1.11% and a Zacks Rank #3.Heritage-Crystal Clean, Inc  has an earnings ESP of +18.18% and a Zacks Rank #3.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

eading business service provider  is scheduled to report its first-quarter fiscal 2016 results after the closing bell on Sep 24. In the last reported quarter, Cintas' adjusted earnings exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Cintas aims to continually achieve revenue buildup by increasing penetration levels at existing customers and broadening the customer base to include business segments that are not historically served. The company recently announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to sell its investment in Shred-it for approximately $550 million to $600 million before taxes.These proceeds will be in addition to the $180 million received at the closing of the partnership transaction and $113 million received in the form of a dividend from Shred-it. The divestiture is expected to rationalize operations and reap synergistic benefits in the long run.With a continued improvement in the pricing environment and higher operational efficiency, Cintas is expected to achieve broad-based revenue growth in the quarter. The company is also expected to capitalize on the growth prospects in the rental first aid and direct sale businesses. Leveraging its well-equipped infrastructure resources, Cintas aims to capitalize on its scale advantages to augment its competitiveness. Also, a more favorable pricing scenario and cost streamlining initiatives are expected to drive incremental margins.In addition, Cintas has a strong balance sheet with adequate liquidity to meet its working capital requirements. The company also generates strong operating cash flow, which helps maintain its cash reserves. The company has consistently returned cash to shareholders through stable dividend payouts and share repurchases. In addition, Cintas has easy access to commercial paper and long-term debt markets on favorable interest rate and other terms, which has historically provided it with rich sources of liquidity.Despite some solid fundamentals, our proven model does not conclusively show that Cintas is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key ingredients for a success recipe. Expected Surprise Prediction or  , which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is currently pegged at 0.00%. This mostly indicates a probable in-line earnings for the shares. Cintas' Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) when combined with a 0.00% ESP reduces the predictive power of ESP. Note that stocks with a Zacks Ranks of #1 (Strong Buy), #2 and #3 (Hold) have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. The Sell-rated stocks (#4 and #5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Delta Air Lines, Inc.  , earnings ESP of +2.38% and Zacks Rank #2.Constellation Brands Inc.  , earnings ESP of +3.05% and Zacks Rank #3.Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.  , earnings ESP of +6.17% and Zacks Rank #2.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

This segment recorded an organic growth of 10.5% and accounted for 8.3% of the company's revenues. Segment gross margin decreased to 42.3% in the reported quarter from 45.9% in the year-ago quarter due to conversion costs and amortization of intangible assets. The All Other segment recorded revenues of $161.0 million, representing 13.4% of the total revenue.Cintas has a solid financial position with adequate liquidity. At quarter end, cash and cash equivalents were $146.9 million, while long-term debt was $1.1 billion.Net cash from operating activities was $143.1 million for the reported quarter compared with $148.2 million in the prior year period.

The company currently has $381.8 million worth of shares available for repurchaseDuring the quarter, Cintas acquired ZEE Medical -- a van-based provider of occupational first aid and safety products, training and services, for approximately $134 million in cash.The strategic move by the company was aimed to expand its presence in North America in the first aid, safety, training and emergency products.

 is scheduled to release its second-quarter 2016 financial results on Sep 16, 2015. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 17.14%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Consolidated backlog at the end of the first quarter increased 22% year over year to $471 million. Regarding the timing, approximately 66% or $311 million of the backlog is to be delivered in fiscal 2016 and the balance 34% or around $160 million in fiscal 2017. The company expects strong backlog growth in the second quarter, driven by rising pipeline of project commitments and awards as well as a high level of bidding activity.Based on the double-digit revenue and earnings growth delivered in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, Apogee increased its earnings per share guidance range for the year to $2.10 to $2.25 from $2.05 to $2.20. The company continues to expect revenue growth of 10% to 15%. This outlook is based on continued strength of its backlog, commitments, and bidding and award activity, backed by industry forecasts of low double-digit growth for the commercial construction market sectors. Apogee expects to cross the $1 billion threshold in revenues in fiscal 2016. The momentum witnessed in the first quarter is expected to continue through the next three quarters as well.Apogee will benefit from improving architectural market conditions and is expecting double-digit architectural market growth through 2016. The company continues to focus on achieving top-line growth by introducing new products, expanding both in domestic and international markets, and entering new markets for its architectural and large-scale optical businesses.However, even though backlog is expected to grow over the course of fiscal 2016, growth rate will be moderate as growth in the architectural services segment, which is the largest contributor to backlog, is estimated to be in the mid to single-digit range. Nevertheless, the company is focused on margin expansion. The company's entry in the Brazilian architectural glass market exposes it to the soft economy in the region as well as to inherent risks associated with operations in foreign markets.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Apogee is likely to beat earnings as it lacks the required combination of two key ingredients, a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). : Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is at 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are at 50 cents per share. : Apogee has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which when combined with an Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some other companies which are worth considering, as our model shows that they have the right combination elements to post an earnings beat:Global Brass and Copper Holdings, Inc.  , has an Earnings ESP of +4.00% and a Zacks Rank #2.Cintas Corporation  , with an Earnings ESP of +1.11%, carries a Zacks Rank #2.Lindsay Corporation  , holds an Earnings ESP of +12.50% and a Zacks Rank #3Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

aste management firm  has recently leased a bigger office space in Reidsville, NC, to seek higher organic growth opportunities by accommodating newer clients and better serving large existing customers such as The Procter & Gamble Company  . With the lease, the company intends to shift its operations from its facility in Greensboro, NC, and transfer about 12 jobs to the newly leased site.The 113,500-square-foot Reidsville facility is nearly ten times the 12,400-square-foot facility in Greensboro and offers significant expansion opportunity to Stericycle. The Reidsville operation will primarily involve shredding products that have either expired or are part of a delayed shipment. This is likely to be an extension of the operations of the recently acquired information destruction services provider Shred-it International.In July this year, Stericycle acquired Shred-it from Cintas Corporation  and its other partners for $2.3 billion in cash. The transaction is likely to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2015, subject to the fulfilment of customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. With Shred-it on board, Stericycle is expected to enhance its core compliance solutions portfolio, thereby fuelling its future growth opportunities. The strategic purchase will also expand its operational infrastructure and enable it to capitalize on route-based logistics know-how. The acquisition is likely to create a new operational platform for Stericycle and offer specialized services, thereby augmenting its value proposition to clients.Incorporated in 1989 and headquartered in Lake Forest, IL, Stericycle is a leading provider of regulated medical waste management and product recall and return services in the U.S. It operates a national medical waste management network that caters to medical schools, hospitals, and other healthcare providers.Medical waste includes single-use disposables like needles, syringes, gloves, and other supplies that have been in contact with blood or other body fluids, blood products and other items that can spread infection. The company operates in the U.S., Argentina, Canada, Mexico, Chile, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Romania, with a network of 175 processing or combined processing and collection sites, and an additional 154 transfer, collection, or combined transfer and collection sites.Stericycle currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

 (  ) was a big mover last session, as the company saw its shares rise roughly 6% on the day. The upside was driven by the company's announcement of its fourth-quarter fiscal 2015 results, wherein revenues beat and earnings came in line with expectations.

This led to solid volume too with far more shares changing hands than in a normal session. Yesterday's rally breaks the recent trend of the company, as the stock is now trading above the volatile price range of $65.45 to $70.42 in the past one-month time frame.The company has seen no estimate revisions over the past 30 days, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the same time frame.

 reported second-quarter 2015 adjusted earnings from continuing operations of 28 cents per share, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 32 cents. Earnings were also lower than the prior-year figure of 41 cents.Revenues of $760 million lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $775 million and $787 million reported in the year-ago quarter.In the quarter, service revenues of $298.2 million were down 6.7% year over year. Storage rental revenues came in at $461.2 million, a decrease of 12% on a year-over-year basis.Internal service revenues from North American Records and Information Management Business (RIM) declined 1.3% year over year and 1.7% in North American Data Management (DM). With the increasing usage of Internet, Iron Mountain's service revenue growth rate in RIM business has stabilized while that from DM business is being impacted because of lower activity levels.Adjusted OIBDA (operating income before depreciation and amortization) was $223.2 million compared with $242 million in the year-ago quarter.Operating expenses were down 1.5% year over year to $630.2 million. The decline was primarily due to lower cost of sales (down 3.2% year over year).Operating income in the quarter decreased 31.7% from the year-ago quarter to $61.4 million.Iron Mountain exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $117.1 million compared with $125.9 million as of Mar 31, 2014. Long-term debt was $4.7 billion.For 2015, the company continues to expect adjusted earnings per share in the range of $1.15-$1.30 while revenues are projected to be in the range of $3,030 million-$3,150 million.Iron Mountain's diversified revenue base is a positive. It is noteworthy that more than 92% of the Fortune 1000 companies are on Iron Mountain's client list. We believe that its strong product portfolio, increasing market share, aggressive acquisition strategy and promising international business are the primary growth catalysts. Moreover, the company's entry into the data center market could be a growth catalyst.However, costs related to conversion and fluctuations in recycled paper prices are the near-term headwinds for the company. Moreover, volatile foreign exchange rates and competition from Guidance Software Inc.  , Pitney Bowes Inc.  and Cintas Corp.  are concerns.Currently, IRM has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"mage: Cintas.Most investors associate  with uniforms, as the company gets about three-quarters of its revenue from rental uniforms and other related products, and another 10% or so from direct sales of uniforms to workers. Yet coming into Thursday afternoon's fiscal fourth-quarter financial report, Cintas investors had already learned that the company had made the decision to divest itself of its document-shredding business, selling off the portion of the Shred-It partnership that it had gotten last year as part of a deal with private equity company Birch Hill Equity Partners and other Shred-it owners.Although Cintas' results were fairly muted on a reported basis, the company's growth looks much more impressive when you take out the impact of the document-shredding business from its past-year results. Let's look more closely at what Cintas said, and what's ahead for the company going forward. As we've seen in previous quarters, Cintas' results look fairly tepid at first glance; but after making adjustments, the company's growth path gets clearer. Revenue of $1.14 billion was just 0.7% higher than last year's fiscal fourth quarter, and adjusted net income of $101.2 million fell 21%, working out to $0.86 per share. Yet when you take out the discontinued document-shredding business, net income actually rose more than 6%. Investors had expected just $0.85 per share in adjusted earnings, leading to a modest earnings beat.A closer look at Cintas' lines of business showed pockets of strength. First Aid, Safety, and Fire Protection had the best results, with revenue growth of almost 10% for the quarter. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products, which is the most important division at Cintas, saw gains of 5.8%, but organic growth came in at a slightly faster 6.5% rate. Only the Uniform Direct Sales division held the company's sales gains back, with growth of just 0.3% year over year.CEO Scott Farmer expressed pleasure at the results, noting that Cintas has ""provided excellent customer service and increased the focus on managing our cost structure."" Combined with solid contributions from its employees, Cintas believes that it has plenty of potential to grow from current levels.Looking forward, Cintas clearly thinks that getting rid of the Document Shredding business is a positive move. As it said in a press release yesterday, Cintas will sell its 42% stake in the Shred-it partnership to  , expecting to clear between $550 million and $600 million in pre-tax proceeds. The deal concludes a successful exit from the shredding business, with Cintas having collected $180 million from creating the Shred-it partnership last year, and also having received $113.4 million in dividends from the partnership a couple of months ago.Meanwhile, Cintas continues to have ambitious growth plans. In its guidance for the 2016 fiscal year, Cintas said it expects $4.7 billion to $4.78 billion in revenue, representing growth of between 5% and 7% from 2015 levels. Earnings per share of $3.74 to $3.83 would equate to even faster growth of around 12% to 14% once you take out the impact of the Shred-it moves. For investors, though, that guidance is somewhat mixed, with the earnings range at the high-end of expectations, but the revenue guidance closer to the low-end.Cintas clearly believes in positive prospects for its stock, as the company spent another $370 million on stock buybacks. Fiscal fourth-quarter repurchases of 2.9 million shares cost the company $237 million, and since the new fiscal year began, Cintas spent $133 million for another 1.5 million shares. Cintas is running out of authorized funds for future buybacks, with just $130 million remaining under the current authorization.Cintas stock didn't respond too much to the news, initially falling in after-hours trading following the announcement, but then bouncing back to the unchanged level about an hour and 15 minutes into the session. Still, for long-term investors, Cintas appears to have a firm sense of its future strategy, and that could help the company keep executing well, and producing greater profits long down the road.Bad news for your credit card company. The plastic in your wallet may soon be gone forever. And once it is, it could cost major credit card companies as much as $18 million a day! Good news for you. Because when you're finally able to say ""goodbye"" to the cards stuck in your wallet, a little-known tech company responsible for finally putting an end to plastic could hand its investors life-changing profits.

nvestors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and  (  )  may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because CTAS is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings-with the most up-to-date information possible-is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for CTAS in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 87 cents per share for CTAS, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 84 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for CTAS, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of 3.57% heading into earnings season.A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more  ).Given that CTAS has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Cintas, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

aste management firm  recently inked a definitive agreement with business services provider Cintas Corporation  and its other partners to acquire information destruction services provider Shred-it International for $2.3 billion in cash.The transaction is likely to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2015, subject to the fulfilment of customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. Post-acquisition, Shred-it will operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Stericycle.Since its inception in 1988, Shred-it emerged as one of the leading paper shredding companies in the world, offering service to over 400,000 customers in 170 markets in 18 different countries. The company specializes in tailored document destruction services that allow businesses to comply with legislation, while ensuring that confidential business information is kept secure at all times. For the 12-month period ending Mar 2015, Shred-it generated pro forma revenues of $726 million.In Apr 2014, Cintas completed the divestiture of its Document Shredding business by forming a new partnership with the shareholders of Shred-it. The two companies merged to create a new firm that operated under the Shred-it name. Cintas had a 42% ownership stake in the new entity, while the remaining 58% was owned by the shareholders of Shred-it.Incorporated in 1989 and headquartered in Lake Forest, IL, Stericycle is a leading provider of regulated medical waste management and product recall and return services in the U.S. It operates a national medical waste management network that caters to medical schools, hospitals, and other healthcare providers.Medical waste includes single-use disposables like needles, syringes, gloves, and other supplies that have been in contact with blood or other body fluids, blood products and other items that can spread infection. The company operates in the U.S., Argentina, Canada, Mexico, Chile, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Romania, with a network of 175 processing or combined processing and collection sites, and an additional 154 transfer, collection, or combined transfer and collection sites.With Shred-it on board, Stericycle is expected to enhance its core compliance solutions portfolio, thereby fuelling its future growth opportunities. The strategic purchase will expand its operational infrastructure and enable it to capitalize on route-based logistics know-how. The acquisition is likely to create a new operational platform for Stericycle and offer specialized services, thereby augmenting its value proposition to clients.The transaction is anticipated to result in cost synergies to the tune of $20-$30 million by 2018, leading to accretive earnings. Earnings per share is expected to increase by at least 10% in 2016 and by the high-teens in 2018, generating robust cash flow and over $1 billion in EBITDA in 2016 through improved margins and debt repayment.A significant portion of Stericycle's historical growth is attributable to the successful integration of acquisitions in both domestic and international markets. The company is continuously on the lookout for strategic acquisitions that will enhance its market share and expand its geographic base. We believe that the current acquisition will also serve the company in good stead, expanding its global client base and generating incremental revenues.Stericycle currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A couple of stocks that look promising and are worth a look now in the broader industry include Clean Harbors, Inc.  and Towers Watson & Co.  , both carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

eading business service provider  is scheduled to report its fourth-quarter fiscal 2015 results after the closing bell on Jul 16. In the last reported quarter, Cintas' adjusted earnings exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6 cents. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.With a continued improvement in the pricing environment and higher operational efficiency, Cintas is expected to achieve broad-based revenue growth in the quarter. The company is also expected to capitalize on the growth prospects in the rental first aid and direct sale businesses. Leveraging its well-equipped infrastructure resources, Cintas aims to capitalize on its scale advantages to augment its competitiveness. Also, a more favorable pricing scenario and cost streamlining initiatives are expected to drive incremental margins.Cintas aims to continually achieve revenue buildup by increasing penetration levels at existing customers and broadening customer base to include business segments that are not historically served. In order to ensure solid organic revenue growth, the company regularly undertakes advanced training procedures of sales personnel to improve sales productivity and expand the number of products and services sold. Its skilled team of service professionals frequently visits customers, thus strengthening personal relationships and facilitating a platform to launch additional products and services. This focused approach for steady top-line growth is commendable.In addition, Cintas has a strong balance sheet with adequate liquidity to meet its working capital requirements. The company also generates strong operating cash flow, which helps maintain its cash reserves. The company has consistently returned cash to shareholders through stable dividend payouts and share repurchases. In addition, Cintas has easy access to commercial paper and long-term debt markets on favorable interest rate and other terms, which has historically provided it with rich sources of liquidity.Backed by some solid fundamentals, our proven model conclusively shows that Cintas is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it possesses the key ingredients for a success recipe. Expected Surprise Prediction or  , which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is currently pegged at +3.57%. This mostly indicates a probable earnings beat for the shares. Cintas' Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) combined with a positive ESP increases the predictive power of ESP. Note that stocks with a Zacks Ranks of #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) and #3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. The Sell rated stocks (#4 and #5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Align Technology Inc.  , earnings ESP of +2.63% and Zacks Rank #2.Cal-Maine Foods, Inc.  , earnings ESP of +5.17% and Zacks Rank #1.Fair Isaac Corporation  , earnings ESP of +12.50% and Zacks Rank #1.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

n Jun 17, Zacks  downgraded leading business service provider  to a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) from a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Despite the downgrade, the stock is currently trading at a forward P/E of 22.9x with long-term earnings growth expectation of 12.2%, which reflects its inherent growth prospects.Cintas procures raw materials from a wide range of domestic and international suppliers, making it susceptible to market risks. A steady climb in raw material costs, such as cotton, has weighed on the company's margins. In addition, U.S. and foreign trade policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, trade sanctions, and limitations on the imports of certain types of goods also escalate product costs and adversely affect its operations.First aid and fire protection services rendered by Cintas are commoditized markets and are therefore subject to fierce competition. As such, the company has to continually invest in value drivers to fend off competition, thus reducing its profitability. Moreover, a persistently challenging macroeconomic environment has led customers to perform certain services in-house, resulting in a loss of business for Cintas.However, Cintas is trying to rationalize its operations through divestures of non-core operations and reap synergistic benefits in the long run. The company completed the divesture of the Document Shredding business by forming a new partnership with the shareholders of privately held document management firm Shred-it International Inc. Cintas now owns 42% of the new company while the remaining 58% is owned by the shareholders of Shred-it. The combined entity will operate under the Shred-it brand and is expected to generate annual revenue in excess of $600 million. Cintas has also sold its Document Storage and Imaging businesses in three separate transactions for an aggregate of approximately $180 million. The transactions marked the exit of the company from this business line.Although there are difficulties in the near term, the long-term prospects look quite firm. The company has consistently returned cash to shareholders through stable dividend payouts and share repurchases. In addition, Cintas has an easy access to commercial paper and long-term debt markets on favorable interest rates and other terms. This has historically provided the company with rich sources of liquidity.Other stocks that look promising and are worth a look now in the industry include CRA International Inc.  , FTI Consulting, Inc.  and Navigant Consulting Inc.  , each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

n May 18, Zacks  updated the research report on leading business service provider  .Cintas has completed the divestiture of the Document Shredding business by forming a new partnership with the shareholders of privately-held document management firm Shred-it International Inc. Cintas now owns 42% of the new company, while the remaining 58% is owned by the shareholders of Shred-it.

The transactions marked the exit of the company from this business line. These divestitures are expected to rationalize operations and reap synergistic benefits in the long run.Cintas aims to continually achieve revenue buildup by increasing penetration levels at existing customers and by broadening its customer base to include business segments that are not historically served. The company also identifies additional product and service opportunities for its current and future customers to expand its product portfolio. To ensure solid organic revenue growth, the company regularly undertakes advanced training procedures of sales personnel to improve sales productivity and expand the number of products and services sold. Its skilled team of service professionals frequently visits customers, thus strengthening personal relationships, and facilitating a platform to launch additional products and services. This focused approach for steady top-line growth is commendable.With improving fundamentals, Cintas has also revised its revenue guidance for fiscal 2015 from its earlier range of $4.45 billion to $4.50 billion to $4.46 billion to $4.49 billion. Earnings guidance was revised upward from its earlier range of $3.49-$3.54 to $3.55 to $3.58.

 reported first-quarter 2015 adjusted earnings from continuing operations of 32 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 29 cents. However, adjusted earnings per share were lower than the prior-year figure of 35 cents.Revenues of $749 million lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $771 million and $770 millionreported in the year-ago quarter.In the quarter, service revenues of $290.4 million were down 6.7% year over year.Storage rental revenues came in at$458.9 million (flat on a year over year basis).With the increasing usage of Internet, Iron Mountain's service revenue growth rate has moderated due to lower activity rates as stored records are becoming less active. In the quarter, internal service revenues in North American Records and Information Management Business (RIM) improved 1.5% year over year.Adjusted OIBDA (operating income before depreciation and amortization) was $231.2 millioncompared with $228.5 million in the year-ago quarter.Operating expenses were down 5.2% year over year to $604.3 million. The decline was primarily due to lower selling, general and administrative expenses (down 8.6% year over year).Operating income in the quarter increased 9.3% from the year-ago quarter to $144.9 million.Iron Mountain exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $119.6 million compared with $125.9 million as ofMar 31, 2014.

It is noteworthy that more than 95% of the Fortune 1000 companies are on Iron Mountain's client list. We believe that its strong product portfolio, increasing market share, aggressive acquisition strategy and promising international business are the primary growth catalysts. Moreover, the company's entry into the data center market could be a growth catalyst.However, costs related to conversion and fluctuations in recycled paper prices are the near-term headwinds for the company. Moreover, volatile foreign exchange rates and competition from Guidance Software Inc.  , Pitney Bowes Inc.  and Cintas Corp.  are concerns.Currently, IRM has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

n Apr 9, 2015, Zacks  upgraded  to a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) from a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) primarily on the back of its business innovations. Going by the Zacks model, companies holding a Zacks Rank #3 have chances of performing in line with the broader market and are likely to beat earnings in the upcoming quarter.Steady economic recovery in the U.S. market is supporting the company's aggregate revenue growth. Moreover, as growing proportion of middle income consumers in emerging economies like China and Brazil call for greater industrialization, it indirectly enhances demand for the company's services.The company's adjusted earnings in the last reported quarter witnessed a year-over-year improvement of 10.9% driven by an enhanced top line as well as efficient cost-reduction strategies. Further, aided by Lean Six Sigma projects and strategic global outsourcing activities, Xylem has succeeded in lowering its expenses. The company also remains committed to benefiting its shareholders through a worthwhile capital deployment strategy.This apart, Xylem is making concerted efforts to enhance the quality of its offerings by launching new product and process innovations. Lately, supported by new technologies, the company has strengthened the competency of its Bell & Gossett product category in the market. Under this regime, the company has launched energy efficiency pumps, energy-saving solutions for HVAC, specialized plumbing applications for commercial buildings.In the last four trailing quarters, Xylem delivered a positive average earnings surprise of 5.15%, without missing the estimates in any season. The positive ESP was attributable to the company's current commercial success. However, in order to beat the broader market in the near future, the company needs to offset the negative impact from macro-headwinds as well as issues related to untimely project deliveries in business.Some better-ranked stocks in the industry include RBC Bearings Inc.  , Berry Plastics Group, Inc.  and Cintas Corporation  .

"nvestors in Cintas Corporation (Symbol: CTAS) saw new options become available this week, for the November 20th expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 240 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CTAS options chain for the new November 20th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $82.50 strike price has a current bid of $4.50. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $82.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $78.00 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CTAS, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $83.19/share today.Because the $82.50 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 54%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.45% return on the cash commitment, or 8.29% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Cintas Corporation, and highlighting in green where the $82.50 strike is located relative to that history:  Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $85.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.80. If an investor was to purchase shares of CTAS stock at the current price level of $83.19/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $85.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 6.74% if the stock gets called away at the November 20th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CTAS shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Cintas Corporation, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing CTAS's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $85.00 strike highlighted in red: Considering the fact that the $85.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 53%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).

"hicago, IL - March 20, 2015 - Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian says, ""We are still a few days away from the end of the March quarter, but the 2015 Q1 earnings season has already gotten underway.""The following is an excerpt from this week's Earnings Trends article. To see the full article,  .We are still a few days away from the end of the March quarter, but the 2015 Q1 earnings season has already gotten underway. We have seen results from 8 S&P 500 members and the tally will reach 19 by the end of the month. Please note that all of these early reports are from companies with fiscal quarters ending in February; we count all of these as part of our Q1 tally.The actual results from these early reporters appear good enough in terms of growth rates and beat ratios. But investors seem unimpressed with the results thus far. The 'price impact' column in the summary table below for the 8 S&P 500 members clearly shows investors' disappointment with the result thus far, particularly for  (  -  ),  (  -  ) and  (  -  ).As we all know, estimates for Q1 took a lot of beating over the last few months, with many suspecting that the negative revisions trend may have gone a bit too far. But judging from the market's reaction to the admittedly small sample of reports, expectations may not be low enough. That said, it is way too early a stage to analyze the Q1 results.For the 2015 Q1 earnings season as a whole, here are the 3 key points to keep in mind. , the magnitude of negative revisions for Q1 is greater than what we have seen for any other recent quarter. The Energy sector is undoubtedly the big reason why the revisions trend for Q1 stands out to this extent, but the picture isn't much better outside of the Energy sector either. , it's not just the growth rate that is so low in Q1; total aggregate earnings for the S&P 500 companies are expected to be the lowest since the fourth quarter of 2012. Aggregate earnings have been in record territory in recent quarters, with each of the preceding three quarters producing all-time record quarterly totals. , growth estimates for the first half of the year have taken a severe beating over the last few months, with positive growth estimates getting replaced by outright earnings declines. Positive earnings growth estimates since mid-December 2014 have evaporated.Zacks  e-mail newsletter provides highlights of the latest analysis from Zacks Equity Research.  .Zacks.com is a property of Zacks , Inc., which was formed in 1978.

inding a great growth stock can be a tough task. Not only are there a wide range of choices, but the space can be extremely volatile and fraught with risk as well. But thanks to our new style score system we have been able to identify a few growth stocks which have incredible potential in the near term.One such company that stands out in this regard is undoubtedly  (  ). Not only does this company have a favorable growth score, but it is ranked as a buy too. And while there are numerous reasons why CTAS is so attractive right now, we have highlighted three of the most important-and pertinent to growth investors-below:Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. And for growth investors, earnings growth in the double digits is definitely necessary and it is often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) ahead for the company in question.While CTAS has put up a historical EPS growth rate of 18.76%, investors should really focus on the projected growth. Here, CTAS is looking to grow at a rate of 19.95%, thoroughly crushing the industry average which calls for EPS growth of just 13.27% in comparison.Cash is the lifeblood of any business, but especially so for growth oriented companies. A positive figure here indicates that cash is flowing into the business (obviously a good thing), while a negative reading here means that net cash is exiting the company.Right now, CTAS' current cash flow growth is an impressive 5.74%, a level that is far higher than many of its peers, and the industry average. In fact, the industry average sees cash flow growth of just 2.22% in comparison, suggesting that CTAS is a better pick from a cash flow outlook.If the metrics outlined above weren't enough, investors should also consider the positive trends that we are seeing on the analyst estimate revision front. Analysts have been raising their estimates for Cintas lately, and now the earnings picture is looking a bit more favorable for the company.Over the past 60 days 8 EPS estimates have been revised higher compared to none lower, at least for the current year time frame. And the magnitude of these revisions has also been impressive, as the consensus estimate for the full year has surged from $3.27 per share to $3.35 per share today.For the reasons outlined above, investors shouldn't be surprised to note that Cintas (CTAS) has earned itself a growth score of 'B' as well as a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This means that we believe Cintas stock is a potential outperformer that is an impressive choice for growth investors, making it a security that you need to keep on your radar in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

 reported third-quarter fiscal 2015 (ended Feb 28, 2015) results with adjusted earnings of 85 cents per share versus 68 cents in the year-ago quarter. The adjusted earnings for the reported quarter also comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 79 cents. The year-over-year increase in earnings was driven by an increase in revenues.On a GAAP basis, Cintas reported net income from continuing operations of $93.6 million or 79 cents per share compared with $84.3 million or 69 cents per share in the year-earlier quarter.Quarterly revenues increased 7.0% year over year to $1,108 million, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate with an organic growth of 7.5%.Adjusted gross margin was 42.9% compared with 42.1% in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted operating income in the reported quarter climbed 17.1% year over year to $173.6 million. Operating margin was 15.7%, higher than 14.3% in the year-earlier quarter.Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenues for the quarter improved 7.2% year over year to $859.5 million. The segment accounted for 77.5% of the total revenue, with organic growth of 7.8%. Gross margin increased to 44.6% from 43.9% in the year-ago quarter.Revenues for Uniform Direct Sales were $112.2 million (up 4.2% year over year). The segment accounted for 10.1% of the company's revenues. First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services revenues improved 8.2% to $137.1 million, representing 12.4% of the company's total revenue.Cintas has a solid financial position with adequate liquidity. Cash and cash equivalents stood at $445.3 million at quarter end. Long-term debt remained steady at $1.3 billion.Net cash provided by operating activities aggregated $464.6 million for the nine months ended fiscal 2015, compared with $385.8 million in the year-ago period. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $163 million. Free cash flow for the first nine months of fiscal 2015 increased to $301.6 million from $272.2 million in the prior-year period.Cintas purchased 3.2 million shares during the reported quarter for $250.8 million. Also, the company approved an additional $500 million share buyback program.In concurrence with the third-quarter fiscal 2015 results, Cintas revised its fiscal guidance. For fiscal 2015, Cintas revised its revenue guidance from its earlier range of $4.45 billion to $4.50 billion to $4.46 billion to $4.49 billion. Earnings guidance for fiscal 2015 was revised upward from its earlier range of $3.49-$3.54 to $3.55 to $3.58. Earnings excluding special items for fiscal 2015 are expected to be in the range of $3.31-$3.44.Cintas continues to deliver organic growth through superior execution of its operational plans. We remain encouraged by the company's relatively strong quarterly performance and bullish guidance.Cintas currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Other stocks that look promising and are worth a look now include CBIZ, Inc  , NV5 Holdings, Inc.  both carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and Corporate Executive Board Co  , carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

e have issued an updated research report on  on Mar 30, 2015. Since its inception in 1910, the company has substantially expanded its business on a global scale, and currently shares a high brand value in the worldwide diversified machinery industry. However, as certain external issues have been troubling the company's commercial affairs lately, investors are keen to evaluate Actuants' second-quarter fiscal 2015 results.Persistent unfavorable conditions in the oil & gas markets as well as in many of Actuants' niche marketplaces lowered its adjusted earnings by 6.7% in second-quarter fiscal 2015. Moreover, due to fluctuations in global oil & gas prices and uncertainty regarding capital investments in markets, the company anticipates its Energy Segment to perform poorly in the near future.Actuant's trade is highly sensitive to market headwinds like currency volatilities, which had lowered the company's revenues in the last reported quarter. It also increased the company's debt burden, offsetting the benefits reaped from free cash flow generation.Actuant encounters stiff market rivalry and as a result, is forced to incur lofty innovation expenses for sustaining or gaining higher market share. However, in case the new technologies become obsolete within a short span of time, such investments might prove to be futile in the near term.Based on these negative factors, estimate revisions for the stock have largely trended downward over the last 30 days. However, we believe Actuant's firm commitment toward increasing its shareholders' value will retain investors' confidence to some extent. Furthermore, benefits reaped from success of new growth plans and product or process-based innovations are expected to offset the negative impact of headwinds, going forward.With a market capitalization of $1.48 billion, Actuant Corporation currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Better-ranked stocks in the industry include ESCO Technologies Inc.  , Cintas Corporation  and Bemis Company, Inc.  . All three stocks hold a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

The resulting negative tone of management guidance notwithstanding, estimates for outer quarters still represent a material ramp up in growth going forward, with estimates for 2015 Q4 representing a new all-time quarterly record. What this means is that there is still plenty of downside risk to estimates for the coming quarters.To see the full Earnings Trends report,  . : Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"ant to invest like nobility? You can, in a way, by allocating at least some of your portfolio to the dividend aristocrats. This small, elite group is comprised of stocks that have raised their distributions at least once annually for a minimum of 25 years running.A host of famous stock market names crowd the dividend aristocrat list --  ,  ,  , etc. But there are also a host of relatively unrecognized, yet no less noble, stocks that have consistently bestowed coin on their shareholders for decades. Here are three of those under-the-radar aristocrats.This company, one of only three real estate investment trusts among the aristocrats, operates in a lucrative niche. It manages property in the healthcare sector, landlording various types of medical facilities.HCP is arguably the REIT best positioned to benefit from the rapid aging of the baby boomer generation, which is entering its twilight years. The company is doing an ace job running its over 1,100 properties -- annual revenue and net profit have grown notably, particularly over the past five years. Net margins are consistently wide, recently landing in the 40%-45% range. data by The boomers are collectively a huge demographic, and they should sustain HCP's business for years to come. Even before these folks entered their golden age, HCP was doing well enough to spit out a dividend on a regular basis. Considering that, I think the REIT will stay aristocratic well into the foreseeable future.At the moment, HCP pays a quarterly dividend of just under $0.57 per share. This yields 5.2% at its current stock price.Like HCP, timing is on the side of this similarly three-initial firm, which sells paints and coatings across five divisions; performance, industrial, and architectural coatings, plus optical/specialty materials, and glass.The first two on that list are by far PPG's largest, and they've been selling into well-performing segments. These include automotive, aerospace, manufacturing, and packaging.Overall, the company's net sales grew by 8% on an annual basis in fiscal 2014 to over $15 billion, one of the best showings in its history. Adjusted net profit was 22% higher at nearly $1.4 million, notching a record-high annual EPS of $9.75. data by One big reason for the improvements was PPG's $2.3 billion acquisition of large Mexico-based paint maker Consorcio Comex, a buyout that was closed during the quarter. Acqusitions should continue to lift results; just last week, PPG announced it closed deals to buy France-based automotive sealant and adhesive manufacturer Revocoat, and wood care and paint maker Flood Australia, for amounts that were not disclosed.Buyouts, then, seem to be the way forward for PPG at the moment. There are a lot of positives here -- the firm's determined and ambitious, plus it has a fairly steady level of free cash flow, and a debt load it seems able to manage with current resources. This also bodes well for its quarterly dividend, which currently stands at $0.67 per share for a yield of 1.2%.The provision and servicing of uniforms wouldn't seem to be a high-growth business. Yet this firm, which rules its niche, has managed to consistently improve its results over the years. data by Lately, this has been due to increased efficiency across all of Cintas' divisions, and an effective restructuring/cost-cutting initiative intended to concentrate resources on the highest-margin units. Stripping out the results of a document-shredding unit that was sold last year, the firm's organic revenue grew by 7.5% on an annual basis in its most  to $1.1 billion, with bottom line advancing 12% to $95 million.It's a good time for Cintas to slim down. Despite a recent hiccup or two, the U.S. employment situation continues to be encouraging, with national joblessness coming in at a nice and low 5.5% in the latest reading. Fuller employment means bigger armies of workers ... such as the ones that wear Cintas uniforms. A leaner organization and increased business should result in higher profits.The company is a cash cow, reporting over $460 million in free cash flow last year. That's almost five times the amount it needs for its regular annual dividend, which was raised by 10% last year to $0.85 per share. The yield on that amount is slightly over 1%.One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World Wide Web to bed. And if you act right away, it could make you wildly rich. Experts are calling it the single largest business opportunity in the history of capitalism...  is calling it ""transformative""... But you'll probably just call it ""how I made my millions."" Don't be too late to the party --  when the Web goes dark.The article  originally appeared on Fool.com.Copyright © 1995 - 2015 The Motley Fool, LLC. All rights reserved.

eading business service provider  is scheduled to report its third-quarter fiscal 2015 results after the closing bell on Mar 18. In the last reported quarter, Cintas' adjusted earnings exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8 cents. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.With an improved pricing environment and higher operational efficiency, Cintas is expected to achieve broad-based revenue growth in the quarter. The company is also expected to capitalize on the growth prospects in the rental first aid and direct sale businesses. Cintas continues to leverage its infrastructure to the optimum level and is capitalizing on its scale advantages as well, which improve its competitiveness. Also, a more favorable pricing scenario and cost streamlining initiatives are expected to drive incremental margins.In order to ensure solid organic revenue growth, the company regularly undertakes advanced training procedures of sales personnel to improve sales productivity and expand the number of products and services sold. Its skilled team of service professionals frequently visits customers, thus strengthening personal relationships and facilitating a platform to launch additional products and services. This focused approach for steady top-line growth is commendable.During the quarter, Cintas approved a plan to increase its share repurchase program by an additional $500 million. The increased share-repurchase authorization doubles the total share buyback program of the company to a cumulative tally of $1 billion to reward shareholders with risk-adjusted returns.Cintas has a strong balance sheet with adequate liquidity to meet its working capital requirements. The company also generates strong operating cash flow, which helps maintain its cash reserves. The company has consistently returned cash to shareholders through stable dividend payouts and share repurchases. In addition, Cintas has easy access to commercial paper and long-term debt markets on favorable interest rate and other terms, which has historically provided it with rich sources of liquidity.However, our proven model does not conclusively show that Cintas is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it lacks the key ingredients for a success recipe.Zacks ESP: Expected Surprise Prediction or  , which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is currently pegged at 0.00%.

 (  ) reported fourth-quarter 2014 adjusted earnings from continuing operations of 25 cents per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 31 cents. However, adjusted earnings per share increased from 21 cents in the year-ago quarter.For 2014, the company reported adjusted earnings of $1.36 per share, down from $1.40 a year ago.Revenues of $778 million came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate but increased from $768 million in the year-ago quarter. For 2014, reported revenues of $3,118 million increased from $3,025 million in 2013.In the fourth quarter, revenues increased on the back of higher storage rental revenues of $469 million (up 5.2% year over year) and higher service revenues of $313.6 million (up 3.7% year over year).Of late, Iron Mountain's service revenue growth rate has moderated due to lower activity rates as stored records are becoming less active with the increase in Internet usage. Internal service revenues in North American Records and Information Management Business (RIM) improved 3% year over year.Adjusted OIBDA (operating income before depreciation and amortization) was $220 million compared with $195 million in the year-ago quarter.Operating expenses declined 3.1% year over year to $650.1 million due to lower Selling, General and Administrative expenses (down 10.4% year over year).Operating income increased 31.7% from the year-ago quarter to $127.8 million.Iron Mountain exited the year with cash and cash equivalents of $125 million compared with $120.5 million at the end of 2013. Long-term debt was $4.12 billion.For 2015, Iron Mountain expects its adjusted earnings per share to be same as adjusted OIBDA growth rate of 1-5%.We believe that Iron Mountain's strong product portfolio, increasing market share and promising international business are the primary growth drivers. Moreover, the company's entry into the data center market could act as a positive factor.Additionally, the company's aggressive acquisition policy should extend its foothold in the emerging markets, in our view, in turn driving top-line growth.However, costs related to conversion and fluctuations in recycled paper prices are the near-term headwinds. Moreover, volatile foreign exchange rates and competition from Guidance Software Inc. (  ), Pitney Bowes Inc. (  ) and Cintas Corp. (  ) are the other concerns.Currently, IRM has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

he following is an excerpt from this week's Earnings Trends article. To see the full article,  .We are still a few days away from the end of the March quarter, but the 2015 Q1 earnings season has already gotten underway. We have seen results from 8 S&P 500 members and the tally will reach 19 by the end of the month. Please note that all of these early reports are from companies with fiscal quarters ending in February; we count all of these as part of our Q1 tally.The actual results from these early reporters appear good enough in terms of growth rates and beat ratios. But investors seem unimpressed with the results thus far. The 'price impact' column in the summary table below for the 8 S&P 500 members clearly shows investors' disappointment with the result thus far, particularly for  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ).As we all know, estimates for Q1 took a lot of beating over the last few months, with many suspecting that the negative revisions trend may have gone a bit too far. But judging from the market's reaction to the admittedly small sample of reports, expectations may not be low enough. That said, it is way too early a stage to analyze the Q1 results.For the 2015 Q1 earnings season as a whole, here are the 3 key points to keep in mind. , the magnitude of negative revisions for Q1 is greater than what we have seen for any other recent quarter. The Energy sector is undoubtedly the big reason why the revisions trend for Q1 stands out to this extent, but the picture isn't much better outside of the Energy sector either.The chart below shows the evolution of 2015 Q1 total earnings growth estimates, with and without the Energy sector. , it's not just the growth rate that is so low in Q1; total aggregate earnings for the S&P 500 companies are expected to be the lowest since the fourth quarter of 2012. Aggregate earnings have been in record territory in recent quarters, with each of the preceding three quarters producing all-time record quarterly totals.The chart below shows the aggregate earnings tally for the S&P 500 index , growth estimates for the first half of the year have taken a severe beating over the last few months, with positive growth estimates getting replaced by outright earnings declines. The chart below shows the evolution of 2015 Q1 and Q2 earnings growth estimates since mid-December 2014. As you can see, positive growth in the first half of the year has evaporated.The revisions trend has been negative for more than two years now, with the trend gaining pace over the last few months under the combined effect of Energy sector weakness, dollar strength, and global growth worries. The resulting negative tone of management guidance notwithstanding, estimates for outer quarters still represent a material ramp up in growth going forward, with estimates for 2015 Q4 representing a new all-time quarterly record. What this means is that there is still plenty of downside risk to estimates for the coming quarters.To see the full Earnings Trends report,  . : Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

n Feb 21, Zacks  downgraded leading business service provider  (  ) to a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) from a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Despite the downgrade, the stock is currently trading at a forward P/E of 25.2x with long-term earnings growth expectation of 11.8%, which reflects its inherent growth prospects.Cintas procures raw materials from a wide range of domestic and international suppliers, making it susceptible to market risks. A steady climb in raw material costs, such as cotton, has weighed on the company's margins. In addition, U.S. and foreign trade policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, trade sanctions, and limitations on the imports of certain types of goods also escalate product costs and adversely affect its operations.First aid and fire protection services rendered by Cintas are commoditized markets and are therefore subject to fierce competition. As such, the company has to continually invest in value drivers to fend off competition, thus reducing its profitability. Moreover, a persistently challenging macroeconomic environment has led customers to perform certain services in-house, resulting in a loss of business for Cintas.However, Cintas is trying to rationalize its operations through divestures of non-core operations and reap synergistic benefits in the long run. The company completed the divesture of the Document Shredding business by forming a new partnership with the shareholders of the privately held document management firm Shred-it International Inc. Cintas now owns 42% of the new company while the remaining 58% is owned by the shareholders of Shred-it. The combined entity will operate under the Shred-it brand and is expected to generate annual revenue in excess of $600 million. Cintas has also sold its Document Storage and Imaging businesses in three separate transactions for an aggregate of approximately $180 million. The transactions marked the exit of the company from this business line.Although there are difficulties in the near term, the long-term prospects look quite firm. The company has consistently returned cash to shareholders through stable dividend payouts and share repurchases. In addition, Cintas has an easy access to commercial paper and long-term debt markets on favorable interest rates and other terms. This has historically provided the company with rich sources of liquidity.Stocks that look promising and are worth looking into now include CRA International Inc. (  ), Exponent Inc. (  ) and Hill International, Inc. (  ), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

"nvestors in Cintas Corporation (Symbol: CTAS) saw new options become available this week, for the March 20th expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CTAS options chain for the new March 20th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $77.50 strike price has a current bid of $1.70. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $77.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $75.80 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CTAS, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $78.54/share today.Because the $77.50 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 58%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.19% return on the cash commitment, or 16.03% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Cintas Corporation, and highlighting in green where the $77.50 strike is located relative to that history:  Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $80.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.35. If an investor was to purchase shares of CTAS stock at the current price level of $78.54/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $80.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 3.58% if the stock gets called away at the March 20th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CTAS shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Cintas Corporation, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing CTAS's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $80.00 strike highlighted in red: Considering the fact that the $80.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

"ource: Cintas.Few investors know much about uniform specialist  , but the company has done a good job over the long run in taking a niche business and making the most of the profit opportunities it has found within the industry. Coming into Wednesday afternoon's fiscal third-quarter financial report, Cintas investors were hoping to see another double-digit percentage jump in earnings, as the company has moved forward with restructuring and cost-cutting efforts aimed at focusing more on its highest-margin businesses. For its part, Cintas exceeded most of the expectations that shareholders had, with even better bottom-line numbers than those following the stock had anticipated. Let's take a closer look at Cintas and what its most recent results say about the company's future direction. Cintas' results will look familiar to those who've followed the company for a while. On the sales front, Cintas had $1.11 billion in revenue, which was down very slightly from year-ago levels. As we've seen before, though, the year-ago quarter included results from the company's Document Shredding business, which it sold to Shred-it International last April. When you take out that discontinued business, organic revenue climbed 7.5%. Net income climbed an impressive 12% to $94.9 million, and after adjusting to reflect the hit to earnings from the Document Shredding business, adjusted earnings per share of $0.85 beat estimates by $0.07.Looking more closely at its various business units, Cintas saw growth across the board. The first aid, safety, and fire protection division saw the fastest growth at 8.2%, but Cintas' rental uniform business also saw a solid 7.2% gain. Direct sales of uniforms climbed the least, but even there, 4.2% growth reversed a year-over-year drop last quarter, reflecting the improving business climate for employment.Source: Cintas.CEO Scott Farmer was happy about the results, again attributing much of the success of Cintas' business to the company's employees. Farmer also called out a massive buyback of $251 million over the quarter, with 3.2 million shares of stock repurchased to use up the remainder of Cintas' 2013 authorization of $500 million toward buying back stock. The CEO believes that the move was successful in ""demonstrating our commitment to provide shareholder value.""Cintas could easily get even more benefit from buybacks in the near future. In January, the company approved an additional $500 million toward buybacks, and Cintas has all that money in its arsenal to capitalize on repurchase opportunities.Indeed, Cintas raised its earnings guidance for the full 2015 fiscal year, perhaps in part reflecting the expectations for further share-count declines. Cintas now expects to earn $3.55 to $3.58 per share, raising its previous range by about a nickel and representing 16% to 17% growth in earnings per share for the company in fiscal 2015. Sales guidance of $4.46 billion to $4.49 billion was fully within the previous range.Source: Cintas.The positive tone in the U.S. employment picture should continue to lift prospects for Cintas' core business. Several months of strong gains in job creation bode well for the prospects for uniform rentals and sales, and with the Federal Reserve seemingly prepared to let faster growth establish itself more firmly before starting to tighten monetary policy, Cintas should enjoy some tailwinds for a while.Cintas investors saw some immediate benefit from the latest results, as the stock gained more than 1% in the first hour and a half of after-hours trading following the announcement. With its efforts to streamline its business and drive growth in its most promising segments, Cintas looks poised to capture as much as possible of the positive economic environment in 2015 and beyond. 2015 is shaping up to be another great year for stocks. But if you want to make sure that 2015 is  best investing year ever, you need to know where to start.

nvestors considering a purchase of Cintas Corporation (Symbol: CTAS) shares, but tentative about paying the going market price of $79.95/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the August put at the $75 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $2.15. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 2.9% return against the $75 commitment, or a 5.1% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to CTAS's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $75 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Cintas Corporation sees its shares decline 6.2% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $72.85 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $2.15 from $75), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 5.1% annualized rate of return. Worth considering, is that the annualized 5.1% figure actually exceeds the 1.1% annualized dividend paid by Cintas Corporation by 4%, based on the current share price of $79.95. And yet, if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downside because the stock would have to fall 6.2% to reach the $75 strike price. Always important when discussing dividends is the fact that, in general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Cintas Corporation, looking at the dividend history chart for CTAS below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 1.1% annualized dividend yield.  Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Cintas Corporation, and highlighting in green where the $75 strike is located relative to that history:  The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the August put at the $75 strike for the 5.1% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Cintas Corporation (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $79.95) to be 18%.

"Welcome to the 11th installment in Seeking Alpha's  series. As we wind the series down, you can look forward to commentary from Jeff Miller and Russ Koesterich.Today, we are turning to the small-cap market and are thrilled to share the thoughts of Maj Soueidan of The GeoTeam. In 1990, Maj Soueidan began his independent research and development of investment strategies utilizing his own personal portfolio as a pilot account to test trading models and strategies in a real time trading environment. He serves as the Portfolio Manager of Markets Edge, Ltd., an affiliated private investment company, and is a Principal of a number of other ventures, including businesses focused on real estate and retail.Mr. Soueidan is also President and Co-Founder of GeoInvesting, founded in 2007. GeoInvesting is a portal that disseminates information and investment ideas (long and short), primarily on U.S. listed Chinese companies and U.S. micro-cap companies. At GeoInvesting, Maj co-leads a staff with partner Dan David that performs research, generates investigative reports and performs extensive on the ground due diligence on public companies.GeoInvesting, under The GeoTeam name, has been a Seeking Alpha contributor for nearly six years, and has published over 260 articles and Instablogs on Seeking Alpha. The team has over 26,000 followers.Recently, SA's George Moriarty conducted an email interview with Maj, focused on the sector. Enjoy! First, let's lay out exactly what you define as the small-cap space. Where is your floor and what is your ceiling for these stocks? The small-cap universe is generally defined as stocks that have market caps between $300 million and $500 million. However, market caps of the stocks we invest in are generally well below $300 million, and often below $50 million. We like investing in stocks that investors would probably define as micro-caps and nano-caps. When our firm does look outside the $300 million market cap limit, we try not to make it a habit of going too much higher than $500 million.As far as a floor goes, I really do not have one. I actually prefer tiny market cap companies, many of which trade on the pink sheets. Most of the stocks we purchase are less than $25 per share and have very simple, very limited share structures and share counts. We believe that some of our best opportunities are micro-cap names that often have revenues and earnings that are larger than one would expect from micro caps. We love these ""sleeper"" stocks, and we believe there's plenty of money to be made from them. We call these names ""big cap micros"" and feel this scenario tends to attract more rapid institutional support, a key factor for sustained positive share price momentum as the company grows and moves forward. What attracts you as an investor to focus on small-cap stocks? The reason I am attracted to smaller capitalized stocks today is the same as it was when I began to pursue my investment career in 1992: information arbitrage. An arbitrage exists when a disconnect between equity prices and the public information available on a company is noticeable and monetarily worth pursuing. Sometimes, the mispricing of microcaps can be substantial.The arbitrage opportunity exists because the pool of investors that choose to invest in these companies is much smaller than its larger counterparts, where the flow of information is quickly dissected by institutional investors, algorithms and analysts. In essence, investing in larger names means that you have to compete against a larger pool of investors that have better and quicker access to information than you. I never found chasing the herd after news breaks as a sustainable investing style.I would rather go where the masses don't, knowing that eventually value will be recognized in situations where it isn't priced in. This advantage has never been more prevalent than it is post-2008. The financial crisis and ensuing recession forced many funds that used to invest in micro-cap names to raise their market cap thresholds. Furthermore, the carnage levied upon retail investors (who, historically helped drive micro-cap share prices) have kept them from reentering the space.Here are some interesting statistics that show the retail investor fading from the world of micro-cap investing. The recent performance of various indices highlights the lack of interest in smaller cap names.The good news is that even after taking into account the Great Recession, with the proper research techniques, one can still outperform the U.S. averages with a smaller-cap strategy as indicated by the returns of the Markets Edge, a hedge fund I manage and GeoInvesting's GeoBargain selections (excluding China), which both embody a large exposure to micro-caps. Of the 62 GeoBargains we have highlighted since GeoInvesting's inception in 2007, around half of them have more than doubled during their tenure as a GeoBargain. Around 40 stocks that we have alerted our premium members of, mostly micro-caps, have been acquired. We believe this to be firsthand evidence that there's an ongoing significant opportunity investing in the micro-cap space.I should point out that while this new reality has created a valuation gap I rarely see, the length of time it is taking for many names to fill the gap has grown. This can be frustrating, but I am a firm believer that patience will allow the small investor to gain a competitive advantage in the market and with the proper research, hit many grand slams. The management teams of smaller companies are much more accessible than those of larger names if you are a non-institutional investor. For us, the ability to interview management and ""kick the tires"" can be priceless. Does the lack of 'traditional' research on so many of these stocks create more opportunities for professional investors? Yes, we see this as a huge advantage. It creates more of a valuation gap that investors can exploit with good research and an effective management interview process. Admittedly, it can be nice to have an analyst or institution eventually follow a portfolio holding if it brings new investors to the table. Are there any sectors that you favor, or avoid, when investing in this area? We are mostly an equal opportunity investor. We tend to stay away from sectors that are impacted by volatile forces, such as commodity plays or direct oil and gas exploration plays. However, the recent oil crisis has prompted us to look at a few select names where we've found some opportunity. While not a major part of our strategy, at times we like to try and identify stocks that will benefit from fads, or from passing trends that are vogue. For example, the unfortunate Ebola break out led us to pound the table on Lakeland Industries (  ) for a period of time which worked brilliantly for our members and inadvertently led us to find one of our newest GeoBargains, Ocean Bio-Chem (  ). Can you give us some of your favorite names, or themes, for the small-cap space as we head into 2015? Theme 1: I think 2015 is going to be an outstanding year for micro-cap investors. The last few years have been characterized by fits and starts in the space and rallies that have not been broad based. Even though our micro-cap selections provided above average returns for our portfolios in 2013 and 2014, it was by no means easy. Larger names once again dominated market rallies and carried premium valuation multiples that didn't permanently trickle down to micro-caps. We believe that this cannot last forever. Value has to win out with either higher stock prices, or an acceleration of mergers and acquisitions. We think 2015 could be one of the golden years for micro-caps, helped along by institutional investors finally giving the space a little more attention.Theme 2: The elimination of QE should give the economy a chance to improve on its own merits giving investors more confidence that companies do not require the Fed's juice to sustain growth. This should gradually give retail investors more of an appetite for risk, which in turn could help them reenter the microcap space.Theme 3: Our team loves finding stocks where activist investors have made their presence known. These have been some of the highest probability bets we have made over the past few years, and the awareness of this type of investing is growing. In fact, we only see it as continuing to grow as long as the micro-cap valuation gap persists.Some stocks we like for 2015:Ocean Bio-Chem (  ) - We are amazed at how cheap OBCI is. It manufactures, markets and distributes various appearance, performance, and maintenance products for the marine, automotive, power sports, recreational vehicle, and outdoor power equipment markets in the United States and Canada. It also produces private label formulations of its products for various customers and provides custom blending and packaging services for these and other products.The company is set to benefit from lower energy prices and the introduction of new products through an established distribution channel. We believe that lower energy prices should induce more boaters to use their boats. The company also gets a near-term ""double whammy"" effect in that its gross margins should improve due to lower raw material manufacturing costs. Even more exciting is that its SG&A should not rise in lock step with the company's improvement in sales. A little known fact is that the company's main asset, its state of the art facility, is underrepresented by $20 million on the company's balance sheet. The CEO reveals this information in a recent interview which we pointed out to our premium members. We think this stock is an easy double, and you can see more about the OBCI catalyst in this  post.Manitex International (  ) - Manitex operates through two segments: Lifting Equipment and Equipment Distribution. The Lifting Equipment segment designs, manufactures, and distributes boom trucks and crane products that are primarily used for industrial projects and energy exploration, as well as for infrastructure development.We just published a  on MNTX. We think a minimum price of $18 could be in the cards once the market prices in an acquisition that should close soon and the recent consummation of a Joint Venture transaction. We had previously coded MNTX as a GeoBargain with a related article on Seeking Alpha in 2012. Shares rose nearly 300% during their first tenure as a GeoBargain.Superior Uniform (  ): SGC manufactures and sells a range of uniforms, image apparel, and accessories primarily in the United States. The company operates through two segments, Uniforms and Related Products, and Remote Staffing Solutions.We love SGC. The industry dynamics are strong and the company has a solid history of successfully integrating acquisitions, while under promising and over delivering operationally. One only has to look at the long-term price performance chart of uniform giant Cintas Corporation (  ), which plays in a similar market space and is expected to see solid growth in 2015.SGC is a much smaller company than CTAS, with greater growth potential (since it is much smaller), which sells at a meaningfully lower 2015 P/E multiple based on the EPS we think SGC can achieve in 2015 (not taking into account future acquisitions). EPS and sales have grown for eight consecutive quarters, year over year, a trend we think will continue through 2015. We urge investors to read management's commentary from the  transcript. Management also just announced a 2 for 1 stock split, which we believe will help bring in some retail liquidity. We see immediate upside of 50% from current prices.See also  on seekingalpha.comThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@GeoInvesting's Maj Soueidan Positions For 2015: An Outstanding Year For Micro-Cap Investors@2015-01-08@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/geoinvestings-maj-soueidan-positions-2015-outstanding-year-micro-cap-investors-2015-01-08

"emember the cold snap of Q1? Well, spring wasn't far behind for the U.S. stock market but the shivers continued to be felt all year round on the international front. Still, the U.S. economy did not stop short of braving an uphill ride and 2014 turned out as another banner year for the country's stock market.So what were the challenges? A slowdown in China and other key emerging economies, turmoil in Russia, a struggling Europe, recession in Japan, geopolitical tensions and if these weren't enough, there was the biggest shocker -  plummeting.The resilient U.S. surprised with better job prospects, stepped-up economic activities, better-than-expected GDP numbers, improved business, renewed optimism in the housing recovery, rising wages and cheap fuel. In fact, the economy recorded back-to-back quarters of the strongest growth in over a decade and is now well on track for the best annual job growth since late 1999.Quite naturally, consumer sentiment jumped to 93.6 in December from 88.8 in November, as per Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan. The final reading represents the highest level in nearly eight years.While the overall gains were broad based, large caps actually led the way higher with the Nasdaq Composite, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average, returning respectively 15.1%, 12.6% and 8.9% this year. The S&P Mid Cap 400 Index gained 9.3% in the year while small cap stocks, as depicted by the Russell 2000 index, added 4.4%. Further, impressive performances came from almost all sectors save energy, which has been sliding with the plunge in oil prices.It's hard to pick star performers from many winners across sectors, yet we present 14 of 14. These are the 14 stocks that not only crushed the broad market returns by wide margins, but also have the potential to outperform in the New Year as well.So what makes these a cut above the rest? First, a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold). Second, a solid industry rank. Then, their positive earnings surprise in the last four quarters and finally, their positive earnings estimate revisions.This is quite a combination to look out for in stocks, especially for investors beefing up their portfolio in the final few days of this year. Take a quick look at the best 2014 stocks and their key metrics in the table below: 
  
Clearly, almost every sector gave a winner or two, but stocks in the airlines, computer and technology, and industrial products spaces outperformed per our criteria.The airlines industry is largely benefiting from lower fuel prices and a strengthening economy, and this trend is likely to continue in the next year as well. As per the International Air Transport Association (IATA), global airlines are expected to earn a profit of $25 billion in 2015, up from $19.9 billion projected for this year. Additionally, the airlines across the globe will likely see the strongest profit margin in more than five years in 2015 due to cheap oil and higher demand.While Hawaiian Holdings (  ), Southwest Airlines (  ) and American Airlines (  ) more than doubled this year and led the space, United Continental (  ) and Ryanair (  ) are expected to outperform in the coming months given all the favorable metrics.A number of industries in the broad computer and technology space has shown immense strength primarily on a flurry of mergers & acquisitions and rise in global IT spending. According to Gartner, global IT spending would grow 2.1% in 2014 and then rise to 3.7% in 2015.Most of the growth this year will likely come from enterprise software and IT services that are expected to grow 6.9% and 3.8%, respectively. Global spending on devices, including PCs, mobile phones and tablets, would grow 1.2% while other corners of the technology space - data center systems and telecom services - will likely see a rise in spending by 0.4% and 0.7%, respectively.In particular, semiconductors like  also enjoyed a strong rally on encouraging fundamentals, solid corporate earnings, strong outlook and investors' continued appreciation of value-centric traditional stocks.With the economy expanding at a solid clip, the industrial sector has been on the rise this year. This is especially true as manufacturing output climbed 4.8% in November over a one-year period and edged past its  seen in December 2007.Despite global slowdown concerns and a strong dollar, production has expanded across the board with manufacturers, utilities and mining working closer to full capacity in more than six years. This trend is likely to continue in the coming months giving a boost to the industrial stocks like Alcoa (  ), Taser International (  ) and Cintas (  ).As the U.S. economy is treading on a full-growth path and consumer confidence is rising, the stock market should continue to surge in 2015. Our choice of stocks also will, hopefully, be high fliers with above-market returns next year too.Be among the first to see  , a portfolio that consists of our Best-of-the-Best fundamentally sound long-term picks designed to perform in any type of market.

ne stock that might be an intriguing choice for investors right now is  (  ). This is because this security in the uniform and related industry space is seeing solid earnings estimate revision activity, and is in great company from a Zacks Industry Rank perspective.This is important because, often times, a rising tide will lift all boats in an industry, as there can be broad trends taking place in a segment that are boosting securities across the board. This is arguably taking place in the uniform and related industry space as it currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 4 out of more than 250 industries, suggesting it is well-positioned from this perspective, especially when compared to other segments out there.Meanwhile, Cintas is actually looking pretty good on its own too. The firm has seen solid earnings estimate revision activity over the past month, suggesting analysts are becoming a bit more bullish on the firm's prospects in both the short and long term.In fact, over the past month, current quarter estimates have risen from 76 cents per share to 79 cents per share, while current year estimates have risen from $3.14 per share to $3.27 per share. This has helped CTAS to earn a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), further underscoring the company's solid position.So, if you are looking for a decent pick in a strong industry, consider Cintas. Not only is its industry currently in the top third, but it is seeing solid estimate revisions as of late, suggesting it could be a very interesting choice for investors seeking a name in this great industry segment.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

torage and information management firm,  (  ) recently reached a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to resolve a civil complaint.Two civilians named Patrick McKillop and Brent Stanley levied charges against Iron Mountain under the False Claims Act in the Eastern District of California in Sacramento. They accused the company of overcharging federal agencies for record storage services. Per the settlement, Iron Mountain will be paying a sum of $44.5 million.This is not the first time that the company has had to cough up money for the settlement of such suits. In 2013, Iron Mountain had to pay $800K for the settlement of a whistleblower suit, according to which it failed to adhere with government rules for the shredding of documents.We believe that the settlement will enable Iron Mountain to maintain its customer relationships with federal agencies, which in turn, will prevent the loss of customers and thereby, revenues.Meanwhile, Recall Holdings has rejected Iron Mountain's $2.2 billion bid citing it to be too low. However, Recall Holdings declared that it was open for further discussions going forward, provided Iron Mountain came up with a better offer.Since the beginning of 2014, the company has invested approximately $150 million to acquire international records and information management related businesses. Additionally, it has invested $12 million in 2014 to acquire the records inventory of 11 document storage companies, including 10 organizations in North America and one in Belgium. The company's aggressive acquisition policy should therefore help it to extend its foothold across emerging markets, which, in turn will drive top line growth going forward.We believe that Iron Mountain's strong product portfolio, increasing market share and promising international business are its primary growth catalysts. Moreover, the company's entry into the data center market could act as a positive.However, costs related to conversion and fluctuations in recycled paper prices are the near-term headwinds for the company. Moreover, volatile foreign exchange rates and competition from Guidance Software Inc. (  ), Pitney Bowes Inc. (  ) and Cintas Corp. (  ) are the other headwinds.Currently, Iron Mountain has a Zacks Rank # 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

 (  ) is scheduled to report its second-quarter 2015 results after the closing bell on Dec 18. In the last reported quarter, Cintas' earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Cintas aims to continually achieve revenue build-up by increasing penetration levels at existing customers and by broadening customer base to include business segments that are not historically served. Cintas recently announced the sale of its Document Storage and Imaging businesses for approximately $180 million. The company intends to offload its non-core businesses and shift focus to high growth businesses, thus restructuring its portfolio in an effective manner.Also, a more favorable pricing scenario and cost-streamlining initiatives are expected to drive incremental margins going forward. Cintas' rental location in Fayetteville, NC, received the Carolina Star certification from the North Carolina Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) for its security commitment. These awards and recognitions raise the company's goodwill among its clients and further strengthen its leading position in the market.Cintas approved an annual dividend of 85 cents per share, which represents a 10.4% increase over last year's annual dividend of 77 cents per share. Additionally, the company approved an additional special dividend of 85 cents per share. The company has consistently returned cash to shareholders through stable dividend payouts and share repurchases.However, Cintas procures raw materials from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers, making it susceptible to market risks, which are beyond its control.U.S. and foreign trade policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, trade sanctions, and limitations on the imports of certain types of goods also escalate product costs and adversely affect its operations.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Cintas will beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below. :  , which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is pegged at 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and Zacks Consensus Estimate currently stand at 78 cents. : Cintas' Zacks Rank #2 when combined with 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult. We caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 and #5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the imminent future.Arch Capital Group Ltd.

"ource: Cintas.Some of the best companies in the stock market are in businesses that most investors neglect.  is a perfect example, with its specialty of putting its customers' employees into specialty uniforms opening the door to slow but steady long-term growth that has rewarded shareholders greatly over the years. Recently Cintas has seen its overall revenue growth slow down, but coming into Thursday afternoon's fiscal second-quarter earnings report, Cintas had managed to keep its profits moving in the right direction. Based on today's results, Cintas is still doing a great job of doing more with less, but long-term investors still have to ask how long the company can keep finding ways to boost its bottom line without bringing in more business. Let's look at Cintas and its results to find out what's happening with the uniform provider right now.Cintas produced headline numbers that were consistent with its recent history of results. On the revenue front, Cintas managed to bring in $1.12 billion, which was flat compared to the year-ago quarter. Moreover, when you exclude the impact of the document shredding business, for which the company didn't include any revenue this year, Cintas actually saw considerable growth of almost 7% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2014.Earnings looked even more favorable. Cintas earned $1 per share during the quarter, crushing last year's $0.69 per share of adjusted EPS from continuing operations. Even when you exclude the $0.14-per-share benefit from the sale of its document storage and imaging business, Cintas produced more than 24% growth in EPS from last year's figure.Source: Cintas.Looking in more detail at its business segments, Cintas got extremely good results from its uniform rental division as well as its first aid, safety, and fire protection segment. Uniform rental revenue climbed more than 8% on an organic basis, while the safety segment gained at an even more impressive 12% clip. Only the uniform sales front suffered, with a roughly 3% drop in organic revenue compared to last year's quarter.For the most part, Cintas celebrated the results. CEO Scott Farmer believes that his employees ""have executed our game plan very effectively, and we are focused on continuing these efforts during the second half of fiscal 2015.""Even better for shareholders was the fact that Cintas raised its guidance for the full fiscal year. Now, Cintas expects to bring in between $4.45 billion and $4.5 billion in revenue for the year, with current investor expectations falling toward the bottom of that range. Cintas' earnings guidance was even more powerfully bullish, with new guidance of $3.49 to $3.54 per share easily topping the $3.15 per share that investors currently expect the company to produce.Source: Cintas.Yet Farmer was somewhat measured in his outlook. ""We view the state of the U.S. economy as fairly fragile given numerous factors globally and within the U.S.,"" said Farmer in the company press release, ""and are hesitant to turn too optimistic. However, we have been pleased with the recent U.S. economic performance and look forward to this current state continuing into the second half of our fiscal year."" If that success  carry through in calendar 2015, then Cintas could easily get the support it needs to push even higher into record-high territory for its stock.From a macroeconomic standpoint, the state of the U.S. employment market has been supportive for Cintas, which relies on hiring to help drive new uniform sales and rentals. With nonfarm payrolls soaring by 321,000 jobs in November, a healthy employment picture can only help Cintas going forward.Cintas certainly made traders happy with its results, as the stock climbed more than 3% in after-hours trading within the first half-hour after the announcement. If the U.S. economy keeps firing on all cylinders, then Cintas should have plenty of potential to push to further highs for its share price in the weeks and months ahead. 2015 is shaping up to be another great year for stocks.

The 24.6% year-over-year increase in earnings was primarily attributable to increased cost efficiency that led to operating margin expansion. The adjusted earnings for the reported quarter also comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 78 cents.On a GAAP basis, Cintas reported net income of $120.4 million or $1.00 per share compared with $84.9 million or 70 cents per share in the year-earlier quarter.Quarterly revenues remained steady year over year at $1.1 billion, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

Adjusted operating income in the reported quarter climbed 20.7% year over year to $181.6 million. Operating margin was 16.2%, 190 basis points higher than 14.3% in the year-earlier quarter.Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenues for the quarter improved 7.6% year over year to $865.4 million, driven by the improved pricing environment. The segment accounted for 77.0% of the total revenue, with organic growth of 8.1%. Gross margin increased to 44.8% from 42.9% in the year-ago quarter due to improved operating efficiency.Revenues for Uniform Direct Sales were $117.5 million (down 3.6% year over year), as lower sales to national accounts continued to be a drag. The segment accounted for 10.5% of the company's revenues. First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services revenues improved 12.7% to $140.5 million, representing 12.5% of the company's total revenue.During the quarter, Cintas sold its Document Storage and Imaging businesses in three separate transactions to three separate buyers for an aggregate sum of approximately $180 million. Consequently, the company classified its Document Storage and Imaging businesses as discontinued operations in this quarter. The transactions marked the exit of the company from this business line.Cintas has a solid financial position with adequate liquidity. Cash and cash equivalents stood at $826.7 million at quarter end. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $44.5 million.Long-term debt remained steady at $1.3 billion.

Free cash flow for the first six months of fiscal 2015 increased to $179.4 million from $145.5 million in the prior-year period.In concurrence with second-quarter fiscal 2015 results, Cintas revised its fiscal guidance taking into account the volatile yet somewhat positive and improving economic environment. For fiscal 2015, Cintas increased its revenue guidance to the range of $4.45 billion-$4.50 billion from its previous guidance of $4.40 billion-$4.475 billion.Earnings guidance for fiscal 2015 was also revised upward from its earlier range of $3.20-3.29 per share to $3.49-$3.54.Cintas continues to deliver organic growth through superior execution of its operational plans. The company expects to build strong momentum in the coming quarters as it focuses on its rental first aid and direct sale businesses. We remain encouraged by the company's relatively strong quarterly performance and bullish guidance.Cintas currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Cintas () is a leading manufacturer and seller of uniforms to both small and large service and manufacturing companies. CTAS also provides cleaning supplies and services to its customers. Cintas has a  and triggered a Momentum Breakout Buy based on Friday’s jump in price, which was in response to a very positive earnings report released after the close on Thursday.The company beat analyst estimates for both revenue and earnings per share in the 2nd quarter report and guided sharply higher for the full year 2015. They are estimating earnings for 2015 of $3.49 - $3.54 vs. analyst estimates of $3.15 per share. This sharp increase in guidance has resulted in a flood of analyst upgrades with price targets being raised as well. Since analyst earnings estimate changes are the single biggest driver of short-term price movement, expect CTAS to continue to outperform the market in the weeks ahead.In the fiscal 2015 2nd quarter, Cintas reported earnings per share of $0.86, a 25% increase over the same quarter last year and beat analyst estimates of $0.78. CTAS increased their net operating margins from 14.3% to 16.2%, which should result in a higher Price/Earnings ratio and higher price targets as Wall Street analysts respond to the very positive fiscal 2nd quarter report.It is normal for a stock like Cintas that spikes higher on a positive earnings surprise to consolidate those gains in a sideways to slightly lower price move before making further gains. Buy CTAS on any short-term pullbacks.Cintas has a very bullish Power Gauge stock rating which is driven by increasingly bullish analyst opinions, very strong price/volume activity and very bullish earnings performance. The company has grown earnings consistently over the past 5 years and the recent increase in earnings guidance for 2015 suggests an acceleration of that trend. Two other factors are interesting in the Power Gauge rating. The insiders have been buying CTAS, which contributes to the Very Bullish Expert Opinion component of the Power Gauge Rating, and there is a relatively large short position that could add fuel to the fire as short sellers cover their positions before year-end.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Stock of the Week: Cintas (CTAS)@2014-12-22@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/stock-week-cintas-ctas-2014-12-22

"t's easy to identify industry bellwethers. They are often the largest or most dynamic leaders in their sectors, tipping the rest of the market off on the state of the industry. A bellwether's strong or weak report can move the shares of its rivals. It's just what an industry tastemaker does.What about corporate America? There are several stocks that provide a good glimpse into the state of our country's economy. Let's take a look at some of these companies that investors should be watching even if they don't own them.The leading provider of workplace uniforms is a pretty fair proxy for hiring practices. If companies are increasing or decreasing the number of employees it should reflect in the number of uniforms that Cintas is providing.Cintas does more than just corporate identity apparel. It also provides rubber entrance mats, bathroom supplies, and other company essentials.Cintas reported quarterly results on Monday. Revenue only inched 0.2% higher to $1.1 billion, but that's not a fair indicator of its actual performance. It unloaded its document shredding service back in April. Back that out and organic revenue moved a more encouraging 7.2% higher.This doesn't mean that companies have 7% more uniformed workers around. Prices move up. Cintas gets companies to spend more on other product lines and services. Cintas also gobbles up market share. There will never be a perfect proxy for a country's economy, but Cintas comes fairly close.Naturally there's plenty of hiring out there for jobs that don't involve wearing uniforms that Cintas cleans and replenishes every week or so. That's where staffing specialists kick in as a great dipstick for the economy.Through ManpowerGroup's many subsidiaries -- Experis, Manpower, Right Management, and ManpowerGroup Solutions -- it helps source and develop talent for 400,000 clients worldwide. It also connects more than 600,000 individuals a year to workplace opportunities.ManpowerGroup reports fresh financial results later this month. Analysts see revenue climbing at a 5% clip this year and again come 2015.Let's talk construction equipment. Caterpillar is the major player in construction and mining equipment. From backhoes to excavators, Caterpillar is responsible for a lot of moving ground.Caterpillar saw sales of its heavy machinery slide 10% in August, but that was the handiwork of weakness abroad. Machinery sales actually improved 8% in North America. If Caterpillar's holding up well it's a good sign that construction activity is picking up. That naturally is a fair indicator of near-term optimism.The ability for companies and consumers to spring for speedy parcel and document deliveries is another great proxy for the economy that investors can find in FedEx's results.Analysts see revenue climbing 5% in its latest fiscal year that began in June. FedEx also announced a couple of weeks ago that its shipping rates will be increasing by nearly 5% across many categories, but let's not assume that the increase in rates is what's driving revenue growth at FedEx. As the economy improves more people turn to FedEx.Jim Cramer isn't always right, but he nailed it last year when he called Netflix a  .""As more homes are built, cable, dish and Netflix get hooked up,"" he said on CNBC's  . ""It's a natural tailwind. When you buy that new TV it has that Netflix clicker on the bottom.""Netflix may be a better gauge than cable or satellite television subscriptions for the state of the housing industry these days. The pay TV industry has actually been taking a breather lately, as younger home owners cut the cord and rely on streaming content. Netflix is now the better indicator.One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World-Wide-Web to bed. And if you act right away, it could make you wildly rich. Experts are calling it the single largest business opportunity in the history of capitalism...  is calling it ""transformative""... But you'll probably just call it ""how I made my millions.""

"Source: Cintas. refuses to give props to macro factors as it toots its own horn following continued great results. But that's good! It's better to have a company that is leading the pack in an industry rather than merely keeping up with it.On Sept. 29, Cintas reported its fiscal first-quarter results. Organic revenue increased 7.2% to $1.1 billion in the period ending Aug. 31. Operating income soared 17.1% to $163.5 million, with earnings per share of $0.93 (including about $0.15 of one-time gains). Revenue hit analyst expectations, but adjusted EPS of $0.78 beat the $0.75 estimate.In the earnings press release, CEO Scott D. Farmer credited ""continued good execution"" by Cintas' employees, whom he referred to as ""partners."" Farmer continued: ""We have focused on selling good, profitable business over the past few years, as well as managing our cost structure and continuously improving the efficiency of our processes. This focus has resulted in improved margins and better customer retention."" Source: CintasIn the earnings release, Farmer noted that profit margins improved in each of Cintas' businesses, which include manufacturing uniforms and fire protection products, the result ofbetter efficiency and more leverage of fixed costs spread out across a higher sales base. While he gave no credit to the economy by referring to ""inconsistent employment figures"" and ""heightened global uncertainty,"" Farmer increased the earnings guidance due to the company's successful efforts.Just two months ago, Cintas guided for fiscal 2015 to show revenue of between $4.425 billion and $4.525 billion, along with EPS between $3.06 and $3.15. Now the estimate is for slightly less revenue of between $4.4 billion and $4.475 billion but EPS was raised materially to between $3.20 and $3.29. Analysts had full-year EPS pegged at $3.09.Look for guidance to continue to climb the corporate ladder CFO Bill Gale might have let the cat out of the bag that results will be even better than the new guidance. Discussing the new outlook during the Q&A session of the quarterly conference call, he stated: ""It could be a bit conservative on our part, but there has been ongoing inconsistency in the jobs reports. We still are seeing reluctance in the part of many of our customers to expand our operations, to add employees."" Gale seemingly excluded any potential benefit from gains in headcounts. He said Cintas is growing mostly from new clients rather than higher orders from current clients, and also from ""a better pricing environment.""Source: Cintas.Better pricing is code for raising prices on its customers. It's an excellent sign, though Gale cautioned, ""I don't want to create a belief that we just have really skyrocketed prices we haven't, but we certainly have been able to get more of a price increase than we have since the end of the recession.""Cintas is gaining market share by landing new customers while also seeing some pricing power. If the company is doing this well in a sluggish industry the company could improve operations if the economy improves some more. A bet on Cintas is a bet on the job market, along with some downside risk protection based on its excellent execution.

 is a dividend aristocrat, which means it has continuously increased its dividend payout every year for the past 25 years or more. Investing in reliable  such as those on the aristocrat list is a rewarding way to unlock exceptional returns for years on end. For Cintas shareholders, this translates into a steady stream of reoccurring income. It is in this spirit that we will look at the underlying fundamentals of Cintas' business to uncover whether it is a rewarding stock to buy today. Cintas is a leader in the commercial services and supplies industry, providing products and services to more than one million businesses today. This is important because it means no single customer accounts for more than 1% of the company's annual revenue. Cintas is now the largest supplier of corporate uniforms in North America, providing clothes for more than 5 million people each workday. In fiscal 2014, sales from rental uniforms and ancillary products accounted for more than 70% of Cintas' total revenue, followed by 11% from first aid and fire protection services, 10% from direct sales of uniforms, and 7.9% from document management services.Source: Cintas.Thanks to its market-leading position and strong revenue channels, Cintas has been able to reward shareholders with dividends every year since it first hit the public market in 1983. Moreover, the company has increased its payout every year for the past 31 years running.In December, the company increased its dividend by more than 20% and now pays an annual cash dividend of $0.77 per share, with a dividend yield of 1.09%. Cintas spent $93.3 billion on dividends last year, though that seems reasonable when compared to the $4.6 billion the company generated in revenue over that period.Additionally, with a payout ratio of just 14%, Cintas should have no problem continuing to reward its shareholders with cash dividends for many years to come. The payout ratio is important because it tells investors how much of the company's net income is being given back to shareholders. In Cintas' case, at a modest 14% of the company's net income, management still has ample cash on hand to invest in growing the business.The stock's dividend yield of 1.09%, on the other hand, leaves a lot to be desired. This is significantly below both the industry average and the S&P 500's dividend yield today. True, chasing high yields can be dangerous. However, there are plenty of reliable dividend aristocrat stocks currently available to investors with much richer payouts. Therefore, despite Cintas getting top marks for reliability, it isn't the best place for investors to put new money today. The smartest investors know that dividend stocks simply crush their non-dividend paying counterparts over the long term. That's beyond dispute. They also know that a well-constructed dividend portfolio creates wealth steadily, while still allowing you to sleep like a baby.

ne stock that might be an intriguing choice for investors right now is  (  ). This is because this security in the uniform and related industry space is seeing solid earnings estimate revision activity, and is in great company from a Zacks Industry Rank perspective.This is important because, often times, a rising tide will lift all boats in an industry, as there can be broad trends taking place in a segment that are boosting securities across the board. This is arguably taking place in the uniform and related industry space as it currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 11 out of more than 250 industries, suggesting it is well-positioned from this perspective, especially when compared to other segments out there.Meanwhile, Cintas is actually looking pretty good on its own too. The firm has seen solid earnings estimate revision activity over the past month, suggesting analysts are becoming a bit more bullish on the firm's prospects in both the short and long term.In fact, over the past month, current quarter estimates have risen from 76 cents per share to 78 cents per share, while current year estimates have risen from $3.08 per share to $3.13 per share. This has helped CTAS to earn a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), further underscoring the company's solid position.So, if you are looking for a decent pick in a strong industry, consider Cintas. Not only is its industry currently in the top third, but it is seeing solid estimate revisions as of late, suggesting it could be a very interesting choice for investors seeking a name in this great industry segment.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

rotesters in Hong Kong extended the blockade on Tuesday and prepared for the return of riot police as Chinese National Day approached.Over the weekend, police attempted to clear the protesters using pepper spray and tear gas before withdrawing on Monday.The government asked protesters to disperse peacefully, but instead the tens of thousands of people began to stockpile supplies and create more barricades, indicating that their fight for full democracy was far from over.In news around the markets:Data Show Increased U.S. SpendingConsumer spending data out on Monday suggested that the U.S. economy is set to grow steadily in the third quarter. The report showed that U.S. household spending increased by 0.5 percent from July to August, and that spending was up 4.1 percent from last year's figures. The figures fall in line with most economists expectations for solid U.S. GDP growth in the third quarter.Ukrainian Ceasefire Under PressureThe ceasefire in Ukraine faced more challenges after the Ukrainian military announced that separatist rebels' fire in Donetsk killed seven soldiers. The fighting took place near the Donetsk airport, the only part of the city still held by nationalist forces, and served as a reminder that the Ukrainian conflict is not yet over.Albertsons Supermarkets Suffer From Data BreachAB Acquisition LLC announced that customer data from some of its Albertsons supermarkets may have been compromised due to a hacking incident.

n Monday, riot police withdrew in Hong Kong after nearly 80,000 people took to the streets over the weekend protesting China's limited democracy rule in the former British colony.Hong Kong has been ruled as a part of China but allowed a limited democracy since 1997. Now, protesters are demanding a full democracy and the ability to nominate their own political candidates. Police clashed with protesters for three nights over the weekend, but withdrew amid relative calm on Monday afternoon.Hong Kong government officials have asked protesters to disperse peacefully, but some say they will continue to fight for their rights. China will be toeing a fine line in fighting this uprising as too strong of a response would diminish investor confidence in Hong Kong, a global business and financial hub.In other news around the markets:Airstrikes In Syria ContinueOver the weekend, a U.S.-led coalition continued with airstrikes in northern Syria in an effort to stem Islamic militants' advances across the Middle East. The strikes are said to have hit and damaged three oil refineries used by ISIS, something the U.S. is hoping will help cut the group's funding. However, information on the impact of the airstrikes has been limited, and reports that the group continued its advance into a Kurdish town near the border of Turkey suggests that this offensive could drag on for an extended period.Fed Official Shares Concern Over Bank's PlanOn Sunday, the Federal Reserve's Richard Fisher admitted that he is worried about the bank's plans for a rate hike, saying that the Fed could wait too long and make financial markets unstable. Fisher cautioned that as the U.S. economy continues to pick up, the Fed will need to reconsider its timeline for a rate hike.SoftBank Looks To Acquire DreamWorksSoftBank Corp (OTC:  ) has begun talks to take over DreamWorks Animation Skg Inc (NASDAQ:  ), something that would provide SoftBank with even more exclusive content. The talks came just weeks after SoftBank abandoned its efforts to acquire T-Mobile in August. While no details about the negotiations have been released yet, Dreamworks' current market value is around $2 million.Lenovo Moves Closer To Closing IBM DealLenovo Group Ltd has given October 1 as the date it will close its acquisition of the International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:  ) x86 server division. The deal, valued at $2.1 billion, will likely give Lenovo a leg up in the market and help the company continue to diversify as the personal computer market wanes.Asian MarketsAsian markets were mixed. Protests in Hong Kong brought the Hang Seng index down 1.90 percent, and the KOSPI also fell 0.25 percent.

usiness services provider  (  ) is scheduled to report its first-quarter fiscal 2015 results after the closing bell on Sep 29. In the last reported quarter, Cintas marginally beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.33%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Cintas had divested its Document Shredding business by forming a new partnership with the shareholders of privately-held document management firm Shred-it International Inc. The agreement provides for the formation of a new company, 42% of which will be owned by Cintas and 58% by the shareholders of Shred-it. Cintas will record its 42% share of the partnership income within SG&A line on the income statement and will no longer record the revenue from this business under its Document Management Services segment.Cintas continues to deliver organic growth through superior execution of its operational plans. The company witnessed top-line growth across all the segments except Uniform Direct Sales in the last reported quarter and expects to continue this in the coming quarters as well.Cintas' expansion through higher penetration levels and broadening of the customer base including business segments that are not historically served, augur well for its growth prospects. During the recession, Cintas had undertaken initiatives to enhance its operations by evaluating sales force productivity, optimizing routes and streamlining labor overhead. The company returned to year-over-year rental organic revenue growth in mid-2010 and has continued on the growth trajectory since then.However, an increase in raw material costs and challenging macroeconomic conditions could weigh on the margins going forward. A continuous increase in raw material costs such as cotton, due to global headwinds, may weigh on the margins going forward. Cintas procures raw materials from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers, making it susceptible to market risks, which are beyond its control.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Cintas is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or at least #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, this is not the case here as elaborated below.Negative Earnings ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is currently pegged at -3.95%. This indicates a likely miss in earnings.Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy): Cintas' Zacks Rank #1 tilts the predictive power of ESP in the positive direction. However, when combined with -3.95% ESP, surprise prediction becomes difficult. The Sell rated stocks (#4 and #5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the future.Alcoa Inc. (  ), earnings ESP of +15.79% and Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Johnson & Johnson (  ), earnings ESP of +4.93% and Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Progressive Corp. (  ), earnings ESP of +2.33% and Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

"The 2014 Q3 earnings season has gotten underway, with results from 17 members of S&P 500 members already out. All of these early reporters have fiscal quarters ending in August and some of them are notable industry leaders.It is way too early to draw even preliminary conclusions from the results thus far. But as the table below of early reporters shows, 64.7% of the total (11 out of 17) have beat EPS estimates while 70.6% have come out with positive revenue surprises. Top line surprises stood out in the last quarter as well, though it's premature to say what we will get this time around.The focus this week is on economic data, with the September jobs report coming out on Friday. There is not much on the earnings front, with less than two dozen companies coming out with results, including four (4) S&P 500 members. As the chart below shows, we are still about two weeks away from a full ramp up in the reporting cycle. But the Q3 earnings season will start getting attention with the  (  ) report on October 8th.This earnings season will give us a good sense of whether the profitability strength on display in the last reporting cycle was a one-off event or the start of something enduring. Please recall that part of the Q2 strength was a bounce back from the extremely low levels to which all activity levels had fallen in the weather-disrupted first quarter of the year. As such, one could argue that none of the last two earnings seasons represented truly normal conditions, which we will most likely see for the first time this year only in Q3.The table below shows a summary picture of current Q3 expectations compared to what was actually achieved in Q2. As you can see, total earnings are expected to be up +1.2% from the same period last year on +1.5% higher revenues and modest margin gains. Finance remains a big drag this quarter, with total earnings for the sector expected to be down -4.5% from the same period last year. Excluding Finance, total earnings for the S&P 500 would be up +2.6%.As has been the trend each quarter ahead of the start of the earnings season, estimates for Q3 have come down as well as the quarter unfolded. The recent leg down in estimates has mostly been due to Bank of America (  ), with the bank's settlement with the government causing its Q3 EPS estimates to drop from positive 32 cents to the current 8 cents loss. In dollar terms, that's a $4.2 billion negative swing in Bank of America's Q3 earnings estimates.The chart below shows estimates for 2014 Q3 have evolved over the last 10 or so weeks.The negative revisions trend has been broad based, with most sectors suffering downward adjustments in estimates. But the trend has been most pronounced for Oil/Energy, Retail, and Consumer Disc. The chart below shows the sectors with the biggest revisions. The Finance sector swing is primarily due to Bank of America.Total earnings for the S&P 500 reached an all-time quarterly record in 2014 Q2 and current estimates for Q3 put the quarterly total as the second highest ever. But given the historical trend of roughly two-thirds of the companies beating earnings estimates, the final Q3 tally will likely be right in the preceding quarter's record vicinity. The chart below shows that current consensus estimates reflect record tallies in the following quarters.For these estimates to hold, we need an improvement on the guidance front, which has been persistently been weak for almost two years now. There was modest improvement in tone of management guidance on the Q2 earnings calls, but the majority of companies providing guidance still guided lower. That said, continuation of even the modest improvement in guidance will be a net positive in the overall earnings picture. :  : For a complete analysis of 2014 Q3 estimates, please check out weekly  .

 (  ), the worldwide producer and distributor of agricultural and forestry equipment, construction equipment and engines, is slated to report third-quarter fiscal 2014 results before the market opens on Aug 13, 2014. In the last quarter, it posted a positive surprise of 10.42%. However, on an average, Deere has posted a 7.81% negative surprise in the last four quarters. Let's see how things are shaping up for the second quarter.Deere reported second-quarter fiscal 2014 earnings of $2.65 a share, down 4% due to lower shipment volumes, unfavorable effects of foreign-currency exchange, and a less favorable product mix partially offset benefits from price realization and a lower effective tax rate.For the third quarter of fiscal 2014, Deere expects equipment sales to decrease around 4% year over year. For the fiscal 2014, Deere trimmed its forecast by 4% from the previous expectation of a 3% dip. Deere, however, maintained its net income projection of $3.3 billion for fiscal 2014.Segment-wise, Deere projects Agriculture and Turf equipment sales to decline 7% for fiscal 2014, down from the previous expectation of a 6% drop. This includes a negative currency translation effect of about 1%. Farm incomes are expected to be lower than 2013, which will have a dampening effect on demand for large farm equipmentImproved market conditions in the U.S and Canada will drive growth in sales of turf and utility equipment. Global sales for Construction & Forestry equipment will benefit from recovery in the U.S. economy and a rise in housing starts. Global forestry sales growth will be driven by economic development and higher sales in the European markets.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Deere is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below. Deere has an Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) of 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at $2.19 per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate, resulting in 0.00% ESP. Deere has a Zacks Rank #3 which when combined with a 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with Zacks Rank #4 and #5 (Sell rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings surprise:G&K Services Inc. (  ) has an earnings ESP of +4.11% and a Zacks Rank #3.Quanex Building Products Corporation (  ) has an earnings ESP of +4.76% and a Zacks Rank #3.Cintas Corporation (  ) has an earnings ESP of +1.32% and a Zacks Rank #3.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

 (  ) reported second-quarter 2014 adjusted earnings from continuing operations of 41 cents per share, which comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 29 cents. Earnings per share improved 4.1% from the year-ago quarter due to modest revenue growth.Revenues increased 4.3% from the year-ago quarter to $786.9 million and managed to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $774.0 million. Revenues increased due to higher storage rental revenues of $466.9 million (up 5.7% year over year) and higher service revenues of $320.0 million (up 2.3% year over year) in the reported quarter.Growth in the North American Records and Information Management (RIM) and Data Management (DM) segments of 3.3% and 0.4%, respectively, also drove resultsOf late, with the increasing usage of Internet, Iron Mountain's service revenue growth rate has been on a decline due to lower activity rates as stored records are becoming less active. Second quarter internal service revenue declined 1.9% on a year-over-year basis due to lower project fees and revenue associated with customer terminations in North America.Gross profit was $449.9 million compared with $433.3 million in the prior-year quarter. Gross margin declined 20 bps to 57.2% in the reported quarter.Adjusted OIBDA (operating income before depreciation and amortization) decreased 10 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 30.7% in the reported quarter. Year-to- date, adjusted OIBDA includes $3.6 million of restructuring costs incurred in 2013 and $3.9 million of Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) compliance costs.Operating expenses decreased 130 bps on a year-over-year basis to $639.6 million, driven by lower selling, general & administrative expenses (down 260 bps on a year over year basis).Operating income in the quarter increased 12% from the year-ago quarter to $147.3 million primarily due to lower operating expense. Net income from continuing operations was $78.9 million or 41 cents per share versus $75.4 million or 39 cents per share reported in the previous-year quarter.Iron Mountain exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $145.3 million compared with $169.9 million at the end of the previous quarter. Long-term debt was $4.29 billion.Since the beginning of 2014, the company has acquired five international storage related businesses and the records inventory of nine other document storage companies for a total sum of $72 million. During the second quarter, the company extended its presence in the emerging market of Brazil and solidified its position in the United States by acquiring customers in New Orleans, Philadelphia and Buffalo.Iron Mountain believes that these acquisitions will help it to establish itself as a market leader and trusted partner for customers who seek to protect and manage their information efficiently.During the quarter, Iron Mountain acquired unanimous approval from its Board of Directors relating to its conversion to a REIT with effect from the taxable year commencing Jan 1, 2014.However, in light of the new development, Iron Mountain is likely to distribute between $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion to shareholders from its accumulated earnings and profits as per the REIT regulations. Moreover, the company will publicly announce a record date and payment date for the 2014 Special Distribution as determined by the board of directors.We believe that this conversion, in turn will definitely enhance shareholders' value as well as reduce the tax burden of the company.On account of its conversion to a REIT, the company has provided a revised guidance for 2014. Management expects revenues to range between $3.09 billion and $3.17 billion while the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $3.12 billion.Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.37 and $1.52 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.43 happens to be lower than the mid point of the guided range.Annual dividend is expected to be between $400 million and $420 million while free cash flow is expected to range from $350 million to $390 million.We believe that Iron Mountain's strong product portfolio, increasing market share and promising international business are the primary growth catalysts. Moreover, the company's entry into the data center market could act as a positive factor.However, costs related to conversion and fluctuations in recycled paper prices are the near-term headwinds for the company. Moreover, volatile foreign exchange rates and competition from Guidance Software Inc. (  ), Pitney Bowes Inc (  ) and Cintas Corp. (  ) are the other headwinds.Currently, IRM has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

 (  ) reported first-quarter fiscal 2015 (ended Aug 31, 2014) adjusted earnings of 78 cents per share versus 62 cents in the year-ago quarter, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 76 cents per share. The 25.8% year-over-year increase in earnings was primarily attributable to increased cost efficiency that led to operating margin expansion.Adjusted net income for the reported quarter came in at $92.4 million, up 20.8% compared with $76.5 million in the year-earlier quarter.Quarterly revenues remained steady year over year at $1.1 billion, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Organic growth (adjusted for the impact of acquisitions) was impressive at 7.2%.Operating income in the reported quarter climbed 17.1% year over year to $163.5 million. Operating margin was 14.8%, 140 basis points higher than 12.4% in the year-earlier quarter. revenues for the quarter improved 8.1% year over year to $856.9 million driven by the improved pricing environment. The segment accounted for 78% of the total revenue, with organic growth of 8.1%. Gross margin increased to 45.1% from 42.6% in the year-ago quarter due to improved operating efficiency.Revenues for  were $105.1 million (down 2.2% year over year), as lower sales to Fortune 1000 national accounts continued to be a drag. The segment accounted for 9% of the company's revenues. Gross margin was 29%, up from 27.7% in the year-ago quarter, as the higher-margin hospitality business had more weight in the company's sales mix. revenues climbed 11.3% to $140.1 million, representing 13% of the company's total revenue. Gross margin remained relatively steady year over year at 43.7%. Organic growth for the segment came in at 10.1%.During the last quarter, Cintas divested its Document Shredding business by forming a new partnership with the shareholders of privately-held document management firm Shred-it International Inc. The agreement provides for the formation of a new company, 42% of which will be owned by Cintas and 58% by the shareholders of Shred-it. The new entity will operate under the Shred-it brand, combining the Document Shredding businesses of both the companies and is expected to have annual revenues in excess of $600 million.Effective from this quarter, Cintas will record its 42% share of the partnership income within SG&A line on the income statement and will no longer record the revenue from this business under its Document Management Services segment. During the first quarter of fiscal 2015, there was no impact from the partnership on the results.Cintas has a solid financial position with adequate liquidity. Cash and cash equivalents stood at $581.4 million at quarter-end. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $68.5 million. Cintas expects capital expenditures for fiscal 2015 to be in the range of $275 million to $325 million.Long-term debt remained steady at $1.3 billion.

usiness services provider  (  ) is scheduled to report its fourth-quarter fiscal 2014 results after the closing bell on Jul 15. In the last reported quarter, Cintas marginally missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.43%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Cintas continues to deliver organic growth through superior execution of its operational plans. The company witnessed top-line growth across all the segments except Uniform Direct Sales in the last reported quarter and expects to continue this in the coming quarters as well.Cintas' expansion through higher penetration levels and broadening of customer base including business segments that are not historically served, augur well for its growth prospects. During the recession, Cintas had undertaken initiatives to enhance its operations by evaluating sales force productivity, optimizing routes and streamlining labor overhead. The company returned to year-over-year rental organic revenue growth in mid-2010 and has continued on the growth trajectory since then.However, an increase in raw material costs and challenging macroeconomic conditions could weigh on the margins going forward. A continuous increase in raw material costs such as cotton, due to global headwinds, may weigh on the margins going forward. Cintas procures raw materials from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers, making it susceptible to market risks, which are beyond its control.A solitary earnings estimate revision for the soon-to-be-reported quarter and fiscal has moved down in the last 7 days without any upward revision. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter as well as for fiscal 2014 has remained unchanged over the same time frame.Despite the downtrend, our proven model does not conclusively show that Cintas is likely to miss earnings this quarter as it retains a mixed bag of key ingredients required for a success recipe.Negative  : Expected Surprise Prediction or ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is at -1.33%. This indicates a likely miss in earnings.Zacks Rank #3 (Hold): Cintas' Zacks Rank #3 when combined with -1.33% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult. Note that stocks with Zacks Ranks of #1, #2 and #3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. The Sell rated stocks (#4 and #5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the future.

ith Citigroup's (  ) decisive earnings win this Monday morning, traders have finally made up their mind as to how they feel about this  , and they feel good. Still, the trickle of earnings we have seen so far amounts to little more than a last minute forecast. Tomorrow, the levee breaks, and that trickle becomes a flood. Here are the most significant reports to watch for, and what they will mean to the market. Though not among the biggest banks, Comerica's business still covers nearly every base in the banking sector. If Wells Fargo (  ) and Citigroup have primed the market to expect good things from the big boys, a win from Comerica may raise enthusiasm that the good news will reach a broader swathe of the market. Most train stocks have had a good year, so far, and the heavy transportation industry has been looked to as a leading economic indicator for more than 100 years now. No indicator is a guarantee, but there is something to this. Common sense says that more traffic on rails means companies have increased orders for materials, and those materials will be made into goods, which means they will be made into profits. If the market sees good news here, it will take it to mean that America's industrial/manufacturing resurgence is alive and well. Cintas is a uniform company, and as such, it is often looked to as an indicator of the health of the service side of the economy, for much the same reason transportation stocks are looked to an indicator of industry and manufacturing. CTAS stock fallen noticeably away from its highs in the last few days, an indication the Street's confidence in an earnings win is low. This one certainly bears close watching. The expectation has already been set that the banking sector will do well this earnings season, but expectation can always be turned on its ear. Intel is not everything it once was, but it is still a megalith in the semiconductor industry and the king of the CPU. Recent good times for the semiconductor industry have caused a general feeling of optimism across the entire technology sector. Intel can either keep that going, or throw a nasty wrench into the system. Much like Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase it very much a bellwether for the investment banking industry. The Street will be looking particularly at the mortgage side of the business, which has been weak in recent quarters. It is expected to be weak again, but how weak will give the Street a picture of how things are going in the real estate market. So, we've covered banking, industry, the service sector, technology… what have we left out? The consumer, of course. Johnson and Johnson provides American households with a huge array of products and medicines. If the Johnson and Johnson is healthy, the consumer is too. Sadly, Yahoo isn't really an indicator of anything, and is on the list mostly for its history than anything else. Lose your edge in technology, and you don't necessarily get to buy it back, no matter how much you spend.Taken together, these earnings reports will paint a much clearer overall picture of the economy than we have at present. As long as they are predominantly positive, the good times should continue to roll for investors. Wall Street tends to have a sixth sense about these things, so those invested in stocks right now are probably well advised to sit tight. has been a business writer since the first day of the twenty-first century, having written for PRA International and the United Nations Department of Peacekeeping.

 (  ) recently announced that its conversion to a real estate investment trust (REIT) has been unanimously approved by its board of directors. Accordingly, it will operate as a REIT from the taxable year commencing from Jan 1, 2014.This approval came after the receipt of favorable private letter rulings from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Following the news, shares of Iron Mountain surged 23.2% ($6.91) in after-hours trading on Jun 25, 2014.This decision comes more than three years after Elliot Management Corp had proposed the plan for conversion to REIT in Mar, 2011. This proposal was approved by the company's board in Jun, 2012. Since then it was awaiting a thorough review by the IRS as well as other necessary approvals for it to become operative.However, in light of the new development, Iron Mountain is likely to distribute between $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion to shareholders from its accumulated earnings and profits as per the REIT regulations. Moreover, the company will publicly announce a record date and payment date for the 2014 Special Distribution as determined by the board of directors.Due to its conversion to a REIT, the company provided a revised guidance for 2014. Management expects revenues to be between $3.09 billion and $3.17 billion, adjusted EPS to be between $1.37 and $1.52, annual dividend to be between $400.0 million and $420.0 million and free cash flow to range between $350.0 million and $390.0 million.The company rents out 66 million square feet of storage space around the world and this storage segment contributed 59.0% of revenues in 2013.To-date in 2014, the company has invested more than $60.0 million in five international storage related businesses. The international transactions include three deals in Turkey and Poland, which enhanced the company's leadership position in these emerging markets, and the acquisition of a leading provider of offsite data storage and data protection services named Tape Management Services in Australia.The conversion into a REIT would definitely increase shareholders' value and reduce the tax burden on the company. On the contrary, a dismal quarter would affect the dividend payout directly.We believe that Iron Mountain's strong product portfolio, increasing market share and promising international business are the primary growth catalysts. Moreover, the company's entry into the data center market could act as a positive factor.However, costs related to conversion and fluctuations in recycled paper prices are the near-term headwinds for the company. Moreover, volatile foreign exchange rates and competition from  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ) are the other headwinds.Currently, Iron Mountain has a Zacks Rank # 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

iven the recent run-up in the market, here's a screen I've been using recently for my own stock picking.First, it focuses on the top Zacks Ranked Sectors and Industries. Then it focuses on the Zacks Rank #1s, #2s and #3s, which are Strong Buys, Buys and Holds, respectively. But then it selects the outperforming stocks with the smallest percentage price change over the last 4 weeks.Why would I do something like that?Here's why.You've probably heard the old adage that roughly half of a stock's price movement can be attributed to the group that it's in. And that's true. In fact, oftentimes, even a mediocre stock in a top group will outperform a top stock in a poor group for this very reason.Now, take a look at any top group. You'll see plenty of fantastic stocks with some impressive price gains in there. But not every stock in every group moves in lockstep at the exact same time. Some will move more than others at any given time.So by focusing on the stocks with the smallest percentage price change with fundamentals that are just as good as those making the biggest price change, you might find yourself getting into the stocks ready to make the biggest potential catch-up move.Here's how to set up that screen:• We're screening for only those stocks with the best (lowest) average Zacks Rank. With 16 sectors, the best 8 sectors give us the best 50% of sectors.• Next step is to get only the best Zacks Ranked Industries coming thru. Since there are 264 'X' or expanded industries we look at, the best 132 will give us the best 50% of industries. But note that only the industries that also happen to be in the top sectors will get thru. If an industry is ranked as one of the best but it's outside of the top sector rank, it will not get thru.• Now the screen gets narrowed down even more by looking at only the Zacks Rank #1s, #2s and #3s. No Sells or Strong Sells (Zacks Rank #4s and #5s) allowed.• Only stocks over $5 with at least an average of 100,0000 shares traded daily will be considered.• This means we're screening for only those stocks that have outperformed the market (S&P 500) over the last 4 weeks.• Then finally we're scanning for the bottom 50 stocks with the lowest percentage price change over the last 4 weeks. So while all of these stocks have outperformed the market, they increased in price less than their peers.So each one of these stocks is in a top Sector and top Industry within that Sector. This alone will tip the odds of success in your favor by a great deal when you consider that the best Zacks Ranked groups outperform the worst ones by a factor of 2 to 1.Then by selecting those stocks with the best Zacks Rank along with the best price performance over the last 4 weeks, you now have only a list of winners from which to choose from.And from that list of winners, we're selecting the ones that have gained less than their peers on that list. Remember, these stocks aren't 'dogs' or unresponsive stocks. Quite the contrary; they have all outperformed the market. It just so happens that they increased less than the others on the list. But because they are a top rated stock in a top rated industry, we've singled these out as the ones that could make the biggest move to 'catch-up' to the others.It's an interesting screen that has generated a lot of great names.Here are 5 from that list: Nike Kraft Foods Genuine Parts Co. Cintas Rockwell AutomationAll great looking stocks that seem to have lots more upside in store for them.Get the rest of the stocks on the list and start putting this and other ideas to the test.

nvestors in Cintas Corporation (Symbol: CTAS) saw new options become available this week, for the February 2015 expiration. One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 240 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CTAS options chain for the new February 2015 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $60.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.80. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $60.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $57.20 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CTAS, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $62.80/share today.Because the $60.00 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 62%.

usiness services provider  (  ) recently pledged its support to control unwarranted textile waste by collaborating with a Cincinnati-based non-profit organization, Know Hope. The strategic tie-up that aims to benefit underprivileged residents of third-world countries is also part of the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives of Cintas.According to data by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), about 21 billion pounds of post-consumer textile waste is squandered annually in landfills. In order to curb such wastage, Cintas has decided to donate leftover material from its uniform production process to Know Hope. This will be utilized by the non-profit organization to produce reusable burlap bags sold by the charity. Funds generated from the sale of such bags will be used for providing basic products and services to families in Mexico, Africa, Haiti and Guatemala.In 2013, Know Hope had produced approximately 4,300 bags and 2,500 smaller accessories to raise funds. A steady supply of textile from Cintas will enable Know Hope to generate more funds for its first Orphan Adoption Grant through Show Hope. Thus, the partnership is viewed as a win-win deal for both Cintas and Know Hope.Based in Cincinnati, OH, Cintas provides specialized services to businesses of all types throughout North America.

ecurity and protection services provider  (  ) recently sealed the acquisition of Reliance Protectron, Inc. - one of the largest security monitoring and installation companies in Canada. ADT acquired the Canadian firm from Reliance Comfort Limited Partnership, a portfolio company of investment funds managed by Alinda Capital Partners - one of the world's largest and most experienced infrastructure investment firms.With the deal, ADT has strengthened its Canadian presence to better serve over 800,000 local customers with the best of products and solutions along with superior customer service in the security industry. In addition, the strategic buy will offer a steady revenue stream to ADT as Protectron reportedly has higher levels of customer retention than other major players in North America. Post-acquisition, the Canadian firm will continue to use the Protectron brand under ADT ownership.ADT believes monitored security and home/business automation services remain grossly under-penetrated in North American households. In addition, rising concerns about crime and security issues (especially by an aging population), increasing customer interest in lifestyle and business productivity, and technology advancements are likely to support the higher penetration of interactive services and home/business automation. As such, the company envisions significant growth potential and intends to capitalize on this opportunity by leveraging on its efficient operating model and lower technology costs over time. These would then enable the company to considerably reduce the cost of basic installation and services, thereby making it affordable for a wider market acceptance by a larger portion of households and businesses.Headquartered in Boca Raton, FL, ADT offers electronic security products along with a wide range of interactive home and business automation and monitoring services for residences and small businesses in the U.S. and Canada.ADT's electronic security and home/business automation solutions primarily include installation and monitoring of residential and small business security and premises automation systems. These products are designed to detect intrusion; control access; react to movement, smoke, carbon monoxide, flooding, temperature and other environmental conditions and hazards; and address personal emergencies, such as injuries, medical emergencies or incapacitation.ADT currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The company's other operating centers are based in Corona, CA; Dallas, TX and Milwaukee, WI.The expanded network will enable the businesses to have broader access to both direct and digital mails for marketing and other commercial purposes. The addition of this center will allow Pitney Bowes to reap the benefits of its expanded coverage across the key regions of U.S. This will reduce the company's postage and operational costs and make its services more affordable for customers as well.Speedy and secured delivery of mails is crucial for Pitney Bowes and it uses the United States Postal Service's (USPS) Sectional Center Facilities (SCF) for the same. The company has to maintain a Total Quality Management (TQM) process to comply with the high standards of the USPS partnership. Apart from these, the company's services come with additional features like Full Service Intelligent Mail Barcode Tracking and Self Delivery.The latest move is part of the company's efforts to strengthen its Enterprise Business Solutions division and tap the immense potential of the direct mail industry. In the last reported quarter (first-quarter 2014), the segment's Presort Services revenues increased 5% year over year to $116.5 million, driven by strong growth in its First Class mail services.At present, Pitney Bowes holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

 (  ) reported first-quarter 2014 adjusted earnings from continuing operations of 26 cents per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Earnings per share declined 3.7% from the year-ago quarter, due to modest revenue growth.Revenues increased a modest 3.1% from the year-ago quarter to $770.1 million and managed to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $770.0 million. Revenues increased due to higher storage rental revenues (up 3.7% year over year) and higher service revenues (up 2.2% year over year).Total storage rental revenue growth reflected a 12.7% increase in the company's International business.

This included 6.4% organic growth from Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products, primarily due to improvements in productivity of sales representatives and an overall increase in the number of sales workforce. Sales productivity improvements are generally the culmination of increased tenure and advanced training procedures of sales personnel, which in turn result in a higher number of products and services sold.During recession, Cintas had taken initiatives to enhance its operations by evaluating sales force productivity, optimizing routes and streamlining labor overhead. The company returned to year-over-year rental organic revenue growth in mid 2010 and has continued the growth trajectory since then. Organic growth from the Other Services segment was also commendable, which was driven by growth in each of the operating segments and accretive acquisitions. All these measures augur well for the long-term growth perspectives, as 7 out of 12 earnings estimates for fiscal 2014 have been revised up and none revised down.In order to have increased market penetration, Cintas has a highly talented and diverse team of service professionals who regularly visit customers. These frequent contacts with existing customers strengthen personal relationships, which consequently provide a platform to launch additional products and services. In order to pursue the strategy of broadening the customer base, Cintas has a national sales organization that introduces its products and services to prospects in all business segments. The company also broadens its customer base through geographic expansion, particularly in emerging businesses of first aid and safety, fire protection and document management, in addition to strategic acquisitions at an opportune time. This focused approach for steady top-line growth is commendable.However, a continuous increase in raw material costs like cotton, due to global headwinds, may weigh on the margins going forward. Cintas procures raw materials from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers, making it susceptible to market risks which are beyond its control. Cost of rental uniforms and ancillary products comprises production expenses, delivery expenses and amortization of in-service inventory, including uniforms, mats, shop towels and other ancillary items.Cintas also faces stiff competition from national, regional and local companies on various factors such as design, price, quality, service and convenience to the customers. In addition, the U.S. and foreign trade policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, trade sanctions, and limitations on the imports of certain types of goods also escalate product costs and adversely affect its operations.

Cintas reported solid second-quarter fiscal 2015 results with nearly 25% year-over-year increase in earnings, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $0.08. The company is witnessing strong growth across major segments, and is looking to build on this momentum, as it increasingly focuses on fast-growing rental first aid and direct sale businesses. Cintas also enjoys significant scale advantages with regard to its route-based network, which in turn boosts its competitiveness.

Adjusted OIBDA margin contracted 80 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 31.8% due to legal accruals and decline in revenues in the Service segment.Operating income in the quarter increased 9.8% from the year-ago quarter to $153.9 million, primarily due to lower operating expenses (down 6.9% year over year).

Arguably the only scene worth watching in an otherwise dreadfully disappointing  was its opening credits, when Gordon Gekko was memorably freed from his cell,  .

And a film called  recently  .So, if you'll allow me to mix my metaphorical pinstripes and prison stripes, let us examine a ""  ."" What follows is a quartet of both corporate criminals and ways to play correctional facilities. 1. Junk bond king Michael Milken defined the ""greed is good"" Gekko-era '80s during an extraordinarily successful spell at Drexel Burnham. Yet having personally earned an unheard of $550 million in 1986, half a decade later, his salary topped out at $.40 per hour at the Federal Correctional Institute in Pleasanton, California. District Judge Kimba Wood (who went on to be a failed Bill Clinton nominee to the Supreme Court) sentenced the businessman to 10 years of hard time and 5,400 hours of community service on fraud, racketeering, and insider trading violations. Arguably the Bay Area compound's most infamous inmate was Jane Moore, attempted assassin of President Gerald R. Ford. As its name suggests, Pleasanton -- if not quite the ""Club Fed"" of popular imagination -- wasn't exactly disagreeable. (The follicularly-challenged financier was, however, compelled to surrender his toupee per prison regulations.) As it turned out, he didn't dally there long; the sentence was reduced on appeal and Milken was a free man as of March 1993. 2. Blue blood Martha Stewart made for a mighty unlikely inmate 55170-054 in Appalachia, but that's where the domestic diva found herself in 2004 after being convicted of conspiracy, perjury, and obstruction of justice in an ImClone Systems insider trading scandal involving her close confidant Sam Waksal. (That Martha -- who left absolutely nothing to chance and was already a multi-millionaire -- would risk her freedom to sell 4,000 measly shares was one of the case's many mysteries.)Taking inspiration from Nelson Mandela as she started her new life -- ""Many, many good people have gone to prison"" -- Stewart spent five months in the Alderson, West Virginia, federal penitentiary, among whose alumna was Lynette ""Squeaky"" Fromme, attempted assassin of President Gerald R. Ford. (Him again? Give the guy a break.)Although 159-acre Alderson was affectionately known as ""Camp Cupcake,"" scrubbing floors and cleaning offices in khakis couldn't have been too much of ""a good thing"" for the 63-year old lifestyle goddess, who told  's Matt Lauer earlier this year that her time inside was ""terrible."" After serving five months, Martha --  -- was released in the dead of night on March 4, 2005, after which her probation officer mandated five additional months of (palatial) house arrest involving an electronic ankle bracelet. 3. Ex  (  ) CEO Dennis Kozlowski was found guilty in June 2005 of 22 counts including grand larceny and securities fraud. A jury convicted him of pilfering $600 million from the outfit he headed, proceeds of which were promptly squandered on opulent apartments and Impressionist art. Spending some $6,000 of his firm's funds on a shower curtain while investors were taking a bath undoubtedly didn't go over well with the 12-person panel. What might have sealed his fate, however, was a widely circulated video of his wife's $2 million Sardinia birthday bash showing an ice sculpture of  . Such egregious excess on the company's dime even resulted in  , which really is a bit rich.After being sentenced for up to 25 years, Kozlowski found himself begging for mercy at New York's Mid-State Correctional Facility in Marcy. Here he pulled in $.80 per day delivering laundry at a minimum security institution, whose 8x10 foot cell was quite a climb down from his former Fifth Avenue apartment. The 6'2"", 235-pound ""Koz"" was as pugnacious as his mugshot suggests, and appealed his case all the way to the Supreme Court, which declined to hear it.Ultimately knuckling down and wisely opting against a prison break -- Tyco is, after all, the world's biggest maker of alarms and security systems -- the 66-year-old Kozlowski eventually became by all accounts a model inmate. Having accrued merit time, earlier this year, he was moved to a facility in Harlem as part of a work-release program, and is due to appear before the parole board in April 2014. To judge by  , Dennis the Menace may soon have a shot at redemption. 4. Bernie Madoff isn't the only executive who is a disgrace to his name; Bernie Ebbers is currently serving a 25-year sentence for securities fraud while in charge of WorldCom. Nor, indeed, is he the sole businessman born in Queens familiar with being locked up;  (  ) from Far Rockaway also  . But for sheer psychotic brazenness, the former  (INDEXNASDAQ:.IXIC) Chairman is in a Category A prison all by himself. He was belatedly arrested on December 11, 2008 for operating a $65 billion Ponzi scheme, the largest in American history. Sent to the slammer for 150 years, Bernie can currently be found with 758 other inmates at the Butner Federal Correction Complex in North Carolina.Freed from handcuffs, and clearly on a one-man mission to save the Post Office, Madoff has since become a letter-writing machine. His snail mail efforts have ranged from  to earlier efforts proudly pointing out, ""  ."" (The competition must have been considerable, for fellow financier Allen Stanford is a cellmate.) Alas, Mr. Madoff's jailhouse judgment that ""It is perfectly safe with no fights"" would prove premature when the  reported he was taken to hospital with fractured ribs and a broken nose following a fracas.While behind steel bars, the embezzler busily  . Optimistically looking ahead to a  , this septuagenarian told CNN earlier this year, ""I live with the remorse, the pain I caused everybody,"" so perhaps he really is trying to  .So how can one make money out of all this?One way to profit is to  . Should you not be so fortunate, there are a few pure prison plays. (As opposed to peripheral stocks such as uniform provider  (  ), for whom the inmate apparel market is but a small part of its overall business.)First up, a caveat. For all the frivolous talk of ""Club Fed"" and ""Camp Cupcake,"" this is  . As such, I must read you your Miranda rights. Money talks, but you have the right to remain silent in this sector, where equities are often illiquid and Big House outfits invariably can't attract the attention of large investment houses.  , while wonderful for the population at large, are another reason to avoid leaping into the jumpsuit industry. And  represent an additional danger. (Okay, just kidding on that last one.)All that said, investors determined to do time in this area are occasionally rewarded with $685 million takeovers. This happened in 2010 when Cornell Companies -- its very name evocative of an Ivy League institution that is as hard to get into as prisons are to get out of -- merged with an  competitor.Here, then, are some stocks for the slammer.1.  (  ) is the undisputed industry leader, operating approximately 67 detention facilities in 20 states. Based in Nashville -- whose favorite sons know how to fulsomely  -- the stock is approximately 90% owned by institutions and sports a market capitalization of about $4 billion. Shares are essentially flat over the past year, but a roughly 5.64% dividend offers real appeal should the market enter a sustained correction, so to speak. Recent overcrowding reduction proposals in California are an additional avenue of growth for the company. As ever, any prospective investors should consult their tax adviser regarding the reporting requirements of real estate investment trust (REIT)-related names.2. Boca Raton-based  (GEO) has returned roughly 14% in the past 12 months, broadly on a par with the  (INDEXDJX:.DJI). The security stock either owns or manages about 100 facilities, with its services encompassing everything from parolee supervision to rehabilitative outreach. It did $377 million in revenues in the most recent quarter, has a price/earnings ratio of roughly 13, and boasts a plump 6.10% yield. The firm survived a  earlier this year, and it is expected to benefit from the  .The next two names are definitely not for widows and orphans, a cohort already badly burned by the high crimes of Madoff et al. When they trade at all, it is highly irregularly and on the pink sheets, so buyer beware.3.  (OTCMKTS:CITY), founded in 1985, hails from Houston and involves itself with inmate education among other issues. It operates in Oklahoma, Texas, and Wyoming. Personally, I stay away from penny stocks, but you never know. A little bird (  , as opposed to the  , who currently finds himself furloughed by Uncle Sam) told me that once in a blue moon, such speculative issues do shoot up.4.  (OTCMKTS:GPSI) has gained 445.45% in the past year, but considering that still leaves the stock trading at only $0.60, it continues to go for a song. (Even in Sing Sing.) The Las Vegas company changed its name from Continental Prison Systems in September and has 10,841,741 shares outstanding as of last count. In a just published interview, ex-Qwest CEO Joseph Nacchio told of a torturous time behind bars, where  . (Poor fellow; doesn't he know that  (WFM) offers an altogether more upscale  ? And to think, they say no big fish have gone to jail for the financial crisis.) Regardless, such a sad plight shed fresh light on the issue of incarceration currency. This firm provides debit card and kiosk products aimed at creating cashless technology that begins with the booking process. These proceeds can then be automatically loaded into the prisoner's account, thus eliminating much manual labor. In 2012, General Payment Systems posted more than $4 million in revenue, and shares recently underwent a 1-100 reverse split.So there we have it -- four jail stocks to score with. Perhaps you've never considered investing in prisons before. But why not try something different?

Extended-Hours Dollar Volume: $72,579,223Earnings Sensitivity (up or down): 3.7%Cintas Corporation (  ) is due to issue its quarterly earnings report after the close today. Given its history, traders can expect very active trading in the upcoming After-hours session immediately following the company's release of its quarterly earnings. An analysis of historical premarket and after-hours trading activity and liquidity conditions in CTAS following an earnings release indicates that the price change in the extended hours is likely to be of significant value in forecasting additional price movement in the following regular session.Analysts at MidnightTrader have tracked how CTAS's stock price has reacted to quarterly earnings events the past both in the after-hours and following regular session. The result of that study is below.Over the last year, when shares of CTAS rose in the extended-hours in reaction to its earnings announcement, there is limited evidence to suggest a follow-through in the same direction the next day.Over that same historical period, when shares of CTAS dropped in the extended-hours in reaction to its earnings announcement, history shows that 25% of the time over the last 4 quarters the stock dropped further, adding to the extended-hours losses by an average of 1.90% by the following regular session close.Our analysis of over a decade of company specific earnings related news and price data on over 5,000 US companies demonstrates that earnings event related trading opportunities can exist for those trading in the after-hours and premarket sessions. Certain stocks demonstrate a historical tendency to either underprice or overreact to earnings news in the extended-hours (the time when companies typically release earnings) relative to the following regular session close.This report was created using historical data and analysis provided by the Midnight Trader Pro service at MidnightTrader.com.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Trade the Earnings: Cintas Corporation@2013-09-19@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/trade-earnings-cintas-corporation-2013-09-19
n Jul 9, we reiterated our Neutral recommendation for business services provider  (  ). The company's diligent execution of operational plans and strategic decision to extend its global footprint, through continuous organic growth across the industry verticals, augur well for its growth prospects. However, an increase in raw material costs along with weak economic conditions prevailing in the global scenario could weigh on the margins moving forward.Cintas aims to continually hike revenue streams by increasing businesses from existing customers and broadening customer base by including new business segments. The company also identifies additional product and service opportunities for its current and future customers to augment its product portfolio.In order to increase market penetration, Cintas has a highly talented and diverse team of service professionals who regularly visit customers. These frequent contacts with existing customers strengthen personal relationships, which consequently provide a platform to launch additional products and services.In order to pursue its strategy of broadening customer base, Cintas has a national sales organization that introduces its products and services in all business segments. The company also broadens its customer base through geographic expansion, and focuses particularly on emerging businesses of first aid and safety, fire protection and document management. Additionally, strategic acquisitions at opportune times also help the company to expand. This focused approach for a steady top-line growth is commendable.Cintas reported an organic revenue growth of 6.9% in fiscal third quarter 2013, including 5.5% organic growth from Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products due to improvements in productivity of sales representatives and an overall increase in the number of sales representatives. Sales productivity improvements are generally the culmination of increased tenure and advanced training procedures of sales personnel, which in turn result in a higher number of products and services sold.During recession, Cintas had taken initiatives to enhance its operations by evaluating sales force productivity, optimizing routes and streamlining labor overhead. The company returned to year-over-year rental organic revenue growth in mid 2010 and has continued the growth trajectory since then. Organic growth from the Other Services segment was also healthy at 10.5% in the last reported quarter, largely due to growth in each of the operating segments and accretive acquisitions. All these indicate solid growth momentum for the company.However, a continuous increase in raw material costs such as cotton, due to global headwinds, may weigh on the margins going forward. Cintas procures raw materials from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers, making it susceptible to market risks which are beyond its control.Cintas presently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

 (  ) reported second-quarter 2013 adjusted earnings per share of 29 cents from continuing operations, which lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 cents. Earnings also slumped 21.6% from the year-ago quarter due to higher shares outstanding.Although revenues improved marginally (up 0.3%) from the year-ago quarter to $754.7 million, it failed to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $764.0 million. Revenues for the quarter were helped by higher Storage Rental revenues (up 1.9% year over year) which more than offset the 1.8% year-over-year decline in Service revenues.Iron Mountain's Global storage rental revenue growth was primarily attributed to 5.6% and 1.2% internal growth in the International business and North America, respectively. Acquisitions also benefited the segment. Services revenues were impacted by decrease in activity-based services. Decrease in recycled paper prices also played a part in the segment's decline.Adjusted OIBDA (operating income before depreciation and amortization) decreased 2.6% year over year to $233.0 million. Adjusted OIBDA margin contracted 100 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 30.8% due to legal accruals and decline in revenues in the Service segment.Operating income in the quarter decreased 16.9% from the year-ago quarter to $131.9 million, primarily due to higher operating expenses (up 7.6% year over year). Net income from continuing operations was $27.5 million versus $41.4 million earned in the previous-year quarter.Iron Mountain exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $258.9 million compared with $229.9 million at the end of the previous quarter. Long-term debt (including the current portion) was $3.94 billion.Iron Mountain revised its fiscal 2013 revenue guidance range from $3.02 billion-3.10 billion to $3.0 billion-$3.01 billion. The company also lowered its adjusted OIBDA guidance range from $905.0 million-$935.0 million to $900 million-$925 million. Iron Mountain now expects earnings per share in the range of $1.05-$1.14, down from the earlier forecasted range of $1.13 to $1.24.The company expects to spend approximately $290 million on capital assets. Free cash flow is expected in the range of $320 million to $360 million for fiscal 2013 consistent with the previous forecast.We believe that Iron Mountain's strong product portfolio, increasing market share and promising international business are the primary growth catalysts for the company. The company's decision to convert to REIT to reduce tax burden and increase shareholder value are the other positives. Moreover, the company's entry into the data center market could act as a positive factor.However, costs related to the conversion and fluctuations in recycled paper prices are the near-term headwinds for the company. Moreover, volatile foreign exchange rates and competition from  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ) are the other headwinds. Moreover, the lowered guidance for the fiscal 2013 is an overhang on the stock.Currently, Iron Mountain has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Iron Mountain Lags Q2 Earnings - Analyst Blog@2013-08-07@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/iron-mountain-lags-q2-earnings-analyst-blog-2013-08-07

"We have all been following the relatively positive trends in jobs. ADP and BLS both had strong showings in February and trends have been stable. BLS showed the U.S. has added an average of more than 200,000 jobs a month in the past four months.ADP trends have also shown consistent growth. If you include revisions, this is the 9 th month the ADP report has beat consensus estimates, averaging 180,000 jobs per month.The low weekly jobless claim filings have been supporting those reports and this week we continued to stay the course.Initial jobless claims rose by 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 336,000 in the week ended March 16. Estimates were for claims to rise to 340,000 from a revised 334,000 in the prior week.The four week average of new claims declined by 7,500 to 339,750; the lowest level since February 2008.In fact, claims have been below 350,000 for five of the past six weeks. The last time that streak occurred was in late 2007, just before the Great Recession began.On the housing front, sales and prices have been stable, but not earth shattering. S&P Case Shiller recently warned that the longer term outlook is still foggy.This morning, the Federal Housing Finance Agency reported home prices climbed a seasonally adjusted 0.6% in January, and increased 6.5% from the same period in the prior year. The data is compiled using only mortgages backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.Lastly we saw Flash PMI come in just short of analyst expectations for 55.1, with a reading of 54.9. Flash PMI readings have been declining over the last three months, but still show moderate expansion.I am on board with the ""stall speed"" recovery, and the Fed driven market rally. But when companies like FedEx, Caterpillar, Cintas and even Oracle offer dismal sales and slash forecasts; one has to wonder about the real state of things. Doesn't it all come back to earnings at some point?Surveys and samples can be deceiving and often have large margins of error, but when companies like FedEx or Caterpillar report real, major declines in sales and slash guidance, I pay closer attention.Personally, I don't feel as though earnings momentum has been very strong (perhaps non-existent is more apropos) nor do I feel comfortable that the aforementioned companies are issuing poor guidance from already lowered expectations.I think the mediocre data will not be enough to support the markets during the next earnings season and the warnings we saw a sprinkle of will become more prevalent and turn this euphoric market lower.**There will be exceptions of courseThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Jobs, Housing, PMI OK; But are More Warnings Coming? - Real Time Insight@2013-03-21@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/jobs-housing-pmi-ok-are-more-warnings-coming-real-time-insight-2013-03-21

The company also reiterated its earnings guidance of $2.50-$2.58.Cintas continues to deliver organic growth by winning new businesses and selling newer services. Margins at Cintas continue to expand based on cost efficiencies despite headwinds from higher input costs. In the first half of fiscal 2013, operating margin expansion was driven by lower selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A). Management sees the opportunity for modest SG&A leverage for the balance of fiscal 2013.So far in fiscal 2013, the company witnessed top-line growth across all the segments except Uniform Direct Sales and the Document Management segments. Results were negatively affected by lower recycle paper prices and weakness in Europe.If recycled paper price remains low then it may weigh on results going forward. To add to the woes, employment growth has been choppy and disappointing over the past few months and leading indicators of US labor demand are weakening.

"n a bid to strengthen its storage business,  (  ) recently acquired two companies - Datastore and Data Technology Services (""DTS""). However, financial details of the deal were not disclosed by the company.With the current acquisitions, Iron Mountain has expanded its presence in the Wilmington, Milwaukee, Madison and the northern Chicago suburbs. Moreover, the acquisitions of Datastore and DTS gives Iron Mountain two records storage facilities in Cudahy and Sun Prairie, and 24,000 square-foot record storage hub in Northchase Parkway.Iron Mountain has been pursuing an aggressive acquisition strategy to supplement organic revenues from the storage business. Iron Mountain has not only gained new customers from these acquisitions, but has also been able to expand its operations into new regions.Earlier, in Dec 2012, Iron Mountain acquired three companies - IG2 Data Security Inc., DATAPROS Storage and Staffing LLC, and Data Backup Inc. All the three companies provide data storage and protection. We believe that the company will continue to pursue accretive acquisitions in this segment (both domestically and internationally) over the long term.Storage is an integral part of Iron Mountain's revenue structure and contributes nearly 58% of its total revenue. In the last concluded quarter, Iron Mountain recorded marginal growth of 1.7% year over year.We expect Iron Mountain to drive significant growth through acquisitions in fast-growing countries like Brazil, Russia, China and India, which will boost its international revenue going forward. We believe that diversification and expansion of its business will help the company to counter sluggish growth from the domestic and European markets over the long term.However, tepid internal growth coupled with volatile foreign exchange rates and a decline in recycled paper prices are expected to partially negate the company's strong product portfolio, increasing market share and promising international business.

 (  ) reported third quarter 2012 adjusted earnings per share of 34 cents, a penny shy of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 35 cents. Earnings decreased 15% from the year-ago quarter, primarily due to lower-than-expected recycled paper prices and currency headwinds.Revenues were down 2.6% from the year-ago quarter to $748.1 million, and fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $764 million. Increase in the Storage revenue was fully offset by lower Service revenue.On a segment basis, Storage revenue (58% of revenues) increased 1.7% year over year to $434.7 million, driven by strong organic growth. Service revenue (42% of revenues) dropped 8% year over year to $313.5 million. Service revenue was negatively impacted by lower-than-expected organic growth in the core services coupled with decline in activity-based service revenue and decline in recycled paper prices.Gross profit (excluding depreciation and amortization) was down 5.2% year over year to $437.8 million in the reported quarter. Gross margin for the quarter decreased to 58.5% from 60.1% in the year-ago quarter, due to lower revenue base.Adjusted OIBDA was down 3.9% year over year to $244 million due to the negative impact of lower recycled paper revenues. Adjusted OIBDA margin for the quarter decreased 40 basis points on a year-over-year basis to 32.6%.Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were down nearly 2.2% from the prior-year period to $204.5 million. Operating income in the quarter increased 13.9% year over year to $154 million. Operating margin was 20.5% compared with 17.5% in the previous-year quarter due to lower operating expenses.Net income from continuing operations was $54 million, which increased from $50 million reported in the previous-year quarter.Iron Mountain exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $334.6 million compared with $170.2 million at the end of the previous quarter. Long-term debt (including the current portion) was $3.74 billion compared with $3.49 billion in the previous quarter.For fiscal 2012, Iron Mountain expects revenues in the range of $2.99 billion to $3.02 billion. The company forecasts adjusted OIBDA between $900.0 million and $920.0 million. Iron Mountain expects earnings per share in the range of $1.20 to $1.28. The Zacks Consensus Estimate projects earnings of $1.30 per share for fiscal 2012.The company expects to spend approximately $245 million on capital assets. Free cash flow is expected in the range of $320 million to $360 million for fiscal 2012. Moreover, management expects a decline in paper prices to negatively impact the top line throughout the year.Iron Mountain recorded strong performance in the International business segment and persistent growth in the North America business, which positively impacted Storage revenue.Strong product portfolio, increasing market share and promising international business are the key positives for the company.

With this strategic tie-up, Cintas will likely expand its uniform design, production and support services in Europe to meet the increased demand for corporate apparel services.The European uniform business of Cintas comprises indigenously-built custom-designed uniform for domestic as well as internationally recognized four- and five-star hotels. By expanding its geographical footprint, the company intends to offer inventory, distribution, and manufacturing expertise at the local level for the first time, which is likely to improve its profitability in the long run.At the same time, the move will facilitate a prompt service to better serve its existing clientele in the U.K., including Marriott and Four Seasons hotels of  (  ) and Hilton Hotels & Resorts.Cintas has been facing severe challenges in recent times from the soft European market and has remained afloat by divesting profitable businesses and stringent cost-cutting initiatives. Consequently, this strategic partnership is expected to reap huge financial benefits for the company.On the other hand, by partnering Cintas, CALVELEX would strive to leverage its state-of-the-art technological equipment and production process, timely delivery schedule, and certified management system to reach newer heights.

n a bid to strengthen its storage business,  (  ) has acquired three companies - IG2 Data Security Inc., DATAPROS Storage and Staffing LLC, and Data Backup Inc. All these three companies provide data storage and protection. However, further details not disclosed.IG2 Data Security provides data protection and backup tape storage services to its clients in Chicago, northwest Indiana and southeastern Wisconsin. In the Phoenix region, DATAPROS Storage and Staffing LLC offers media storage and management services, which also includes data protection. Data Backup Inc. is based in Sarasota and delivers data storage and recovery services.Iron Mountain has been employing an aggressive acquisition strategy to supplement the organic growth in storage revenues. Iron Mountain has not only gained new customers from these acquisitions, but has also been able to expand its operations in new regions.In mid 2012, Iron Mountain made several accretive acquisitions in the storage space (File House Offsite Record Storage, Document Systems Inc and First National Safe Deposit). We believe that the company will continue to pursue accretive acquisitions in this segment (both domestically and internationally) over the long term.Storage is an integral part of Iron Mountain's revenue structure and contributes nearly 58% of its total revenue. In the last concluded quarter, Iron Mountain recorded marginal growth of 1.7% year over year.We expect Iron Mountain to drive significant growth through acquisitions in fast-growing countries like Brazil, Russia, China and India, which will boost its international revenue going forward. We believe that diversification and expansion of its business will help the company to counter sluggish growth from the domestic and European markets over the long term.However, tepid internal growth coupled with volatile foreign exchange rates and a decline in recycled paper prices are expected to partially negate the company's strong product portfolio, increasing market share and promising international business. The company also faces stiff competition from Anacomp Inc. and  (  ).Thus, we have a Neutral recommendation on the stock. Currently, Iron Mountain has a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@IRM Strengthens Storage Business - Analyst Blog@2012-12-12@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/irm-strengthens-storage-business-analyst-blog-2012-12-12

 (  ) reported second quarter adjusted earnings per share (excluding costs associated with the 2011 proxy contest, the Special Committee and the proposed REIT conversion) of 36 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 31 cents. Reported earnings increased 9.1% from the year-ago quarter, primarily aided by lower share count.Revenues slipped 0.8% from the year-ago quarter to $752.2 million, and fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $762.0 million. Quarterly revenues were primarily impacted by decline in service revenue, which fully offset the increase in the storage revenue.On a segment basis, Storage revenue (57.6% of revenues) increased 3.4% year over year to $433.4 million, driven by strong organic growth as well as from the recent acquisitions across North America.Service revenue (42.4% of revenues) dropped 6.1% year over year to $318.7 million. Service revenue was negatively impacted by lower-than-expected organic growth in the core services coupled with decline in complimentary service revenue and decline in recycled paper revenue.Gross profit (excluding depreciation and amortization) was down 2.7% year over year to $439.0 million in the reported quarter. Gross margin for the quarter decreased to 58.4% versus 59.5% in the year-ago quarter, due to lower revenue base.Adjusted operating income (excluding costs associated with the 2011 proxy contest, the Special Committee and the proposed REIT conversion and depreciation and amortization) increased 0.4% year over year to $239.0 million. Adjusted OIBDA margin for the quarter increased 40 basis points on a year-over-year basis to 31.8%, reflecting benefits from international business and overhead cost controls.Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were down nearly 8.9% from the prior-year period to $203.5 million, attributable to stringent overhead cost controls.Operating income in the quarter increased 2.0% year over year to $162.0 million. Operating margin was 21.5% compared with 20.9% in the previous-year quarter due to lower operating expenses.Net income from continuing operations declined from $74 million in the previous-year quarter to $42.0 million due to increased interest expense.Iron Mountain exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $170.2 million compared with $178.3 million at the end of the previous quarter. Long-term debt (including the current portion) was $3.49 billion compared with $3.35 billion in the previous quarter. On June 13, 2012, the company paid a quarterly dividend of 27 cents per share.For fiscal 2012, Iron Mountain expects revenues in the range of $2.99 billion to $3.04 billion. The company forecasts adjusted OIBDA between $890.0 million and $930.0 million. Iron Mountain expects earnings per share in the range of $1.20 to $1.36. The Zacks Consensus Estimate projects earnings of $1.30 per share for fiscal 2012.The company expects to spend approximately $220.0 million on capital assets. Free cash flow is expected in the range of $320.0 million to $360.0 million for fiscal 2012.Moreover, management expects a decline in paper prices to negatively impact the top line throughout the year.Iron Mountain recorded strong performance in the International business segment and persistent growth in the North America business, which positively impacted Storage revenue. However, tepid internal growth coupled with volatile foreign exchange rates and a decline in paper prices are expected to partially negate the company's strong product portfolio, increasing market share and promising international business.Iron Mountain faces stiff competition from Anacomp Inc. and  .We maintain our Neutral recommendation on a long-term basis (6-12 months).

"he markets weren't enthralled early on by this morning's commentary from Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke, who once again repeated the Fed is prepared to take whatever means possible to keep the economy from coming off the tracks. However that early concern faded by midday as the likelihood of further bailouts were back on the table.As for stock-related headlines, earnings were driving some of the action as well. Some names not faring as well included transport play J.B. Hunt (  ), State Street Corp (  ), and uniform provider Cintas Corp (  ). On the flipside, there were some earnings plays bucking the early selling, including Mattel (  ), M&T Bank (  ), Coca-Cola (  ), and Mosaic (  ), which announced a doubling of their annual dividend payout. Again, Mosaic is in the commodity space (fertilizer play) so the dividend payouts can be much more volatile and not as consistent as other sectors we follow.Whenever the market sprinkles in a bit of volatility (which is more often than we like), investors tend to get panicky.

 (  ) is slated to report its fourth-quarter fiscal 2012 results after the closing bell on July 16. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is 59 cents per share, representing an estimated year-over-year increase of 21.09%. Revenues, as per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, are $1.065 billion.The company, in the third quarter (ended February 29, 2012), reported earnings of 58 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 52 cents and exceeding the year-ago earnings of 41 cents.Revenues in the reported quarter increased 7.9% year over year to $1.012 billion, comfortably surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.008 billion.Cintas, which competes with  (  ), experienced growth in its top-line, driven by organic growth which improved 5.9%. The positive was partially offset by recycled paper price which remained at relatively low level during the quarter.Out of the 12 analysts covering the stock, none have revised their estimates for the fourth quarter in either direction over the last 7 days. A similar trend applies for fiscal 2012. Only one firm has revised its estimates in the downward direction over last 30 days for both the fourth quarter and fiscal 2012.The Zacks Consensus Estimates remained the same for both the fourth quarter and fiscal 2012 over the last 7 and 30 days.With respect to earnings surprise, Cintas has topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters. The company has delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 13.07% over the preceding four quarters, implying that it has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate by that measure.Cintas continues with margin expansion through cost efficiencies despite headwinds from higher energy and material costs. During the third quarter of fiscal 2012, gross margin increased 30 basis-points (bps) to 42.1% and the operating margin inflated 200 bps to 13.6%, marking the fifth consecutive quarter of operating margin growth. Cintas has scope for further margin expansion given the unutilized capacity in facilities that the company can leverage.However, low recycled paper prices still pose a problem for the company. The recycled paper prices during the third quarter remained as low as $150 per ton; negatively impacting revenue growth by $5.6 million or 0.6%.

KeyBanc cited several reasons for the downgrade, including high unemployment levels, a weak Document Management business, and a less-compelling valuation to some of its peers in the space.Cintas shares fell 55 cents, or -1.5%, in premarket trading Thursday.Shares of Cintas (  ) have a 1.43% dividend yield, based on last night's closing stock price of $37.85.

 (  ) has obtained management approval for its conversion into a real estate investment trust (REIT). The decision comes more than a year after Elliot Management Corp had proposed the plan in March 2011. However, the conversion is subject to a thorough review by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other necessary approvals. Upon gaining the necessary regulatory orders, Iron Mountain would operate as an REIT from January 2014.Notably, Elliot Management has been in talks with Iron Mountain to convert the company into an REIT for a long time, as the conversion would enable the company to lower its tax liability. Up until now, Iron Mountain has resisted the proposal, as being an REIT necessitates it to distribute approximately 90% of the profits among shareholders.However, in light of the new development, Iron Mountain is likely to distribute between $1 billion and $1.5 billion to shareholders from its accumulated earnings and profits as per the REIT regulations. Moreover, the company has increased quarterly dividend from 25 cents to 27 cents, which would be paid on July 13, 2012 to stockholders of record as on June 22, 2012 to increase its shareholder value.The cost of conversion to REIT would be $325 million to $425 million and analysts expect annual savings on tax of approximately $120 million to $130 million. The company rents out 64 million square feet of storage space around the world and this storage segment contributed 55.8% of revenues in 2011. Moreover, the company's initiatives to increase its operational footprint in the core storage space and divestures of the non-core digital services unit were thought to justify the decision.Iron Mountain has recently made accretive acquisitions in the storage space (File House Offsite Record Storage, Document Systems Inc, First National Safe Deposit and Grupo Store). We believe that the company will continue to pursue accretive acquisitions in this sector (both domestically and internationally) over the long term.The conversion into an REIT would definitely increase shareholders' value and reduce the tax burden on the company. On the contrary, a dismal quarter would affect the dividend payout directly. Moreover, the conversion may face regulatory issues and might not finally go through.We expect Iron Mountain to drive significant growth through acquisitions in the rapidly growing countries like Brazil, Russia, China and India, which will boost its international revenue going forward. We believe that this diversification and expansion of its business will help the company to counter sluggish growth from the domestic and European markets over the long term.However, tepid internal growth coupled with volatile foreign exchange rates and a decline in paper prices are expected to partially negate the company's strong product portfolio, increasing market share and promising international business. The company also faces stiff competition from Anacomp Inc. and  (  ).Thus, we have a Neutral recommendation on the stock.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for the quarter is 59 cents per share, representing an estimated year-over-year increase of 12.59%. Revenues, as per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, are expected to be $1.059 billion.The company, in the fourth quarter (ended May 31, 2012), reported earnings of 60 cents per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results improved from the year-ago earnings of 49 cents per share.Revenues in the reported quarter increased 4.1% year over year to $1.05 billion, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.07 billion.Out of the 11 analysts covering the stock, only 1 analyst has revised the estimate downwards for the first quarter over the last 7 days as well as 30 days. On the other hand, none of the analysts have revised their estimates for fiscal 2013 in either direction over the last 7 and 30 days.The Zacks Consensus Estimates for both the first quarter and fiscal 2013 remained the same over the last 7 and 30 days.With respect to earnings surprise, Cintas has topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the last four quarters. The company has delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 10.66% over the preceding four quarters, implying that it has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate by that measure.Cintas, leveraging its strong balance sheet, redeploys cash to its shareholders thus adding value. During fourth-quarter 2012, the company purchased $3.3 million of shares at an aggregate cost of $129.6 million.One of the important raw materials for Cintas is recycled paper used in document management segment. Gross margin during fourth-quarter fiscal 2012 dropped 70 basis points to 42.1% due to lower recycled paper prices. If paper price remains low then it may weigh on margins going forward.Cintas faces tough competition from companies like  (  ) and  (  ). Cintas retains a short-term Zacks #2 Rank (Buy).

"s the market continues to price in potential worst-case scenarios in Europe, now is a good time for dividend investors to keep a shopping list handy. More dividend bargains could be coming our way as quality stocks are pulled down a bit by the wider market. More on this point below.As far as the headline movers today, some of the earnings names bucking the weakness included Wal-Mart Stores (  ), The Buckle (  ), and Precision Castparts (  ). On the flipside, we saw selling in shares of Advance Auto Parts (  ), Gamestop (  ), and The Limited (  ) following their earnings results. Wall Street analyst downgrades pushed shares of Abercrombie & Fitch (  ) and Cintas (  ) lower. Also, Tiffany & Co. (  ) shares were down a bit, despite news of the company raising its dividend payout by 10.3%. We did finally see gold prices (  ) catch a bid as selling intensified. It has been tough sledding for commodity investors in 2012.Dividend investors should never panic when the market's inevitable down periods come around. As long as you stick to a strict sell discipline, you'll be able to avoid holding on to shares of companies that have lost their way for too long. Also, we tend to look at down periods as providing some better entry points for high-quality dividend names. So when the markets do pull back, think offensively rather than defensively.I understand that down days tend to make people nervous, but that's human nature and totally expected. If a stock you own is going down particularly hard on days the markets are not down so much, you should always examine why that price action occurred. Remember, even companies that were once titans in the business world can crumble if their business model or execution erodes over time.It pays to be proactive when it's time to pull the weeds out of one's dividend garden. Flat performance doesn't worry me as much as negative returns when the rest of the market is moving up nicely over a period of time. The stock tape can sometimes warn us ahead of time that we need to consider making changes, so as I said above, be prepared to take action. Just avoid getting skittish if it's simply the overall market pricing in potential bad news ahead.In  , we outline the do's and don'ts of investing in high-yield Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs). Our exclusive new MLP report outlines everything you need to know about these popular high-yield investments, including:- Understanding their unique company structure- What you absolutely need to know about their special tax treatment- Why MLPs may not be suitable for retirement accounts- How to find the best high-yield partnerships- …and much more!Head to the  page to download this brand new report today!We recently updated our list of dividend stocks that have been paying out dividends for 25 years or more. Be sure to check out  .Financial blog DailyReckoning.com recently took a look at the difference dividend payouts made in the overall return investors saw throughout the prior decades. Here are some of the highlights:- The Nasdaq is down 28% since the end of 1999. Even the ""blue chip"" S&P 500 stocks are down 15% during that time frame…until you add back those ""boring"" dividends. With dividends included, the S&P 500′s 15% loss flips to a 6% gain.- Without dividends, the S&P 500 index would have produced a loss for the 25 long years from August 1929 to August 1954. Then again, without dividends, the S&P 500 produced a 5% loss during the 13 years from September 1961 to September 1974. But with dividends included, the S&P's loss became a 46% gain.- Over the course of the last half-century, dividends have contributed more than half of the stock market's total return - 56%, to be exact.Of course, you can't discuss the potency of dividend investing without making mention of how awesome compound returns are. I can't stress enough the power of compound interest: you take a small amount of money and turn it into a large amount over time.

nformation storage and management service provider,  (  ) recently announced that it has acquired File House Offsite Record Storage, Document Systems Inc, and First National Safe Deposit. However, the terms of the transactions were not disclosed.File House Offsite Record Storage provides document storage solutions in the areas of Fredericksburg, Virginia, while Document Systems Inc. serves the Central and coastal South Carolina. Philadelphia-based First National Safe Deposit provides offsite data protection services.Although it is expected that these acquisitions will somewhat expand Iron Mountain's domestic business and customer base, we believe that they will not contribute significantly going forward owing to the small scale and reach of these businesses.As storage forms the crux of Iron Mountain's business model (contributing 57.0% in the recently concluded first quarter of 2012), we believe that the company will continue to pursue accretive acquisitions in this sector (both domestically and internationally) over the long term. Recently, IRM acquired Grupo Store, an information management business, based in Sao Paolo, Brazil for $80.0 million in cash.We expect Iron Mountain to drive significant growth through acquisitions in the emerging countries like Brazil, Russia, China and India, which will boost its international revenue going forward. We believe that this diversification and expansion will help the company counter sluggish growth in the domestic and European markets over the long term.We believe that Iron Mountain will benefit from its ongoing strategic overhauling policy, announced in April last year. As per its comprehensive strategic plan, Iron Mountain has taken a number of initiatives to improve its profitability over the past year. These include not only accretive acquisitions along the same business line and adjacent market segments, but also a review of underperforming assets and business units and the gradual divestiture of these units.In adherence to the policy, the company has dispensed with key assets of its under performing digital division and some other assets over the last 12 months. We believe that the emphasis on core business will help the company to enhance shareholder wealth over the long term.The divestiture of underperforming units and assets will also enhance the company's liquidity, which in turn will boost share buybacks and dividend activity going forward. Iron Mountain expects to return approximately $2.2 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends by 2013.We believe that Iron Mountain will continue to pursue growth opportunities in both domestic and international markets, which will help the company to achieve long-term targets of after-tax ROIC of 11.0% by 2013 (up from 7.7% in 2010), adjusted OIBDA margin of 32.0%, while lowering its capital spending to approximately 6.0% of revenue at the same time.However, tepid internal growth coupled with volatile foreign exchange rates and a decline in paper prices are expected to partially negate the company's strong product portfolio, increasing market share and promising international business. The company also faces stiff competition from Anacomp Inc. and  (  ).Thus, we have a Neutral recommendation on the stock. Currently, Iron Mountain has a Zacks #3 Rank, which implies a Hold rating in the near term.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Back-to-Back Acquisitions for IRM - Analyst Blog@2012-05-09@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/back-to-back-acquisitions-for-irm-analyst-blog-2012-05-09
 's (  ) first quarter adjusted earnings per share of 29 cents came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Reported earnings increased 3.6% from the year-ago quarter on the back of strong performance from its international business segment.Revenues increased by a marginal 0.7% from the year-ago quarter to $746.5 million, but fell shy of the Zacks Consensus Estimates of $751.0 million. On constant currency, quarterly revenues climbed 1%, which was offset by unfavorable currency fluctuations.Segment wise, Storage revenue (57.0% of revenues) climbed 2.3% year over year to $425.3 million. Storage revenue was driven by continued strong performance in the International business segment and persistent growth in the North America business. Global records management net volumes inched up 1% year over year.Service revenue (43.0% of revenues) dipped 2.8% year over year to $321.2 million. Core service was negatively impacted by slump in activity-based core service revenues and lower prices of recycled paper, which offset the robust hybrid revenue and rise in revenues from projects.Gross profit (excluding depreciation and amortization) edged up 0.2% year over year to $431.0 million in the reported quarter. Gross margin for the quarter increased to 57.8% versus 57.6% in the year-ago quarter, due to expansion in the storage gross margins on the back of lower occupancy costs, which offset the deceleration of the service gross margins.Adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization (OIBDA) for the quarter increased 1.8% year over year to $221.0 million. Adjusted OIBDA margin for the quarter increased 40 basis points on a year-over-year basis to 29.5%.Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were down nearly 1.0% from the prior-year period to $210.7 million, attributable to stringent overhead cost controls.Operating income in the quarter increased 2.9% year over year to $142.0 million. Operating margin was 19.0% compared with 18.5% in the previous-year quarter due to lower operating expenses.Iron Mountain exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $178.3 million compared with $179.8 million at the end of the previous quarter. Long-term debt (including the current portion) remained flat on a sequential basis at $3.35 billion.During the first quarter of 2012, the company repurchased 1.1 million shares for a total aggregate purchase price of $35.0 million under its existing share repurchase program. On April 13, 2012, the company paid a quarterly dividend of 25 cents per share.Earlier this month, IRM acquired Grupo Store, an information management business, based in Sao Paolo, Brazil for $80.0 million in cash which will strengthen the company's international business segment.For fiscal 2012, Iron Mountain expects revenues in the range of $2.99 billion to $3.07 billion. The company forecasts adjusted OIBDA between $890.0 million and $930.0 million. Iron Mountain expects earnings per share in the range of $1.20 to $1.36. The Zacks Consensus Estimate projects earnings of $1.32 per share for fiscal 2012.The company expects to spend approximately $220.0 million on capital assets. Free cash flow is expected in the range of $320.0 million to $360.0 million for fiscal 2012.Moreover, management expects a decline in paper prices to negatively impact the top line throughout the year.We maintain our Neutral recommendation on a long-term basis (6-12 months) due to tepid internal growth coupled with volatile foreign exchange rates and a decline in paper price that is set to partially negate the company's promising product portfolio, strong market share and a promising International business segment.Iron Mountain faces stiff competition from Anacomp Inc. and  (  ).Iron Mountain has a Zacks #3 Rank, which implies a short-term 'Hold' rating (for the next 1-3 months). ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis ReportThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Modest 1Q for Iron Mountain - Analyst Blog@2012-04-27@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/modest-1q-for-iron-mountain-analyst-blog-2012-04-27

e are downgrading our recommendation on  (  ) to Neutral as we expect that margins will remain under pressure in the fourth quarter due to an increase in energy and medical related expenses along with higher raw material costs.The company reported third-quarter fiscal 2012 earnings of 58 cents per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 52 cents. Total revenue in the reported quarter increased 7.9% year over year to $1.012 billion, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.008 billion.Cintas raised the earnings estimates for fiscal 2012 to a range of $2.24-$2.27 per share from the previous target of $2.16-$2.20. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $2.27, at the higher end of the company's guidance range. The company expects revenues in the band of $4.09-$4.12 billion, up from the previous range of $4.075-$4.125 billion.Cintas continues with margin expansion through cost efficiencies despite the pressure from higher energy and material costs. During the third quarter, gross margin increased 30 basis points (bps) to 42.1% and the operating margin inflated 200 bps to 13.6%.This marked the fifth consecutive quarter of increase in the operating margin. Cintas has scope for further margin expansion given the unutilized capacity in facilities that the company can leverage.Recently, Cintas has partnered with Rubbermaid Commercial Products, the leader in solutions based cleaning products, to offer its customers with hygiene solutions and custom cleaning. The synergy has proved beneficial, enabling Cintas to augment its current product portfolio.However, energy related costs along with medical expenses are expected to create headwinds. Moreover, lower paper price remains a concern for the company. It affected revenue growth in the Document Management segment during the third quarter.Organic growth dropped 1.3% and gross margin declined 240 bps to 47% year over year in the Document Management segment during the quarter. If paper price remains low, it may weigh on the segment as well as revenues going forward.In addition to paper, another important raw material is cotton which is used in uniforms. Higher cotton price remains a headwind for the balance of the year, particularly in the Rental segment, which may put pressure on margins moving forward.Cintas faces competition from  (  ) and privately-held companies ARAMARK Corporation and Alsco, Inc.

Be sure to  detailing the upgradeThere are scores of programs in the marketplace today that are designed to share the secrets on getting rich, but the thrill is usually gone by the time the books and DVDs arrive and you see the system is mostly worthless. If you are stuck at the starting line (for instance, if you still don't have an online brokerage account opened yet), you need to put together a checklist of routine tasks. Then you can start the process of building wealth properly.The simple task of writing your routine down is sometimes all it takes to progress beyond just sitting on the sidelines and watching the markets. Put a checklist together of tasks to complete to get you on your way. Many of these processes are one-time events, like opening a brokerage account or automating how much money will go from your weekly salary or savings account into your investing account. You should then pick a day where you will log on to  and target your favorite dividend stocks to buy in that particular month. Put them in your  and add your current portfolio holdings in there as well. The goal at a minimum should be to buy one stock per month. Within a year, you'll have the 10-12 dividend stocks that make up the initial core of your holdings.The investments we make in ourselves each day by learning all we can about relevant topics will pay an enormous dividend not only in our own lives, but the lives in our own family's future generations. These lessons are all around us. I'll be sure to share the ones I've learned (and continue to learn) in this newsletter.Critics are out in force following news all-world quarterback Peyton Manning has chosen the Denver Broncos as his next team. Many people saw Manning's best opportunity to win a championship with the San Francisco 49ers.Only Peyton knows why he ultimately chose Denver. Maybe the decision came down to simply having more control over the offense (in contrast, 49ers coach Jim Harbaugh is described as a control freak). Regardless, there is no turning back now that the big-money contract has been inked.We all will face or have faced a similar decision in our lives. Some people freeze up in those moments, paralyzed by the pressure to choose. I personally see decision-making as a graduation of maturity. The sooner we take charge of our future, the closer we'll be to experiencing a new perspective on reaching our ambitions. With the reputation Peyton has built in his career, sports fans know it was truly his decision on where his career would continue. He weighed the options and made the best choice for him and his family - and I think we can all learn something from that.I recently read a great article on FastCoDesign.com regarding how companies market products. The essence of the article stated that regardless of how much a company spends on marketing, success always comes down to the attractiveness of the product or service being sold.It doesn't matter where a product is featured or sold, but rather how it fills the need of those buying it. Here at Dividend.com, we've taken that same approach from day one. We've spent very little money marketing our  service. Instead, we concentrated on making the service as good as it could possibly be.Sure, it helps that you can easily find our site by searching online for dividend-related terms, which we're at the top of the rankings for. The way we achieved that position of strength, however, was from putting out quality content each day. We also partnered with some of the biggest and most respected names in the finance world (NASDAQ, Forbes, TheStreet, etc.) to help build up our brand. Finally, the outstanding word-of-mouth support from our readers has put us over the top as the #1 dividend-centric site on the web.The article also mentioned how Apple (  ) spent $5 billion out of its $62 billion in 2010 revenue on marketing, whereas Microsoft (  ) spent $17 billion of its $62 billion in 2010 revenue. Despite outspending Apple by $12 billion in marketing, Apple was still able to pass Microsoft in revenue and brand popularity by simply focusing on the products they deliver.As the article summed it up, where a company sells is becoming less important than what it sells. For those of you who love to learn about the inner workings of business, this is a great lesson to remember as you apply it to your own business situation perhaps. Throughout the years, we see some companies win market share while others head downhill. Holding on to shares in a company that has already seen its best days will never be good for your investment returns. Don't ever be afraid to say goodbye to brands that lose their relevancy. Sometimes the companies themselves don't ever realize they have lost their way, so as investors, we must stay vigilant and check our portfolios regularly.In case you missed it, we saw a plethora of companies raise their dividend payouts yesterday. Be sure to check out our  running down all these changes.We want to make sure everyone understands that the stocks on our  are the names we currently like for new investor capital, regardless of what date the stock was first recommended on. If and when a stock is removed from the list, we will clearly state whether the stock should be sold (which is rare but occasionally will happen), or simply held in one's account until we see a better entry point or catalyst.And here's one last thing to remember about what we do here at Dividend.com: it's not just the names that we recommend that can help you build wealth, but also the things we try to steer you away from that are just as important.

" (  ) is slated to report its third-quarter 2012 financial results after the closing bell on March 20. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is 52 cents per share, representing an estimated year-over-year increase of 26.42%. Revenues as per the Zacks Consensus Estimate are $1.01 billion.The company, in the second quarter (ended November 30, 2011), reported earnings of 57 cents per share, comfortably surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 48 cents per share and exceeding the year-ago earnings of 38 cents.Revenues increased 9% year over year to a record $1.02 billion, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1 billion.Cintas, which competes with  . (  ) and privately held Alsco Inc. and ARAMARK Corporation, experienced growth in the top-line because all its segments (other than Document Management Services) reported steady revenue increase in the second quarter.Out of the 12 analysts covering the stock, 2 have revised their estimates for the third quarter in the upward direction over the last 30 days with no reverse movements. A similar trend applies for fiscal 2012. There were no movements in either direction over the past week.The Zacks Consensus Estimates remained the same for both the third quarter and fiscal 2012 over the last 7 and 30 days.With respect to earnings surprise, Cintas has topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate over the last four quarters in the range of 10.6% to 18.8%. The average remained at a positive 13.7%, indicating that the company has topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by the same magnitude in the trailing four quarters.The analysts have revised their estimates on Cintas upwards, following its better-than-expected second quarter earnings results. The upward revision can be attributed to its strong performances in all divisions except Document Management, raised revenue and earnings per share guidance for 2012, solid organic growth and margin expansion despite cost headwinds.Recently, the company has partnered with ScanMD in order to switch on to electronic medical records (  ), instead of maintaining elaborate paper charts and files. The new alliance is expected to improve the Document Management Services segment of the company by curtailing the cost as well as labor of maintaining paper records.Our long-term recommendation on Cintas remains Outperform.

 's (  ) fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of 33 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 30 cents. However, reported earnings remained flat on a year-over-year basis.Revenues increased 1.8% year over year to $741.8 million, but fell shy of the Zacks Consensus Estimates of $744.0 million. Revenues were positively impacted by internal growth (1.0%) and favorable foreign exchange rates and acquisitions (1.0%).Segment wise, Storage revenue (56.7% of revenues) climbed 3.8% year over year to $420.8 million. Storage revenue's internal growth was 3% in the quarter, driven by continued strong performance in the International business segment and persistent growth in the North America business. Global records management net volumes crept up 2% year over year.Service revenue (43.3% of revenues) dipped 0.8% year over year to $321.0 million. Core service revenue's internal growth was negative 1.0% as strong hybrid service revenue growth and increased fuel surcharges were more than offset by the softness in North American core service activity levels.Gross profit (excluding depreciation and amortization) fell 2.0% year over year to $427.0 million in the reported quarter. Gross margin for the quarter stood at 57.5% versus 59.4% in the year-ago quarter, due to higher incentive compensation expense and mix shift toward hybrid service.Adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization (OIBDA) for the quarter upped 2.0% year over year to $237.0 million. Adjusted OBIDA margin for the quarter remained flat on a year-over-year basis at 32.0%.Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were down 5.2% from the prior-year period to $189.4 million, attributable to stringent overhead cost controls.Operating income in the quarter increased 2.0% year over year to $149.0 million. Operating margin was 20.1%, relatively flat on year-over-year basis.Iron Mountain exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $179.8 million compared with $480.9 million at the end of the previous quarter. Long-term debt (including the current portion) was $3.35 billion versus $3.32 billion in the prior quarter.During the fourth quarter of 2011, the company repurchased 14.7 million shares for a total aggregate purchase price of $440.0 million under its existing share repurchase program. On January 13, 2012, the company paid a quarterly dividend of 25 cents per share.For fiscal 2012, Iron Mountain expects revenues in the range of $2.97 billion to $3.05 billion. The Zacks Consensus revenue estimate for the fiscal 2012 is pegged at $3.07 billion.The company forecasts adjusted OIBDA between $890.0 million and $930.0 million. Iron Mountain expects earnings per share in the range of $1.20 to $1.36. The Zacks Consensus Estimate projects earnings of $1.33 per share for fiscal 2012.The company expects to spend approximately $215.0 million on capital assets. Free cash flow is expected in the range of $320.0 million to $360.0 million for fiscal 2012.Moreover, management expects a 32.0% year-over-year decline in paper prices to affect the total revenue by $45 million. Additionally, North American core service activities will likely experience continued pressure while the decline in paper prices is expected to be a headwind going forward.Iron Mountain has more or less outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimates by a positive 2.86% over the last four quarters and the phenomenon was repeated in the quarter when reported earnings beat the Zacks Consensus by 10.0%.We maintain our Neutral recommendation on a long-term basis (6-12 months) due to weak internal growth coupled with volatile foreign exchange rates and a decline in paper price that is set to partially negate the company's promising product portfolio, strong market share and a promising International business segment.Iron Mountain faces stiff competition from Anacomp Inc.,  (  ) and privately held SOURCECORP, Inc.Iron Mountain has a Zacks #3 Rank, which implies a short-term 'Hold' rating (for the next 1-3 months). ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis ReportThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Iron Mountain Reports Mixed 4Q - Analyst Blog@2012-02-23@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/iron-mountain-reports-mixed-4q-analyst-blog-2012-02-23

Although signs continue to emerge of a strengthening economy, yesterday's weaker-than-forecast  started this week's deluge of domestic housing data on a shaky note. Housing starts and building permits are in focus today, with both reports slated for release at 8:30 a.m. Meanwhile, fresh concerns out of China have also put the bulls on edge. Against this guarded backdrop, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is looking at a 60-point drop, while the broader SPX is trading 7 points lower.In equities news, CVR Energy, Inc. (CVI - 27.09) has once again rejected Carl Icahn's $30 per share tender offer. The board of directors also requested that current shareholders not tender their shares to the activist investor.

CVI is up 0.3% ahead of the bell.In earnings news, Adobe Systems Incorporated (ADBE - 34.51) said its first-quarter profit arrived at $185.2 million, or 37 cents per share, a 21% drop from last year's $234.6 million, or 46 cents per share. Excluding items, earnings landed at 57 cents per share. Although product sales fell 4.1%, a 38% surge in subscription sales helped push total revenue up 1.7% to $1.05 billion. The results fell in line with analysts' expectations. For the current quarter, ADBE is projecting a per-share profit of 57 cents to 61 cents on revenue of $1.09 billion to $1.14 billion, on the low end of the Street's forecast for earnings of 60 cents per share on $1.1 billion in sales. ADBE is set to drop 3.7% right out of the gate.Tiffany & Co. (TIF - 68.68) unveiled a fourth-quarter profit of $178.4 million, or $1.39 per share, down 1.6% from its year-ago earnings of $181.2 million, or $1.41 per share. The upscale jeweler attributed the earnings decline to a steep income tax provision of $94 million, up from $85.9 million in the comparable quarter of fiscal 2010.

Miners and resource stocks were among the notable laggards, after sector heavyweight BHP Billiton noted ""flattening"" Chinese demand for iron ore. Banks also underperformed, with Shanghai Pudong Development Bank leading the pack after Citigroup unloaded a $743-million stake at a discount. However, some tech stocks were able to buck the selling trend, as investors cheered Apple's first-ever dividend. By the close, China's Shanghai Composite fell 1.4%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng lost 1.1%, South Korea's Kospi shed 0.2%, and Japan's Nikkei edged up 0.1%.The major European benchmarks are broadly lower at midday, following suit with Asia. Mining issues are slumping in response to BHP Billiton's demand warning, and automakers have also taken a turn south.

The  , which cost $0.25 to open, would widen in the process. (See our  section)The position can also profit if CTAS stays below $42.50 in the next five weeks but then rallies above it. In that case, the trader will own the May calls at less than half price and remain exposed to gains in the following month.The only possibility of the position losing money is if the stock closes above $42.50 before April 20. In that case the initial outlay would be gone.CTAS rose 0.60 percent to $40.21 on Friday. The stock has risen 32 percent in the last three months after a strong earnings report in December. The company supplies uniforms to a wide array of institutions, including hotels, prisons, and hospitals. It also provides items such as first-aid kits and fire-alarm systems.The trader may additionally believe that the stock will pause around $42.50 because it's a long-term peak from early 2007.

"intas Corporation (  )Cintas provides highly specialized services to businesses of all types throughout North America. It is the largest company in its space and services more than 900,000 businesses. Founded in 1983, Cintas has become the go-to for everything from the design, manufacture and implementation of corporate identity uniform programs to entrance mats, restroom supplies, promotional products, document management and even fire protection, first aid and safety services.They have over 430 facilities in the US and Canada that employ over 30,000 people. The rental division is still the company's largest but is just a part of their overall pie. You will find Cintas' floor mats, first aid kits, fire alarms and suppression systems, hand soaps and air fresheners in many large and mid-size companies across the US.Growing NeedOn  , I noted the bullish fundamental strength of Cintas and the bullish tone the company took since realizing that they could deliver strong results even in challenging times. An improving jobs market and consumer outlook seems to be having a direct positive effect on Cintas. Anecdotally, it seems plausible that many consumers and employers alike went into ""panic mode"" once the recession hit 3 years ago. Until recently, this frugal state of mind most likely prevented or slowed many from spending on discretionary expenses like new uniforms, mats, first aid kits, etc. In that time, potential demand built up and now it seems there could be a continued onslaught of business for companies like Cintas as these ""semi-discretionary"" items become a necessity.Another Strong QuarterCintas delivered strong Q3 2012 earnings on March 20th of 58 cents per share. Earnings were 41.5% higher than the 41 cents reported in the year-ago quarter; net income increased by 28.7% to $76 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was for 52 cents ahead of the number. Total revenues in the quarter increased 7.9% year over year to $1.012 billion, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.008 billion. Organic growth in the quarter was 5.9%.Their most recent quarter's beat kept their earnings surprises on a role; over the past year they have exceeded expectations by an average of over 13%.Looking AheadOn the most recent call, Cintas updated their guidance for fiscal 2012. They now expect 2012 revenue to be in the range of $4.09 billion to $4.12 billion with EPS in the range of $2.24 to $2.27. They offered this guidance with the caveat that there is no further deterioration in the U.S. Economy.According to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, expectations are for Cintas to generate $0.59 in income this quarter. Of the 12 analysts who cover CTAS, the consensus is for the company to grow earnings by 34% in the current year (FY2012) and roughly 11.4% in FY2013.In terms of the magnitude of analyst estimate trends, we are still seeing all of the consensus estimates higher than they were 90 days ago for the current and next quarters as well as FY2012 and FY2013. There have been a slew of positive revisions following the most recent earnings announcement.The stock is now a Zacks Rank 2 Buy.Market Performance & TechnicalsWhile the earnings report was good, it turned out to be a ""buy on rumor, sell on news"" event, sending shares off 4% from their 52 week high of $40.61 reached just the day prior.For the first time since December 2011, CTAS closed below its 50 day moving average, which now stands at $38.78. If the stock can get back above that level, it will once again become support. For the time being, it seems like a bit of resistance the stock needs to break through. The 200 day is quite a bit lower at $33.25.CTAS has exceeded the S&P 500's performance by 23% in the past year but has begun to lag in the last 90 days due to its consolidation and move lower.ULTA Beauty (  )When you think of the return of the American consumer, the last thing on your mind is hairspray, perfume and skincare products; but the fact of the matter is that Ulta Beauty and competitors like  might already be reaping the rewards of a stronger consumer who is armed with credit and ready to make a fresh start.Recent economic data supports the thesis that consumer strength and spending is indeed improving. Ulta is what I would consider a ""discretionary-staple"" company in that they offer many of the day to day aesthetic needs of American consumers (mostly women, but men as well) which help keep revenue flowing under normal financial circumstances. In times of growth, ULTA will enjoy higher net sales, but also a gravitation towards high price, high margin products and services. Old National Bank (  )Old National Bank is one of those companies that you probably never heard of and if it weren't for TARP and the warrants that were issued in conjunction with TARP, I would have most likely overlooked it as well.Back in 2009, ONB was given a gracious gift by the government in the form of a cheap buyback of their warrants. In short, the bank was able to buy back their stock warrants that were owned by the treasury for about 20% of their real value, saving them millions of dollars. This ended up costing the taxpayer, but all worked out well for this regional bank.Three years later, ONB is being recognized by the Ethisphere Institute as one of the World's Most Ethical Companies (not that they did anything wrong with TARP) and has been delivering strong earnings results over the past year. In the financial sector, regionals like ONB are sometimes preferred because they don't typically carry the same risks as thier much larger multi-national peers. Old Dominion Freight Line (  )22 years before Dwight D. Eisenhower formed the national interstate system in the US, Old Dominion was moving freight around this country. 80 years after its humble beginnings,  was recently named the number 1 LTL (less than truckload) carrier.Trucking is in integral part of interstate commerce here in the states and with almost 12,000 employees and roughly 6,000 tractors to pull their 16,000 pup trailers and 6,300+ vans, ODFL is a major player in the space. They may not be the largest, but they were the fastest growing; sales rose 25.7 percent in 2011 to $1.7 billion according to a study by SJ Consulting Group in Pittsburgh. The LTL trucking sector as a whole grew 11.6 percent in 2011 compared to 2010, netting $30.6 billion in the year.With higher gas prices and a challenging consumer environment, can these trends continue? Red Robin Gourmet Burgers (  )I have dined at a couple Red Robins in my day and had no idea they were a public company until about a week ago. You'd think after ranking as the #1 Best Burger (chain stores) 3 years in a row from Zagat; they would be on my radar being that I'm a connoisseur of fine ground beef in a bun and a stock junkie.After listening to their commercial about 20 times I had their chime in my head, but it was a random trip out to Garland Texas that introduced me to one of the 462 restaurants in the chain. It was worth the trip if you like burgers and other items.On the surface, my biggest complaint would be obviously be visibility, unlike competitors like Chipotle Mexican grill, which seems to be everywhere you look (physically and in financial circles), Red Robin is a bit harder to find. Red Robin does have diversity in its offerings with everything from ribs to shrimp tacos to fish and chips, which add to its attraction. When you compare the two, Chipotle (  ) is currently trading at more than 50 times forward earnings, while Red Robin is at about 19 times. Perhaps there is still some value in this unique burger chain. Jared A Levy is the Senior Stock Strategist for Zacks.com.

Stocks recently featured in the blog include  (  ),  (  ),  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ).Get the most recent insight from Zacks Equity Research with the free Profit from the Pros newsletter: The U.S. economy is going through a rough patch, and at such times it is a tough task for the retailers to convince the shoppers to pay big bills.Using the arsenals of early-hours store openings, huge discounts, promotional activities and free shipping on online purchases, some of the retail companies were able to lure the cautious customers during the holiday season. But all were not fortune enough in getting the best of rewards from their strategic cards. (  ), the operator of general merchandise and food discount stores in the United States, posted lower-than-expected December comparable-stores sales of 1.6%, compelling management to trim the earnings outlook. The company now expects fourth-quarter 2011 earnings of $1.35 to $1.43 per share, compared with its earlier guidance of $1.43 to $1.53.Consequently, Target felt the need to adapt to the demands of time and consider consumer-oriented strategies. The recent one announced by the company is 'The Shops at Target', meaning small boutiques in stores.The new design program, which is in line with  's (  ) store-within-store concept, is slated to make a debut on May 6 at every Target store and will initially run for six weeks. J. C. Penney has incorporated stores of Sephora, MNG by Mango and Call It Spring by The ALDO Group in its store suite.'The Shops at Target' will feature exclusive collections of 400 items from five different specialty stores - The Candy Store, Cos Bar, Polka Dog Bakery, Privet House and The Webster - tailored to cater to the demand of customers with prices ranging from $1 to $159.99.In line with in-store department concept, Target unveiled another plan of incorporating small  (  ) stores across its 25 locations as a test run, which will display products from the maker of Macintosh computers. Target's stores currently carry products such as, iPads and iPods from Apple.An enhanced relationship with Target will help Apple aim a wider spectrum of customers. Apple also operates small stores within  's (  ) floor space,  reported.Additionally, Target has gone a step ahead to further bolster investors' confidence on the stock by announcing a new $5 billion share repurchase program, which is to be exhausted in 2 to 3 years. The company hinted that it will initiate repurchasing under the new program, after completing its current $10 billion share buyback authorization in early 2012.The company had bought back 185 million shares at a price of $51.53 per share under its current authorization from the time when it was announced in November 2007 through the third quarter of 2011. Target also informed that in the first three quarters of 2011, it had repurchased 34 million shares worth approximately $1.7 billion. In 2012, the company plans to invest $1.5 billion or more towards share buyback.The share repurchase activity not only enhances shareholders' return but also boosts earnings per share and raise the market value of the remaining shares. The company's long-term objective is to increase its earnings to $8.00 per share or more by 2017.Another financial mechanism, which Target makes use of to create value for shareholders is through dividend yields. The company has been consistently raising its dividend for the last 40 years, and expects it to increase to $3.00 per share by 2017 from the current $1.20. The company recently declared a quarterly dividend of 30 cents to be paid on March 10, 2012 to shareholders of record on February 15, 2012.Target is persistently trying every means to stay afloat in this turbulent environment. The company's P-fresh remodel program, 5% REDcard Rewards program, City Target stores and its foray into the foreign market are its arsenals to battle the economic upheaval.Target's efficient marketing, multi-channel strategy, product innovation, compelling pricing strategy, and new merchandise assortments, should drive comparable-store sales and operating margins in the long term.The company is eyeing opportunities in the international markets, such as Canada and Latin America. We believe, store openings outside the United States will definitely boost the company's top and bottom lines and improve cash flow generation capability.It is evident that the company's customers remain sensitive to macroeconomic factors including interest rate hikes, increase in fuel and energy costs, credit availability, unemployment levels, and high household debt levels, which may affect their discretionary spending, and in turn curtail the company's growth and profitability.Currently, we maintain our Neutral rating on the stock. Moreover, Target holds Zacks #3 Rank that translates into a short-term Hold recommendation, and correlates with our long-term view.We have recently upgraded  (  ) from Neutral to Outperform encouraged by solid organic growth and margin expansion despite cost headwinds. Furthermore, we believe Cintas' balance sheet and cash flow characteristics support a renewed repurchase authorization and a dividend hike.Cintas reported earnings of 57 cents per share for fiscal second quarter 2012, comfortably surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 48 cents and 50% higher than the 38 cents earned in the year-ago quarter. Total revenue increased 9% to a record $1.02 billion, striding ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1 billion.Cintas was directly affected by a huge number of job losses and facility closures during the recession. However, during those times, Cintas enhanced its operations by evaluating sales force productivity, optimizing routes and streamlining labor overhead. This helped the company return to year-over-year organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 after a stretch of negative performance for six quarters. Since then, organic growth has only accelerated.In the reported quarter, the company posted solid organic growth of 7%, close to the 8% in the fourth quarter of 2011 - an all time high in the past five years and a massive improvement over the 4.2% growth reported in the year-ago quarter. Even as the macro environment remains uncertain, we believe Cintas will continue to drive growth by adding salespeople and increasing sales productivity.Cintas also continues to deliver margin expansion through better sales productivity and cost efficiencies, offsetting the rising headwinds from higher energy and garment material prices. There is scope for further gross margin expansion as the company has unutilized capacity in facilities that it can leverage.Want more from Zacks Equity Research?

"intas Corporation (  )Cintas does more than just rental work uniforms. Over the years, they have evolved into many diverse segments from document management to fire protection. Even with this variety, just about all of their businesses are dependent on a strong consumer and healthy economy.Because Cintas has contracts with many large industrial and commercial companies and runs a diversified corporation, they can not only weather more storms than their competition, but also offer customers a gamut of services at a good price to improve retention.If you are a believer in the American consumer and economic recovery then Cintas may be a stock to watch. It has been building solid momentum over the past several months and recently reported a blow-out quarter which sent shares soaring.Company Description & DevelopmentsCintas provides highly specialized services to businesses of all types throughout North America. It is the largest company in the space and services more than 900,000 businesses. Founded in 1983, Cintas has become the go-to for everything from the design, manufacture and implementation of corporate identity uniform programs to entrance mats, restroom supplies, promotional products, document management and even fire protection, first aid and safety services.They have over 430 facilities in the US and Canada that employ over 30,000 people. The rental division is still the company's largest but is just a part of their overall pie. You will find Cintas' floor mats, first aid kits, fire alarms and suppression systems, hand soaps and air fresheners in many large and mid-size companies across the US.They may not be a visible to the general public, but to their customers, they offer invaluable service and a positive corporate culture that propels their success.For all you ""green"" folks out there, Cintas is making the first transition in the industry to a phosphate-free and EDTA-free biodegradable solution for the laundering of their uniforms. Washing Systems LLC is the supplier of these new sustainable laundry products and is their partner in this new venture.Financial ProfileCTAS is a mid-cap (5.01 billion) company that is trading at about 17 times forward (expectations for next quarter) earnings. CTAS became a Zacks Rank 1 strong buy on December 23rd, 2011 after their strong results on December 20th.The services company reported a quarterly sales increase of 1% at their last earnings report, but saw a 10% rise in EPS for the same period. Annual sales were up 9% compared to (fiscal) Q22011 with total sales of roughly 3.8 billion in FY2011. CTAS earnings jumped from a $1.40 to $1.69 profit from FY2010 to FY2011. CTAS is expected to earn $2.19 in FY2012 according to the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Earnings EstimatesCintas reported strong earnings last quarter that beat estimates by 19%. On the call, Cintas noted record revenue and saw a 50% jump in EPS year over year. They also saw margins increase throughout several of their business. Cintas has surprised analysts to the upside for the past 4 quarters in a row an average of 13.66%.Expectations are for CTAS to generate $0.52 in income this quarter when they report on March 20th. Of the 12 analysts who cover CTAS, the consensus is for the company to grow earnings by 30% in the current year (FY2012) and roughly 11% in FY2013.In terms of the magnitude of analyst estimate trends, we are seeing all of the consensus estimates higher than they were 90 days ago for the current and next quarters as well as FY2012 and FY2013. It was interesting to note that the CEO was cautious in their September report. Once he realized that they were able to deliver such strong results in the December report, Cintas upped their guidance for the entire year which pushed their stock even higher.He was confident that even in challenging times Cintas would be able to deliver. If the economy is indeed improving, results should be even better.Market Performance & TechnicalsCTAS struggled a bit in the last half of 2011 and fell almost 27% from the July highs to its lows in October. Late November was key for the stock as it broke above the 50 day moving average and began to pick up steam.After the last report, the stock was propelled above both moving averages and has continued to rise in the past couple weeks. CTAS is now firmly above its 50 and 200 day moving averages of $35.73 and $31.92 respectively. The recent consolidation has developed some support at the $37.00 level as well. Below that look at $34.45 as a major level aside from the moving averages.CTAS has exceeded the S&P 500's performance by 31% in the past year and over 18% in the past 3 months. Given its recent consolidation in the past couple weeks, Cintas is lagging the index by about 2%. The good news is that consolidation is when a stock will generally build a foundation. The stock is also relatively cheap which will benefit it if the market takes another leg up. If consumer strength continues to improve, look for CTAS stock to follow suit.Jared A Levy is the Momentum Stock Strategist for Zacks.com.

e have recently upgraded  (  ) from Neutral to Outperform encouraged by solid organic growth and margin expansion despite cost headwinds. Furthermore, we believe Cintas' balance sheet and cash flow characteristics support a renewed repurchase authorization and a dividend hike.Cintas reported earnings of 57 cents per share for fiscal second quarter 2012, comfortably surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 48 cents and 50% higher than the 38 cents earned in the year-ago quarter. Total revenue increased 9% to a record $1.02 billion, striding ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1 billion.Cintas was directly affected by a huge number of job losses and facility closures during the recession.

There is scope for further gross margin expansion as the company has unutilized capacity in facilities that it can leverage.Cintas recently raised its quarterly dividend by 5 cents to 54 cents, the 29th consecutive year of the company's dividend hike. The company has religiously hiked its dividend each year starting from 1983, the year it went public. In addition, Cintas' board of directors also approved a new share repurchase program under which the company may repurchase up to $500 million of Cintas common stock at market prices. Since the beginning of fiscal 2011, the company has purchased 23.4 million shares under its share buyback programs at a total cost of $702 million. We believe Cintas' solid balance sheet and cash flow support a renewed repurchase authorization and a dividend hike and could create further upside for shareholders.On the flipside, Cintas continues to be plagued with rising costs of cotton used in uniforms and diesel fuel for trucks. Energy and cotton prices remain headwinds for 2012, particularly in the Rental segment.Furthermore, its Document Management segment was affected by a material decline in recycled paper prices. After experiencing a fairly long stretch of prices in excess of $200 per ton, the prices dropped to $150 per ton during the quarter, 16% below the first-quarter average. In the next few quarters, recycled paper prices will remain sluggish at $150 per ton. The segment was also affected by the difficult economic environment in Europe. Although the company has taken steps to right-size the business, incurring costs this quarter, we await the segment to deliver a turnaround.All said, we upgrade our recommendation from Neutral to Outperform on Cintas Corporation. The quantitative Zacks #1 Rank (short term Strong Buy rating) for the company indicates upward pressure on the stock over the near term.Cincinnati, Ohio-based Cintas Corporation designs, manufactures and implements corporate identity uniform programs, and provides entrance mats, restroom supplies, promotional products, and first aid and safety products for approximately 900,000 businesses.

"n order to convert medical charts to electronic formats  (  ) has entered into a partnership with ScanMD recently. Cintas will now be able to switch to electronic medical records (  ) instead of maintaining elaborate paper charts and files.The coalition will guarantee Cintas the security of medical records by converting the paper charts into electronic formats, backed-up on secure servers. The searchable data fields will make the task of searching the patient's records easier. The PDF files will simplify the navigation process, thus saving time. Alongside, the solution will also save the cost and space required for maintaining the paper charts and files.The alliance with ScanMD has helped Cintas in curtailing the cost and labor of transforming the healthcare information and records to EMR program. Moreover, Cintas is also able to stay ahead of the future legislative regulations of utilizing EMR programs.ScanMD specializes in converting paper medical charts to electronic formats. It integrates paper charts to EMR and safeguards them, fulfilling the norms of Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). The system also diminishes the risk of HIPAA issues by reducing the number of lost or inaccessible files.In the recently reported quarterly results, Cintas' earnings increased 50% to 57 cents per share from 38 cents in the year-ago-quarter. Total revenue increased 9% year over year to $1.02 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter of the year 2012 is 52 cents.Cintas continues to deliver margin expansion through better sales productivity and cost efficiencies, offsetting the rising headwinds from higher energy and other input costs. During the second quarter of fiscal 2012, gross margin increased 50 basis points to 42.2% and in operating margin there was an impressive 200 basis point expansion to 13%; this happens to be the fourth consecutive quarter of strong operating margin expansion after several years of decline.This performance was commendable considering the ongoing headwinds from higher energy and garment material prices. There is scope for further gross margin expansion as the company has unutilized capacity in facilities that it can leverage. Furthermore, due to a weak labor outlook, much of the growth over the last few quarters has been driven by new business sales rather than existing customers adding more employees, which is more profitable. Any increase in hiring at existing customers will boost margin expansion.Currently, the shares of Cintas maintain a Zacks #2 (short-term ""Buy"" recommendation) Rank.

(Will the new EU bailout fuel a debt supercycle? According to several analysts it very well could.According to  the developed world faces a paradox: easy credit is the solution to financial problems, and easy credit is the source of financial problems. European leaders are all caught up in this Catch 22 as they aim to manage the debt problems of Greece, Italy and Spain in a summit on Wednesday.Right now the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) has $400 billion in committed funds for the use of propping up troubled financial institutions, and in turn their country’s economy. This is in addition to the $200 billion already spent on Ireland, Portugal and Greece.But more money is needed to pump up the economies and assure the markets everything is under control. This has some worried that European economies will start to fall into a “debt supercycle,” a term coined in 2007 by BCA Research.“The debt supercycle is a simple idea: Sound economic policy requires deficit spending and stimulus efforts to stop financial crises and restore economic growth. But in doing so, it lays the groundwork for even bigger bust later on.”Essentially, bailout of a small crisis needs an easy flow of money that can lead to a bigger crisis, which requires an even larger and easier flow of money to move on. The pattern repeats until the necessary bailouts are too large to be managed. Has Europe reached that point?Fortune notes, “most economists and policymakers see the 100% level of debt-to-GDP as the line where economies become unsustainable: historically, rising above this level is seen as sparking a long, slow economic and political descent.” And while countries like Japan have a shocking 226% debt to GDP ratio most of that debt is owed to itself.Unlike Japan, the European Union has an 85% debt to GDP ratio right now and largely owes money outside its borders. With the addition of a $1.3 trillion dollars in bailout funds (the amount many officials say is the necessary to stabilize the EU) the debt to GDP will immediately raise to 94%.So, are you worried about the debt super-cycle’s possible impact on your portfolio? To help you explore this idea, we identified about 150 S&P 500 stocks have the highest ratio of long-term debt to equity.From this list, we collected data on institutional transactions, and identified the names that have seen the largest outflows during the current quarter.Big money managers appear to be concerned about the debt levels at these companies–do you own any of these names?Use this list as a starting point for your own analysis.1.  of all companies mentioned2.  mentioned below3.  mentioned Engages in the discovery, development, and commercialization of therapeutics for the treatment of life threatening diseases worldwide.

e have recently downgraded  (  ) from Outperform to Neutral as the positives like solid organic growth and margin expansion are undercut by headwinds from cotton and energy prices and an uncertain economic environment.In the first quarter of 2012, Cintas reported earnings of 52 cents per share, comfortably surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 47 cents and 30% higher than the 40 cents earned in the year-ago quarter. Strong performance across all its business segments helped the company to deliver better-than-expected results.Total revenue in the quarter under review increased 10.1% to $1.02 billion, striding ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.998 billion. The quarter marked the second consecutive period of double-digit revenue growth.Cintas, in fiscal 2012, expects to generate revenue in the band of $4.0 billion to $4.1 billion and EPS in the range of $1.97 to $2.05. The Zacks Consensus Estimates for revenue and EPS are at $4.075 billion and $2.04, respectively.During the recession, Cintas sharpened its operations by evaluating sales force productivity, optimizing routes and streamlining labor overhead. The company returned to year-over-year organic revenue growth in mid-2010 not looking back since then. In the recently reported quarter, the company posted solid organic growth of 7.6%, reflecting the sixth consecutive quarter of a year-over-year rise. The organic growth of 7.6% was almost on par with a rise of 8% recorded in the fourth quarter of 2011, marking a five-year high and a distinct improvement over the 2.8% growth recorded in the year-ago quarter. Though the macro environment can limit Cintas' growth prospects, the company has the wherewithal to drive growth by adding additional salespersons and increasing sales productivity.On the margin front, Cintas continues to expand through better sales productivity and cost efficiencies, offsetting the rising headwinds from higher energy and other input costs. During the first quarter of fiscal 2012, gross margin increased 60 basis points to 43.2% and operating margin expanded an impressive 170 basis points to 12.6%, the third consecutive quarter of strong operating margin expansion after several years of declines. This performance was commendable considering the ongoing headwinds from higher energy and garment material prices.Cintas recently raised its quarterly dividend by 5 cents to 54 cents, the 29th straight year of the company's dividend hike, translating into a 10.2% increase from the prior dividend of 49 cents. The company has religiously hiked its dividend each year starting from 1983, the year it went public. We believe Cintas' solid balance sheet and cash flow characteristics support a renewed repurchase authorization and a dividend hike.On the flipside, Cintas draws 70% of revenue from its core uniform rental segment, which is in the saturation stage. The company is constantly making efforts to innovate and focus on its other businesses, including direct uniform sales, first aid safety, fire protection and document management. However, in doing so, the additional resources and time involved in developing these growing segments may affect Cintas' profitability.The quarter was plagued by rising costs such as cotton for uniforms and diesel fuel for trucks. These costs could pressure profitability in 2012, particularly in the Rental segment. Management reiterated expectations for a $15 million impact from higher cotton prices.Cintas' revenue largely depends upon the service industry, including hotels, airlines, restaurants, etc. Any drop in the employment rate can adversely impact the company's profitability.We have thus downgraded our recommendation on Cintas Corporation from Outperform to Neutral. The quantitative Zacks #2 Rank (short-term Buy rating) for the company indicates upward pressure on the stock over the near term.Cincinnati, Ohio-based Cintas Corporation designs, manufactures and implements corporate identity uniform programs, and provides entrance mats, restroom supplies, promotional products, and first aid and safety products for approximately 900,000 businesses.

"he focus was back on fundamentals for the markets today, and investors didn't take too well to some of the earnings results.Before we delve into the stocks making headlines today, I just wanted to point out a recent story that has me shaking my head. Today, the National Association of Realtors revised existing home sales data for the 2007-2010 period by 14%. What does that mean? It means that the agency mistakenly reported a significantly higher amount of existing home sales during that period than had actually occurred.What a shock! The organization that represents the interests of real estate agencies overestimated the numbers to their benefit. This development is just another example of why we should always remain skeptical of the economic data we're greeted with on a daily basis. As investors, our focus should be squarely on company and industry fundamentals. Those metrics are what will ultimately determine share prices over the long term.Getting back to the earnings results from earlier today, reports from names such as Oracle Corp (  ) (  ), Walgreen Company (  ) (  ), and Paychex (  ) (  ), were met with selling by market participants, although Walgreen Co. did bounce nicely off the early lows. On the flipside, buyers liked the results from Nike (  ) (  ) and Cintas (  ), with both stocks trading in the green all day.Anyone checking out our  section today will notice that we trimmed the ratings on several recommended names. These stocks are still recommended, but due to the recent outperformance and share price run-ups, we felt compelled to cut their ratings just a bit. Again, these names are all still on our  . It's just that the valuations for some have gotten a little less attractive, so subscribers should consider looking at some of the other names we currently recommend which may have similar ratings at this point.It is always great to see the media tip their hat to what has been a great year for dividend-paying stocks. We're seeing several major media outlets publishing articles about how dividends were a big investing theme in 2011.The truth is that we tend to see solid years more often than not in the dividend world, but the business media focuses their attention instead on the high-risk momentum action.

"There are two lists that serve as basic source material for investors interested in long-term dividend-raisers. One is the well-known  list published by S&P. (To get the list, click the link here, then Market Attributes, then Dividend Aristocrats. Free registration is required.) The other is the lesser-known  list maintained by The DRiP Investing Resource Center, a non-profit organization.In my book, the latter list is far more useful than the former. What follows is a comparison between the two lists. Both lists, at first glance, appear to have the same goal: To identify companies that have raised their dividends for 25 consecutive years. That would lead one to believe that the lists should be identical. But they are not. The Dividends Aristocrats [DA] list identifies  such companies as of February 17, 2010. The Dividend Champions [DC] list names  . How can that be? The answer lies in the methods used to compile the lists.The two organizations use slightly different wording to describe what their lists show. S&P states that the DA list shows companies with ""25 consecutive years of increased cash payments."" DriP puts it this way: ""[C]ompanies that have increased their dividend in at least 25 consecutive years[,…]broadened to include additional companies that [have] paid higher dividends (without necessarily having increased the quarterly rate in every calendar year."" DA uses the S&P 500. If a company is removed from the S&P 500, it is immediately removed from the DA list. If a company is added to the S&P 500, it is not eligible to be included on the DA list until the list is recompiled in mid-December each year. DC does not specify its universe, but it appears simply to be all US-based companies. Note that neither list includes foreign-based companies. S&P's DA list is updated once per year, in mid-December. It remains unchanged during the year unless a company is dropped from the S&P 500 as just described. Each month during the year, DA is updated to show whether or not a dividend increase or decrease has been declared by each company on the list. So even if a company declares a decreased dividend early in the year, the company will remain on the DA list for the rest of the year. For example, when GE announced in Feb. 2009 that it intended to cut its dividend, GE remained on the DA list for the rest of 2009, with a notation that its dividend had ""decreased in February.""DC is updated every month. GE was deleted from its list at the end of Feb, 2009, as it should have been. DC maintains a running chronology of changes to its list. That chronology notes, ""2/27/09: Deleted General Electric (div. reduced)."" GE has not appeared on the DC list since that date. S&P focuses on ""dividend actions."" These are positive declarations by a company that it is increasing its dividend.DriP focuses on the actual dividend paid annually. This introduces another difference between the two lists. A company can increase its dividend distribution year-over-year without declaring a dividend increase. For example, ""alternators"" are companies that declare a dividend increase every other year, then hold the payment steady between increases. Say that a company pays out four times per year, as is typical of US companies. Then the actual annual dividend distribution will rise each year even if there is a declared increase only every other year. DC picks up such companies, DA does not. (If it is not intuitive to you why every-other-year increases result in annually increasing payouts, see the example in the DC document.)Another apparent difference is that DC accounts for ""special dividends."" When a company declares a special dividend, it can appear the following year that it cut its dividend, even though its ""regular dividend"" has actually increased. DC factors out special dividends for its listing, and therefore it does not drop a company on the basis that it issued a special dividend the preceding year. Each list gives the company name, ticker symbol, and sector/industry for each company on its list. Each list is available in Excel spreadsheet form. DriP also provides a pdf version of DC. The DA list is alphabetical, while the DC list is in descending order of the dividend streak. DA provides a year-by-year tabulation (going back 8 years) of dividend actions by the companies on its list. It tells what month the dividend was increased in that year. For the current year, it tells whether a company has decreased its dividend, without removing the stock from the list. If the company has neither increased nor decreased its dividend in the current or preceding year, that cell is left blank in the spreadsheet. Even if a company has declared a decreased dividend, S&P keeps the company on the DA list until the next December update. So, for example, in the list dated 11/11/2009, DA showed 52 companies, even though 8 of them had decreased their dividends (as noted in the document). Two other companies remained on the list even though no increase was noted in either 2008 or 2009. All 10 of those companies have been removed from the 2010 list.DriP's DC list provides a host of additional information beyond the bare list itself:The DC list uses colors to flag special situations: It uses green to indicate that an increase announcement is expected in the next 30 days. It uses red to indicate that the last dividend increase was more than a year ago (i.e., that this stock is a candidate to be dropped from the list.)The DC list drops stocks that freeze their dividend across two consecutive years. For example, Johnson Controls (  ) is one of the companies noted earlier that S&P kept on its list even though their spreadsheet showed blanks for both 2008 and 2009 (i.e., no dividend increases). DRiP, on the other hand, noted in its chronology that Johnson Controls was dropped in 9/2009 because ""4 divs. pd. 2009 = 2008.""Finally, the DC list includes an addendum of ""contenders,"" companies that have recorded at least 15 but less than 25 years of dividend growth. Thus, DC is really a source for companies that have increased their dividends for 15 years or more I have seen it said that business cycles typically last for 3-8 years. Therefore, a company with a 15-year history of dividend growth has maintained that record through at least two business cycles, while a company with 25 straight years has done it through at least three cycles. Each is an impressive achievement. In my opinion, either list should be used only as a starting point for doing your own due diligence. As many banks proved in 2008-09, just because a company has raised its dividend many years in a row does not mean that it has the financial wherewithal to keep doing so. Some financial institutions raised their dividends (and repurchased shares) just months before failing. Utilize a method for determining the financial soundness of a company, and the sustainability of its business model, before investing in it for increasing dividends. I modestly suggest the method laid out in my own Also, just because a company has been raising its dividend for many years does not mean that it has a good yield. If you have a threshold minimum yield of 2.5% or 3%, some of these companies will not meet it. For example, Parker-Hannifin (52-year streak) yields 1.8% at the moment. Tootsie Roll (44 years) yields 1.2%. The following table compares the two lists. It shows vividly the difference between them as sources for 25-year dividend raisers. You will note that just one company-Supervalu-appears on the DA list and not on the DC list. The company cut its dividend last October; it is not clear why S&P kept it on the DA list for 2010.Abbott Laboratories (  )YesYes (37 years)ABM Industries (  )Yes (43)Aflac (  )YesYes (27)Air Products & Chemicals (  )YesYes (27)American States Water (  )Yes (55)Archer Daniels Midland (  )YesYes (34)AT&T (  )Yes (26)Automatic Data Processing (  )YesYes (35)Bancorp South (  )Yes (25)Bank of Hawaii (  )Yes (30)Becton Dickinson (  )YesYes (37)Bemis (  )YesYes (26)Black Hills (  )Yes (40)Bowl America (BWL-A)Yes (38)Brown-Forman (BF-B)YesYes (26)California Water Service (  )Yes (43)Carlisle (  )Yes (33)CenturyLink (  )YesYes (35)Chubb (  )YesYes (44)Cincinnati Financial (  )YesYes (49)Cintas (  )YesYes (27)Clarcor (  )Yes (26)Clorox (  )YesYes (32)Coca-Cola (  )YesYes (47)Colgate-Palmolive (  )Yes (46)Commerce Bancshares (  )Yes (41)Community Trust Banc.

 (  ) reported earnings of 57 cents per share for fiscal second quarter 2012 ending November 30. Results comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 48 cents and were 50% higher than the 38 cents earned in the year-ago quarter.Strong performance at all the segments except Document Management Services helped in the better-than-forecast results. However, the Document Management Services segment was affected by a steep drop in recycled paper prices and poor results at its European business due to the difficult economic environment.Total revenue in the quarter under review increased 9% to a record $1.02 billion, striding ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1 billion. Organic growth in the quarter was 7.0%.Cost of rental uniforms and ancillary products increased 9% year over year to $410 million and cost of services rose 6% to $179 million during the quarter. Selling general and administrative expenses flared 3% on a year-over-year basis to $297 million.Operating income during the quarter improved 25% to $133 million. Operating margin expanded 200 basis points year over year to 13%.Rental uniform and ancillary products revenue of $722.8 million in the quarter increased 10% from $657.8 million in the year-ago quarter. Uniform Direct Sales revenue grossed $111.9 million, up 3% from $108.8 million in the year-ago quarter.First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection revenue was $101.7 million, up 9% from the year-earlier quarter. Document Management revenue of $82.75 million in the quarter increased 8% from $77 million in the year-ago quarter.Cintas exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalent of $207.8 million, an improvement from $150.3 million at first quarter end. Long-term debt, at $1.06 billion, was flat sequentially. As of November 30, 2011, the debt-to-capitalization ratio increased marginally to 37.9% from 37.8% as of August 31, 2011.Cash flow from operations was $176 million during the first half of fiscal 2012, up from $109 million in the year-ago comparable period. Free cash flow improved substantially to $96.2 million in the fiscal first half from $21 million in the first half of 2011.Cintas' Board of Directors approved a new $500 million share buyback authorization in October, but the company has not made any purchases under the program during the quarter.Cintas, in fiscal 2012, expects to generate revenue in the band of $4.075 billion to $4.125 billion, up from the previous expectation of $4.0 billion to $4.1 billion. Earnings are now projected in the range of $2.16 to $2.20 per share in place of the prior range of $1.97 to $2.05 per share.The company expects capital expenditure to be between $180 million and $200 million in fiscal 2012.We are encouraged by the solid organic growth and margin expansion displayed by Cintas. Furthermore, Cintas' solid balance sheet and cash flow characteristics support a renewed repurchase authorization and a dividend hike. However, cost headwinds from cotton and energy and the uncertain economic environment remain concerns.We retain our Neutral rating on Cintas Corporation.

"niform maker Cintas Corporation (  ) late Thursday said its fiscal first quarter profit rose 12% from last year, helped by cost cuts and higher revenue, beating analyst estimates.The Cincinnati-based company reported fiscal first quarter net income of $68.6 million, or 52 cents per share, compared with $51.3 million, or 40 cents per share, in the year-ago period.Revenue rose 10% from last year to $1.02 billion.On average, Wall Street analysts expected a smaller profit of 47 cents per share, on lower revenue of $998.5 million.CEO Scott Farmer said in a statement that ""Our focus on selling profitable business, managing our cost structure and improving efficiencies through process improvement continues to drive margin expansion.""Looking ahead, the company backed its previously-announced full-year earnings guidance of $1.97 to $2.05 per share on revenue ranging from $4 billion to $4.1 billion. Analysts currently expect $2.02 per share on $4.06 billion in revenue for the year.Cintas shares were unchanged in premarket trading Friday.Shares of Cintas (  ) have a 1.70% dividend yield, based on last night's closing stock price of $28.77.

At one point they touched $34.44 but ended near their lows for the session.The stock is up 40 percent in the last year, benefiting from wider margins and customer retention. Its last earnings report on March 22 beat expectations on the top and bottom lines.Judging by yesterday's call selling, some shareholders apparently think that its gains could now slow, and they would like to get some money back before CTAS drops.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) scored a small victory yesterday, as the blue-chip barometer posted a fractional gain after the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) forecast slow U.S. economic growth. The DJIA enters today above support in the 10,700 region, but below resistance in the 10,800-10,850 area. Wall Street appears ready to extend Tuesday's late-session pullback, as futures on the DJIA and the S&P 500 Index are trading 23 points and 2.7 points below fair value, respectively. Elsewhere, gold is dominating the landscape, with futures on the precious metal soaring to record highs within reach of $1,300 an ounce.In equity news, shares of Adobe Systems Inc. (  ) have plunged more than 20% in premarket trading, as investors flee the company in the wake of its fourth-quarter earnings forecast. Specifically, ADBE said it expects fiscal fourth-quarter sales between $950 million to $1 billion, below the current Wall Street estimate of $1.03 billion. The company also forecast fourth-quarter earnings of 48 cents to 54 cents per share, on the low end of the consensus estimate for a profit of 53 cents per share.Elsewhere, Cintas Corp. (  ) said its fiscal first-quarter profit rose to $61.3 million, as revenue increased to $923.9 million from $891.6 million last year. Analysts estimated a quarterly profit of 38 cents per share on revenue of $913.5 million.Finally, Darden Restaurants (  ) announced a first-quarter profit of $113.1 million, or 80 cents per share, with sales rising to $1.81 billion. Analysts were looking for a profit of 77 cents per share on revenue of $1.83 billion.On the earnings front, CarMax Inc. (  ), General Mills Inc. (  ), Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (  ) and Red Hat Inc.

"tocks fell again today, but traders apparently think that the declines will be orderly.optionMONSTER's tracking systems detected the sale of more than 4.3 million options across the eight exchanges in yesterday's session. That's 29 percent more than average, even though overall options volume was 22 percent below normal levels.Put selling occurred in such names as Campbell Soup, Cintas, Safeway, and Iron Mountain as investors looked to earn income by insuring the stocks against significant drops.""A lot of people don't think it's going to get more volatile, so they are selling,"" said Group One's Jamie Tyrrell, designated primary market maker for VIX options at the Chicago Board Options Exchange. The VIX, which measures the cost of insuring the S&P 500, is a broad measure of the cost of options across the market. In Iron Mountain, investors sold 12,620 July 20 puts for $0.15 against open interest of just 111 contracts. The document-management and shredding company fell 1.80 percent to $22.97. IRM would have to fall another 13 percent by expiration for the investor to lose any money.Traders sold 5,700 July 20 puts on Safeway for $0.40 against no open interest, pushing total options volume in the supermarket stock to about 6 times greater than average.
