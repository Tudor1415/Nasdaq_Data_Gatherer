computational problems. Starting with a focus on PC graphics, we extended our
focus in recent years to the revolutionary field of artificial intelligence, or
AI. Fueled by the sustained demand for exceptional 3D graphics and the scale of
the gaming market, NVIDIA leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for
virtual reality, or VR, high performance computing, or HPC, and AI.
The GPU was initially used to simulate human imagination, enabling the virtual
worlds of video games and films. Today, it also simulates human intelligence,
enabling a deeper understanding of the physical world. Its parallel processing
capabilities, supported by up to thousands of computing cores, are essential to
running deep learning algorithms.&nbsp;&nbsp;... <a href=""http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/edgar_conv_html%2f2020%2f02%2f20%2f0001045810-20-000010.html#FIS_BUSINESS"" target=""_blank"">More</a> ...&nbsp;&nbsp;
