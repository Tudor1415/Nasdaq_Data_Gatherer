Using a broad portfolio of RNA chemistries and efficient\r\nmodes of delivery, Arrowhead therapies trigger the RNA interference mechanism to\r\ninduce rapid, deep and durable knockdown of target genes. RNA interference, or\r\nRNAi, is a mechanism present in living cells that inhibits the expression of a\r\nspecific gene, thereby affecting the production of a specific protein. Deemed to\r\nbe one of the most important recent discoveries in life science with the\r\npotential to transform medicine, the discoverers of RNAi were awarded a Nobel\r\nPrize in 2006 for their work. Arrowhead's RNAi-based therapeutics leverage this\r\nnatural pathway of gene silencing.\r\n\r\nPipeline Overview\r\n\r\nArrowhead is focused on developing innovative drugs for diseases with a genetic\r\nbasis, typically characterized by the overproduction of one or more proteins\r\nthat are involved with disease.&nbsp;&nbsp;... <a href=\"http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/edgar_conv_html%2f2019%2f11%2f25%2f0001564590-19-044376.html#FIS_BUSINESS\" target=\"_blank\">More</a> ...&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n", "KeyExecutives": [{"name": "Christopher Richard Anzalone", "title": "President, Chief Executive Officer & Director"}, {"name": "Curt W.
