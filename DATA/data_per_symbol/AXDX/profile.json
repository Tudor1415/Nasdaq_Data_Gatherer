(\"Accelerate\") is an in vitro diagnostics company\r\ndedicated to providing solutions that improve patient outcomes and lower\r\nhealthcare costs through the rapid diagnosis of serious infections. Microbiology\r\nlaboratories need new tools to address what the U.S. Centers for Disease Control\r\nand Prevention (the \"CDC\") calls one of the most serious healthcare threats of\r\nour time, antibiotic resistance. A significant contributing factor to the rise\r\nof resistance is the overuse and misuse of antibiotics, which is exacerbated by\r\na lack of timely diagnostic results. The delay of identification and antibiotic\r\nsusceptibility results is often due to the reliance by microbiology laboratories\r\non traditional culture-based tests that often take two to three days to\r\ncomplete. Our technology platform is intended to address these challenges by\r\ndelivering significantly faster testing of infectious pathogens in various\r\npatient sample types.&nbsp;&nbsp;... <a href=\"http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/edgar_conv_html%2f2020%2f02%2f28%2f0001628280-20-002502.html#FIS_BUSINESS\" target=\"_blank\">More</a> ...&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n", "KeyExecutives": [{"name": "Jack Phillips", "title": "President, Chief Executive Officer & Director"}, {"name": "Parampal Deol", "title": "SVP, Head-Research & Development"}, {"name": "Romney Humphries", "title": "Chief Scientific Officer"}, {"name": "Steven Reichling", "title": "CFO, Secretary & Chief Accounting Officer"}], "Number_of_employees": ["NO INFO"], "Subsidiaries": ["NO INFO"]}
