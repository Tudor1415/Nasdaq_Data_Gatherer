Company Description@Marriott International@MAR@10400 FERNWOOD ROAD, BETHESDA, Maryland, 20817, United States of America@3013803000@Hotels/Resorts@Consumer Services@North America@"We are a worldwide operator, franchisor, and licensor of hotel, residential, and
timeshare properties under numerous brand names at different price and service
points. Consistent with our focus on management, franchising, and licensing, we
own very few of our lodging properties. We were organized as a corporation in
Delaware in 1997 and became a public company in 1998 when we were ""spun off"" as
a separate entity by the company formerly named ""Marriott International, Inc.""
We believe that our portfolio of brands, shown in the following table, is the
largest and most compelling range of brands and properties of any lodging
company in the world.
                  [[Image Removed: bp130logolockupk2100.jpg]]
We discuss our operations in the following reportable business segments: North
American Full-Service, North American Limited-Service, and Asia Pacific.&nbsp;&nbsp;... <a href=""http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/edgar_conv_html%2f2020%2f02%2f27%2f0001628280-20-002376.html#FIS_BUSINESS"" target=""_blank"">More</a> ...&nbsp;&nbsp;
