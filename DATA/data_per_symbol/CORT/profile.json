Since 2012, we have marketed\r\nKorlym\u00ae (mifepristone) for the treatment of patients who suffer from Cushing's\r\nsyndrome, a disease caused by excess cortisol activity.\r\nWe have discovered more than 500 proprietary, selective cortisol modulators in\r\nfour structurally distinct series. These novel molecules share Korlym's affinity\r\nfor the glucocorticoid receptor (\"GR\") but, unlike Korlym, do not bind to the\r\nprogesterone receptor (\"PR\") and therefore do not cause effects arising from\r\nantagonism of progesterone activity, such as termination of pregnancy,\r\nendometrial thickening and vaginal bleeding. The composition of these compounds\r\nand their methods of use in a wide range of indications are covered by U.S. and\r\nforeign patents.&nbsp;&nbsp;... <a href=\"http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/edgar_conv_html%2f2020%2f02%2f24%2f0001628280-20-002122.html#FIS_BUSINESS\" target=\"_blank\">More</a> ...&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n", "KeyExecutives": [{"name": "Andreas Grauer", "title": "Chief Medical Officer"}, {"name": "Gary Charles Robb", "title": "Secretary & Chief Financial Officer"}, {"name": "Hazel Hunt", "title": "Senior Vice President-Research"}, {"name": "Joseph K.
