Cystic Fibrosis
Our goal is to develop treatment regimens that will provide benefits to all
patients with cystic fibrosis, or CF, and will enhance the benefits that
currently are being provided to patients taking our medicines. Our marketed
medicines are TRIKAFTA (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor and
ivacaftor), SYMDEKO/SYMKEVI (tezacaftor/ivacaftor and ivacaftor), ORKAMBI
(lumacaftor/ivacaftor) and KALYDECO (ivacaftor). We obtained approval from the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, for TRIKAFTA, our triple
combination regimen, in October 2019.  This approval increased the number of
patients eligible for our medicines in the U.S. by approximately 6,000 and
provided an additional treatment option for many patients who are also eligible
for one of our previously approved products.&nbsp;&nbsp;... <a href=""http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/edgar_conv_html%2f2020%2f02%2f13%2f0000875320-20-000007.html#FIS_BUSINESS"" target=""_blank"">More</a> ...&nbsp;&nbsp;
