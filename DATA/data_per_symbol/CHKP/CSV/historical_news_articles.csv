"s  stock recently tumbled after the Israeli cybersecurity company posted its first-quarter earnings. Its revenue rose 11% annually to $106.8 million, narrowly beating estimates by $0.2 million. Its adjusted net income dipped 9% to $19.6 million, or $0.50 per share, but it still beat expectations by $0.13.CyberArk's headline numbers looked stable, but its forecast for roughly flat revenue growth with a 41%-71% drop in adjusted earnings spooked investors. It also withdrew its guidance for the full year in light of the  pandemic.CyberArk's investors clearly weren't pleased, but the stock remains up nearly 100% over the past three years. Should investors lock in their profits now, or ride out the near-term volatility for bigger long-term gains?Image source: Getty Images.Many cybersecurity companies focus on external threats, but CyberArk protects internal networks from corporate spies and disgruntled employees. When a threat is detected, CyberArk's software locks down compromised networks and tracks the intruder.CyberArk enjoys a first mover's advantage in the niche privileged access management (PAM) market. It currently serves over 5,300 companies, including more than 50% of the Fortune 500 and 30% of the Global 2000. It has also acquired smaller companies, including Agata, Conjur, Vaultive, and Idaptive, to expand its ecosystem and customer base in recent years.CyberArk went public in late 2014. Its revenue rose 56% in 2015, 35% in 2016, 21% in 2017, 31% in 2018, and 26% in 2019. It also remained profitable on a  -- which was rare for a high-growth cybersecurity company -- thanks to its conservative use of stock-based compensation.CyberArk relied on acquisitions, an expansion of its sales team, and the introduction of new services to maintain its momentum over the past few years. But the COVID-19 crisis disrupted that flow in the first quarter.Image source: Getty Images.CyberArk witnessed a ""rapid decline in the business environment"" in March as the pandemic spread, and some of its deals were either canceled or downsized near the end of the quarter. Its exposure to the troubled energy, retail, transportation, and travel sectors, which together accounted for 15% of its total bookings in 2019, exacerbated the pain.As a result, CyberArk's licensing revenue grew less than 1% annually to $51.7 million. But on the bright side, 79% of that licensing revenue came from add-on services, up from 63% in 2019. Subscription revenue also accounted for another 10% of its licensing revenue, up from 4% a year earlier.Those sticky expansion rates indicated CyberArk was squeezing more revenue from its existing clients. Its maintenance and professional services revenue also rose 23% to $55.2 million, which partly offset its weaker growth in licensing revenue.Meanwhile, CyberArk's operating expenses rose 20% annually during the quarter as it aggressively increased its headcount. That hiring spree, which expanded its workforce 24% annually, is a sign of strength -- but it could also dent its operating margins as its core business faces tougher pandemic-related headwinds.During the , CyberArk CFO Josh Siegel pointed out that the company's gross margin remained high (at 84% in the first quarter), and most of its operating expenses were related to its increased headcount -- so it still had the ""flexibility to adjust our hiring to better align with the top-line as we move through the year.""In other words, CyberArk can hire fewer new employees, or even prune its workforce, if its revenue growth doesn't improve. But for now, CyberArk seems confident in its long-term growth, and newer products like Alero -- which allow remote workers to access a company's resources through CyberArk -- could strengthen its ecosystem through the downturn.Analysts expect CyberArk's revenue to rise 10% this year as its earnings decline about 26%. Investors should take those forecasts with a grain of salt, but its stock looks a bit pricey at over 40 times forward earnings. By comparison, Wall Street expects CyberArk's bigger Israeli peer  -- which trades at just 17 times forward earnings -- to grow its revenue and earnings 1% and 4%, respectively, this year.But CyberArk is arguably a more exciting investment than Check Point, a mature player in the firewall space that shed 5% of its value over the past three years. CyberArk doesn't face much competition in its growing niche, its ecosystem is well-suited for both on-site and remote workers, and it's consistently profitable. 2020 might be a rough year for CyberArk, but I believe its stock should gradually rise and outperform those of many of its industry peers over the next few years.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, , has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and CyberArk Software wasn't one of them!

Cybersecurity stocks got hammered earlier this year as the novel coronavirus pandemic and other macroeconomic factors sent the broad market packing.In March, the market saw its , and top cybersecurity companies such as   and  bore the brunt. But conditions have changed, and both stocks have since regained a lot of ground in the past three months.Data by .This isn't surprising as cybersecurity companies are  to address the fallout from the COVID-19 outbreak. As organizations shift their employees to a work-from-home model, there has been an increase in the volume of cybersecurity threats. The Federal Bureau of Investigation reports that cyberattacks have quadrupled in the wake of the pandemic, creating a tailwind for  such as Palo Alto and Check Point.Image source: Getty Images.Palo Alto Networks got off to  in 2020. The company's fiscal second-quarter report was disappointing as its sales growth lost momentum, and management slashed full-year guidance. But the pandemic seems to have given Palo Alto's business a bump as its growth hit a higher gear in the fiscal third quarter that ended on April 30.The cybersecurity specialist saw a 20% spike in revenue to $869 million during the quarter, blowing past its guidance range of $835 million to $850 million. The good part is management believes that its COVID19-related strength is here to stay. That's evident from a 24% annual jump in billings to $1.0 billion as well as a 28% spike in  to $3.4 billion, both of which outpaced the growth in actual revenue.This is a positive sign for shareholders, as billings and deferred revenue are indicators of future revenue growth. Deferred revenue, for example, is the money collected by a company in advance of services that will be provided in the future. That amount sits on the balance sheet as a liability and is recorded on the income statement as revenue when the actual service delivery takes place.Given the way the metric is trending, Palo Alto is witnessing an increase in its customer base as well as a jump in spending from existing customers. The company added 2,500 new customers last quarter, as pointed out on the , while there was a 21% annual increase in the lifetime value of the top 25 customers.Not surprisingly, Palo Alto's remote access cybersecurity solution -- GlobalProtect -- saw a massive spike in demand as organizations adopted a telecommuting model. GlobalProtect added 1,000 new customers last quarter as the service allows organizations to enable secure access for all of their employees regardless of the device they use.Looking ahead, secure remote access solutions will continue witnessing strong demand. According to a third-party report, demand for cloud virtual private networks (VPNs) that allow users to securely log into their organization's network is expected to produce a compound annual growth rate of 21% through 2026 -- setting the stage for further growth at Palo Alto.Like Palo Alto, Check Point Software also enjoyed a nice bump in its business last quarter. Demand for the company's remote security solutions and network security gateways similarly improved. CEO Gil Shwed provided a few instances of this shift on the latest :We helped [a] major global corporation expand employee remote access from 8,000 daily users to 80,000 users. In another case, it was 130,000 users that are now utilizing our VPN solution. We have many more examples like these across all industries: financial services, transportation, industrial, healthcare, and others.However, Check Point differs from Palo Alto in terms of the pace of its growth. The company's first-quarter revenue had increased just 3% year over year to $486.5 million. Deferred revenue also increased by a similar margin. This makes it clear that Check Point is no match for Palo Alto from a growth perspective, but investing in this cybersecurity play has its own set of advantages.Palo Alto's  net loss during the fiscal third quarter increased to $74.8 million from $20.2 million in the prior-year period. On the other hand, Check Point reported net income of $179 million that was flat compared to the prior-year period. This isn't surprising as Check Point enjoys much better margins.Data by .The huge difference in profitability between the two companies can be attributed to the difference in their approaches. While Palo Alto  on acquisitions, Check Point has been .But that shouldn't count against Check Point Software as the company's transition to a subscription-based business model is gathering momentum. The company generated nearly $159 million in revenue from security subscriptions last quarter, an increase of 10% year over year. Revenue from software updates and maintenance also increased slightly to $217.5 million.The legacy products and licenses business declined 2% year over year to $110.2 million, accounting for 22.6% of total revenue last quarter, compared to 23.9% a year ago. The transition could gain further momentum in the coming quarters as Check Point is now witnessing a faster transition to cloud-enabled solutions.For investors with a higher appetite for risk, Palo Alto Networks should be a better fit. The company is growing at a faster pace and is going all out to make a dent in the cybersecurity space with the help of its aggressive acquisition strategy, which is also the reason why it has a rich valuation.Palo Alto stock trades at 43 times forward earnings estimates as of this writing, much higher than Check Point's forward earnings multiple of 17.

In our press release, which has been posted on our website, we present GAAP and non-GAAP results, along with a reconciliation of such results, as well as the reasons for our presentation of non-GAAP information.Now I'd like to turn the call over to Tal Payne, for a review of our financial results. -- Thank you, Kip. Good morning and good afternoon to everyone joining us on the call today. I hope you and your family stay healthy during this unprecedented times. During this period, our top priority is ensuring the health and safety of all of our employees around the globe, as we continue to serve our customers. Today, Gil will elaborate on the COVID-19 effects on different aspects of our business, steps we are taking to operate through the pandemic and provide update to our guidance. During the quarter, we sustained elevated business activity levels and delivered results toward the upper half of our guidance. Revenues for the quarter increased by 3% year-over-year to $486 million and our non-GAAP EPS grew by 7% to $1.42.Before I proceed further into the numbers, let me remind you, that our GAAP financial results include stock-based compensation charges, amortization of acquired intangible assets and acquisition related expenses, as well as the related tax effects. Keep in mind as applicable, non-GAAP information is presented excluding these items.Now let's take a look at the financial highlights for the quarter. Products and security subscription revenues were $269 million, a 5% increase year-over-year. Our subscription revenues continue to be strong with 10% growth year-over-year, reaching $159 million. Our software update and maintenance revenues increased to $217 million, representing 1% growth year-over-year.On the product side, we saw an increase in remote access VPN solution and in scaling up networks where needed. On the other hand, products are continuing to transition faster to the cloud solutions, which are included in the subscription line. The reduction in the product line is naturally driving lower support level.The growth in our subscription revenues is driven by our advanced solutions mainly Cloud and SandBlast Zero-Day threat prevention. Infinity consolidation solution also started to flow into the revenues and show a nice trend. During the quarter, we had Infinity deals in variety of industries, including government, telecommunication and industrial. We also saw growth in our Cloud business. Both Cloud and Infinity annual run rate increased over 100% year-over-year.Last week we finished the launch of the new Quantum security gateway series. Quantum includes our SandBlast Network Zero-Day protection, bundled by default. Our old appliances bundle the next generation threat protection, NGTP. Naturally, the new package carries higher value. According to accounting rules, the fair value of Software Blades is separated from their client spread, deferred and recognized over the service period. As a result, we expect to see a shift from product revenue to deferred revenues, that will be recognized over 12 months. The annual effect depends on the pace of the transition and the appliance mix, and we will have more color in the coming quarter.Deferred revenues as of March 31, 2020 reached $1.349 billion, a growth of $36 million or 3% over March 31st, 2019. Revenue distribution by geography for the quarter was as follows; 46% of the revenues came from Americas; 43% of revenues came from Europe, Middle East and Africa region; the remaining 11% came from Asia Pacific. This quarter, we had a strong execution in Americas and the growth came from most regions in the U.S. We are seeing strength in financial services and healthcare vertical.Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 48% compared to 50% last year. A reduction related to the increased investment in our workforce and cloud infrastructure in the year-over-year comparison. This margin is higher than planned, as a result of the higher level of revenues and the nature of savings relating to the new environment, for example from slightly lower travel costs and move to virtualized events.Our financial income this quarter reached $90 million. Financial income is expected to be slightly reduced during the remainder of the year, as a result of reduced interest rates in the U.S. Effective non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 18%, in line with our expectations, remember, it can be 1%, up 1% down fluctuation. GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2020 was $179 million or $1.23 per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $206 million or $1.42 per diluted share, an increase of 7% from the first quarter of 2019, and $0.02 above the midpoint of our guidance.Our cash balances as of March 31st increased to $4 billion. We are one of the strongest companies in the industry, with significant cash balances and no debt at all. The company has exceptional balance sheet, and we can handle a very wide range of scenarios in the future. Majority of our cash is invested in marketable securities, unrealized gain as of March 31st was $21 million. We invest in U.S. Dollar, marketable securities that are rated at a minimum of A-. We review the securities that the fair value was lower than the book value, and deemed it to be a temporary reduction, hence no impairment was recorded owning these.Operating cash flow was $359 million; collection from customers continued to be strong. As a reminder, we hedge our balance sheet against currency fluctuation. The hedge affects our cash flow with minimal effect on our P&L as intended. During the quarter, the dollar strengthened against the Israeli shekel, resulting in a hedge cost of approximately $12 million on cash flow versus cash income of $7.5 million last year. Our operating cash flow, net of hedge effect is similar to last year.On the margin, we expect to see some of our customers, who are seeing a disproportionate economic impact, are likely to be credit constrained and are working with them to adopt the payment terms to ensure continued service to help our customers. Naturally, it will have an effect on some of the second quarter cash flow. In February, we approved an expansion of our buyback program for additional $2 billion and up to $325 million per quarter. During the quarter, we continued our buyback program and purchased 3 million shares for $325 million, the full capacity, at an average price of $110.Now let's turn the call over to Gil for his comments. -- Thank you, Tal, and hello to everyone joining us today. This is an unusual period and I really appreciate your time and attention today. Before I even begin to discuss the business, I'd like to be all of you and your families good to health and a quick return to your freedom.Now let me start with my review of the quarter. As you heard from Tal, we had a good first quarter. We managed to meet almost every financial metrics, despite the new challenge that the world faced throughout the quarter. We began the year in our usual manner, conducting our three major CPX 360 customer and partner events. We had a record level of attendance, around 9,000 people in our three locations, Bangkok, New Orleans and Vienna. Our messages were received with great enthusiasm we received very high praise from the participants. Looking at the picture from the events, it is a hard to believe that only three months ago, we gathered thousands of people physically, celebrating innovation in cloud together. Both the Vienna and the New Orleans Convention Center are now emergency hospitals for coronavirus patients. Just to illustrate, how quickly the world has changed.Before I address these changes and how we dealt with them, let me provide some color on the business this quarter. As I said previously, we managed to close the quarter on a quite high note and exceeded almost every financial measure. We saw some strong signals in the traditional and emerging parts of our business. Our security appliances had a good quarter and we saw nice momentum in our cloud technologies.Despite the lockdowns in many parts of the world, we've seen an active business environment. During the quarter, we had around 20% demand increase in our technical services, driven by customers scaling up their infrastructure, in preparation for increased network demand. Customers accelerating the completion of project, in light of the circumstances, as well as the implementation and scaling of remote access VPN, something we've been doing for many years. Our products' webpages saw a sevenfold increase in traffic in these areas, our VPN products have saved the day for many organizations. For example, we enabled quarantined doctors that were sent home due to coronavirus exposure, to remotely connect back to the hospital, where they were able to monitor patients something that was never done before.We helped major global corporation expand employee remote access from 8,000 daily users to 80,000 users. In another case it was 130,000 users, that are now utilizing our VPN solution. We have many more examples like these across all industries; financial services, transportation, industrial, healthcare and others. Some of these expansions drove additional business. In other cases, we were able to accommodate the demand with equipment and licenses the customer already owned.In terms of the effectiveness of remote access solution, we conducted survey among over 1,000 of our users, comparing different methods of remote access. I'm glad to say, that the end user satisfaction from the Check Point VPN Endpoint Security came with the highest score, validating our strategy of enabling connectivity, while providing the highest level of security.In the cloud space, we continue to see a good momentum, almost doubling our conflicts value from that business comparing to last year. We're starting to see a nice pipeline of deals that are based on the understanding of the mission critical nature of the cloud, and the security needs that are coming with it.We also had some nice customer wins. In the Americas, we added one of the world's largest retailer and one of the largest -- the world leading food dairy brands. Overall, we had a very good quarter in the Americas. Keep in mind though, that the coronavirus had less business impact in the U.S. this quarter compared to other geographies. While many countries changed their business practices, starting in February, it only impacted Americas in a big way in the last 10 days of March.Now, let me share with you some of the changes we see inside Check Point, before I go back to talk about our technology and customers. As I mentioned in the beginning, we managed to conduct our three CPX 360 conferences with record attendance, and completed the last one during the first week of February. When we went back to the office, we started to see a changing environment. One, that kept changing every couple of days. It started with supply chain challenges, while our manufacturing isn't in China, our supply chain does depend on some components that are made in China. At the beginning of February, people in Asia came back from the Lunar Year vacation, to find some closed factories. We started addressing that challenge, while at the same time, we began the production of our new Quantum appliance model. Then, we began to see lockdowns and business limitation in more and more countries. In February, it was primarily Asia. And in the beginning of March, some European countries started implementing lockdown. Until the end of February, most of our marketing conferences and International business travel, was still running pretty much as usual. But since the first week of March, business pretty much stopped and we had to adjust our travel and events accordingly.Logistically, it was an interesting ride. All in all, we managed to keep our supply chain operating effectively, and we continue to address it. The only country we couldn't ship products to, was India, where access was shutdown toward the last few days of the quarter. Meanwhile, in mid-March, the rules in Israel became stricter. We had to reduce the amount of employees that are allowed to come to the office every day. Until then, our development, quality assurance and technical services were all done exclusively from our offices. They rely on lab access and an on-site development environment. In a short period of time, we built a new environment that would allow remote work for all these function. Within two weeks, we moved almost the entire organization into a remote workplace.For example, our technical assistance centers in Israel, United States, Canada and India are now operating remotely, and produce very high level of productivity, actually higher than normal. All thanks to the engagement and commitment of our employees.We managed to get to the March 31st, the end of the quarter, fully remote enabled. We had our first virtual end of quarter, where we received tremendous volume of orders, which we processed and shipped quickly. These 48 hours were some of the busiest, most challenging and interesting in our quite an experience for all of us.Getting back to our business; the coronavirus did have an impact on business in several countries. Pretty much the entire world has been affected, as many countries were able to keep business flowing. The major countries, the decline this quarter were the U.K., China and Italy. I must say, that our employees and partners in all countries, including those who have suffered from the virus, have shown great level of engagement and continue to work and support our customers and partners, throughout this period.Last week, we expanded the Infinity Architecture, according to plan, and launched some new products. Infinity is the only architecture in the industry, that delivers end-to-end security with the unified architecture and prevention across the cloud, mobile endpoint and IoT and network. We extended the largest area of our Infinity architecture, with a complete new lineup of network security gateways.The Quantum family of security appliances is the first to include, the highest level of security prevention standards out of the box, with every appliance. It provides higher level of security by bundling our standard Zero-Day threat prevention technology, our gateways actually prevent attacks and stops them immediately, while other competitors just detect the attacks and let the malware in.Our appliances are better performance and are fully scalable with our Hyperscale technology, and doing it in an even more energy-efficient manner. The appliances also has the lowest subscription rate in the industry and therefore, deliver a lower TCO than our competitors. The Quantum Series includes 15 models, starting its original Branch Office at around $5,000 dollar and going all the way to the highest end data center, with performance that can scale up to 1.5 terabits, the Maestro Hyperscale technology. Network security is one part of the business. Another important area is the cloud. We continue to see increased interest in our cloud solution. All of this, combined with our strength in the Americas, make me very pleased with our first quarter execution.Now let's take a look at the second quarter in the remainder of the year. Our shift to remote work actually enabled me to meet more partners and employees over the past few weeks. The good news is that everyone is engaged, committed and working hard to deliver business results. Even though, our April results are trending well so far. In a session we conducted, it seems the security professional realized the increased risk from working remotely, and the additional threat that we are facing, as a result of the current environment. If the situation continues, we will have to strengthen the security environment, to mitigate those risks, and to close many holes that are introduced now. Keep in mind, that the effect of the pandemic in the U.S. was limited in the first quarter, as the big changes in the U.S. only began in the last 10 days of March. Many projects were actually accelerated last quarter, in light of the pandemic.The evolving circumstances will impact all of us. It's already evident in some industries, like travel and hospitality. But the fact that most of the world is under a home lockdown, it is bound to create changes in the demand pattern and in the macro economy. The level of certainty we have, as to the impact on our future business is very low. As a result, I can share some of my assumption into the second quarter, but won't provide formal projection. And if we take our revenue model, over 75% of our business is comprised of annuity sales now. Most of it is already in. The rest depends on how the quarter evolves. Since the majority of our business comes in the last month of the quarter, it's hard to predict what will happen in the coming two months, where the business will trade like we've never seen before, whether it will stay stable or whether it will accelerate from current levels.On the expense side, our expense model is relatively stable, mostly depends on our headcount, and there is no significant change in our headcount or hiring policies. The range of the assumption as to the revenue model is very wide. The probabilities to assign [Phonetic] which scenario are unknown, and depends by the way, in the things that are way-way beyond our control, all over the world. Therefore, I cannot provide projections or range, but can be valuable for the next quarter or for the remainder of the year. So I believe it will be prudent at this time, to withdraw our previously issued guidance for the year.To summarize, we managed to sail through the corona storm smoothly so far. Over the last decade, we've built a strong base of annuity revenues, which is more predictable, combined with our employees, partners and our balance sheet, it provides us with more stability into the future. Customers actually assign more value to this quality in such times.I would like to thank our customers, partners and employees for their continued support, dedication and innovative spirit. We remain committed to our long-term strategy and expect to emerge from this challenge stronger than before.I'd like to thank you for joining us today. Wish you again health and wish that our freedom resumes to all of us shortly and I would like to open the call for your -- for some questions. Thank you very much.[Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. -- Thank you. Good morning, Gil and Tal, congrats on helping Check Point manage through this crisis, as well as it sounds like you have. I wanted to just ask you about the decision not to provide guidance. It sounds like the Q1 actually came in relatively in line, if not slightly better than the midpoint, Gil, you mentioned that April results are actually trending relatively well so far. So perhaps you could elaborate what -- it doesn't sound like you're experiencing new deal push-outs that some of your software peers are seeing. So what do you worry could change, looking forward, that reduces the visibility if things have actually tracked relatively well so far? Maybe you could just explain that for us. Thank you. -- Thank you. First, I think I'm very pleased that we had the results that we had in the first quarter. But let's remember, the corona pandemic gut had the big impact on most of the world, only like you March, and in most of the world, only in the last few days of March. And even then, we did see some deals in the last few days, that were pushed, because people were moved to home lockdown and things like that. We've seen many others, by the way, that went smoothly. I must say that, I couldn't be -- I mean I had an amazing -- its almost two months now, a month and a half, when we went through this crisis, to see the commitment of everyone, including our partners, including customers, where I didn't believe where customers were under lockdown and still insisted on doing the business.But as I said, it happened only in the last -- the real changes especially in the U.S., happened only in the last 10 days to a week of the quarter, when many of the orders were already signed, processed, and it was a matter of the channel processing, it's getting it to us. So we enjoyed them. As I mentioned, we started Apri; really in a pretty good note and April is not over, but up to this second, April is trending as a nice month, is expected actually even a slight -- a good one, but we are seeing an environment which constantly changing and the regulation and the changes in everything that's happening, can turn every day.Again I don't want to give anyone ideas, but international shipping is changing every day. Government changes in what we're allowed and what we're not allowed to do our changing every single day. But most important, it's not of the external forces which again are huge, it's the entire demand pattern. If we're all sitting at home, our entire consumption model is changing, and when the consumption is changing, the economy is bound to change. Whether it will happen in May or June, I don't know, it might. Some of it will happen in May and June for sure. Whether it will happen in August or October, I also don't know. But something will change. People are changing their buying patterns. Some companies are gaining, like we see at least here, that the food and the grocery is doing very well, but most of the other sectors are doing terrible, and that will impact what we do. So, if I am a clothing company, in Q1 it probably didn't affect much, my big projects, my IT procurement; but in Q2 and Q3, I will be in a completely different situation, when my business went down by 60%, 70% or 80%.I can't predict that, I can tell you from -- again, I wanted to give even more transparency than usual here. So, so far, we're seeing we're seeing business moving along in a pretty good pace. As I said, I really, really appreciate both customers, partners and employees for their hard work. They are all trying very-very hard to keep some sanity, to keep business running. But the macroeconomic forces, some of that could change and it will change. Where, how, if it will have significant impact or insignificant impact, that's what I don't know, and that's the reason, that it's hard to provide guidance. If I could quantify that in saying that's X millions of dollars in these countries or this industry, it would have been very -- it could be easier to quantify that.But at this point, we really really don't know. I mean, take our largest sector, and I'll give more examples. Financial institution; we had a terrific quarter with financial institution in Q1. I can't even guess what this pandemic will have on the performance and investment and priority of financial institution in Q2 and Q3/ Some may accelerate procurement, because they need more bandwidth and supporting people online. Some might say that the environment is changing so quickly, so we have to freeze all the future plans and stop all non-essential projects. I have no clue on that, and I must tell you that, with all the calls that I made primarily to partners, and partners is actually pretty good, because they see a very wide range of customers and are very close to the procurement department. The answer is straightforward, everybody is trying to move business, but there is a very-very high level of uncertainty, so we have to live with be uncertainty at this point. -- Got it. Okay, that's very clear and understandable. Thank you, Gil, and best of luck over the coming months. -- Thank you very much.Our next question is from Shaul Eyal with Oppenheimer. Please proceed. -- Thank you. Hi, good afternoon, Gil, Tal, this morning there, Kip. Two quick questions on my end; Gil, have you seen -- you just mentioned the partners and the fact that we provide you with a good color into what's happening out there. Have you seen in the early part, probably on the final two weeks, maybe even three weeks of March, as this thing as COVID-19 continued to unfold or began to unfold actually. Have you seen a little bit of urgent spending from some of your customers? -- Again, the question is, if we've seen some urgent spending on our customers? -- Urgent spending yeah for the VPN access products, for some of the high-end appliances, as companies have been moving to a remote work environment. Have you seen some of those all of a sudden coming with actually some accelerated spending? -- Yeah. I have seen two partners and that's positive to us. Yes, we've seen some customers that have purchased very quickly, extended or even new VPN environments and again, when I mention examples like moving from 8,000 users to 80,000 users and scaling up to 130,000 current users every day. That did involve some spending in expansion and buying equipment. By the way, in one case, they actually took equipment that was planned for another and use it for the VPN expansion and hopefully they will buy more equipment for the other projects. In some cases, we were really rushing equipment fast and shipping it even before we got the order, so we can help the customer get on time.Another phenomena that we saw in many customers, is that they understood that something is changing in the world, and things might happen. So IT managers, they simply rushed projects and they simply said, let's complete the project before the environment will change, before we will have hard time getting our budget or before we will need it in a critical manner. So some projects did accelerate in the first quarter. On the same time, by the way, we did have projects that got delayed and got canceled in the first quarter, and I mentioned few countries like like Italy, U.K., China where we did see an effect on the business -- that business declined, and business which would have arrived, didn't arrive. Again for different patterns, different reasons, but all related to the situation.So again in the first quarter, we saw few factors that were more business than usual and few factors that were below. Overall I must tell you, we had a very good first quarter, especially in the Americas, when we are saying, that we are investing in the Americas, its very important. The first quarter, it was a quarter that we've been proud with, under any circumstances, not with corona in the Americas. In the rest of the world, it was a different pattern. -- Understood. Thank you for the transparency. Tal, maybe can you provide us with the number of seven digit transactions Check Point has had during the quarter? -- So actually, we didn't disclose it, we said a few quarters grow that we don't believe it's a material metric. But just to make you feel comfortable, I will give you that it was 56 customers with transactions over $1 million compared to 47 in the year-over-year, last year Q1. -- Understood, thank you for that. Good luck. Stay healthy everyone.Our next question is from Gregg Moskowitz, Mizuho. Please proceed. -- Thank you very much and good afternoon, Gil and Tal. I guess my first question is, I was wondering if there was any way to estimate the positive impact to Americas revenue or billings from the increased remote access requirement. Perhaps by looking at activity levels over the last 10 days of the quarter and comparing that with what you saw a year ago or if there was any way -- other way to parse that? -- Tal, do you have any specific numbers? Again overall, I don't think it has a huge effect on the quarter, because again, we also did deals that were postponed and deals that were going down and again, in one of the cases, there was a large deal, the deal was planned. Anyways, it was planned for another use, but we used the equipment for VPN, instead for another that they wanted it. So I hope that we'll get the original deal again, but again, it's unguaranteed at this point. Its planned but it's not yet in.I think overall, the strength in the Americas that we saw, wasn't a result of corona, it was a result of working hard with customers and partners. And again, we're seeing that we are doing it for the long time. It's nice to see that its bearing fruit and we are actually seeing some results. -- Okay, that's... -- And I would say -- I would say, I think America started the quarter strong and finished strong. So it was across the quarter. We did see strength in verticals like the financial services and healthcare, which might have some relations to corona and the increase of the remote access of the employees. -- Okay, that's very helpful. Thank you both for that. And then just as a follow-up, I did want to ask about the SD-WAN space. One of your competitors has a lot of momentum there and another one of your competitors is -- sort of has recently followed suit with an acquisition. And I'd love to hear more Gil, just kind of -- if you could sort of elaborate on why you have a partnering strategy, if you will in this space, as opposed to perhaps going after the market more directly? And then also, if you can just talk about demand expectations for for SD-WAN going forward? I think that would be very helpful. -- Okay. So first, it's a very good subject, and SD-WAN is a very interesting area and we are looking into that like everyone else. I am following it for the last two or three years. Historically, it has been the networking area. And in networking -- usually the networking guys and people that are dedicated to that are doing better, and it usually stays with them. In the past, when we look at things to combine remote access or things like that, with our security. I mean, to provide security for remote access was always a great business. To do the remote access or the connectivity by ourselves was never a good business for us, and again I'm talking about going 25 years back. If you look at our VPN products, for example, they started around 1995 I think. So we have a lot of experience in that industry. We never replaced equipment or hardware from the big networking vendors, and that's why this -- and by the way, specifically on the SD-WAN front, that was one front that there weren't clear leaders with high volume leading the market. It was, it is still relatively fragemented. That's why we chose to take the software approach and to partner with several of them, Silver Peak, VMware and several others and that provided security to this environment.Right now, we are actually doing quite well with them and the fact that some of our competitors have made acquisition and provided products in that state, actually helps us in some areas, expand the relationship. What will happen in the long run it could -- I wish I knew. I think it's going to be an interesting dynamic. -- Okay, thank you Gil. Stay well and all the best.Our next question is from Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. Please proceed. -- Thanks very much and hats off to you. It's clear that your results demonstrate during these trying times. One for Gil and one for Tal. Gil, for those of us trying to better understand customer buying behavior during these unique times, and I [Technical Issues] maybe as well a bit. it's intuitive that what you provide is not discretionary. So what is the customer doing, who is deferring a purchase, especially when they are faced with significant traffic demands, are they running their existing appliances for longer? Are they rerouting traffic to the cloud? And just based on your learnings from the past, do you feel that you saw in March is a net pull forward or push out of demand? -- I think it's very loved by customers. For example, our customers that are they are -- that have a huge challenges in moving to remote access, and therefore they shift all their attention to remote access, and to stop other security project. Other customers, they just have difficulties in general, and the slowdown investments in IT projects. I mean, let me tell you in the hospitality business, that's a business, we have some customers there. We support them. We work with them. Seeing their pain is heartbreaking, an industry that went from amazing years and unlimited demand to shutting down 90% to 99% of their business overnight. And I'll give you, even in that industry, some of it we supported, they are moving to work from home, and we had some projects there. Not necessarily revenue generating, but the activity is the main thing. First, we need to work with the customer on the project, and then it will lead to something. A week later, half the team is fired. Three weeks later, the entire team is fired. We form a deal for the long run, how we support them and make the right concession to support them, which is the right thing to do. And two weeks later or a week later, even the procurement team is not working anymore, because they have been laid. This is heartbreaking, but this is reality unfortunately, as we see it.So again I don't want to paint a negative picture here. Right now, our business is moving. Most customers are trying to keep business alive. I'm actually -- I mean this was very -- for me it was a very interesting month seeing how the world is coping with one of -- some of the biggest changes we've ever seen in our lifestyle over such a short period of time and coping it and keeping business alive. So I don't want to sound negative. I'm just saying that, we can't ignore the situation around us, and we can't assume that the fact that we managed to survive in this situation for, let's say, it depends where you look at, between five to nine weeks, without a change of the macroeconomy, means that its going to continue that way.In the bigger level, we've seen everything. We've seen companies accelerating. We have seen companies slowing. We have seen people that are hard to get and don't sign a deal, because they are not at the office. We've seen people that are making all the efforts to sign every deal, even though, they are in some of the worst countries and worst areas in the world. So in the micro-level, i have seen everything. On the macro level, I think, assuming that the macro level will stay stable is the wrong assumption, and I hope that I am wrong. I hope that we will see a smooth sailing moving forward, and it definitely a scenario that can happen based on what I've seen in the last eight or nine weeks. -- Thank you so much, Gil. -- Thank you. -- If I can just follow-up, one for you, and I appreciate the business is very much [Technical Issues]. Can you give us an update on how April bookings have trended relative to March? -- So I've said we don't -- I've mentioned that, we usually don't give update in the middle of the quarter. But this time I did go outside my way. April so far looks like a decent month. Levels of business are slightly higher, or higher than -- I mean would the months that I'm comparing with, is January this year and April of last year, that's the right comparable in terms of seasonality. Right now, again, we are not over April, we still have three work days to go. But up to this morning. April was better months than both of the months, slightly better. And by the way, that's what we expect. We expect to have -- but again, it's not a prediction for anything, because I think what we're foreseeing in April is also slightly spillover from the end of the quarter. And again, with customers -- one pattern that I can see customers understand that the world is changing, and if they say, if I can complete a project now, I should complete it now and not wait.That's what I am seeing at the professional level. At the professional level, we've seen by the way, it happening in demand on every area, in laptops in servers, I mean, I'm saying it from the macro, what you're seeing as analysts. I am seeing it myself in the market. When the pandemic started, we were saying, OK, we will need laptops. When we had laptops months ago, let's buy all the laptops that we can. Now that doesn't mean that long term or even short-term we would buy laptops, it just means that I told my supplier, give me the inventories that you can give me. And I feel that, I mean I have just mentioned an anecdote. I met one day when I was still at the early pandemic, when we worked really really hard at the office to adjust the office environment. And we worked very long hours, and I still hanged around and tried to meet as many people as I can. I went one day. I stopped by the entrance. I showed the delivery guy delivering a big cart with computers on it. I said impressive and so on, he says, how is your business? Is it still going? He says, you can't believe it, I am working now until 12 AM every day, every business in the country is buying -- by the way, he was speaking about businesses, is buying all the equipment that they can get, because they are getting ready for something. And that was -- again that was more than a month ago.At a certain point it stopped, and you say, I have the equipment or the macroeconomic or the economic constraints, and I can't afford it anymore. So I just gave you a small example from meeting the delivery guy, because he is the one actually that is doing the work. -- Thank you very much. Be well everybody. -- I will just add just to make sure, we started April growth, but remember majority of the booking is coming in the last month, and therefore it's a small portion of the numbers, believe me, that are needed for any quarter including Q2.Our next question is from Michael Turits with Raymond James. Please proceed. -- Hey guys. Hello everybody and hope everybody is well. Gil, to come back to the VPN question and remote access, you did obviously state both in the press release and have talked about it since that, there was some increase for that. Do you have any sense whether people are now where they need to be in terms of capacity for VPN and remote access? However, they still need to add, in order to get up to work from home requirements? -- I think it varies a lot by industry and by country and I don't have good data. We might -- again we're starting to learn how to move to this new world and assess the new requirements, because these are -- now in the past, we had a pipeline of projects that were planned a year in advance and the salespeople couldn't plan for that. Now when you move into projects and think, my remote access is not working well, I need a solution now. In general by the way, one thing that did happen to our business and to the rest of the world, things that used to take two months are now taking -- today things that used to take two days or two weeks are now taking six hours. And the planning in general, we still have long-term planning, but we're moving to very local execution, execution that's measured by date. The reason I'm saying that is because, I mean if you were now a business let's say months ago, you said my workforce will go home and they will do whatever they can. Now you're saying, OK, how effective we are, is performance good, and let me revisit that. Maybe it's working and I'm fine and maybe now it's time to start a new project, because if I'm going to stay that way, I'd rather optimize and invest more, which is something by the way, even us are doing them on many of these areas.When you start a new project and maybe again, it's not a six month projects, it's maybe now a two week projects or a two month project instead of what used to be an annual project. Having said all of that, and I don't think it's over, but again that's what I'm saying about unpredictable environment. Maybe we will see that in three weeks the world will resume to work, and people start going to the office, maybe with some modifications. And all this talk about remote access project is going to translate into something different and shift to how we close the gap. By the way, one thing that I can predict, is that by moving to remote access, companies opened a huge amount of holes in their security. I mean the corporate network is now open in ways it wasn't open before, and hackers are going to exploit it. There is no doubt about that. We already saw a situation like that last week when the -- I think was the NHS, the Chinese Institute for Pandemic Research and the World Health Organization, were all hacked in a huge way. So there is a new -- there will be new security threat and many new holes to close. Surveys, which we did conduct did show the security professionals are very much aware of that. They're concerned about that. It doesn't mean that they were able to translate it yet to a motion, to create new projects or to budget, I think eventually it will come. -- Okay. Next caller?Our next question is from Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please proceed. -- Thanks. Tal, wondering if you could give us an update? I don't think we've had a number like this in a while, but it's relevant. How much of your business -- you've given us the $1 million deals, but how much of your business comes in from larger projects in your pipeline for a long time versus the sort of transactional piece that you sort of have less visibility, when it comes to the channel? -- So we didn't provide this color before. I can say, when we talked about the deals, there was a question before, how many transactions are coming in with the transactions over $1 million or customers that purchased over $1 million and then we saw a nice increase there. It's probably from those transactions you can get around -- it can fluctuate between quarters, right? So on the revenues, it's very different than on the booking. On the revenue side, it's not that large, so it's -- we do have large transactions, but it's not going to be 20% or 30% or 40% of our book -- of our revenue, because it's spread over many-many transactions. There is a numbers of deals we saw, there's about -- we said I think 67 transactions like this, this quarter. Remember, when you have large deals, many times, because it's multiyears and therefore it affects the bookings and the deferred revenues. but less affects revenues in a specific order. -- Okay. And then Tal, just another question you brought up on the Quantum appliances. It sounds like you're deferring more revenue than you had in the past. Could you maybe -- I know it has been a probably decade long discussion here around more deferral of appliance revenue. Could you help us understand what has changed with Quantum and maybe if there's any sort of benchmark you can give us from a year ago or five years ago in terms of how much more of a sale you're deferring, versus what you're seeing with this current generation? -- Sure. So we just started to sell it. So I can't tell you yet the amount, but I can give you the feel to it. So it happens every time we launch a new product line and we bundle with it, a subscription package which is a higher level than before. If you remember I think 2016 or 2017, we bundled with a new family -- instead of next generation firewall, we bundled next generation threat prevention and then we saw a shift from product revenues into the subscription. This launch, we bundle on the Quantum, we bundle instead of NGTP, like the old family, we bundle with the Sandblast, which is a higher level. Hence higher dollar value is allocated into the subscription going through the deferred revenues and then recognized.So it is -- its a deferral of the revenues, which instead of coming at the time of the selling of the product, is being deferred over four quarters. So from a business perspective, obviously it's still very-very good, because your customers are using higher level of security, they now have Zero-Day protection and then a year after, you also see them using it and then renewing it and therefore it will give another driver for the growth in the subscription. That's the logic of doing it. Securing the customers, and then a year after enjoying an additional dollars in the subscription.In order to estimate how much it is, we need to understand where the customer is -- what the customer will use in terms of appliance. This is very hard to predict. If they go down, if they go up in the level of appliance, therefore it can end up having zero effect, or we can end up maybe in a different scenario, having an effect of a few percentage on the product, maybe $10 million to $20 million, minus in the product and plus in the subscription over four quarters. And it can even do a difference, increase the product because they will choose to go to a higher appliance and we will enjoy both in the product and in the subscription. So I said in a few quarters, we will have much more visibility when I will see which route the customers are choosing to go and based on that I will be able to give you more color in the next quarter. -- Great. Thank you.We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Kip E. Meintzer for closing remarks. -- Thank you guys all for joining us today. We hope you're all safe and we look forward to speaking to you during the quarter. Thank you. Bye, bye.[Operator Closing Remarks]. --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --

While the broader stock market has recovered to some extent after the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic crushed investor confidence back in March,   continues to languish thanks to concerns about the company's .  data by The  billings growth -- a key indicator of its future revenue -- was on the , and the economic fallout caused by the COVID-19 outbreak may make things worse. Here's why.FireEye's fiscal first-quarter results contained a big red flag, as billings fell 7% year over year to $170 million. The novel coronavirus outbreak shaved off $10 million to $15 million from FireEye's first-quarter billings and forced the company to withdraw its annual billings guidance.FireEye was originally expecting to deliver billings between $930 million to $950 million this year, a small increase over last year's figure of $926 million. Things could now get worse, as the withdrawn guidance indicates that FireEye doesn't have clarity about how much sales it is going to bill in 2020.Image source: Getty Images.The company was already struggling with billings growth thanks to  a product-based business model to a software-centric one. Instead of taking an upfront payment from customers for a perpetual license under the earlier model, FireEye now recognizes revenue over the length of the subscription contract. The problem for FireEye is that customers weren't willing to commit to long-term contracts earlier, and COVID-19 has added more uncertainty into the mix.CFO Frank Verdecanna pointed this out over the latest :I believe the biggest unknown for us is the average contract length of billings. While customers may still commit to multiple years, given the current economic uncertainties, we are assuming that some will be less willing to pay for upfront for multiple years.FireEye's average contract length (ACL) for recurring subscriptions and support billings came in at 25 months during the first quarter. This was an improvement over the prior-year period's average contract length of 24 months, though lower than the ACL of 27 months seen in the second quarter of 2019. FireEye anticipates its average contract length to drop by two to three months in 2020.In all, there is a lot of uncertainty about FireEye's financial performance this year under the current circumstances, and that makes it a risky cybersecurity bet.FireEye announced that it will be laying off 6% of the company's workforce. The company says that this move was planned before the novel coronavirus-related disruptions hit the business, but the moves will help FireEye save some money in these difficult times.The company estimates a non- operating expense reduction of $25 million in 2020 over last year thanks to this restructuring. FireEye also clarifies that the layoffs are happening in the company's traditional appliance-based product business, and it was necessary for its transformation into a software-as-a-service (SaaS) provider.But a closer look at FireEye's balance sheet indicates that the disruptions caused by COVID-19 may have forced its hand. The company has around $980 million in cash on its balance sheet as compared to $1.1 billion in debt. Its gross margin and cash flow have been heading south over the past year, and things are likely to get worse in the coming months. data by In the end, it is clear that there are quite a few reasons why it would be a good idea to avoid FireEye. It is  of a jump in the volume of cyber threats that are arising because of an increase in telecommuting -- unlike rival , which recently delivered a robust quarterly performance and reported an uptick in business activity.FireEye's business was already on shaky ground before the novel coronavirus pandemic arrived, and it may be a long time before it gets back on track.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"The novel coronavirus pandemic sent the stock market packing in March as investors went into panic-selling mode fearing the economic fallout COVID-19 may cause. Top cybersecurity stocks weren't spared from the sell-off.In fact, cybersecurity stocks fell harder than the broad market in March thanks to their . This is why now may be a good time for investors looking to add a cybersecurity play to their portfolio to make their move. After all, demand for cybersecurity solutions should actually increase as shelter-in-place orders across the globe leave remote employees vulnerable to bad actors.  is one such cybersecurity stock that is attractive at its . Let's see why.Image source: Getty Images.Check Point's first-quarter results breezed past Wall Street's expectations thanks to an increase in demand for remote network security solutions. CEO Gil Shwed said, ""We saw an increased demand for network security gateways in order to support higher capacities and expand the use of our remote access VPN solutions.""Shwed added that Check Point was able to sustain ""elevated business activity levels"" as its teams transitioned ""almost exclusively"" to a work-from-home model. Demand for the company's technical services increased by 20% during the quarter as customers ramped up their infrastructure to tackle the increase in demand caused by shelter-in-place orders, Shwed said on the latest .The company's virtual private network (VPN) solutions are well positioned thanks to the jump in remote employment. One of Check Point's customers expanded the number of daily users employing its remote access solutions to 80,000 -- up from 8,000 previously. Check Point management also pointed out that its website has witnessed a seven-fold surge in traffic.Thanks to these tailwinds, Check Point revenue increased 3% annually to $486.5 million during the quarter, beating the $480.8 million consensus estimate. The company's non-GAAP earnings also increased to $1.42 per share, up from $1.32 per share in the prior-year period.Check Point saw a bump in demand for its cloud-specific solutions during the quarter, which led to a bump in its subscription business. Subscription revenue increased 10% year over year to $159 million, and the momentum is likely to continue as Check Point is seeing stronger interest in its cloud solutions. That's not surprising as the COVID-19 outbreak has accelerated many companies' transitions to the cloud so they can work remotely, thereby creating the need for cloud-specific cybersecurity solutions.Demand for Check Point's offerings should also improve long term as the novel coronavirus pandemic reshapes workplaces. But the company has decided to play it safe despite these potential tailwinds to its business -- Check Point management chose to withdraw its full-year guidance, citing the uncertainty the disease has brought to businesses around the globe.However, that shouldn't be a reason for investors to panic as the company has a solid balance sheet that should help it sail through the novel coronavirus storm.Check Point Software's total cash balance stood at $4 billion as of March 31, and the company has no debt. This cash-rich balance sheet should see the company through any troubles COVID-19 may cause, and management can use this strong cash position to boost shareholder value through .The company had expanded its share repurchase program by $2 billion in February. It bought back $325 million worth of shares last quarter, and it won't be surprising to see the company repurchase more shares in the coming quarters as it is currently trading at 19 times trailing earnings, below its five-year average  of 22.3.Between an attractive valuation, a robust balance sheet, and a business that looks capable of withstanding the pandemic, now is the time to go long on Check Point Software stock.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

  lost about a third of its value this year due to two major challenges. First, the cybersecurity firm's first-quarter guidance disappointed investors in February. Second, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic crushed stocks across the board.Yet the coronavirus crisis also sparked a surge in remote work, which could bolster demand for cybersecurity services. So is FireEye, which trades at less than one times its annual revenue, a potential turnaround play in this volatile market?Image source: Getty Images.FireEye provides threat detection services that intercept attacks before they breach a network. Over the past few years, FireEye pivoted away from on-site appliances toward cloud-based services.That strategic shift reduced its revenue, since appliances initially cost more than cloud subscriptions, but it also locked in customers and stabilized its annual returns. FireEye also reduced operating costs at its core business, and expanded its ecosystem by acquiring smaller companies like iSight, Invotas, The Email Laundry, X15 Software, Verodin, and Cloudvisory over the past four years.FireEye serves over 8,200 customers across 103 countries, including roughly half of the Forbes Global 2000. However, FireEye still faces fierce competition from larger rivals like   and 's  Symantec, which are both frequently cited as suitors in a potential takeover.FireEye's growth in revenue and billings decelerated significantly over the past five years:Growth (YOY)20152016201720182019Revenue46%15%5%7%7%Billings35%3%(6%)12%8%YOY = Year-over-year. Source: FireEye annual reports.That slowdown can be attributed to its shift from appliances to services and tough competition in the cybersecurity market. It's also generating more revenue from cloud and virtual subscriptions, which have shorter contracts than hardware-tethered subscriptions.For 2020, FireEye expects its revenue to rise 5%-6%, with just 0%-3% billings growth. It offered that guidance in early February -- before the coronavirus crisis escalated into a full-blown pandemic -- but hasn't updated those numbers yet.On a  basis, FireEye's gross margin contracted from 75% in 2018 to 73% in 2019, as its operating margin receded from 3% to 1%. It expects its non-GAAP gross margin to decline to 71% in 2020, due to a higher mix of lower-margin professional services, but for its operating margin to expand to 5%-6% as it cuts costs and integrates newly acquired businesses like Verodin.FireEye still isn't profitable on a GAAP basis, mainly due to stock-based compensation expenses, which consumed 17% of its revenue in 2019. Its cash and equivalents also declined 18% to $334.6 million in 2019, but its short-term investments stayed nearly flat at $705 million.Investors generally favor two types of cybersecurity stocks: those with robust revenue growth that aren't fretting over profits yet, and those that generate slower growth with sustainable profits. FireEye, an unprofitable company that generates single-digit revenue growth, doesn't fit either category.Image source: Getty Images.Investors looking for a higher-growth play would likely prefer , which posted 28% revenue growth last year. Those looking for a more profitable play would likely stick with   or . That's why all three stocks currently trade far above their , while FireEye trades nearly 50% below its IPO price of $20.With an enterprise value of $2.7 billion, FireEye remains a potential buyout target for Cisco, Broadcom's Symantec, and other tech giants. However,  claimed that FireEye was seeking offers of $30 or more -- which seem unlikely in this market as the pandemic forces companies to scale back their spending.Lockdowns and remote work might boost billings for certain cybersecurity companies, but I'm not convinced they'll generate major tailwinds for FireEye. Companies that want to bundle cybersecurity services with collaboration software could stick with Cisco, and those that want end-to-end solutions might flock to larger players like Symantec.Meanwhile, investors can still pick up higher-quality cybersecurity plays like CyberArk, Palo Alto, or CheckPoint after the recent market pullback. Investors should be picky in this brutal market, and FireEye simply isn't strong enough to warrant a recommendation yet.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"Investors in Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd.  (Symbol: CHKP) saw new options begin trading this week, for the June 19th expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CHKP options chain for the new June 19th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $100.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.80.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $100.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $96.20 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CHKP, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $104.28/share today.

Because the $100.00 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 66%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.80% return on the cash commitment, or 24.33% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.


Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd. , and highlighting in green where the $100.00 strike is located relative to that history:


   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $105.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.80.  If an investor was to purchase shares of CHKP stock at the current price level of $104.28/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $105.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.29% if the stock gets called away at the June 19th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CHKP shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd. , as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing CHKP's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $105.00 strike highlighted in red:



   
Considering the fact that the $105.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 49%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.60% boost of extra return to the investor, or 29.48% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.


The implied volatility in the put contract example is 40%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 38%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $104.28) to be 31%.

"Looking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. 	For the Invesco QQQ ETF (Symbol: QQQ), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $233.54 per unit.


With QQQ trading at a recent price near $209.43 per unit, that means that analysts see 11.51% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings.   Three of QQQ's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are PACCAR Inc. (Symbol: PCAR), Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd.

Similarly, CHKP has 12.69% upside from the recent share price of $102.10 if the average analyst target price of $115.06/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting VRSK to reach a target price of $165.36/share, which is 12.39% above the recent price of $147.13.

Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past.

"he coronavirus outbreak is shaking our lives. At least 1.7 billion people have been requested to stay home to enforce social distancing and try to slow down its spread.The impact on investors is no less remarkable. It took only 19 days for the index to switch from an 11-year bull market to bear territory on March 11. And at the time of this writing, March 24, the benchmark plunged by 34% from its recent all-time highs. That gives long-term investors the opportunity to buy solid tech stocks at a much cheaper price than a few weeks ago.But when it comes to select the companies you want to own over the next several years, you should first focus on the potential of their businesses. The unknown impact of the coronavirus makes this task more difficult, though. Which companies are at risk if a recession materializes? Which ones will be impacted by short-term disruptions such as stay-at-home policies? And what about the long term? The good news is, some tech companies may not be impacted by the potential problems of the coronavirus situation.  ,  , and   should survive any prolonged recession the pandemic may cause, thanks to their strong balance sheets and high profitability. Also, their long-term potential remains intact since they provide the computing infrastructures the world will need no matter how the coronavirus changes our digital lives.Image source: Getty Images.The tech giant dominates the networking industry. It increased its revenue to $51.9 billion during  2019, up 5% year over year. Its broad portfolio also covers the cybersecurity and communication areas. As such, no matter how we work when the coronavirus situation settles, enterprises will need Cisco's solutions.Granted, . Its cloud-based cybersecurity product Umbrella and communications software Webex allow remote employees to work from home in a secure way. But that remains a small part of Cisco's portfolio. The company's core business, which consists of selling networking hardware, software, and services, represented 82% of total revenue during the last quarter. And the need for those solutions remains significant.For example,  and  recently lowered the quality of their video streaming to alleviate the strain on the Internet. After years of reduced capital spending, internet service providers such as  and  will have to ramp up their efforts to still offer a performance network, which bodes well for Cisco. In addition, the deployment of new technologies such as  should also boost Cisco's business over the next several years.Besides, the company can sustain a potentially prolonged recession that the coronavirus pandemic may cause. At the end of last quarter, its cash and equivalents exceeded its total debt by $11.1 billion. And thanks to its large scale, its strong  -- 28.2% during the last quarter -- represents an extra safety net.With its recent 25% drop over the last four weeks, Cisco's stock price has become attractive at only 12.2 times forward earnings.Check Point Software is much smaller than Cisco, but its $2 billion of annual revenue in 2019 -- up 4% year over year -- positions the company as an important player in its core cybersecurity market. Besides its legacy on-premises products, such as firewalls, that protect corporate networks, it offers cloud-based cybersecurity solutions that remote workers can use.The company's transition to subscription-based software is having a negative impact on its revenue growth in the short term since smaller annual revenues are replacing large upfront payments.But with its broad cybersecurity portfolio, the company is equipped to capture the forecasted 10.2% annual growth that the cybersecurity market represents over the next several years, according to the research company MarketsandMarkets. And that growth should materialize no matter how work-from-home policies evolve in the long run. Considering the significant threats, cybersecurity is not a discretionary expense anymore, no matter how we consume IT services. Given that Check Point has $3.9 billion of cash and equivalents, no debt as of the end of last year, and a huge operating margin of 46% during the last quarter, investors shouldn't worry about any  (ability to pay debt) anytime soon.The stock price dropped by 25% in one month, valuing the company at a modest  (P/E) of 15.5.Arista Networks competes with Cisco, mostly in the high-speed data center switching market where it increased its share from 10% in 2015 to 18% last year. The company's networking portfolio addresses the needs of cloud giants such as  and  in terms of performance, scalability, and flexibility. As a result, Arista's revenue increased to $2.41 billion in 2019, up 12.1% year over year. The company generates a significant part of its revenue from a few giant cloud providers. Microsoft and Facebook represented 23% and 17%, respectively, of total revenue last year. Thus, sales and marketing expenses remained low (8.9% of revenue), which led to an impressive operating margin of 33.4% in 2019.The drawback is that Arista depends on the capital spending of these few large customers, which results in volatile quarterly results. For instance, fourth-quarter revenue dropped by 7.2% year over year after a 16.7% increase during the prior quarter.Yet the company is exposed to the secular growth that  represents. And with $2.7 billion of cash and equivalents and no debt, the company would not be put at risk if a prolonged recession occurs.With the 27% drop in Arista's stock price in one month, the market values this  at 22.5 times its forward earnings, which seems reasonable.

Shares of a few smaller technology companies made some big moves on Friday as the broader market struggled to stay positive. While the  was up a few percentage points at market open, that gain had been whittled down to just 0.54% by 11:50 a.m. EDT. ,  , and   were substantially higher at market open. Those gains had moderated by late morning.Stock Change at 11:50 a.m.Maximum ChangeSilicon Laboratories6.2%13.6%Fastly4.6%17.9%Check Point Software5.5%9.7%Data source: Yahoo! Finance.The stock market tumbled on Thursday, with the major U.S. indexes losing nearly 10% each. It was the worst day in decades for the market, and nearly every stock got caught up in the selling. Silicon Labs dropped 18.6%, Fastly fell 17.1%, and Check Point slumped 9.6%.All three stocks have been hammered over the past month as fears surrounding the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic escalated. Event cancellations and school closings are piling up in the U.S., and major tourist attractions are beginning to shut down. The ultimate economic impact to the U.S. economy is unknown, but it could be substantial.Image source: Getty Images.Over the past month, shares of Silicon Labs and Check Point are down around 28%, while shares of Fastly have tumbled roughly 38%.Silicon Labs cut its first-quarter outlook on Thursday morning, which contributed to the stock's poor performance. The company is seeing weakening demand thanks to the pandemic, and there are still issues with its supply chain despite all its Asia-based suppliers having resumed operations. Silicon Labs now expects adjusted EPS between $0.49 and $0.53 in the first quarter, down from previous guidance of $0.57 to $0.67. On a  basis, the company now expects to post a per-share loss between $0.12 and $0.16.Edge cloud-computing provider Fastly reported solid results back in February, but it wasn't enough to keep the stock afloat. Revenue grew by 44% to $59 million, beating analyst expectations by more than $4 million. Adjusted EPS was a loss of $0.10, ahead of analyst estimates by $0.01. Fastly also announced a CEO change, with Joshua Bixby, its president, taking the helm. Previous CEO Artur Bergman transitioned to chief architect and executive chairperson.On top of coronavirus fears, Check Point received an analyst downgrade early this month, which added fuel to the fire.  downgraded the stock to sell on March 5, dropping its price target to $100 per share. Goldman is concerned that maintenance growth will come under pressure if the company continues to lose market share.In 2019, while Check Point's subscription revenue jumped 12.5% to $610.3 million, product and license revenue slumped 2.8% to $510.8 million.While solid gains for these stocks on Friday certainly feel good after a brutal Thursday sell-off, there's little reason to believe the volatility will die down anytime soon. More big declines, and more big rallies, are likely as the coronavirus pandemic plays out in the United States and around the world.All three of these  will likely see some negative impact from the pandemic. For long-term investors, what matters is how the companies perform in the long run.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"In today’s challenged markets, consider cybersecurity stocks. Why? We could be entering a global recession. But that doesn’t mean hackers will soon be out of work. Corporate America remains vulnerable to data breaches. As Robert Siegel, lecturer in management at Stanford Graduate School of Business, wrote in an email to InvestorPlace, “Perhaps the most obvious challenge will be in privacy and safety due to increased connectivity.”Why? Even before millions of Americans were  due to the coronavirus from China, decentralized workplaces were becoming the norm. Large-scale moves to cloud computing also add to increased demand. This means sensitive data is under greater threat from bad actors. Overall, corporate America needs cybersecurity now more than ever.With these tailwinds in motion, now’s the time to look into cybersecurity stocks. But which ones are the best stocks to invest in? Taking a look at large cap names, a few stand out. Granted, short-term headwinds may impact performance. But all three could be great long-term buys for your portfolio.Let’s dive in, and see why you should keep these three cybersecurity stocks on your radar.Source: jejim / Shutterstock.com
	 (NASDAQ:) stock may face slow growth. But what this Israeli-based company makes up for it with is a solid balance sheet. As one writer recently noted, Check Point’s  may make it a safe harbor in these challenging times.Additionally, with shares trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 15.6, this is a value stock in a growth industry. Granted, forward revenue growth is only 3.3%. Yet, the company could use its financial strength to capitalize on the situation. How? By acquiring faster-growing cybersecurity businesses while valuations remain depressed.However, don’t discount the value of Check Point’s existing operations. As InvestorPlace’s Josh Enomoto discussed last fall, a key area for the company is . As Enomoto put it, the company shows strength in “addressing next-generation threats.”Slow-growth may make them more vulnerable to high-flying competitors. But, shares could already reflect this factor. So with recent price declines, CHKP stock may be one of many stocks to invest in as markets head towards a bottom. Be careful before “buying the dip,” but keep this name on your radar.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com
	 (NASDAQ:) stock is another strong cybersecurity play. But, is the company immune to economic headwinds? No, says D.A. Davidson’s Andrew Nowinski. The analyst  shares from “buy” to “neutral.”The reason? Fortinet’s focus on firewalls may mean its products and services could be in less demand. In other words, don’t expect businesses to upgrade their firewalls anytime soon. This could impact the company’s high projected revenue growth of around 15% between 2020 and 2021.Coupled with the stock’s high valuation (forward P/E of 38.2), it may pay to wait-and-see with FTNT stock. In other words, the company’s underlying business may be well-positioned. But this factor could remain priced into shares.Bottom line? With the stock down from $120 per share to under $100 per share, FTNT stock may be a buy today. But at even lower prices, Fortinet shares could be a strong opportunity.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com
	Corporate America’s move the cloud is a boon for  (NASDAQ:) stock. Remote working also benefits this fast-growing identity company. But these tailwinds may not be enough to sustain growth. MFA (multi-factor authorization) and single sign-on isn’t going away. But, a recession could affect the company’s current 40%-plus revenue growth.As I discussed back in October, Okta’s , and then some. Yet, the stock rallied further in the now-past bull market. Shares have retreated back to being near prior levels in recent weeks (between $110 and $120 per share). However, keep in mind downside risks before putting in a buy order.Okta’s underlying catalysts remain strong, but shares could easily head back to their 52-week low (around $79 per share) if the company’s high growth takes a dip.My call? Consider shares today, but keep in mind how COVID-19 affects first quarter (Q1) 2020 results. The company  for fourth quarter (Q4) 2019. But, with the economy turning on a dime, all bets are off.Thomas Niel, contributor to InvestorPlace, has written single-stock analysis for web-based publications since 2016.

"Looking today at week-over-week shares outstanding changes among the universe of ETFs covered at , one standout is the iShares Core MSCI Total International Stock ETF (Symbol: IXUS) where we have detected an approximate $226.9 million dollar inflow -- that's a 1.3% increase week over week in outstanding units (from 308,000,000 to 312,100,000).  Among the largest underlying components of IXUS, in trading today NXP Semiconductors NV (Symbol: NXPI) is off about 4.8%, Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd.  (Symbol: CHKP) is down about 4.8%, and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (Symbol: TEVA) is lower by about 12%.  

The chart below shows the one year price performance of IXUS, versus its 200 day moving average:
   

   

Looking at the chart above, IXUS's low point in its 52 week range is $51.02 per share, with $63.03 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $52.15.  Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique -- .




		


Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''.  These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand.  Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).  Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

"Looking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. 	For the ProShares ProShares Ultra QQQ ETF (Symbol: QLD), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $139.91 per unit.


With QLD trading at a recent price near $125.09 per unit, that means that analysts see 11.84% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings.   Three of QLD's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are NXP Semiconductors NV (Symbol: NXPI), Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd. (Symbol: CHKP), and Fiserv Inc (Symbol: FISV). Although NXPI has traded at a recent price of $119.47/share, the average analyst target is 22.49% higher at $146.33/share. Similarly, CHKP has 15.71% upside from the recent share price of $103.66 if the average analyst target price of $119.94/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting FISV to reach a target price of $129.54/share, which is 14.77% above the recent price of $112.87. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of NXPI, CHKP, and FISV:  

   Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:

Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

"Investors in Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd.  (Symbol: CHKP) saw new options begin trading this week, for the October 16th expiration.  One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 233 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CHKP options chain for the new October 16th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $105.00 strike price has a current bid of $6.70.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $105.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $98.30 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CHKP, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $107.47/share today.

Because the $105.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 61%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.38% return on the cash commitment, or 10.00% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.


Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd. , and highlighting in green where the $105.00 strike is located relative to that history:


   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $110.00 strike price has a current bid of $7.60.  If an investor was to purchase shares of CHKP stock at the current price level of $107.47/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $110.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 9.43% if the stock gets called away at the October 16th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CHKP shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd. , as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing CHKP's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $110.00 strike highlighted in red:



   
Considering the fact that the $110.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 50%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 7.07% boost of extra return to the investor, or 11.08% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.


The implied volatility in the put contract example is 26%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 25%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $107.47) to be 20%.

I'm pleased to begin the review of the fourth quarter and the full year.Revenues for the fourth quarter increased by 3% year-over-year, to$544 million and our non-GAAP EPS grew by 21% to $2.02, both above the midpoint of our guidance. Before I proceed further into the numbers, let me remind you that our GAAP financial results include stock-based compensation charges, amortization of acquired intangible assets and acquisition related expenses, as well as the related tax effects. Keep in mind that as applicable, non-GAAP information is presented excluding these items.Now let's take a look at the financial highlights for the quarter; revenues reached $544 million, $2 million above the midpoint of our guidance. Product and security subscription revenues were $322 million. Our security subscription revenues continue to be healthy with 12% growth year-over-year, reaching $164 million. Our software update and maintenance revenues increased to $222 million, representing 2% growth year-over-year. Products are transitioning partly to the cloud solution, which are included in the subscription line. The reduction in product line is naturally driving lower support levels. The growth in our subscription revenues is driven mainly by our CloudGuard business and Infinity deals, we generated double digit and triple digit revenue growth respectively.Deferred revenues. As of December 31 reached $1.387 billion, a growth of $49 million year-over-year. Revenue distribution by geography for the quarter was as follows; 44% of revenues came from the Americas; 45% of revenues came from Europe, Middle East and Africa regions. The remaining 11% came from Asia-Pacific. Since the beginning of 2019. Middle East and Africa region are part of Europe, Middle East and Africa, which before it was part of Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa region. The revenue distribution by geography for Q4 last year, after the reclassification, would have been 45% of revenues came from Americas, 44% of revenues came from Europe, Middle East and Africa region; and the remaining 11% came from Asia Pacific.Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter were 51%. During the quarter the dollar weakened against some currencies mainly the Israeli shekel, creating a headwind of $4 million or $0.03 year-over-year. Our financial income for the quarter was $20 million, compared to $21 million last quarter, and $17 million last year. During the year, we saw a change in trend, with a decrease in our portfolio yield, as a result of the lower interest rate in the U.S. As a result of this decrease and the continued buyback program, our financial income for next year is expected to be around $19 million in the beginning of the year, moving down to $17 million in the quarter by the end of the year.Effective non-GAAP tax rates for this quarter was zero as expected. This quarter similar to last year, our tax expenses included tax benefit from lapse of statute limitation of certain provisions. GAAP net income was $272 million or $1.84 per diluted share, an increase of 21% from fourth quarter of 2018. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $299 million or $2.02 per diluted share, an increase of 21% from the fourth quarter of 2018. EPS was $0.03 above the mid of our guidance.Our cash balances were $3.991 billion as of year-end. Operating cash flow continued to be strong, with $246 million, compared to $249 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. Collection from customers are strong. Our cash payments increased, in line with our continued investment in sales and marketing. During the quarter, we acquired Protego and Cymplify, both have minimal effect on our profit for the quarter.During the quarter, we utilized the maximum quarterly buyback authorized and purchased 2.9 million shares for $325 million, at an average price of $113 per share.Now let's take a look into the full 2019; revenues for the year were $1.995 billion, an increase of 4% from last year. During the year, subscription continued to be the main growth driver. The subscription revenues include majority of our new products and services, including Cloud Infinity solution and mobile. On the Infinity front, we have seen an increase of tens to hundreds of percentage in the annual run rate of business, with customers that adopt in the full Infinity threat protection solution. This is great news. The product portion reduced, since the allocation to subscription is quite large.During the year, we have increased cloud market penetration, with over 2,500 customers. During 2019 and the beginning of 2020, we introduced the new appliance family. It is hard to predict the mix between the old and the new products and between the different types of appliances that the customers will end up choosing. As you know, our goal is to provide higher throughput across the line for the benefit of our customers, understanding that there is some risk of some customers buying lower priced appliances, with higher throughput. Hence, it is quite hard to predict the effect of our new appliances on the average sales price in 2020. We also plan to bundle more services as part of our appliances next year, which will continue the transition that we are experiencing between products to subscription.Non-GAAP operating margin for the year was with 50%, as we anticipated in the beginning of the year. We continue to invest in our workforce and marketing efforts. As discussed during the year, the dollar weakened against some currencies, mainly the Israeli shekel, and created a headwind for the full year of $5 million or $0.04. This headwind is expected to continue and to be $10 million or $0.06 in 2020, based on the current exchange rates. The acquisition we made during the year are expected to have an effect of $0.03, $0.04 on non-GAAP EPS and $0.07, $0.08 on GAAP EPS. As a result of the continued investment, currency effect, and the acquisition we expect annual margin next year to be around 48%, with lower points in Q1, and with the highest point at Q4 next year.Effective non-GAAP tax rate for the year was 14%. For 2020, we expect the tax rate to be for the year around 12%, going down 2%, as a result of the change in regulation, structure and tax [Indecipherable]. Quarterly taxes are expected to be around 17% in Q1, Q2 and Q3 and around zero in Q4, as the lapse of statute limitation expected to occur in the fourth quarter, as we've seen in the last two years.GAAP net income for the year was $826 million or $5.43 per diluted share. GAAP earnings per share grew by 5%. Non-GAAP net income for the year was $933 million or $6.13 per diluted share, reflecting an increase of 7%. For the year, cash flow from operation was $1.102 billion compared to $1.130 billion, quite similar. During the year, the company repurchased approximately 11.2 million shares, at a total cost of approximately $1.278 billion at an average price of $114 per share.We believe that our market leadership and long-term growth prospects, makes it is an effective time to further utilize our cash to increase shareholder value. As such, we have announced today an increase of $2 billion to our buyback program, with the quarterly repurchase of up to $325 million a quarter, consistent with our previous plan. The total amount available as of year-end from the old program was $382 million.Based on the above plan, we expect our average diluted number of shares for 2020 to be on average, $144 million, starting at $147 million and moving down $141 million in Q4 of 2020.Now let's turn the call over to Gil for his comments. -- Thank you, Tal, and hello to everyone joining us today. Tal spoke about fourth quarter business results were in line with our projections. Our CloudGuard family of products, mobility and advanced threat prevention solutions continue to demonstrate solid growth throughout the year. These are all subscription-based solution and where continued success shifts our business into more of an annuity model. Overall, we had a strong finish for the quarter, and tallied the nice number of wins with our new technologies.We are placing a lot of emphasis on driving the future of cyber security, with the launch of our Infinity NEXT architecture. But before we dive into the future of cyber security, a little summary of the technologies we launched in 2019. We started revamping our clients models with the 16000 and 26000 series of appliances for the high-end datacenter. But unlike most industry, we made a real breakthrough network security architecture, with the launch of the Maestro Orchestrator. Maestro delivers cloud like elasticity and reliability to datacenters. Normal gateway architectures work on the premise with 1+, the 10+10=10. For example, traditionally, you buy two 10 gigabit appliances to work in a high availability mode. So if one fails, the other takes over. And if you run out of bandwidth, again, 10 gigabits, you need to upgrade the whole installation.Maestro changes this architecture, you can have two, three or up to 52 security appliances, and they will work in parallel, delivering a multiple of the performance, providing N+1 redundancy not only that, it is completely elastic architecture, you can add more and more capacity as demand increases. We are starting to see good adoption of the Maestro based solution with enterprises of all sizes.We have also complemented our network security architecture with the 1500 security appliance series. This series brings enterprise grade capabilities to the entry level of the marketplace. It is favored by managed security providers, and telcos who wants to provide the highest level of security to many small businesses in an effective manner. But beyond the network security development [Phonetic] in 2019, we made a lot of headway in the cloud space. We've extended the CloudGuard family with cloud delivered network security, CloudGuard Connect and with the integration into SD1 systems, we've made a bigger evolution with the acquisition of Dome9 and are now delivering CloudGuard Dome9 multi-cloud security management, and toward the end of the year, we completed another acquisition in the cloud space for server-less security, adding what is called workloads to the CloudGuard family, covering Amazon Lambda function in traditional serverless workloads in the future.Given everything we've done on the cloud space, we believe that we have a very good foundation for cloud security with the CloudGuard family. CloudGuard IaaS, CloudGuard SaaS, CloudGuard Dome9, CloudGuard Connect and CloudGuard Workload. Overall, our cloud business now reaches over 2,500 customers, up significantly from last year.Another acquisition we completed in December was in the field of IoT security. This one is quite revolutionary technology. Most IoT security companies provide discovery and mapping of IoT devices. The smelting device on its own doesn't elevate the security level. The real challenge in IoT devices is even if you know which devices you have, you don't know their security posture. These are cloud devices the don't let you manage your application or operating system environments, usually old invariable operating system, and therefore creating huge security vulnerability. Our new IoT security technology will change that. It can analyze the firmware of each IoT device, and provide the report on the level of security and vulnerabilities in the device. But that's just where the story begins, we can automatically create a modified binary, that fixes these security vulnerabilities and [Indecipherable] part 3 the IoT device framework. So when an organization deploys IoT devices, they can check for security level, and ask the vendor to harden [Phonetic] their device's security posture, using our technology.This is what we refer to as nano-security architecture, which leads me to the future of cyber security, where we're going to focus in 2020. But before I dive into the future of cyber security and the Infinity NEXT architecture, let's take a quick look at the industry. Enterprises of any size, whether it's 400 or 400,000 employees, all face similar challenges, they have a host of platforms, endpoints, mobile, networks, IoT and huge number of cloud platforms, virtual servers, container, web services and more. Many of these don't follow the traditional computer models, and present a real security challenge.The attacks are becoming more sophisticated. We're now with the fifth generation of cyber attacks, moving into the sixth generation. These attacks are fully amorphic, making them very hard to detect, multi-vector, an attack can start with the credential from a mobile device and use that to penetrate the cloud in the network, until it starts downloading and activating it's malicious workloads. So a typical enterprise can find itself with 30 to 40 computing platform, or as we call assets, and dozens of security technologies that are needed to protect them.No enterprise can pull it altogether. Many platform or assets will remain insufficiently secure. Many technologies that are needed once being deployed, which is what we see every day, with the vast majority of the market customers, are Gen 3 security rather than Gen 5, where we should be. The technologies that are being implemented today, don't work together probably, and don't deliver the desired level of security for the entire enterprise.Check Point Infinity and Infinity NEXT are uniquely positioned to change that reality. In the first few weeks, we started launching the Infinity NEXT, the technology that can solve the security challenge. Infinity next provide a unified architecture. It consists of a security brain, that covers over 60 secured technologies with a range of field, known attacks, unknown threats, zero trust access, hardening in compliance, and coordinate the i-Security. This range provides capabilities to cloud service to all the platforms, asset types and workloads. Our aim is to get over 50 platform or asset types in 2020. For each platform, there is a unique nano-agent that's plugged into web system and connected to the security [Indecipherable].This includes the long list of asset types from serverless function, a web service or IoT devices. They will all consume the services from the cloud, no need for upgrades, updates, complicated installation, delivery of security can be embedded into devops services in an automated manner and provide the highest level of security posture constantly.Infinity NEXT is the only architecture, that combines over 60 security services, multiplied by 50 platforms to deliver unmatched security. We launched the Infinity NEXT technology at our CPX conferences over the past few weeks. We were received by our customers and partners with great enthusiasm. We received the highest ratings from customers based on our vision and relevance to release. We are starting to deliver these solutions now, and 2020 will be an important year for the new architecture.From an execution standpoint; we continue to make many changes in our field operation in 2019, and will continue in 2020. Evolving our business and consumer relationship is an evolutionary time. We're continuing to target cloud buyers, C level CIOs and CSOs that are involved with the larger cyber security landscape. We have recruited many new leaders, especially in the channel management areas. We've put new sales structures in places, and we continue to support and grow the traditional network security business, while leveraging our customer relationships, to expand our footprint into new field of security.Some areas showed good progress; in particular our cloud sales are growing nicely, as well as our Infinity Total Protection platform. In 2019, annuity sales amounted to almost 75% of our revenues, and security subscriptions surpassed the sale of traditional product This is a great achievement. Over the past decade, we've built an advanced security annuity business, that is now over $600 million in revenues annually. In the short term, we will aim to grow both products and subscription lines, as the new product sales continue to provide an important platform for subscription.Over the next year, we will continue to focus on the same key areas. Our Infinity NEXT platform will take the front stage for innovation and fast forward that into the future of security. We will continue to move services to the cloud, like for security management-as-a-service model, and we will continue to drive innovation in the network security core business, with our [Indecipherable] software platform, our new Quantum appliances that were launched last week, and the Maestro platform, that continues to generate significant business and provide leading technologies in the core network security market.From a technology perspective, I believe we are gaining traction with our cyber security leadership. From a business perspective, clearly, we should generate higher growth rates, and we are fully committed to achieve that success.This is a good transition to our 2020 projection. As you know, my regular caveat, it is hard to predict the future, especially with all the changes we are implementing to our technology and business. So I will remain relatively conservative with my projection. Of course, there are many opportunities for upside, and also some risks to these projections. In particular, most of our new initiative revolves around new cloud and annuity business model, which means, that when we win a large project, most of the revenues will be deferred for the duration of the contract, and not flow right into the P&L.With that said, revenues for 2020 are expected to be in the range of $2 billion to $2.1 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $6.25 to $6.65. GAAP EPS is expected to be approximately $0.85 lower.For the first quarter, we expect revenues in the range of $475 million to $495 million, and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.37 to $1.43. GAAP EPS is expected to be approximately $0.21 less.With that, I'd love to open the call for your questions. Looking forward to hear your thoughts and questions.[Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. Please proceed. -- Excellent. Thank you so much. Gil, I wanted to drill in a little bit on the go-to market changes, and I appreciate all the color in your prepared remarks. Last week we noticed the new stars global partner program you announced, building on the Engage program that you also I think announced last May, and it seems though, that when we talk to partners, it's still tough getting them to lead with Check Point in net new opportunities, landing new logos. Can you talk specifically about the progress that you made last year? How the new program incentivizes new business? And any metrics or leading indicators that you feel that you maybe -- you've gotten it right now, as we head into 2020? -- I think first, it's important to understand, last year, we grew the number of new customers and we grew the number of partners, and we had some nice successes. I think the new programs that we have are all tailored to have some effects on that, and to create the programmatic effect. But to be honest with you, the main job is not the programs, and not the formalities, it's the joint work that our people are doing and will do in the marketplace. To that end again, we've put some new leadership in the channel areas, both on the global basis and especially in the U.S., and I think one of the important elements is to kind of reiterate that matter to our people, go work with our partners. If we we create more successes together we will -- they will be replicated by the partners.Now keep in mind, we are the only vendor that does a 100% of business with partners and through partners. But I think what's changed in the last few years in the last -- again, it's not the last few years, changed many years ago, is that we ended up driving more business and just fulfilling it through the channel. I think what we need to do, is drive the business all the way with the partners. I am encouraged with some of the things I've seen, but again, we have a long way until we reestablish their trust. By the way, it goes both ways, partners working with us, as we're working with and I think in CPXs, we got good feedback from them. We have a very, very successful CPXs. We had two of them, one in Bangkok three weeks ago, one in New Orleans, in the U.S. last week. The biggest one, by the way, by far is going to be our European one, that's going to start tomorrow in Vienna. And again, from what I've seen in the U.S. in particular, we've seen some good traction in getting partners more and more involved. -- Thank you, Gil. If I could just follow-up for one -- from Tal. Tal, I think most of us appreciate the transitions that Check Point and the overall industry is going through and the impact it has in your business model, as more revenue shifts to subscription. But if I look at current deferred revenue, for the full year last year, you added $32 million, compares to the prior year at $100 million and the year before that, its $64 million, and this is with strength and things like CloudGuard and Infinity and and as Gil talks about, strength in your annuity business. So with this transition and we would -- we would expect it to have an impact on product revenue. Why are we seeing it more build in deferred and any kind of acceleration on the subscription lines? Thanks. -- So you are right. the effect should be reflected in the deferred revenues. The only thing I will say that, two things; one Infinity deals, the majority of the dollars are not coming through deferred, because it's annually invoiced. So you see a phenomena of annual invoice business. And second, I remind you that we talked about it throughout the year, that last year we had a few, call it abnormal huge transaction growth in Q2, and in Q3 and some some in Q4, which was very hard to match. Last year we had the few very-very large deals which were partially part of the deferred revenues, and therefore we don't see it as part of the growth this year. -- Okay. Thank you.Our next question is from Michael Turits with Raymond James. Please proceed. -- Hey guys. Good morning, good afternoon. So I think I'll start with Tal. Tal, the two points of margin decline this year, can you just make sure we parsed that correctly, to understand what's coming from acquisitions or from the shekel, and what's coming from incremental investments, and where those investments are and the follow-on question is that, another two points down this year with margins. What the prospects are? Are we bottoming at this point or how do you think about margins longer term? -- Yeah. So I mentioned three things; there's a lot of details behind it, but the three main thing was one we talked about the headwind from the dollar. The main drop against the shekel happened in Q4. It's already now ILS3.4. We started last year, if I recall, around ILS3.8, but most of the jump happened in the last quarter or two. So the full effect you see in next year, which as I told you, I think based on today's rate at around $10 million. Okay. So that probably explains about half a percent, slightly more.Second, we had the acquisition at -- in cents, its about $0.07 to $0.08 annually. You can calculate how much is in dollars. I think it comes to about also $10 million or so. We had three acquisitions this year if you recall, one in the beginning of the year and during Q4. So it's not a big effect, but it is affecting. All of them have no revenue, just expenses, but it's a good, we bought an amazing technology, that is just part of the expenses for next year.And third, I mentioned, remember that when you recruit people and you are having salary increases, even if we don't recruit people, if you grow the revenues up 3%, 4%, % then naturally, the growth in your headcount plus the growth in the increases in salary, brings higher growth, and that's the third big explanation for the two point drop from 50% to 48%. And that's the average, remember that Q1 starts much lower, because obviously peak season in Q1. So Q1 starts maybe 2% lower, and then the year-end with 2% higher. So the average comes to the 48%. -- And then just my longer-term question, as I said, it has been a couple of years of continuing declining margins. How should we think about your strategy, relative to margins over the next couple of years? -- I think first, I mean I've been saying that we are public now for like almost 24 years. I've been very-very consistent about that from the day we went public in '96. Our focus is not about the margin, our focus is on building a healthy, growing business, and that's what we are doing. By the way over that period of time, we've actually expanded our margin, not lowered our margin, over the long period of time, and our margins are very, very high; around -- again, whether it's 48% or 52% of operating margin, it's very high. The main strategy is what we do and how we do it effectively. There are many opportunities in the marketplace. We do want to conquer new markets. We do want to take good care of our people, which is also important. We do want to provide good incentive for our partners. The fact that we are able to do all of that and still maintain the high margin, I think speaks for speaks for itself and I think once we see some of it flowing -- some of the growth coming and flowing into our top line, it will flow down to the bottom line as well.Our next question is from Fatima Boolani with UBS. Please proceed. -- Good morning, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the questions. I had one for Gil and one for Tal. Gil, you were super helpful in outlining the initiatives for calendar '20 -- in the focus areas for calendar '20. But I did note the emphasis is still on reenergizing if you will, your network security, your product business. So can you help us think about what sort of sales compensation or sales incentive structures you're going to bring into place, that both incentivize adoption of some of your newer solutions, like the CloudGuard family, as well as the traditional network security in the Gateway portfolio? -- First, that the product and the network security portfolio is still the majority of the of the revenues and the activities. So clearly, the salespeople are focused to bring those numbers. Actually, we need to incentivize them to invest in the new areas, where we believe it's very-very important for strategically -- and with the mind share and for building the future revenue streams, and yet they account only for a small portion today of the total revenues, and even -- and I think that's where it comes to play.So I think we do build the incentive programs and we have incentive programs to help invest. As I mentioned earlier for an earlier question, the main job is not about the the commission plans or the incentive programs, the main one is management every day that every salesperson and every sales engineer and every manager in the field should know how to balance their act between supporting and growing the network security business, and creating new business on the total security platform. We're finishing a decade now and I didn't talk much about that. But if you remember where we started the decade, we started the decade with gateway platforms that were -- I wouldn't say basically, we are very rich for that era, for a decade ago, but we started with a Software Blade platform, and what we aim to do is consolidate many technologies into the gateway and make the gateway a much bigger security platform and support that with the new business model, that was the Software Blades model.10 years later, you can see that we've actually achieved that. I mean in the network security business, the gateways are unified. The gateway is a big platform. Our software blades business, or what we call it now the subscription business, already surpassed the new product business. So that's a huge achievement from that point. We built them business with more than $600 million in revenues. Big part of it is the additional security services on top of it, and we really created a consolidation on the gateway.I am really glad, because when we look into the next decade, I think what we are trying to build now with Infinity, is the next platform that will go beyond the gateway and will bring something with the same principles to the entire network security landscape, having the cloud as the first priority, but also the IoT and other spaces in that space. I really like to hope if we look forward 10 years from now, we will see Check Point building such a platform beyond just the network security field, and extending it to the bigger, bigger cyber security landscape, providing the same kind of consolidation and unification.Our next question is from Daniel Ives with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed. -- Yeah, thanks. So as you think about the cloud transition, when you look at your current product portfolio versus let's just say, potential acquisition, just how are you thinking about it buy versus build, in terms of just cloud and going after the 2020 opportunity there? -- I think, first, we have today a very-very rich cloud platform, including all the key elements. The cloud virtual servers, the multicloud management, private cloud, public cloud, cloud workload, cloud SaaS security as a service or security for software as a service, actually multiple Ss there. A cloud provided security, like the CloudGuard Connect and the SD-WAN solution that's included with that. So I think we've built a very strong platform. I think the core of the platform is built by us, it's based on our threat cloud, and now in Infinity NEXT, which is brand new technology platform for delivering security, from what we call a cloud brain.Inside that, we have a lot of technologies and the lot of places, where we can augment it with acquisition. And I think just this year, we made three acquisitions or just in 2019, we completed three acquisitions in the cloud space for serverless functions, for a -- web services on the cloud, which is very important, at the beginning of the year. And IoT which is -- while it's not cloud, the security is delivered from the cloud, and using that cloud to deliver security. And that's on top of what we've done in 2018 for the cloud management with Dome9.So I think we will continue to look for more opportunities we will. I think as I mentioned before, we are -- we want to secure now at least 50 type of assets, many of them -- more than 20 types of these assets are workloads on the cloud, and the nano agent that we will put into them is sometimes made by us, sometimes it's a combination of something made by Check Point and new technologies that are being acquired, and we will continue to look in all those spaces. Our next question is from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed. -- Thanks. Tal, billings that missed consensus numbers, I'm just curious for this year, how we should be thinking about billings? Is it something you pay attention to you, or how we should think about that? As that remains a key metric that many investors are focused on? -- We don't report billing. The reason is, that it can fluctuate easily as you've seen this year, very clearly, or between some quarters, because billing has two effects. If you invoice multi-year, you will have an upside on the billing, and if you had a great deal, but you're invoiced monthly or annually, then you won't see feel it. So we're very careful on that, well we look at it as a run rate.Now rightfully, you're right, the P&L reflects the run rate and the right way with a single-digit, and we aspire to increase it significantly. But the guidance is aiming for single-digit as well at this point, because of the transition between the products and the cloud products into subscription and the Infinity, which is annual versus multiyear and so on. So the guidance remains in this level, and like you will say it can have upside or downside, but that's where we are at this point of time.Our next question is from Gregg Moskowitz, Mizuho. Please proceed. -- Thank you very much. First just a high level question for Gil, how would you characterize [Technical Issues]? -- Could you repeat that, because you were sounding very weak, the sound. -- Hi, Gil. Just any better? -- Yes, much better. Much better -- Terrific. Sorry, about that. So just a high level question, I was wondering how you would characterize demand for physical firewalls as well as the virtual today versus six to 12 months ago? -- It's hard for me to say. Some of the shift in attention in every organization does go to new platforms. By the way, I was surprised last week when I surveyed partners to some of their priorities for 2020. I was expecting to hear, all have cloud on their agenda, but I was expecting to hear more cloud and I heard more about IoT and SD WAN connectivity. So there are multiple levels of interest, not just cloud. I think the demand for gateway and physical network security remains pretty stable. I'm not sure if it means the small increases, small decreases, but stable. Our next question is from Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. -- Thanks. Gil And Tal, I'd just like to press a little bit on the Q1 in 2020 revenue growth guidance of 3%. Gil, you described it as conservative, but throughout this call you and Tal have mentioned on a few occasions, this mix shift from product to subscription, which should put a little bit of pressure on growth. Tal, you mentioned not assuming some of the chunky deals that you closed in the middle of last year. So given those comments I would have expected your revenue guidance to be a little bit lower. So 3% is about what it has been frankly in the last several quarters. So there must be some positive offset to these sources of revenue growth pressure? Maybe you could outline what one or two of those that might be. Thank you. -- First, my aim is to much higher growth rate. I think the combination in for -- is again, some of what's happening in the marketplace, some is the shift in the businesses, some of the investment in new areas, that are still fairly small. I think at the end of the day, we take all the data that we have. We balance it, and the and we got to the numbers that we got. My goal and the sales goal is to try and create business again, no matter how you measure it. If you measure it on the revenue side or you measure on other amounts that will generate at least that with amount of growth. Tal? -- Again I will do my part in the sense of the balancing. So first, you're right. I'm seeing like the last few quarters. I see the 3%. You're right, when the products are negative, the support is under pressure, therefore it's is going down as well. But we see the outlook for you on the CPX and the salespeople what they feel about next year, and the partners that we met in the CPX. So I think when you look at the full year, then we expect to see some changes already in the second half of the year. I don't see it tomorrow. You're right. It will take some time. But this is like balance do you can be -- if the product transition to the cloud will be faster, then you right, there will be much more pressure than you thought of the guidance. But if you will see, products is picking up because of the execution of the partners and the field in the network area, then you might see an upside. And that's why we have a range.Our next question is from Brian Essex with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. -- Hi good morning and thank you for taking the question. Tal, I was wondering if I could ask you a little bit more about last quarter, I believe you noted that sales cycles are lengthening, particularly as you transition from more product to annuity-type revenue. How are you seeing the backlog evolving? And maybe a Part B of that question, sales and marketing, it continues to accelerate maybe faster than revenue growth. Is there a point where you see maybe an inflection point in the backlog, where you might get more sales and marketing leverage? And how are you measuring incremental dollars of sales and marketing spend in that light? -- I think Gil can say his part. The way I look at it is, it's not yet in this level. First, we would like to see, the pipeline is growing and the execution is improving and to see that booking increasing and then translating into the P&L. Once you get there and you see the pipeline is growing, you will see the measurement per salesperson are improving and then you can talk about leveraging.But two things are clear, the opportunities out there. The cloud opportunity is opening. We see our cloud numbers are increasing significantly. We see our Infinity and number of deals are increasing significantly. We see when we close an Infinity deal, the annual value is increasing between tens of percentage to hundreds of percentage. So the opportunities are there. Well, we need to start seeing it, building into a significant amount in order to to balance the reduction that you see in the product. And that's what we are looking for on the next year, specifically in Americas. -- Got it. Very helpful. Maybe I could just do a quick follow-up on M&A activity. Is your pipeline building? Are you looking at more activity out there, or are things just -- valuation expectations just too inflated at this point? -- We always look at many-many opportunities. You see, this is actually -- the conversion rate was high, because we converted three opportunities into acquisitions. So that I think is the most we purchased actually in one year, or if you look at 12 months from December to December, we actually had four, because last year it was in December as well, if I remember the deal. So, we see more acquisition, and then it depends on what we see. If we see good opportunity, we will seize it, definitely.Our next question is from Shaul Eyal with Oppenheimer. Please proceed. -- Thank you. Hi. Good afternoon guys. Gil. I know that in prior quarters, and probably throughout 2019, the main focus from a hiring perspective was senior personnel, mostly in the US. But I wonder what the status of sales leadership is in Europe and other any changes or planned additions? -- I don't want to give too much from a competitive standpoint to all the searches and all the position we are looking. But we're looking for good people all over the world. By the way we are looking for good people also at all levels, at every level, it's important. And we do have several -- and by the way, when you look at the sales in the world, I mean, we look at the total results and what the total percentage. This varies a lot we have regions within the U.S., that demonstrated very nice success and very high growth rates. We have region within or countries within Europe and Asia and Latin America that demonstrated their very nice growth rate, and we have the opposite example. So I mean it's not uniform. The percentage which looking for is far from representing the run rate of every every single geography that we have.So yes, we have several countries and several geographies that we are looking to strengthen our leadership, in particularly specific areas. And we're looking for good personnel, especially in the field and in sales all over the world and always.Our next question is from Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please proceed. -- Hi. A question I guess split for Gil and Tal here. On the new appliances, you've gone through these releases a number of times and even gone through the process of deferring more of the revenue into subscription. So I'm wondering, Gil, as you look at the new appliance releases and how customers may adopt them, there is always this potential trade off of of buying cheaper boxes that have better throughput. How would you compare this release to priors? And then Tal, could you help us understand, just from a mechanical perspective, what the increased deferral rates are on the new appliances, with the subscription attach? -- So the general direction I'm looking for and we yet again don't want to pre-launch anything, is to give more security value with each appliance we have. I think we need to spend for the best security. We tried last week the models when we sold the basic boxes and multiple options for different level of security. To tell you the truth, I don't think that's necessarily the right approach. Our approach should be to stand for the highest level of security, to always protect against Gen 5 security, to deliver to our customers, what we believe is right, which is the highest level of security, then we can choose to activate it, renew it, and so on. But my approach would be to give more and more security services inside the gateway that we provide. It has -- again, accounting implications from calculating deferred value of the appliance and the subscription service. I think its a little bit too early to say what they are, because there is a lot of moving parts in that, like what will be the ongoing cost of the subscription after that and so on. But my aim is to provide the highest level of subscription, the highest level of security, and then to provide very competitive subscription rates for future years.Our next question is from Sterling Auty with JP Morgan. Please proceed. -- Yeah, thanks. Hi guys. Just wondering with the investments that you made, can you give us a sense of what the total sales and marketing headcount finished 2019 versus where it finished 2018? -- In general, its increasing a few percentage. Average versus average, it was 7% or 8%. The actual number we didn't provide, we will provide it as part of the [Indecipherable]. -- And by the way, most of the change wasn't year-end to year-end, but was throughout the year. Because last year we have actually, in the end of Q4, we accelerated hiring. -- Yeah.We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Kip, for closing remarks. -- Thank you guys all for joining us today. We had a plane to jump for one of us, so we are going to have to cut it just slightly early today. But we look forward to seeing you throughout the quarter, and have a great day. Take care.[Operator Closing Remarks]. --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --

  released uninspiring fourth-quarter results, and management expects low-single-digit revenue growth to continue in 2020. But the cybersecurity specialist's performance could improve in the medium term thanks to its cloud business. According to a study from Mordor Intelligence, the cybersecurity market Check Point addresses is poised to grow 14.5% annually by 2025. In comparison, the company's recent results look much less exciting. During the fourth quarter, revenue increased by only 3.5% year over year to $543.8 million. And because its research and development and sales and marketing expenses grew faster than revenue, operating income even decreased by 0.4%. In addition, the outlook doesn't show any sign of acceleration: Based on the midpoint of guidance, management expects revenue to increase by 2.8% in 2020.That growth rate looks even weaker when compared to some cloud-based security players. For instance, the endpoint security company  and the identity management specialist  grew their last-quarter revenue by 98% and 45%, respectively, compared to last year.Behind these flattish results, the details reveal a contrasted situation. The company's products and licenses segment, which includes revenue from legacy firewalls and gateways that protect on-premises computing infrastructures, declined to $157.9 million, down 1.7% year over year. But security subscriptions, which include cloud-based cybersecurity solutions and software attached to legacy products, more than offset that decline with $163.7 million of revenue, up 11.6% year over year. The company's most recent offerings, such as CloudGuard (cloud-based solutions that protect against advanced threats) and Infinity (a unified platform for cybersecurity across all networks and clouds), contributed to the strong growth of subscriptions.Besides these two segments, Check Point's software updates and maintenance business, which partly depends on the company's products and licenses segment, still represents an important part of total revenue with $222.2 million during the last quarter. Thus, given their relatively large contribution to total revenue, legacy businesses will keep on offsetting the higher growth of Check Point's cloud-based activities over the next several quarters.Image source: Getty Images.The way subscriptions are recognized as revenue also contributes to the company's low revenue growth. When selling hardware that will run over several years, Check Point receives large upfront payments that are immediately recognized as revenue. In contrast, the company's new businesses such as CloudGuard and Infinity generate annual revenue in the form of subscriptions.This accounting trick makes year-over-year revenue growth comparisons challenging as the company is transitioning from products to subscriptions. But since upfront payments should represent a diminishing part of total revenue, this headwind should wane over the medium term, which should boost revenue growth.In addition, management indicated during the  that it was still looking for acquisitions to enhance its new offerings. And Check Point has the dry powder to execute this strategy: Thanks to its high operating margin (44.2% in 2019), the company has accumulated $4.0 billion of cash and equivalents, without debt.Besides, Check Point can take advantage of its large customer base -- more than 100,000 organizations of all sizes -- to scale its acquisitions. For instance, following its purchase of Protego in 2019, it will integrate the start-up's serverless security technology (which protects some cloud-based services) into its Infinity platform.As a result, the double-digit revenue growth of its expanding cloud-based cybersecurity portfolio should boost the company's performance over the medium term. And assuming no major misstep, there's no reason for the company's revenue growth not to get closer to the double-digit growth of the cybersecurity market in the next few years.Based on its -to-sales ratio of 7.8, Check Point's stock doesn't seem attractive, even if you assume a higher revenue growth in a couple of years. But this ratio doesn't take into account the company's low expenses that command its impressive operating margin.Based on the midpoint of guidance, the market values the company at 20.3 times its forecasted earnings under generally accepted accounting principles (), which looks a bit rich given its low revenue growth. But you should keep in mind this ratio ignores the $4.0 billion of cash on Check Point's balance sheet, which represents an important part of the company's $17.4 billion market capitalization. And if you assume revenue growth acceleration over the medium term, Check Point seems fairly valued.Thus, given the context of lofty valuations of high-growth non-profitable , Check Point represents an interesting alternative for investors looking for exposure to the cybersecurity market at a reasonable price.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''.  These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand.  Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).  Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

"Legendary investor Warren Buffett advises to be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful.  One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100.  A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.

In trading on Tuesday, shares of Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd.  (Symbol: CHKP) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 29.9, after changing hands as low as $107.81 per share.  By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) is 33.0.  A bullish investor could look at CHKP's 29.9 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.    The chart below shows the one year performance of CHKP shares:

"Investors in Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd.  (Symbol: CHKP) saw new options become available this week, for the March 20th expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CHKP options chain for the new March 20th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $115.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.20.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $115.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $111.80 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CHKP, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $115.95/share today.

Because the $115.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 57%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.78% return on the cash commitment, or 18.15% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.


Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd. , and highlighting in green where the $115.00 strike is located relative to that history:


   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $120.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.30.  If an investor was to purchase shares of CHKP stock at the current price level of $115.95/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $120.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.48% if the stock gets called away at the March 20th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CHKP shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd. , as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing CHKP's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $120.00 strike highlighted in red:



   
Considering the fact that the $120.00 strike represents an approximate 3% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 65%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.98% boost of extra return to the investor, or 12.94% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.


The implied volatility in the put contract example is 23%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 22%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $115.95) to be 19%.

After shuttering its service, Baidu took on a similar mantle in the Chinese market and economy, bolstering its search advertising business as it added services like mobile search, online wallets, maps, music, encyclopedias, news, social media and online community tools.Started in 2000 by Robin Li, its current CEO, Baidu was founded on two principles: simplicity and reliability. Also, its name is an allusion to a Song dynasty poem written more than 800 years ago, the literal meaning of the word being ""hundreds of times,"" a representation of a continuous striving toward the ideal. Such cultural cornerstones help explain how it climbed to its marketing-leading position.Perhaps not a household name, NVIDIA () is a near-legendary brand in video gaming and various tech sectors. As a leading producer of graphics units, NVIDIA has revolutionized digital technologies in several ways, with business in artificial intelligence, self-driving cars, robotics, entertainment, and much more. In fact, in 2019 it was ranked as the No. 1 most innovative company in AI by Fast Company.NVIDIA is basically responsible for the life-like graphics you see in video games and other computing applications, having invented the graphics processing unit (GPU) in 1999, a technology it continues to reinvent today with real-time graphics.Apart from its achievements in business, NVIDIA has also received recognition for its support of environmental, social and governance goals. Barron's annually ranks the 1,000 largest publicly traded companies on ESG factors, and NVIDIA made the top 100 in 2019.Modeling software has been a boon for architects, engineers, product designers, construction firms, public planners, animators and other professionals. And they can thank Autodesk (), a pioneer in computer-aided design (CAD), for the tools that help them create the things they envision.With tens of products across various industries, Autodesk has helped continually innovate new solutions for designing needs. It was recognized for this pedigree of pushing the envelope when it was ranked No. 15 by  on its list of the most innovative companies in the world. Today, besides solutions for construction, civil engineering and entertainment, Autodesk is also working in the Internet of Things, 3D printing and other emerging technologies.Autodesk has had to contend with upheaval in the software market — shifting from licensing-based sales of boxed solutions to recurring revenue through cloud computing subscriptions — but has come out in pole position.Data is the lifeblood of business today, and Verisk Analytics () lives in the numbers, helping deliver insights that drive corporate decision-making. An analytics company that focuses on the insurance, financial, and energy and specialty markets, Verisk leverages its unique data sets and extensive domain expertise to provide risk assessment, intelligent compliance and predictive analytics, among other products and services.Verisk's data assets are deep, allowing it to mine billions of insurance policy transactions and trillions in consumer spending for insights. Hundreds of subject matter experts in fields like commodity analytics and GIS mapping contribute to the vast experience of the company, as does CEOForbes in 2019.While technology has led to many social and economic gains, the new digital world is also one rife with cybercrime. With threats lurking around every online corner, organizations need rock-solid defenses to protect their data and reputations. Enter Check Point Software Technologies (), a leading provider of diverse cybersecurity products.Check Point has garnered international recognition in its nearly 30 years of operation, having grown, matured and innovated alongside the wider world of tech. Check Point has collected awards and recognition for its performance in cybersecurity from the likes of Gartner, Forrester, IDC and various other publications. Most recently, it won the Security Innovation of the Year category in the 2018-2019 Cloud Awards for its CloudGuard Dome9 platform.Founded in Israel with U.S. headquarters in Silicon Valley, the company's sights are trained on combating the fifth generation of cyberattacks.These days, surgeons need a steady hand not only when using a scalpel themselves but also when operating robotic surgical equipment. Such technology has become commonplace in the operating room, if not entirely essential to the success of some advanced procedures. In those terms, Intuitive Surgical () is helping to revolutionize health care while also improving patient outcomes and safety.Founded in 1995, Intuitive builds the da Vinci system, which since its launch in 1999 has defined and advanced intelligent surgery, helping develop minimally invasive procedures. In 24 years of operation, more than six million minimally invasive surgeries have been completed and nearly 5,000 da Vinci systems installed worldwide.Intuitive, like Verisk, is also well-equipped at the helm to navigate the monumental shifts and opportunities in health care: Its CEO, Gary Guthart, was ranked as the No. 14 most innovative leader in America in 2019 in the same Forbes list.Combined, these innovative companies along with the FAANGs, represent just over 1/10th of the Nasdaq-100.

"Investors in Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd.  (Symbol: CHKP) saw new options become available this week, for the February 2020 expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CHKP options chain for the new February 2020 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $110.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.85.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $110.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $107.15 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CHKP, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $111.85/share today.

Because the $110.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 61%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.59% return on the cash commitment, or 16.03% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.


Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd. , and highlighting in green where the $110.00 strike is located relative to that history:


   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $115.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.55.  If an investor was to purchase shares of CHKP stock at the current price level of $111.85/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $115.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.10% if the stock gets called away at the February 2020 expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CHKP shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd. , as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing CHKP's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $115.00 strike highlighted in red:



   
Considering the fact that the $115.00 strike represents an approximate 3% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 61%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.28% boost of extra return to the investor, or 14.10% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.


The implied volatility in the put contract example, as well as the call contract example, are both approximately 22%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $111.85) to be 19%.

There’s a new buzzword in the world of computer security.  is a term coined by (NYSE:) to describe a world where users routinely work outside their company’s firewall but must be protected from threats nonetheless.	The whole industry is jumping on SASE. Few more so than s (NYSE:), which plummeted 10% recently on what many termed .Palo Alto’s SASE offering is called , and the company is advertising that .But has it? Can it? That’s the debate that is beginning right now, and on it hinges the future of PANW stock.Palo Alto is telling anyone who will listen that Prisma Access makes it perfectly , warning that enterprises aren’t ready for the new threats, but PANW is.Shlomo Kramer of privately held — also a co-founder of  (NASDAQ:) — insists that not only has Palo Alto not built a , but it can’t.It can’t, he says, because PANW is wedded to the idea of network appliances, at some arbitrary network edge, and the idea that there is a boundary between internal and external networks. He dismisses Palo Alto’s effort this way. “This isn’t SASE, this is someone else’s appliance stuck in the cloud.”Industry analyst Richard Stiennon agrees. He calls Palo Alto’s effort “marketecture,” virtual instances of the company’s existing firewall spun into data centers with traffic routed to them by hardware .The criticism of industry experts — combined with embarrassment — is hitting Palo Alto shares. A breach in Palo Alto’s own network leaked personal data on seven current .  The data was apparently leaked in February, by an external contractor.Palo Alto’s financial results, , show a loss of $59.6 million, or 62 cents per diluted share, on revenue of almost $772 million. Revenue was up nearly 18% from a year ago. The company projects revenue for the next quarter, between $838 million and $848 million, that will show similar growth.But here’s the problem for Palo Alto, and indeed for all cybersecurity stocks. The challenges of the field are constantly changing. This requires constant investment in the business, often ahead of revenue, as in this case. PANW continues to lose money and, while the losses had been declining, it’s now on pace to lose close to 2017’s $2.39 per share if it can’t turn things around. Thus, there is much at stake in the SASE debate.Even assuming Palo Alto hasn’t completely cracked the SASE code, neither have its competitors. Cato Networks, which says it has cracked it by starting from a clean sheet of paper, is still privately held. All of Palo Alto’s main competitors, like  (NASDAQ:) and  (NASDAQ:), are using some version of the same next-generation firewall technology Palo Alto has.Computer security demands constant investment by customers, companies and investors. The problem for investors is that it’s hard to turn that investment into profit at the bleeding edge, where Palo Alto works. Companies behind that edge, including profitable companies like  (NASDAQ:) and  (NASDAQ:), are still spinning on the SASE challenge.The approach to network security may have to change in response to SASE as Gartner has described it. No company can do business entirely within its own firewalls. Palo Alto’s current approach may be inadequate. But the company is big enough to improve on it, and it may be the best choice many customers have.This SASE misstep, while a blow, is unlikely to be fatal to Palo Alto Networks.  is a financial and technology journalist.

'  third-quarter earnings came in slightly above expectations. The legacy cybersecurity vendor posted modest year-over-year revenue growth and flat earnings per share, but the company's unexciting results hide its medium-term growth potential. And given its reasonable valuation, Check Point could turn into an attractive investment.Since some studies estimate the cybersecurity market will grow at an annual rate above 11% over the next several years, Check Point's third-quarter results look weak.Revenue increased by only 4% year over year and reached $491.4 million, slightly above the midpoint of management's guidance range of $480 million to $500 million. Earnings per share reported under generally accepted accounted principles () reached the top of the guidance at $1.25 but stayed flat year over year. And the midpoint of management's revenue guidance for next quarter of $542 million corresponds to modest 3.6% year-over-year revenue growth.The company is facing the secular decline of its products and licenses segment, in which it sells licenses for its legacy hardware firewalls. During the third quarter, this segment declined 2.4% year over year.But Check Point is transitioning from one-off licenses to subscriptions. More and more, customers pay recurring fees to use a growing part of the company's portfolio, versus a single large upfront payment. As a result, Check Point's revenue from subscriptions increased by 12.9% during the third quarter. This strong performance also highlights the company's growth in its cloud offerings which include Threat Extraction protection, CloudGuard Solutions, and Infinity; all of which are billed in the form of subscriptions. But this transition also contributes to the company's low total revenue growth in the short term since it involves giving up large immediate revenue in exchange for revenue that will spread over several years.During the third quarter, revenue from the company's subscription business of $153.9 million largely exceeded that of its products and licenses segment of $118.2 million. Over time, the negative impact of revenue from the company's products and licenses segment will diminish, which will boost Check Point's top line. Besides, the current quarter's 8% increase in , a leading indicator of revenue growth, highlights the company's potential over the medium term. Image source: Getty Images.Despite Check Point's modest third-quarter revenue growth, GAAP net income dropped to $187.9 million, down 5.2% year over year. And GAAP operating income, which excludes the impact of taxes and interest, decreased by 5.4%. Albeit lower compared to last year, the company's third-quarter GAAP operating and net margins of 43.6% and 38.3%, respectively, remain impressive. In contrast, many high-growth cybersecurity companies such as , , or  have been posting GAAP losses over the last several years.Check Point's lower sales and marketing (S&M) expenses as a percentage of revenue -- 28% during Q3 compared to 45%+ for many competitors -- explain its higher profitability. But that also corresponds to the low revenue growth the company has been reporting. Several quarters ago, Check Point's management recognized it  to boost revenue growth. However, executives noted during the last  that the increase in S&M expenses to reorganize the sales force would pay off over several quarters, which means operating margins won't improve in the short term.Thus, investors should keep an eye on Check Point's S&M expenses. Over the medium term, the company's sales reorganization should translate into revenue growth and it should sustain its impressive operating margin above its current level of 43.6%. Higher revenue growth coupled with improving operating margin will boost Check Point's profits.At Check Point's current valuation, the market doesn't price in much growth. Given the company's low revenue growth, its -to-sales ratio of 7.6 -- in line with its high-growth peers -- looks pricey. But you should consider its huge profit margin. With Check Point's full-year GAAP earnings per share based on the midpoint of the next-quarter's guidance, Check Point's  stands at a moderate 20.2 at the time of this writing. Moreover, the P/E ratio doesn't take into account Check Point's large cash position of $4.06 billion, with no debt.Thus, given Check Point's reasonable valuation and its potential growth, investors should consider it as an attractive  over the medium term.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''.  These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand.  Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).  Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

  has turned out to be an underwhelming cybersecurity bet in 2019 when compared to its more illustrious peers.  have hampered Check Point's momentum, while the company's safety-first approach in a cutthroat cybersecurity industry has also dented its prospects. data by .But things are changing for the better at Check Point Software. Its software-based revenue is ticking up and the company has taken steps to supercharge its growth in the long run. In fact, it wouldn't be surprising to see Check Point becoming  in the future. Here are three reasons why you should consider going long Check Point stock.Image source: Getty Images.You can see in the chart above that Check Point's top-line growth has been tepid. The story was no different in the company's fiscal 2019 Q3 results: Revenue increased just 4% year over year to $491 million. But the more important thing to note was that Check Point's  grew at a much faster pace of 8% year over year to $1.24 billion.Deferred revenue is the money collected by a company in advance for services that will be rendered at a later date. The deferred revenue amount sits on a company's balance sheet as a liability when it is collected, and moves to the income statement once the actual delivery of services takes place. So deferred revenue gives us an idea of where a company's business is headed, especially if it is involved in selling subscriptions.The fact that Check Point's deferred revenue is outpacing its actual revenue growth means that the company is signing up more subscription customers. The numbers show that's exactly what happened in the third quarter. Check Point's subscription business clocked 13% year over year growth to $153.9 million, thanks to an uptick in the adoption of its cloud solutions.The security subscription business now accounts for just over 31% of Check Point Software's total revenue, compared to 29% in the prior-year period. Meanwhile, revenue from software updates and maintenance also increased slightly on a year-over-year basis to $218.7 million. The growth of these software-centric businesses was enough to help Check Point offset the decline in its products and licenses segment.More importantly, the company enjoyed much higher margin in the security subscription business. The cost of revenue in this segment was just $6 million as compared to nearly $21 million in the products and licenses business. So the software business is generating higher revenue at a much lower cost base for Check Point when compared to the legacy business of selling products and licenses.This is great news for Check Point, as the security subscription business still has a lot of room for growth.Check Point Software has been  in a highly competitive cybersecurity market, but that's changing now. It looks like the higher margin of its subscription business has encouraged the company to go on the offensive as far as spending on marketing and research and development is concerned.Check Point's research and development expenses increased 20% year over year while selling and marketing expenses rose nearly 10.5%. Both of these metrics outpaced the company's actual revenue growth. In fact, Check Point has stepped up its investment in both of these line items in the past year or so, and the positive impact is visible on the company's subscription growth. data by .The company is now looking to get into lucrative cybersecurity niches as well. Check Point recently announced the acquisition of Internet of Things (IoT)-focused cybersecurity start-up Cymplify. Check Point will integrate Cymplify's expertise into its Infinity cybersecurity architecture so that clients can protect their IoT devices -- such as smart TVs, medical devices, and IP cameras -- against cyberattacks.This should open up a big growth opportunity for Check Point because according to , cybersecurity is the fastest-growing IoT niche. The firm predicts that the IoT data security market will grow from $3 billion in revenue this year to $7 billion in 2022 as more original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) move to secure their IoT devices.Check Point Software's trailing  of 23 and forward earnings multiple of 19 are quite attractive by cybersecurity industry standards. data by .Given that Check Point is now looking to boost revenue through the higher-margin subscription business, the company should be able to deliver sustained earnings growth in the future.

"nvestors in Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd.  (Symbol: CHKP) saw new options become available this week, for the July 2020 expiration.  One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 241 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CHKP options chain for the new July 2020 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $115.00 strike price has a current bid of $6.60.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $115.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $108.40 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CHKP, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $117.25/share today.

Because the $115.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 60%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.74% return on the cash commitment, or 8.69% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.


Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd. , and highlighting in green where the $115.00 strike is located relative to that history:


   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $120.00 strike price has a current bid of $7.60.  If an investor was to purchase shares of CHKP stock at the current price level of $117.25/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $120.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 8.83% if the stock gets called away at the July 2020 expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CHKP shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd. , as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing CHKP's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $120.00 strike highlighted in red:



   
Considering the fact that the $120.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 49%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.48% boost of extra return to the investor, or 9.82% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.


The implied volatility in the put contract example, as well as the call contract example, are both approximately 23%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $117.25) to be 21%.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''.  These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand.  Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).  Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

"ybersecurity is one of the fastest-growing segments of the technology industry. As more people around the globe connect to the internet and hundreds of millions of devices get connected to a network every year, the need to keep all of that data secure is on the rise.In fact, according to research firm  Insights, cybersecurity is expected to go from a $120 billion-a-year endeavor in 2017 to more than $300 billion in 2024, good for an average 12% annual growth rate. It's no wonder, then, that so many businesses are getting in on the movement. Old tech titans like , , and  all offer cybersecurity as part of their service suites. Other names are investing in the action, too. Old smartphone maker  , for example, bought small cybersecurity outfit Cylance in early 2019 to further its transformation as a software company.Image source: Getty Images.As the world goes digital, managing new digital-first business operations and keeping information safe and secure will continue to evolve and grow in importance. For those wanting to invest in the cybersecurity industry, researching the biggest names in the business is a good place to get started (after ). Here are the 10 largest companies that make cybersecurity their primary concern based on  (the value of the company calculated by number of shares outstanding multiplied by price per share).Data as of July 23, 2019. Data source: YCharts and company-specific investor relations.""Cybersecurity"" is the umbrella term, but there are different types of security firms tackling various problems in today's connected age.For example, the larger outfits have been angling themselves to cover a wide range of needs, becoming one-stop security shops. Palo Alto Networks and Fortinet are two such companies, covering everything from firewalls (a network feature, sometimes a piece of hardware but more often software, that decides what data to let in and out) to artificial intelligence-based software that automates tasks and monitors an organization's digital activity.These companies focus on securing remote devices connected to a network. The number of devices hooked up to the internet has been , and that trend is expected to continue. Businesses are leading the charge, and everything from employee smartphones and tablets to assets in transit to connected machinery is in need of safekeeping. Endpoint protection software handles that specific need. Startup , among others, is a specialist in this space.These niche companies include Okta, which provides privileged-access management -- basically, only allowing users access to the sensitive data that they're supposed to see. Then there's security for , or computing and software that is offered remotely by way of a data center. Zscaler concerns itself with keeping cloud connections and data safe for businesses and organizations.Regardless of the security need, digital-based operations and communications are on the rise across the board, which means all of the top cybersecurity companies are experiencing growth of some sort. That creates an opportunity for investors to cash in on the movement. Here is a breakdown of each of the top cybersecurity companies and how their stocks are valued.Sitting atop the cybersecurity pure-play list is Palo Alto Networks. The company has built itself into the leader in the security space, offering a broad range of services for its customers from firewalls to automated threat response to cloud security. The largest player in the cybersecurity niche by market cap, Palo Alto has managed to outpace the industry's average growth rate in spite of its size.Part of the story behind Palo Alto's growth is the company's acquisition spree of smaller competitors. In May 2019, the company announced its intent to purchase , one for $410 million and the other for a smaller undisclosed sum. Both were added to a new cloud security service segment called Prisma, aimed at continuously updating Palo Alto's offerings as needs of customers evolve over time. CEO Nikesh Arora, a former executive at 's   Google, has indicated that strategic acquisitions will continue to play an integral part in his company's strategy to remain relevant.The sums of money paid for acquisitions have been substantial (at least $1 billion spent since 2018), and they're among the reasons Palo Alto is not yet a profitable business. However, when backing out one-time nonrecurring expenses and noncash items, the company still manages to post positive  (money left over after basic operating expenses and ). In short, that means the company can afford its aggressive buying spree.The free cash flow generation is important, because it gives the leader in pure-play network security the wiggle room it needs to invest heavily in cloud computing, AI, and other technology as customer needs change over time. Global cloud spending is expected to grow an average of about 16% a year through 2022, according to technology research group . Sitting at the intersection of two double-digit growth industries, that long-term trend should give Palo Alto Networks an enduring outlet to sustain double-digit sales growth and help it maintain its pole position within the world of cybersecurity.Splunk started out as a . Its software suite allows organizations to analyze and make sense of information being generated from their digital systems, from websites to connected equipment to payment processing networks, among other things. If it's an electronic system, it creates data; and if it creates data, Splunk can help monitor it and give customers the ability to make sense of trends and other behavior of digital systems. Incidentally, one of the primary use cases for the data parsing and analytics platform is cybersecurity.To increase its capabilities in that department, Splunk has also embarked on an aggressive . As a result, the big data company is now a leader in the fast-growing security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) segment of the cybersecurity industry. SOAR utilizes artificial intelligence (a software system that mimics how the human brain works and learns and adapts to changing circumstances) to sift through information in real time, detect potential threats, and take action to keep things on lockdown. With data breaches a constant threat, the ability to automate aspects of the workload holds appeal for large organizations.Despite its size, Splunk has still been growing quickly. The downside is that Splunk is spending lots of cash to foster further expansion, which keeps the company in the red. Specifically, research and development of new software capabilities and sales and marketing to acquire new customers are the biggest line items affecting the bottom line. However, much like Palo Alto Networks, Splunk is free cash flow positive; profits will be a bigger consideration later on as the company matures.That's because Splunk's primary industry, big data analytics, should grow an average of 13% a year and surpass $274 billion in size by 2023 -- according to researcher IDC. Along the way, Splunk will also benefit from the booming and fast-changing cybersecurity industry, making it one of the best plays on the trend. The company's expertise in monitoring and making sense of large and complex sets of data particularly lends itself to keeping business information locked up, and its recent takeovers of smaller peers have helped bolster its position in network security. Splunk's prospects and chances at continued industry leadership look especially good.Check Point Software, as its name implies, offers software security along with hardware to keep business networks secure. Much like Palo Alto Networks, the company has a diversified mix of solutions covering on-premeses computer networks, cloud, and endpoint protection.Though it's one of the largest and oldest cybersecurity companies around (founded in 1993), Check Point has not been growing at the breakneck speed of some of its peers.  has been the norm for some time. The reason? New technologies like the cloud have made some of Check Point's legacy services like hardware-based security less compelling. The company is trailing some of its competitors, so spending to update the business model for today's security needs has been a top priority. It isn't paying off yet, and Check Point's sluggish pace could mean its younger peers will bypass it in the years ahead.There is one thing that makes Check Point different from other companies on this list, though. As an older, well-established company, it does turn a profit. Thus, traditional valuation metrics (without the need to make adjustments for things like , shares a company pays to employees as an extra perk) work for the stock. However, heavy spending to transform the business into a more relevant one for the times has the bottom line stuck in a rut. Until that changes, there's little compelling reason to consider the stock.Check Point has been working hard to update its offerings for more modern needs, but the sheer number of newer start-ups could mean this established cybersecurity business will continue to get disrupted. That's not an enviable situation to be in, especially when the industry overall is growing by double digits.Endpoint security company  after it had its  (sold shares to raise money, making it available to the general investing public for the first time) in June 2019. That easily puts the firm among the largest in the cybersecurity business by market cap.The stock has years' worth of double-digit sales growth baked into it, but momentum could be on CrowdStrike's side. Revenues more than doubled in 2018. The number of connected devices around the globe is increasing every year -- by the hundreds of millions -- which plays right into the hands of this security company and its endpoint-protection software suite. Since many of those devices are not tethered to an office or other physical location, CrowdStrike's cloud computing-native system lends itself to this type of security particularly well.Because it is cloud based, CrowdStrike also boasts the ability to make near-instant system updates when a threat is detected, and its software can learn and adapt from uploaded customer data. Paired with millions of new connections getting added to an internet-connected network every year, it adds up to lots of new customer sign-ups and expanding relationships with existing ones. Dollar-based net expansion (which measures how much money existing clients spend each year) has been over 100% for years, indicating customers spend more with CrowdStrike as time passes. It's a powerful business model, one that CrowdStrike plans on putting to use in other security disciplines as it begins to expand beyond endpoint security. With the cloud and the number of endpoints increasing dramatically, it's no wonder this stock is off to a hot start and looks like it has years' worth of growth left ahead of it.Another upstart security company, Okta has only been around since 2009, but the identity-protection specialist has been growing like a weed. The company ensures that employees and others with privileged access within an organization get connected to the apps and data they need -- and keeps everyone else out. The number of digital systems and software being utilized by organizations continues to rise, increasing the complexity and difficulty in keeping systems secure from intruders. Thus, the need for Okta's identity services has been booming.In just a few years' time, Okta has become one of the largest cybersecurity pure plays around, with sales consistently growing north of 50% in the past. Management expects that trajectory will moderate to somewhere in the mid-30% range for the foreseeable future -- still nothing to balk at. And that rate of expansion could be sustainable, too. According to the Global Market Insights cybersecurity report, identity, authentication, and access management services are expected to be an especially fast-growing subset of cybersecurity, with the potential for services to increase an average of 17% a year through 2024. At the forefront of the movement, Okta is primed to gobble up market share as identity and access management increases in importance.Here's the downside: Okta is not a profitable business as of this writing. The company is funneling cash into marketing and research to maximize its sales growth now. Profits will be a concern later. The good news, though, is that gross profit margin (the amount of money the company keeps after producing a service and then selling it but before paying other operating expenses) is on the rise as the company grows.That bodes well for the future of this cybersecurity leader. Identity security/privileged data access rights is expected to be a high-growth segment of network security for the next few years, and Okta is a leader in the space.Another diversified provider of firewalls, cloud and endpoint security, and identity management, Fortinet took a hit amid worries that the trade war between the U.S. and China would dampen growth in the company's important international markets -- Asia and Europe specifically. Newer security upstarts have also disrupted some of Fortinet's legacy offerings like hardware-based network security for on-premises protection. Economic and industry headwinds or not, though, this cybersecurity outfit is doing just fine.Revenues and adjusted earnings were up 20% and 77%, respectively, in 2018. Fortinet has been adding dozens of new deals worth more than $1 million every quarter, winning customers over with its new and improved software suite aimed at keeping all parts of an organization safe. Although less aggressive in its acquisition strategy than Palo Alto Networks or Splunk, Fortinet continues to invest heavily in updating its offerings to keep its customers secure. The cloud has been an area of focus, as well as increasing the number of subscription-based software deals. The investments in new technology have been paying off and yielding results for shareholders, even as other legacy cybersecurity companies have been failing to make the cut.As a result of its less aggressive nature, Fortinet also runs a profitable business where some of its competitors don't -- and the bottom line has been rising faster than sales as the company's investments have started to yield results. Ample cash means this security business can continue to invest in its new high-octane segments like cloud, endpoint, and identity security, which bodes well for it being able to maintain its two-figure top-line growth rate for some time even as legacy lines of business fade. With a well-established presence in the industry and a successful business update strategy well underway and paying off, Fortinet is one of the best cybersecurity stocks around.Symantec is the world leader in cybersecurity services when using sales figures as the metric. With nearly $5 billion in revenue in the last year, it is nearly double the size of its younger peers like Palo Alto Networks. Yet despite Symantec's leadership, its market cap lags. One of the oldest network security players around and owner of recognizable software names like LifeLock and Norton Antivirus, Symantec has had to deal with disruption and shifting technology that have left growth near nonexistent and profitability underwhelming.Though Symantec has been updating its operations -- it recently announced a new comprehensive cloud-based security suite covering everything from email to application login protection -- results have been sluggish. Fiscal 2019 sales fell 2%. The company's legacy operations are holding it back, and bloated operating expenses have meant paltry bottom-line earnings. Not exactly what investors should be looking for from the leader of a high-flying industry.There could be hope of a rebound, though, as Symantec continues to work through its transition. Chipmaker  and was reportedly interested in acquiring the old security company to add it to its growing software division. However, negotiations fell through, and Symantec will have to go it alone for now. Until the company can demonstrate a strategy that can gain some traction in the growing world of cybersecurity, Symantec will continue to struggle in the wake of younger and more nimble peers that started investing earlier in the shifting landscape.The next security outfit on the list handles a different piece of the industry than any of the others covered thus far.  helps deliver and secure web content as it travels from its source to the end user, from live and streaming video to traditional web page text and pictures. The internet's continual expansion has been a boon for Akamai, which has launched new services to cover new web applications (like video streaming) and new mobile device types to keep the internet connection to them secure.Akamai's traditional web business is a low- to mid-single-digit growth story, but its newer cloud security services have been growing well into the double digits. New services are still a small fraction of the whole, but they are a high-margin endeavor. Akamai's bottom line has been getting a big double-digit boost as Akamai's investment and spending on new web delivery applications subside and past spending starts to yield results.Akamai has grown into one of the internet's primary content delivery platforms, responsible for handling as much as a third of global web traffic. As such, this company will be slower moving than other security businesses, but Akamai still has growth prospects ahead of it. Internet infrastructure company Cisco expects web traffic -- led by video content -- to grow an average of 26% a year through 2022. That means Akamai's newer business should continue to move the needle for some time; plus the overall operation is solidly in profitable territory. In short, the leading internet content delivery and security company should be a slow-and-steady play for the foreseeable future.Back to small but up-and-coming cybersecurity. Zscaler has its sights set on securing cloud computing and thus built itself from the ground up as a cloud-only software suite. The world is going mobile, and so are business operations. With fewer centralized locations and more remotely connected devices popping up, Zscaler helps keep newer business networks safe for its customers and their employees.With a business model similar to those of CrowdStrike and Okta, Zscaler plays in a new multibillion-dollar industry that will only continue to grow larger, and the company has been frank in saying it is all about maximizing growth right now. And no wonder, as Gartner says in its cloud research that annual spending will nearly double from 2018 to 2022 to more than $330 billion a year. Sales at Zscaler have been growing north of 60% year over year for some time, but what's a few hundred million in annual sales when the whole market is worth hundreds of billions? The downside is that in spite of massive growth and a rosy outlook for the good times to continue, operating losses are still substantial. With Zscaler all about nurturing sales as fast as possible, the red ink is unlikely to disappear anytime soon.Much like its start-up peers, though, Zscaler takes those losses by design as . Gross profit margin was an enviable 81% at last report, one of the best in the industry. With profit potential like that in a fast-expanding cloud computing sandbox, it makes sense Zscaler is all about growth now and profit later. With the world going mobile, this security stock looks like an especially promising one in the years ahead as it takes advantage of its early cloud-based security lead.F5 Networks provides hardware and software solutions that help companies keep their applications and app delivery secure. Similar to Akamai, the company's legacy business isn't exactly lighting the world on fire. However, newer services, particularly those aimed at cloud computing-based apps, are on a tear. To that end, F5 recently acquired app optimization and security peer NGINX for $670 million.It's a sizable sum but likely a prudent move for F5. The company has been reporting low-single-digit revenue growth the last few years -- nearly all of which has been driven by big expansion in its software service segment. While the top line has been sluggish, the upside is that new software and security offerings are a much more profitable concern. As a result, earnings are up nearly 40% over the last trailing three-year stretch.During its transition phase to more modern app security and delivery, F5's stock has taken a beating. There's worry that the transition will continue to be a bumpy one, thus making this stock among the cheapest in the cybersecurity industry. However, though the low valuation reflects the fact that F5 has fallen behind the curve in the digital age, F5 is an inexpensive play on digital security and delivery. With internet traffic and content delivery still a slow-and-steady endeavor, F5 can continue to thrive -- albeit at a much slower rate than elsewhere in cybersecurity.One of the smaller outfits in the security space, Proofpoint is worth a mention as a bonus number 11 on the top-10 list. The company specifically helps organizations keep their employees safe. Email attacks are a key pain point for many businesses, and securing communications in that department -- as well as on social media, cloud applications, and mobile devices -- is a specialty at Proofpoint.Though a niche offering within the greater cybersecurity industry, Proofpoint is expanding fast. After , management forecasted full-year 2019 revenue to be up at least another 22%. However, as with its high-powered sales-oriented peers, the company does run up big losses. As with many other cybersecurity plays we've been discussing, though, that's due to Proofpoint reinvesting in itself to foster more growth.Nevertheless, when we adjust the bottom line for one-time items and other noncash expenses, Proofpoint is free cash flow positive, a metric that has been steadily on the rise. That should help Proofpoint keep up its double-digit growth trajectory as employee access points via remote computers, smartphones, and other devices continue to boom in the States and especially overseas. It's a much smaller business than the top 10 companies are, but this cybersecurity concern still offers a compelling growth story worth keeping an eye on as it keeps communications safe and secure.Proofpoint will also likely see long-term benefit from the explosion in devices hooked up to a network in the years ahead. The workforce's increasing mobility means keeping employee communications on lockdown will be an increasingly complex problem, one that this small security company can help solve.Image source: Getty Images.Taking a high-level look at the biggest companies in the cybersecurity market is only the start to choosing an investment. Some of the stocks are buys, others not so much. As the industry is still in high-growth mode and adapting fast to technological developments, investors would be best off picking the companies posting the fastest revenue expansion rates and those that carry the highest gross profit margins. Click here for a discussion on the top cybersecurity stocks and an introduction on .Before investing, though, it's important to remember a few things. Though cybersecurity is one of the fastest-expanding industries around, with high growth expectations comes a high level of volatility. Stock prices can run higher very quickly -- and reverse course just as fast. Only investors who have a long-term perspective (no less than a few years) and the ability to purchase a position over time (buying a few shares at a time on a set schedule, like monthly, quarterly, or whenever the stock dips in price by at least double digits) should consider buying.For those with the time to wait, though, investing in cybersecurity should be a profitable endeavor. In a decade's time, this top-10 list will no doubt look very different, but a few of these names will still be around and will likely be much larger than they are today.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"nvestors in Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd.  (Symbol: CHKP) saw new options begin trading this week, for the December 20th expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CHKP options chain for the new December 20th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $100.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.50.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $100.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $98.50 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CHKP, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $107.89/share today.

Because the $100.00 strike represents an approximate 7% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 82%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.50% return on the cash commitment, or 9.27% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.


Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd. , and highlighting in green where the $100.00 strike is located relative to that history:


   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $110.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.10.  If an investor was to purchase shares of CHKP stock at the current price level of $107.89/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $110.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 4.83% if the stock gets called away at the December 20th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CHKP shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd. , as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing CHKP's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $110.00 strike highlighted in red:



   
Considering the fact that the $110.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 57%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.87% boost of extra return to the investor, or 17.76% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.


The implied volatility in the put contract example is 28%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 25%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $107.89) to be 22%.

"One of the toughest tasks of an investment analyst is to pick out stocks to buy that will increase in relevancy over the next several years. But when it comes to cybersecurity stocks, there’s no question: this sector will not only grow, but the dynamics involved virtually guarantee robust progression.First, let’s look at the costs associated with cyberattacks. According to a 2018 data breach study, the average global . This figure increased over 6% from the prior year. Further, the scope of cyberattacks have steadily increased, indicating that hackers are increasingly savvy and emboldened. Thus, the need for defensive mechanisms is strong, bolstering the case for cybersecurity stocks to buy.Second, no digital platform is really safe without effective countermeasures. That’s according to Adam K. Levin, former director of the New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs and author of “Swiped: How to Protect Yourself in a World Full of Scammers, Phishers, and Identity Thieves.” Addressing a new threat called e-skimming, Levin stated:Unlike ATM skimming, where you may be able to see the hardware, e-skimming takes a virtual approach that is much harder to detect and is less risky for the criminal.This segues into another point about the implications for cybersecurity stocks to buy: security breaches affect us all. Whether you’re the CEO of a powerful multinational organization, or an average Joe or Jane buying tickets to the game online, the specter of a costly hack is always present.The war between hackers and protectors will probably persist until the end of time. You might as well benefit from it with these seven cybersecurity stocks to buy:Source: Twin Design / Shutterstock.com
	Although cybersecurity stocks to buy have tremendous long-term potential, not all are backed by stable fundamentals. Typically smaller and focused on a singular purpose, the sector sometimes features volatility. And that’s why I like  (NYSE:). With IBM stock, you receive multi-pronged exposure to relevant tech segments, including cybersecurity.Because IBM is itself a massive enterprise, it best knows the needs for large-scale organizations. And according to a cyberattack study they conducted with the Ponemon Institute, the . On average, it takes 279 days to identify and contain a breach. Moreover, the lifecycle of a malicious attack from breach to containment averages 314 days. Thus, IBM stock is more than just a dividend play.And as I mentioned earlier, the company offers exciting exposure to relevant tech sub-segments, such as cloud for enterprises and artificial intelligence. Plus, IBM stock is a recovery play, giving you better potential for upside.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com
	One of the vanguards of cybersecurity stocks to buy,  (NYSE:) is primarily known for developing cutting-edge network firewalls. Over the years, Palo Alto has consistently won industry accolades for their extensive security platforms. As well, PANW stock is among the most reliable winners in this hectic sector.An exciting component of Palo Alto is their investment in AI platforms. In the olden days of cybersecurity, countermeasures involved responding or reacting to data breaches. But with Palo Alto’s suite of defensive mechanisms, their system identifies potential threats and eliminates them. In this industry, an ounce of prevention is worth several million dollars. And that’s why PANW stock typically tops lists of cybersecurity stocks to buy.To be fair and upfront, though, Palo Alto shares experienced some wild trading throughout this year. However, PANW stock appears to have stabilized since late August. Thus, this might be an opportunity to buy shares at a discount.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com
	Another historical top performer among cybersecurity stocks to buy,  (NASDAQ:) made its name through producing various countermeasures. These include firewalls, anti-virus software, intruder prevention systems, and endpoint security protocols. Not surprisingly, FTNT stock tends to have a similar trajectory like PANW. If you want a relatively reliable winner in this sector, Fortinet is a solid pick.But as cyberthreats advanced, so did the company. A particular dynamic management addresses is known as digital transformation. As companies adopt various new technologies, this ironically increases the surface area for data breaches. In other words, as an organization grows, some of its branches may be more vulnerable than others.To protect clients in this new era, Fortinet introduced a . Combining all countermeasures under a centralized command point, Fortinet can deliver effective solutions across an enterprise’s business spectrum. It’s this kind of next-level thinking that makes FTNT stock a compelling buy.Source: jejim / Shutterstock.com
	A popular and established name among cybersecurity stocks to buy,  (NASDAQ:) earned a reputation for providing combined hardware and software solutions for IT security. But because of the ever-evolving nature of online threats, Check Point had to adapt to a new reality. And this is what makes CHKP stock so interesting.In recent years, the risk of  among corporations and individuals alike. An especially nasty form of malware, ransomware encrypts a victim’s files. In order for the affected to regain access to their system, they must pay a ransom.According to Check Point’s website, in 2016, victims collectively . Fortunately, the cybersecurity firm offers a solution, providing AI platforms that detect and quarantine possible ransomware attacks. Furthermore, if an attack occurs, Check Point’s security system springs to action immediately, mitigating damages and working toward data restoration.CHKP stock has taken a beating since spring of this year. The bearishness might be overdone, though, considering the underlying company’s effectiveness in addressing next-generation threats.Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com
	Despite the tremendous upside potential for cybersecurity stocks to buy, they’re not immune to analyst downgrades: just ask stakeholders of  (NASDAQ:). Although one of the leading players in cloud-based endpoint security, Citi Research analyst Walter Pritchard didn’t view that as an asset for CRWD stock.Instead, Pritchard views the endpoint market as competitive and crowded,  on CRWD stock. He further cited other cybersecurity stocks to buy that may offer superior exposure to this market.Granted, this tech segment doesn’t always offer stable returns. Thus, I can understand why Pritchard is hesitant on CRWD stock. However, for contrarians, they should consider the growth narrative. In its quarter ending July 31, 2019, CrowdStrike generated revenue of $108.1 million. That’s up 94% from the year-ago quarter.Put another way, Citi Research may have done you a favor by giving you a discount on CRWD.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com
	Most of the cybersecurity stocks to buy on this list concentrate their resources on enterprise-level security measures. And while  (NASDAQ:) once did the same, they also feature a healthy platform for personal online security. Thanks to their Norton and LifeLock brands, SYMC stock is a well-known commodity.Since around mid-September of this year, though, SYMC stock has started to slip in the charts. But from a longer-term perspective, I view this as a temporary blip on the radar. With cybercrimes rising in both frequency and scale, the need for identity theft protection increases in lock step. With Symantec specializing in this arena, I believe the outlook for SYMC stock is positive.Also, due to the growth-centric nature of this industry, most cybersecurity stocks to buy don’t provide passive income. However, Symantec offers a dividend, which is a rarity. Of course, the yield of 1.31% is nothing to write home about, but it at least provides some measure of protection.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com
	Sometimes, cybersecurity firms are at war with each other. Take for instance last month’s dust-up between cloud-based security provider  (NASDAQ:) and industry leader Palo Alto Networks. In early September, Palo Alto claimed that they “displaced” Zscaler as a supplier to two major companies. That comment sent ZS stock tumbling.In response, Zscaler CEO Jay Chaudhry dismissed Palo Alto’s remarks as nervousness from a legacy provider. Chaudhry continued his rebuttal, noting that “To do cloud security right you . You can’t take the legacy boxes and stick them in a cloud and say it’s cloud security.”He has a point. With enterprises adopting cloud architecture at a significant rate, the threat of data breaches only increases. Since several people are connected to the cloud, one exposed vulnerability could impact the whole system.As a smaller, mission-focused company, Zscaler theoretically enjoys better agility than the bigger names. That said, ZS stock is one of the riskiest names you could buy right now, although the reward potential is also strong.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.The post  appeared first on .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@7 Cybersecurity Stocks to Keep Your Portfolio Safe@2019-10-24@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-cybersecurity-stocks-to-keep-your-portfolio-safe-2019-10-24
"nvestors in Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd.  (Symbol: CHKP) saw new options begin trading this week, for the November 15th expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CHKP options chain for the new November 15th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $105.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.30.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $105.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $102.70 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CHKP, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $108.14/share today.

Because the $105.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 67%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .

Check Point assumes no obligation to update information concerning its expectations or beliefs, except as required by law. In our press release, which has been posted on our website, we present GAAP and non-GAAP results, along with a reconciliation of such results, as well as reasons for our presentation of non-GAAP information.Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Tal Payne for a review of the financial results. -- Great, thank you, Kip. Good morning and good afternoon to everyone joining us on the call today. I'm pleased to begin the review of the third quarter. Revenues for the quarter increased by 4% year-over-year to $491 million and our non-GAAP EPS reached $1.44. Our revenues were slightly above the midpoint of our guidance and the non-GAAP EPS was at the top end of our guidance.Before I proceed further into the numbers, let me remind you that our GAAP financial results include stock-based compensation charges, amortization of acquired intangible assets and acquisition related expenses, as well as the related tax effects. Keep in mind as applicable, non-GAAP information is presented excluding these items.Now let's take a look at the financial highlights for the quarter. Revenue for the quarter came $1 million above the midpoint of our guidance. Product and security subscription revenues were $272 million, a 6% increase year-over-year. Our subscription revenues continue to be strong, with 13% growth, reaching $154 million [Phonetic]. Our software update and maintenance revenues increased to $219 million, representing 3% growth year-over-year. The growth in our subscription revenues is driven by our advanced solutions, mainly next generation Threat Extraction protection, CloudGuard Solutions, and Infinity. Deferred revenues as of September 30, 2019 reached $1.242 billion, a growth of $94 million or 8% year-over-year.Revenue distribution by geography for the quarter was as follows; 46% of revenues came from Americas, 42% of the revenues came from Europe, Middle East and Africa region, and the remaining 12% came from Asia-Pacific. Since the beginning of 2019, Middle East and Africa parts are part of Europe, Middle East and Africa region, while before it was part of Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa region. The revenue distribution by geography for Q3 last year for comparison purposes, after the reclassification would have been, 47% of revenues came from Americas; 41% of revenues came from Europe, Middle East and Africa region; and the remaining 12% came from Asia-Pacific.We continue to invest in our sales force and marketing in order to execute our growth strategy. As a result, non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter were 50%, same as the previous quarter and in line with our plans. Effective non-GAAP tax rate for this quarter was 19%, similar to the last quarter. Please note, that in the fourth quarter, we expect the tax rate to be around zero, as the lapse of statute limitation is expected to occur by the year end. Our expected tax rate for the year remains around 40% as predicted in the beginning of the year.GAAP net income for the quarter was $188 million or $1.25 per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $217 million or $1.44 per diluted share. Our cash balances as of September 30, 2019 were $4.055 billion compared to $4.072 billion last year. Operating cash flow was $244 million. Collection from customers continue to be strong. Our cash payments increased, in line with our continued investment in sales and marketing. During the quarter, we utilized nearly the maximum quarterly buyback authorized and purchased 2.9 million shares for $323 million, at an average price of $112.Now let's turn the call over to Gil for his comments. -- Thank you, Tal, and hello to everyone joining us today. I'm glad to have you all on the call and pleased to provide you with a bit of more insight on the first quarter results. As you heard from Tal, we continue to deliver healthy financial results in the third quarter. We're still in a period of change in transformation, as we continue to focus on elevating our customer security environment into the fifth generation of cyber protection. This means that we have taken upon ourselves quite an ambitious goal of preventing the most advanced cyber attack and providing an integrated cyber solution for all elements of the modern IT infrastructure; networks, datacenters, endpoint, mobile, cloud and IoT.We continue to expand our cyber security solution consolidation efforts, with the Infinity architecture. As you can see from the numbers, we had quite a good success with our cloud solutions. Yes, we continue to aim for much higher growth rates across our business. We're still in the period of transformation, moving from a traditional product business into more of an annuity model, we aim to drive our sales execution across all of our business areas. We continue to expand our global field management and conduct more in-field and marketing activities around the world. Naturally, we would like to see high growth rates sooner, but it does take time, and we remain focused on making that happen.We place a lot of emphasis on the cloud, and we believe we have the most comprehensive architecture to secure cloud environments. As a result, we've seen nice successes. Cloud business results continue to be healthy, growth percentage remains quite high, some recent example of nice wins in the cloud space includes two of the world's largest accounting firms, two of the world's largest consulting firms, one of the world's largest business media firms, two of the world's largest retail franchises, two of the world's largest stock exchanges, and the list goes on with many of the world's top companies, including shipping, financial, telcos and government.Our recent success didn't just focus on the cloud. We have won many projects with our advanced threat prevention for network, endpoints and mobile. One example for such a win is a new customer, an energy company in America. We asked them what made them choose Check Point? They quoted, few major reasons; one is that only Check Point has real time threat prevention. The competition simply lacks these capabilities as their threat analysis work in the background and don't stop the attack. The second reason was the superiority of our management. Our interface is more comprehensive and much easier to use. Things that takes hours with the competition, simply takes minutes with checkpoint. Overall we felt that Check Point has a better architecture, with much better TCO.This is quite typical of what we learned from the marketplace. In both the qualitative and quantitative research we conduct, we see three main reasons that customers choose Checkpoint. First, is the real-time threat prevention. Second is the management capabilities; and third is the completeness of our security architecture.Here is a real world example of a customer experience that just happened this quarter. The potential customers started testing our CloudGuard products. A week after starting trial, they had enough confidence to turn on the real-time prevention mode. They were in the middle of an IPO process, and that's where the story turned interesting. Our SandBlast technology embedded into the CloudGuard product caught a file which contained some command and control malware, that could have leaked very good [Phonetic] financial information. This model infected a file which was sent from their account to their bankers account. If that file would have gone through, you can just imagine the potential damage to the customer and the investment bank.Many solution could have been deployed to handle this incident, by using almost any other solution in the marketplace, the cost of the investigation, forensic, collection and remediation of this incident could have been enormous, between hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars. By using the Check Point product, the file was cleaned by our Threat Extraction Engine, alerts were recorded and no damage occurred. The cost of this incident to the customer was zero, instead of the hundreds of thousands of dollars or more in real damages. This kind of incidents happen many times every day, in most cases we don't even hear the story, simply because the effectiveness of the real-time prevention solution. Unfortunately, our incidence response same is seeing an increase in incidents with a significant impact, which could have been eliminated, if the organization had been using our fifth generation threat prevention solution.Turning to the subject to some of the new products we launched in recent quarters -- in recent months. We continue to upgrade our security appliance family. In July, we launched the 16,000 and 26,000 security appliance family. These high-end data center great models provide threat prevention performance in the range of 12 to 30 gigabits per second. On the other side of the scale, we launched the 1500 series of appliances earlier this month, with the starting price under $1,000 and the performance between 456 megabits to 660 megabits of threat prevention performance. This model show the strength and the scale of our architecture and the ability to provide the most comprehensive security architecture at all price and performance levels.A new addition to our family of products was the CloudGuard Connect and CloudGuard Edge solutions. CloudGuard Connect allows the utilization of the same security architecture through cloud service. Connecting branch office directly to the cloud with no on-premise equipment. It opens the door to many new opportunities and is fully integrated into the same policies and management tools used by our customers.One change we've also implemented with the new appliance model, is simplify the subscription process. As we discussed previously with the old models, every appliance included a bundled one year, next generation threat prevention subscription, and the customer could choose to upgrade it. In addition, the customer had to choose the support level they required, and in the second year, they had to renew both. With the new models we're simplifying the process. The appliances provided basic configuration and the support and security subscription are bundled into a single offer with three levels. So the first year and the following year looks the same, and there are fewer and simpler choices to make.All customers receive access to 7/24 support services, with new models shift even more revenues into the annuity part of our business model. Still early to measure the effect of these business model changes, we will only see the full impact of these changes in the future. Talking about business models, makes a nice transition to speak about our projection for the next quarter. You know my regular caveat, it's hard to predict the future. There are many promising deals and results over lot of unknowns that can impact results.With that said, our revenues for the fourth quarter expected to be between $527 million to $557 million, and non-GAAP EPS is expected to be between $1.93 to $2.04. GAAP EPS is expected to be approximately $0.19 lower.Thank you. And now we'd be happy to answer your questions.[Operator Instructions]. First question is from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. -- Thank you. If you could just comment on some of the increased investments in sales and some of the productivity enhancements that you're seeing, particularly in North America would be helpful? -- North America, we continue to invest in the sales and marketing organization, and one big change that we've conducted last quarter is the appointment of a new leader. We hired a new President for the Americas, Chris Scanlan. We had a lot of experience in our industry and with our channel. We've also hired few other people in the telco space, in the channel space, for the Americas. But I think this new high level appointment should take us a long way and should provide a lot of leadership and support for our field people in the Americas.Our next question is from the line of Michael Turits from Raymond James. -- Hi Gil and Tal. To the extent you can, can you comment on the overall demand for security and what you're seeing? Any weaknesses in any geos [Phonetic], Europe, anything on the telco service provider side? -- I think overall demand remained stable, remained healthy. I think our market enjoys a very high level of demand, enjoys I think a very high level strategic view. On the other hand, suffers from a lot of fragmentation and a lot of confusion and a lot of competition, in all aspects and in all sizes. But overall I think demand is quite healthy and I haven't seen any specific issues around that. -- Okay. And then if I can, a follow-up, as you said, you mentioned, Chris Scanlan there's been a lot of changes in sales management in general. Frank Rauch came in, I don't know, something like a year ago. And there have been other changes a level below them as well. Can you just discuss what types of changes strategically you expect, and where you are in that process? -- I think we want to -- I think, first, we have people that are doing a very good job. And again, [Indecipherable] I was very pleased to see with many -- with many wins that we've seen all around the world. I think what we'd like to do is, to first get more get more new customers, that's a big focus. By the way, this quarter we did see a nice increase in the number of new customers. I would like to see more emphasis on the new strategic areas of the market, like mobile, advanced threat prevention and the cloud. And again, we've seen nice successes in all these areas. The cloud, the business was very healthy this quarter. So that's quite a good sign from that perspective. I think we can do much better on the product business, on the traditional product business, more gateways to more companies, more refreshes and more new customers. So that is an area that even consists a big part of our business and there we're doing well with it. We can do much better with that.And last but not least, is enhancing our relationship and doing better with our partners in all places and all segments, both with our traditional channel partners, renewed energy for the telco sector, system integrators, and even adding new partners that will help us get to more customers and especially in the new areas like cloud places. So I think I have captured a very broad picture, but I think in -- for two minutes, I think it's a very broad picture for what we're doing. -- Yes, thank you very much, Gil and Tal.The next question is from the line of Shaul Eyal with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question. -- Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. One for Gil, and one for Tal, Gil, this is something I've asked about last quarter. So with respect to the Engage plan, the frequent flyer type of plan, would like to hear about any new updates you can share with us from a customers' perspective, also from the channel? -- I think the Engage plan is a new plan that we created with our partners, to really engage the partners in Check Point activities, rather than -- usually when you are discussing with partners, there's a lot of discussion about margins, about financials, which are all fine. But they don't drive the daily work in the field. And I think what we like to do, is drive the daily work in the field, and that's where we created the Engage app and the Engage program that will incentivize our channel partners at the sales rep Level, to do more work with us and go to customers.I think it's being received well. I don't have a specific update about the usage and so on, but from what I hear, it's coming up quite nicely. I think we will base next year partner level on -- in big part on the Engage program and I think, again, we've heard good feedback about that. And I think in the next two months, we will see more about how it shapes up and which partners gain level, because we've been active and because they were going to more activities, and which partners may need some more push and -- and now we can see it, based on their activity level. -- Understood. And Gil or Tal, as you further think about the ongoing shift, as you've indicated of the business model toward an annuity driven one, would there be any architectural changes to your appliances down the road? In other words, could we be seeing Check Point embedding more ASIC, slightly more hardware in its appliances to accelerate throughput and performance down the road? -- I think at this point, that wouldn't be our focus and I'll explain why. I think the main issue is, yes, we can drive sometimes more performance, more basic performance through hardware acceleration. But what we're seeing more and more, is that the big challenge is actually in the more advanced threat prevention capabilities, and in being flexible and agile to the changes in the French landscape. And I think that's not a stable environment. It's not an environment when we set the roadmap. That's an environment with [Indecipherable], in our world are setting the roadmap. And I think on that front, we've seen a lot of success with the open architecture that we are utilizing. We have the most agile software. I think we demonstrated. Again customers, they test our product, in that see the superiority of security, and we hear it from almost every customer that have gone in that to the analysis. And what we've found over time, that in order to do that, the right architecture is an open architecture, and ASICs that can do a good job in accelerating very simple operation, simply fail when it comes to advanced capability with security needs. So most of our focus is going to remain on the open architecture that we are developing. -- Thank you so much for that.Our next question is from the line of Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your questions. -- Great, thanks for taking the questions, this is Ryan MacDonald on for Brad. My first question is for Gil. Last quarter you announced new high-end appliances, and while it's still early on in that product life cycle, can you speak to the conversations you're having with customers around those appliances, and if you expect to see any short-term impacts from customers potentially trading down to slightly lower tier appliances, as we've seen in the past with product introductions that have significantly increased performance? -- So I think we're seeing a good acceptance for the new appliance model, both the 16,000 and the 26,000. And another one, by the way, what adds a lot of value to the market is what we call the Maestro Orchestrator. The Maestro is actually quite revolutionary, right when we came in earlier in the year, at the beginning of the year, and it's already actually starting to gain share and get into the market in nice volumes. And Maestro, basically allows to take several of the appliances and turn them into a super appliance, with much higher performance, with much higher level of redundancy, what we call cloud like performance, very high level of flexibility and very high level of resiliency.I think we're really seeing good traction of that. Right now, I am not seeing a lot of down shift for appliances. I think, by the way, that's also some of the changes that we've made to the Applied subscription model, try to help invest at the basic appliance may go -- may be slightly lower in price with the new appliances. But the subscription somehow compensates for that, and give the customers a simpler and easier way to account for that in the annuity side of business. But I also like to comment compared to [Indecipherable] have said so far was on the positive side of the new appliances, which I think is being received quite well. The only thing that I would say is that, we see that for large projects and large customers, it actually takes a long time to move to a new model. And I'd expect, when we come up with a new model from -- when I'm the consumer, I like to move to the new model the next day. What I'm seeing in the sales cycle to big enterprises, that it takes between three months to nine months, and sometimes even more, to get the new model into the sales cycle. Many times there's an RSP already with the old model. Many times customer need certification and the -- and so I mean the cycle is slightly slower than what I'd like it to be, when I would like to see all the new customers, all the new deals coming with the new appliances. -- Great, thanks. That was really helpful. And a follow-up for Tal, if I could. Can you just remind us if there are any large deals that impacted billings last year, as you were facing tough comps on a year-over-year basis? And can you remind us if there was anything in Q4 that we should be paying attention to. Thanks.In Q3 -- both in Q2 last year and in Q3 last year, we had large deals. Large deals, it means over $50 million. So yes, there were large deals in both Q2 and Q3, which did not happen and we didn't expect to happen in Q2 and Q3 this year. Q4, I'm trying to think if there was very large one. I don't remember this size like over $50 million in Q4. -- Okay, thank you.Thank you. The next question is from the line of Fatima Boolani with UBS. Please proceed with your question. -- Good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. Gil, I have one for you, and Tal, one for you as well. Gil, we've seen the cloud security portfolio at Check Point expand pretty nicely over the last year. You're doing TAS, that you're doing Cloud Workload Protection, Cloud Security Posture Management. I'm wondering if you can speak to, if you have any bundles associated with these cloud capabilities and to the extent, you'd be willing to or would start breaking out cloud specific revenue in the financial model? And then I have a follow-up for Tal. -- I think you are right, we are seeing good traction with the cloud product. It consists of -- its actually a broad family, with a lot of details, and by the way, cloud in general is one of the more sophisticated and you can even say confusing markets, because there is many things that are called cloud. But overall, we are seeing very good traction on that,, both on securing the cloud with our technology, also on the cloud management and the cloud compliance side of business, we're seeing a good traction. And also for the newer technologies like the CloudGuard SaaS, with secure SaaS applications and Office 365 and so on. We don't intend to break the revenue down based on the specific family, simply too small. Some of the products, the families are too small.And in terms of bundling that, first we do offer one -- or not bundle one, strategic value, which is part of the Infinity model that we have. And in the future, I think we will see, I'm not sure if I'll call it bundling, I think we will see some new and creative business models around the cloud, because I think we want to offer much more evolutionary architectures and technologies around the cloud. -- Fair enough. And Tal for you, just looking at deferred revenue, I don't think we've seen this type of seasonality or sequential downtick in deferred revenue growth since at least 2012, based on my model. So what are some of the things that we should consider here, that could potentially be weighing on the growth of this metric? -- So it's basically billing, that's what you see in the deferred. If you look year-over-year it was, if I recall, if you look at the short-term growth in deferred revenues, it was around 8%, if I remember, and I think if you look historically, like in 2018 and 2019, you had some quarter with 7%, 8%, 9%, 11%, 10%, 8%. So I will say it's pretty much in the same vicinity. The long-term did change. So if you look year-over-year, long-term contracts or long-term deferred revenue this quarter increased year-over-year, again by 9% and if you look, last year, both in Q2, Q3 and Q4, and even this year you've seen 11%, 15%, 16%. So obviously we're seeing less billing with the long-term deferred revenues, which is affecting the total growth in the deferred revenues. -- Fair enough. Thank you.The next question is from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question. Gregg, your line is open for question? -- Thank you very much and hi guys. A follow-up on Michael Turits' question if I may. Your revenue growth in EMEA, actually showed good growth on a sequential basis, and on the face of it, that was I would say, perhaps a little surprising, just given some of the caution I think many of us have been hearing overseas. Conversely, your North America revenue declined roughly mid single digits on a sequential basis, and it was probably a little weaker than I think many would have thought. And I'm just kind of wondering if you could comment on both of these regions, just from a demand perspective, or more specifically, if you're seeing any changes at all in the competitive landscape? -- I think both areas remains very, very promising. The potential in the Americas is very high. The potential in Europe is also very high. We are far from reaching the potential of the market. I think the same is true for our execution. We can do better and we can generate better results on the -- on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. I'm pleased with some of what you've seen in Europe. As I said -- I mean we said I think we are investing more and more in the Americas. And by the way the Americas is not one size fits all, when I analyze it, I'm seeing -- by the way, its true both in Europe and in the Americas. We analyze our region in both places. I see regions that have done tremendously well this quarter, and I see region that were struggling a little bit. And that's true in Europe and that's true in the U.S. And actually what I was pleased to see because I've done a lot of in-depth analysis this quarter, is seeing some of the regions in the U.S. that are starting to show signs of good recovery, good wins and the right level of execution that I expect. -- That's helpful. Thanks, Gil. And then just a follow-up on CloudGuard Connect, which you talked about in your prepared remarks. One of your close competitors has been doing quite well here. Another competitor recently announced plans to enter this market, and so I was wondering if you could talk to how well you think your integrated offering will compete there? -- I think, first, we have a terrific offering and I have tried it, it's actually very easy, you can just go on the web, get up and running, connect the branch office or connect few users very easily with -- with really few minutes, no training. Really simple on-boarding process, which is what people expect from a cloud solution like that, [Indecipherable]. I think the very two big differentiators in what we have, I don't know by the way, if the competitive landscape is that easy or that simple to turn on, it would be very hard to compete with what I've seen, with our product. What I definitely can say is, one is -- two things that differentiate ours, is what is the level of security? We provide much higher level of security, much higher level of threat prevention. And second is the ability to tie-in into the overall enterprise management and enterprise set of rules, I mean really big part of the same enterprise solution. So we've built our solution to support that, to be part of that, and we are seeing some nice demand of that. I don't have very high expectation from immediate results that we'll see, because I think that some of the targets market that we have are the large customers, and they're very well interested. But will take some time to onboard and to shift infrastructure. But it's definitely a promising area that we have. -- Great, that's helpful. Thank you.Next question is from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. -- Thank you, Gil or Tal, the R77 to R80 OS migration is obviously ongoing in your installed base, especially in 3Q, as a lot of customers faced the R77 and the support date in September. It can sometimes be hard for us on the outside to determine whether a big OS migration like this is a catalyst to upgrade, or a reason, perhaps to hesitate? I'd love if you could share your thoughts about what you're seeing with that migration issue in 3Q, and how you expect it to play out in 4Q? Thank you. -- First, I mean, let's say, it's a very good point. And again, what we're seeing in many times at the high level, macro level is very different than what customers are facing, which is exactly which version and which OS, and a lot of technical details that are on customer heads [Phonetic]. I think what we -- what I'm pleased to see, is that the majority of our customers now are on R80, that's very-very good. We're still a portion, a minority, but still an important portion that haven't migrated to R80. We are supporting them. We will do a -- we are supporting both what we are doing now and we will support their migration to R80, because we'd like them to have the latest security, and I think it is critical for them to enjoy the latest security features that we have.How does that impact the migration or the sale? It's very hard to say for me. Again, I'm seeing some customers that it would help them, if you put some -- so if things were easier, I'm seeing other customers when it's a no-brainer and they like the situation that we are in and that we with. So I can't say -- I can't put right now any -- it's very hard for me to quantify that impact at this point. -- I would just say that the good news is the majority passed, the better news is that while, we have still a small portion that needs to move. While they move, it can help us increase, because when you buy the new appliances, then many times when they need to refresh, it can create an opportunity to sell -- to buy new product, when they finish to upgrade their software system. So I'm less concerned about the end of life of the software. I think it's a non-issue completely, because we know, if they need a bit more time, we can always provide more time. That's not a problem, it's completely in our hands. But it's more, I think an opportunity that when the more transition happens, the more an ability for us to help them refresh their install base and increase their product sales portion. -- Okay, thanks very much.The next question is from the line of Ken Talanian with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. -- Hi guys, thanks for taking the question. You mentioned earlier, it takes a long time for larger customers to get accustomed to new models? And I was wondering if you could give us a sense for whether you did any pricing studies ahead of the new appliance pricing model? And any anecdotes you might have from customers on that? -- The pricing model, you mean what Gil was referring to, solid-state? First, of course we checked with customers and partners before, is simplify significantly for them, the universe. I'll give you an example, before when the pressure is on appliance, at that point of time, we gave them NGTP Incorporated. So they didn't have much of an option to choose if its NGFW or NGTP. On the other hand, they could have upgrade to NGT, if they chose to. Then they had to make a decision, what level of support they want? And they have different level of support, it can be the standard, the premium, the diamond they can choose on-site support, non-on site support and so on. So they have many-many options for buying that appliance.Now it's a much simpler model. It's basically they choose appliance. It doesn't integrate in it, the subscription. So it's cheaper, in a sense or lower price when you come to the base model. That like you said, can hurt our product revenues, we understand that. But the benefit is, for the customers and for us, it now he has an ability to choose one of three layers--options, NGT, NGFW, NGTP or NGTX Package, including the support, which is 24-7. So there is only three options, and they can do that. And then in the second year, just renew it and continue. So customers love it, because it gives them much more flexibility. So if they choose not to have NGTP and just want NGFW, they can. If they want NGTX, they can still go with NGTX of course. But now they have the support embedded in it, in a very simple pricing model, because it's a percentage of the base price of the appliance. So it's not the price that is a fixed price, and this price can be similar historically between small appliance and may be one level above with the appliance. Now, it's the percentage of the base. So it's very-very easy for them to understand the pricing model, and therefore they should like it. -- Understood. And I guess as part of that, have you seen a greater inclination to move to the higher pricing of those three? -- As I said, I think it's too early to say, because what I've seen, that especially on the higher end model, it takes customers a little bit longer time to simply shift the model. So I haven't seen enough cases to see how does the... -- Now, I will say it for you. From the one that brought the new appliances, we see some that moved down, some that moved up. But remember that the percentage now is compensating for that. So we took it into account in the pricing. We know that on the product, it will be lower. But over time, we should see more in the subscription. -- Great, thank you very much.The next question is from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please proceed with your question. -- Hi, thank you. Tal, just to follow up on that question you just had there, I guess, in the past, you've had -- you've had these shift spread more of the business that have gone from product to annuity. Anyway to quantify in terms of how much that shift may be under a base scenario, and how that might compare to shifts that you've seen in the past? -- First remember, that when they buy the new appliance, they have to choose one of the packages. So all of them, when they buy an appliance, they will have a subscription portion and of course the support portion. So the lowest they can go is NGFW, but they can go up to NGTX, including the premium. So its included in all of these option or majority of them, there will be an uplift in the subscription. The short-term price is in the product line. -- Okay. And then just a quick one on DSO, I think actually probably the lowest DSO you've seen in a number of quarters here drop into the 50s. Just wondering, anything around how the quarter progressed or a large field impacted that influenced that number? Thanks. -- No, it probably was slightly less back-end loaded. But in general, nothing dramatic. Collection remains the same. It's a good sign, DSO, but this time it came from the levels of the booking. So it's not -- it basically remains the same, in general. If you look at it by month, because we calculate by month, its the same DSO. -- Great, thank you. -- Sure.Our next question is from the line of Sterling Auty with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question. -- Yeah, thanks. Hi guys. Gil, want to go back to the CloudGuard Connect commentary, you talked about solution being more secure. In those large enterprise, I think both security and performance are the key issues, can you comment to the kind of the architecture that you're using in that product, and how it compares to the other solutions that are on the market, a little bit more specifically to understand both the higher security, as well as what kind of performance expectations you have out of it? -- Sure. First, I think the engines that we have and the capabilities that we have are much-much higher. Both our Threat Extraction, Threat Emulation, SSL inspection. We have more and more web inspection capabilities, more than any other vendor in the marketplace. All of that put our security level in a much, much higher level. The fact by the way, but -- when you are talking about processing files and things that I've described, I think we're the only vendor that actually offer all these things in a mode, with prevent mode. That is -- that you don't get what's called patient zero, is going to be caught. Not first you get infected, and then hours later, you need to deal with the consequences because it was detected. So we with sales for the way we do our -- the level of security that we provide.For -- in terms of the architecture, I think we are providing each customer with a more private environment. It's still a cloud environment, but every customer get an instance. So data is more safe, is more secure, it's not shared with others and it -- and the specific policy what this customer has. is applied toward data. So it's much less, I mean from -- like a consumer service that you get, the secure pipe to a highly secured pipe, we've -- at your level, with your privacy and your level of management and your policy, much more in what our customers like to see, and based by the way, why they remain the number one targets that we have, is for small branch offices, but would like to enjoy this kind of capability. -- Got it. And then, Tal, one follow-up for you. Given the good growth in the subscription side, can you just qualitatively remind us at this point, what are the biggest contributors to the growth in that line? So in other words, which bundles, which products are driving the growth? -- So, it consists from all of the subscription. But specifically, the main growth coming from the Cloud, Infinity and NGTX or the SandBlast Zero Day protection. So that's the main one. Remember by the way, that Q4 has usually an effect also from the DLP in the compliance, and some of them come in Q4, and that can change sometimes the growth to slower or to faster, depends what happens. So it's very hard to predict. -- Thank you.Our next question is from the line of Shebly Seyrafi with FBN Securities. Please proceed with your questions. -- Yeah. Thank you. I'm trying to gauge the comparison in billings in Q4. In Q4 of '18, your deferred actually accelerated from Q3 of '18. But you didn't call out large deals in Q4 of last year, which suggest the billings comparison is easier. So I'm trying to understand, do you think that the comparison with billings on a year-to-year basis is easier or harder in Q4? -- I'm not sure. I followed you. Regarding the Q4, I was asked before, if I remember, a very large deal, I admit I didn't -- from the top of my head, I don't remember a very-very large deal, but Q4 is a huge quarter for support and subscription, and so its very hard to predict it. In general, I don't think we -- based on that number, that it's an easy compare, just because, if I recall, it was quite a large number. Q4 grows... -- [Speech Overlap] quickly. There were large deals in Q2 and Q3 of last year, were there potentially large deals in Q4 of last year? -- So I said, I don't recall. I don't have it in front of me, so I don't want to throw it on the top of my mind. But I remember it was very high growth. If I remember Q4 growth year-over-year, it was about 13%. So that was a huge number. So I would define it is a tough compare. -- Okay, that's it. Thank you.Our next question is from the line of Dan Ives with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed with your questions. -- Thanks. Gil going into next year, I mean obviously you are not giving guidance. But just in terms of overall spending on security. I mean, is your sense out of your customer conversations, that spending, especially in the move to the cloud is actually increasing, flat, decreasing -- I'm just interested from your perspective? Thanks. On overall security. -- I think with overall security -- I mean all the customers at the high level are willing to invest in security. Also, all the customers have their budget under control. So I don't think that anyone has huge additions to their budget that are -- that they can spare. So we are looking somehow to balance between the new investment. We are going to invest a lot in the cloud space. I think it is going to be important, and it is going to be -- and it is by the way, a big place, where customers are investing and customers are putting their budgets. So we need to be there, we need to make it secure. By the way, I think that the importance of cloud security is also very-very high. We've seen almost all the cases of data leakage in recent year, result from weaknesses in the cloud. I mean -- I'm seeing it every day. When you make a small mistake on the cloud, it's being exploited within minutes. I have few horror cases like that from the last quarter that I've seen, how really a small mistake inside the company wouldn't even be noticed and wouldn't create any damage in the cloud, creates a damage within minutes.So I think the cloud investment is going to be important. Overall, I think our challenge is not the overall spending environment, it is how we is -- how we get the customers to adopt the Check Point architecture in its entirety. That's the high level solution, and on the technical level, winning in as many product segments as we can, including the core gateways that we have. That's it's still a big opportunity that's still there and and we can capture an even bigger market share there. -- Great and just tangentially, in terms of like -- in terms of private security deals, are you seeing more and more assets out there, that, from an M&A perspective, and in terms of valuations, maybe more sort of digestible, with a lot of private companies, in consolidation. I am just interested, is there any change in the M&A landscape, especially on smaller private companies? Thanks. -- Because the fragmentation of the market, I think there is many opportunities. Obviously some parts of the market valuation are getting out of control. But at the same time, we also see a lot of companies with really really cool technology that can fit our portfolio and, but may be a good fit. So I think there is no one answer to that. We do see some opportunities, and I think hopefully, we will be able to do more with that. -- Thank you.Thank you. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. It's time for one final question, which would be coming from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo. -- Hey, thanks guys for taking my question. Gil, just a question for you, curious just what you're seeing in the pricing environment environment out there, particularly if you could maybe talk through sort of the enterprise versus the telco space, which I know has been a growing focus for you guys? -- I think it remains very competitive. I haven't seen big changes on that. But so I mean -- I don't know, Tal, if you have anything to add on that? -- No. In general, we see -- I don't see something specific in telco. Telco, as you know, they are always very competitive, especially in pricing. We are creating a focus on the telco, as you know, because we believe there is a nice opportunity for us there. But we see nothing dramatic this quarter versus the previous quarter. -- Great, thanks guys.Thank you. I will turn the floor back to management for closing remarks. -- Thank you guys for joining us this quarter. We look forward to seeing you out on the road at conferences and such. if you guys have any questions, please reach out to us after the call and we'll do our best to address any of those questions. Thank you and look forward to seeing you guys. Take care, bye-bye.[Operator Closing Remarks]. --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --

"ooking today at week-over-week shares outstanding changes among the universe of ETFs covered at , one standout is the iShares Core MSCI International Developed Markets ETF (Symbol: IDEV) where we have detected an approximate $79.0 million dollar inflow -- that's a 5.6% increase week over week in outstanding units (from 26,550,000 to 28,050,000).  Among the largest underlying components of IDEV, in trading today NXP Semiconductors NV (Symbol: NXPI) is off about 1.7%, Coca-Cola European Partners plc (Symbol: CCEP) is up about 0.1%, and Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd.  (Symbol: CHKP) is lower by about 0.3%.  

The chart below shows the one year price performance of IDEV, versus its 200 day moving average:
   

   

Looking at the chart above, IDEV's low point in its 52 week range is $47.05 per share, with $57.6183 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $52.65.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''.  These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand.  Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).  Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

"nvestors in Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd.  (Symbol: CHKP) saw new options become available this week, for the April 2020 expiration.  One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 241 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CHKP options chain for the new April 2020 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $105.00 strike price has a current bid of $5.80.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $105.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $99.20 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CHKP, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $108.39/share today.

Because the $105.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 63%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.52% return on the cash commitment, or 8.37% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.


Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd. , and highlighting in green where the $105.00 strike is located relative to that history:


   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $110.00 strike price has a current bid of $7.80.  If an investor was to purchase shares of CHKP stock at the current price level of $108.39/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $110.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 8.68% if the stock gets called away at the April 2020 expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CHKP shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd. , as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing CHKP's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $110.00 strike highlighted in red:



   
Considering the fact that the $110.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 47%.

"'  second-quarter earnings keep the company on track to achieve its objectives in 2019. In other words, the near-term guidance looks assured, but, as ever, investors will want to put the results in the context of the company's long-term aims. So let's take a look at the takeaways from the recent earnings report.Starting with the key headline numbers from the quarter compared to the : As the numbers above show, Check Point's earnings were pretty much within the guidance ranges, and digging into the details reveals even more positive news. For example, in the previous quarter, issues with Check Point's sales execution in the Americas region resurfaced, and sales came in basically flat for the quarter. However, this quarter Americas sales came in with a 4.3% rise (based on my calculations), albeit against a somewhat tough comparison to the same quarter last year.Image source: Getty Images.When  in the third quarter of 2017, management made substantial changes to the sales organization and strategy in the U.S. Hopefully, the issues have now been resolved, but with the third quarter coming up against a difficult comparison to last year's period (when Americas region sales rose 8.2%), it won't be easy to tell in the next quarter's results.Check Point hasn't just been transforming its U.S. sales organization. It's also been investing heavily in sales and marketing (S&M) in order to help drive sales growth. As you can see in the chart below, S&M expenses as a share of revenue have been rising and appear to be largely responsible for the drop in operating margin in the last few years.When a question was asked about the matter on the , CFO Tal Payne , ""We said that our margin will be this year around 49% to 50%. So it's in line with our plan."" Data source: Check Point Software presentations. Chart by author.The increases in S&M expenses and headcount don't seem to have had an immediate impact on product sales growth or even on the trajectory of overall revenue growth -- it remains in the low single digits as befits a mature player in the industry.That said, Check Point's business model is evolving toward more subscription-based revenue, and  actually rose 11% to $1.286 billion in the quarter. Furthermore, in a sign that Check Point is growing its business better than the headline numbers suggest, cash flow from operations rose 9% compared to the same period last year.Data source: Check Point Software presentations. Chart by author.Management guided for revenue in the range of $480 million to $500 million in the third quarter, implying year-over-year growth between 2% and 6.2%. Meanwhile, EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.36 to $1.44, compared to non-GAAP EPS of $1.38 in the third quarter of 2018.The ranges are pretty wide, so it's likely that Check Point can hit a number within them, but investors will be keenly looking for a confirmation of progress in the U.S., plus the possibility of some margin expansion in the future, when the S&M spending initiatives start to fully kick in.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"Image source: The Motley Fool. Q2 2019 , Greetings and welcome to Check Point Software Technologies Second Quarter 2019 . [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference over to your host, Kip E. Meintzer, Head of Global Investor Relations. Thank you, you may begin. -- Thank you. I'd like thank all of you for joining us today for Check Point Second Quarter 2018 Financial Results. Joining me today on the call are Gil Shwed Founder and CEO, along with our CFO and COO Tal Payne. As a reminder, this call is webcast live on our website and is recorded for replay. To access the live webcast and replay information, please visit the company's website at checkpoint.com. For your convenience, the conference call replay will be available through July 31. If you'd like to reach us after the call, please contact Investor Relations by email at kip@checkpoint.com.Before we begin with management's presentation, I'd like to highlight the following. During the course of this presentation, Check Point's representatives may make certain forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 include, but are not limited to, statements related to Check Point's expectations regarding business, financial performance, and customers; the introduction of new products and programs, and the success of those products and programs; the environment for security threats and trends in the market; our strategy and focus areas; demand for our solutions; our business and financial outlook, including our guidance for Q3 2019. Because these statements pertain to future events, they are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from Check Point's current expectations and beliefs. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences are contained in Check Point's earnings press release issued on July 24 2019, which is available on our website, and other risk factors, which are included in Check Point's annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2018, which is on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Check Point assumes no obligation to update information concerning its expectations or beliefs except as required by law.In our press release, which has been posted on our website, we present GAAP and non-GAAP results, along with the reconciliation of such results, as well as the reasons for our presentation of non-GAAP information. Now with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tal Payne for a review of the financial results. -- Thank you Kip. Good morning, good afternoon to everyone joining us on the call today, I'm pleased to begin the review of the second quarter Revenues for the quarter increased by 4% year-over-year to $488 million and our non-GAAP EPS reached $1.38, both slightly above the mid of our guidance. Before I proceed further into the numbers, let me remind you that our GAAP financial results include stock-based compensation charges, amortization of acquired intangible assets and acquisition related expenses, as well as the related tax effects. Keep in mind, as applicable, non-GAAP information is presented excluding these items.Now let's take a look at the financial highlights for the quarter. Product and security subscription revenues was $270 million, a 5% increase year-over-year. Our subscription revenues continue to be strong with 13% growth reaching $149 million. Our software update and maintenance revenues increased to $218 million, representing 4% growth year-over-year.The growth in our subscription revenues is driven by our advanced solutions, mainly SandBlast Zero-Day threat prevention, clouds, and Infinity solutions. Deferred revenues as of June 30, 2019 reached 1 billion $286 million, a growth of $128 million, or 11% year-over-year. Revenue distribution by geography for the quarter was as follows : 48% of revenues came from Americas; 40% of revenues came from Europe, Middle East and Africa region; and the remaining 12% came from Asia-Pacific. Since the beginning of the year, I remind you, Middle East and Africa is our part of the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, while before it was part of Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa region.The revenue distribution by geography for Q2 last year, after the reclassification, would have been 48% of the revenues from Americas, 41% of revenues from Europe, Middle East and Africa region, and the remaining 11% from Asia Pacific. You can see our region had growth this quarter. We continue to invest in our sales force and marketing in order to execute our growth strategy. As a result, non-GAAP operating margins for the quarter were 50%, same as previous quarter Q1, and in line with our plans. Our financial income this quarter was $21 million. Since the beginning of the year, we see a change in trends, with a decrease in our portfolio yield as a result of lower interest rate expectations in the US, hence our financial income for the next quarter is expected to be around $20 million. Effective non-GAAP tax rate for this quarter was 19%, similar to the first quarter of this year. GAAP net income for the quarter was $186 million, or $1.21 per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $211 million, or $1.38 per diluted share, $0.02 above the midpoint of our guidance. Our cash balances as of June 30, 2019, were $4.110 million compared to $4.42 million last year. Our operating cash flow was $233 million, compared to $213 million in the second quarter of 2018, and 9% increase year-over-year. Collections from customers continues to be very strong. Our operating cash flow includes tax and balance sheet hedge transaction, which can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. Excluding these items, our operating cash flow increased by 4%. During the quarter we utilize the maximum quarterly buyback authorized and purchased 2.8 million shares for $325 million.Now let's turn the call over to Gil for his comments. -- Thank you, Tal, and hello everyone for joining us today, I'm pleased with our second quarter financial results. There is just about the mid point of our projection. But more importantly, our execution and transformation continue to improve. When I speak about transformation. I am addressing the modernization of IT security environment, protecting the IT infrastructure against Gen V attacks, and expanding the security coverage into the cloud, mobility and IoT spaces. In the second quarter, we made good progress around IT modernization. Our cloud business has grown quite significantly, more than doubling in size this quarter.We've introduced new solutions for security and data analysis with the new Log.ic cloud security solution that takes information from cloud providers and processes that into meaningful insights and actions. In the first quarter, we introduced Maestro solution enabling cloud-like elasticity for customer security environment, using our Hyperscale technology. In the second quarter, Maestro demonstrated solid traction with many new projects. We've continue to modernize and upgrade our core product line, with the introduction of the mid range 6500 and 6800 security appliances in the first quarter, and continued in the second quarter we've been introduction of the high-end 16,000 and 26,000 security appliances. These security appliances are optimized for Gen V security operation. Today, we're launching our highest-end model of the 26,000 series that delivers performance of over 300 gigabits of raw firewall and 30 gigabits of Gen V security, a 50% increase from previous models. The 16,000 and 26,000 security appliances are powered by our latest version of security software [indecipherable] , which features many new and unique capabilities, including advanced threat prevention for web downloaded content and the ability to process SSL security with higher levels of security and performance. While our progress this quarter primarily reflects technology advancements for the cloud and network environment, we also made good progress with our execution in the field. For example, in Asia Pacific, we had a terrific quarter with double-digit growth and we've substantially increased field and marketing activities. This success can be largely attributed to our new APAC leader who joined us at the beginning of the year.In the US, we saw quite healthy trends this quarter. Product growth in the US resumed, and the majority of region demonstrated healthy growth rates. We've also significantly increased our marketing activities. In the first quarter, we had almost 10,000 participants at our free global CPX 360 conferences across Asia, America, and Europe. In the second quarter, we took the Check Point Experience Program locally we 37 events in different cities around the world, tripling the number of participants to almost 11,000.Our headquarters hosted many Chief Information Security officers, including two large events, each attended by over 100 seats sold, including major global Fortune 100 companies. Our research team continued to generate grateful findings regarding malware and when there abilities in mobile and cloud. In the mobile space, we found a vulnerability in Xiaomi mobile devices, which may affect over 100 million devices. We also found malware named Agent Smith that actually affected hundreds of applications and over 25 million Android users. Additionally, we discovered a vulnerability in Electronic Arts, Apex Legends game that could have affected over 300 million online users, another vulnerability which is a result of the security challenges associated with cloud infrastructure. Our research team is exposing a lot of vulnerabilities, enabling customers and vendors to fix them and stay out of trouble.However, there are many other cases where enterprises don't secure themselves that well, and the quality of security does matter. To make things worse, in addition to the cost of business operation, technology, confidence and reputation, which are part of being breached, companies are now being fined pretty hefty amounts by regulators. Just in the past few weeks, more than $1 billion in combined fines were given out to three companies that suffered major breaches. I believe that these cases could have been prevented in real time by using the right technology at the right place, instead of being detected months after the damage has already occurred. We have a big mission to educate the market with real-time prevention of cyber attacks is possible. Our Infinity architecture is unique in that sense, and can really make a difference.So overall, I'm quite pleased with the progress we made in the second quarter. We have produced good financial results and are on track to improve our operation and potentially generate even better results. We continue to bolster our management team with the addition of new leadership for Telco initiatives, and we intend to further augment our management team. For the third quarter, my usual caveat continues to hold true, with the predicting the future is always a challenge and there may be surprises, lower or higher. With that in mind, I'd like to share the forecast for the third quarter. Revenues are expected to be between $480 million to $500 million, and non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be between $1.36 to $1.44. GAAP EPS is expected to be approximately $0.19 lower. Now, we are happy to take your insightful questions.Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. Please proceed. -- Great, thanks so much for taking my question. My first one is for Gil, and I've got a follow-up for Tal. Gil, it seems your commentary would suggest you're seeing evidence of improvement in sales execution. But at the same time, it would also seem you're growing a bit less than the overall market. And I know you generally always tell us that the environment for cyber security spending remains robust. But is there any reason to believe that if we look at it today or in Q2 versus Q1, or perhaps even a year ago, that there has been a change in the spending backdrop in the category? -- I don't know if there is any change in the overall spending. I think the market is healthy. Now it's not the market which shows signs of weaknesses. There are many changes in the marketplace and I think we're very well equipped to handle them from a technological perspective. From a field perspective, we definitely need to go through some changes, and we are going and we are investing in them, and I think it shows. We need -- we are going higher up in the organization to cover a broader spectrum of solution. We are selling more architectural approaches that requires sometimes people that our train differently, different sales cycles. And I think we are making all the right investments. You can see that in our sales and marketing spend, but it's not just the spend, it's really the change in the education and the expertise that we are learning as we are bringing to market. And what I'm saying, but I'm optimistic, I think it's because I'm seeing a lot of internal trends in activities in measuring other managerial measurements that I'm very, very focused on, and I think that in the first half of this year and definitely in the second quarter we saw some big internal changes. -- Thanks very much, Gil, and Tal, just to follow up. We're seeing Check Point step up in sales and marketing investment this year, which given the market opportunity and your strong technology, seems a very rational move. And I know you think more in dollars than percentages, but we've seen op margin tick down, even if slightly again this quarter. Where should we expect it to inflect or perhaps asked differently, how are these investments beginning to pay off versus your original plan heading into the year? -- It's actually completely in line with our plan. We said that our margin will be this year around 49% to 50%. So it's in line with our plan. The main expense is a result of the continued increase in our headcount, continued increase in our marketing efforts. We had many, just as an example, providing the CPX. Historically we used to have 3 CPXs, now we had more than 40, we had 40 CPXs, locally and globally. So we are stepping on the gas when it comes to digital marketing, event marketing, and we start to see results and leads coming out of that. So that's nice to see. It takes longer than -- it's not one quarter investment and then the quarter after you see it, it's over time you should see the fruits of that translating into growth in the revenues. Remember also that the trend of the move from product into subscriptions, from product into cloud, all of those cloud is also subscription for us creating a lot of pressure on the product lines.So at the end of the day, it should to translate into our growth in the booking and in the revenue. -- Thank you so much for taking the questions.Our next question is from Michael Turits with Raymond James. Please proceed. -- Hey guys, good morning, good afternoon. Quickly Gil and Tal, you didn't comment on the full-year guidance. Is the preceding, the prior full-year guidance, still in place? -- Yes, we are keeping the guidance, absolutely. -- Thanks, Tal. And then, I wonder if you could be specific at all about some of the trends relative to the hiring and productivity of the sales force. Where are you in terms of sales attrition, if we just say 2017, 2018, and 2019? And where are you over that three-year period in terms of the percentage of the sales force this is that full quota productivity? Just so we can get a sense of where we are in terms of the transition? -- First, it's hard to deduct from attrition if it\s good or bad. I think Attrition this year was lower than the previous year, and but depends where in the world, especially in the US. Some of it is very good. Some of it we should do more attrition to handle cases where we need to improve, but overall there is no -- I mean, it's stable with some positive trends around that. -- Okay, and can you comment on the level of productivity? In other words, what percentage of your sales force was that full productivity this year, where it might bottom, and when do you expect that to improve? -- Actually remember the productivity is a result of the target provided. We provide targets that are not easy to reach. So I will say productivity is probably similar to last year. We see, think about it -- the way we look at it is in order to see at the end of the day the booking, it starts with much earlier measurements. Meaning in there we start to see a significant improvement. It starts from meeting customers meeting new customers, all the way to building pipeline, moving from pipeline to best case, from best case to commit, and commit to bookings. So that's the whole cycle, and the more complicated the transactions are and more holistic, then the longer it takes to close the deal. So with tracking those trend when it comes to meetings and the pipeline before you get into the bookings, and there we start to see a nice improvement. -- Okay, thanks guys.Our next question is from Shaul Eyal with Oppenheimer & Company. Please proceed. -- Thank you. Good afternoon, everybody. One for Gil. one for Tal. Gil, the the new Check Point reward plan, any preliminary view? How is it being viewed by the sales force, by the channel partners? It is somewhat different from what some of your competitors are doing. So just interested in understanding how it's being perceived out there. -- Okay, so I'll just to recap with we launched last quarter a new partner program called Engage, and I think a big part of the partner program is to base the rewards and all of that on activity level. It's done through an app. Sales reps of the partners collect points by doing sales activities like marketing activities, like meeting with the customers. And through the point system, just like in [indecipherable], we can reward and give more points to things, to activities that we feel are more important, I think that's a quite a unique approach and I haven't seen a lot of similar things in our marketplace. We just started with that. I can tell you that a nice percentage of our partners have already signed up, and they're using the app. The top partners that we have, the real top tier of partners. More than 70% of the companies have signed up for the program and have started using the application. For the reps that are using the application, we are seeing activity level like we expected for the niche when you launch something new. Like how do you said the reward targets, how many points you give, I mean how to estimate how many activities people are actually doing. So we are seeing good activity level, but it is just the beginning. I think that we will have a lot of learning during the implementation of it because it is a novel approach, that at least we didn't try before. And I think it is based on my belief that what we should focus on is on the activities. If we do the right activities, if we will work together with our partners, then we will achieve the results together. -- Got it, got it. And one for Tal, then maybe Gil if you want to comment about it, and maybe also building on Brad and Michael's prior productivity-related questions. So if you're bringing today, if you're hiring a new sales rep, whether you brought in from a competitor or from another organization, how many quarters does it take until he or she are up and running and already providing revenues, and hence commissions? -- It really varies in the region of the world that the rep himself is bringing with him, the set of the connections that is already involved, but mainly in the type of the accounts. So for a global account, it can take -- by the way, global accounts in general, the sales cycle can be multiple years. For a smaller transaction, it can be three months. So I would say that the average is around six months, but there is a big variance between the person, the type of accounts, and the specific situation. Like if somebody is stepping into a region, which is with healthy activity and everything works well, it picks up where the previous rep left. And somebody stepping in into a region when the rep, when the previous wasn't doing a good job, or when there wasn't a previous rep and we need to build everything from scratch, it will take longer.So, I don't think that a clear answer, but I would say the average is somewhere north of six months. -- Understood. Thank you very much.Our next question is from Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo. Please proceed. -- Yeah, thanks guys for taking my question. A question to Gil first, just on the pricing environment. If you think about actually by tiers of customers, kind of Telco's large enterprise, mid-sized businesses, anything that you'd want to call out there from a price environment, but also just from a demand perspective too, that'd be great. -- I think there is the pricing environment, and the whole environment remains competitive. We haven't seen any major trends in the discounting environment , and all of it remains quite stable, which is a good sign because for years it did change and I think now it's a little bit more stable. -- Got it, and then also if you think about just that environment, sort of across the tiers too, anything you'd kind of highlight, especially now that we're six months through the year, versus last year? Any changes? -- Not really. I think that we have we have plenty of opportunity. I think we're not missing opportunity. I think a lot of it is up to us, to our execution. For example, I mentioned that with growth last quarter a new leader for global telco activities we brought in, because we think that there is a much higher potential in telcos, even though we are doing quite well with some telcos. But I think the potential is really much higher, but on the same time, I can't say that there is a single sector that I would say is kind of saturated. We have plenty of opportunities, we have plenty of new customers to win, and we have plenty of existing customers where we can expand. -- Great, thanks guys.Our next question is from Shebly Seyrafi with FBN Securities. Please proceed. -- Yes, thank you. So, I saw that your billings growth was flat year-to-year, and it decelerated for the past two quarters. Can you talk about the strength of your pipeline going forward? -- It's actually not really relating to the pipeline. The pipeline actually grew, especially when we talk about the product pipeline, which is very important to us as well. It's really relating to the fact that in the first half of last year we had a few very, very, very large transactions. We talked about some of them. You can see in Q2 we had two large transactions last year of 10s of millions of dollars, which typically do not repeat. It's a multi-year typically. I always say that when it's a multi-year, you need to look at the year-over-year.So when you look at the deferred revenue growth, the year-over-year, you see 11%, and when you look at the implied booking -- which again, we don't report booking because there can be a big variation between implied booking and booking in revenues because of the multi-year, which is the math you just did. Multi-year has a huge effect on booking in our industry. And lastly, we had a few very large multi-year transactions, which obviously they were signed in Q2 last year. Now for two years, we will not see. So for example, if you had a $50 million, $60 million multi-year for 3 years, then you got last year a big pick and this year, you will see minus 20, basically, from the potential. So I would be cautious when looking at the implied booking. -- Okay, and just to be clear, you didn't have those large transactions in the back half of last year or so. Are you suggesting that headwind goes away in the back half of this year? -- Actually, to admit I don't remember if we had in the back half. I need to go and look into the numbers. I know clearly about Q2 just because when we analyzed the numbers we saw two very large transactions they were tens and millions, and obviously it's created that pressure on the booking this quarter, naturally. -- And of course, there is nothing bad in this transaction, it just skews the measurements year-over-year. -- Okay. Separately, it looks like according to my math, your EMEA revenue growth decelerated to 2% roughly, from 9% in Q1. You did well in Asia, but what happened in Europe? -- Actually, Europe, where we had the strongest one in Q1. So sometimes you need to look at the year-to-date in order to see the full effect. So you're right, Europe had a weaker quarter this quarter and they had a very strong quarter in the previous one. -- No, it is just lumpy, is what you're saying? -- Yeah. It can happen. -- Okay, thank you.Our next question is from Andrew Nowinski with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed. -- Great, thank you. I was just wondering if you could provide any color on how you think Check Point is positioned in security for cloud-based applications relative to Palo Alto's GlobalProtect cloud services and Zscaler? -- I think it's the many different ways. I think first, this area is an area that we are addressing, we are building the solution, and I think we'll see some nice solutions there. I think you look at the overall cloud services that we provide, we have a much more integrated and comprehensive approach to cloud security. Again, what you asked about is one aspect of security, about remote access and some small branch offices, which is an area which is right now not the key focus of what we did. But I think we are addressing it, and we'll have some nice solutions to that. Overall in the cloud, I think we are making great progress in cloud security management and in building the future cloud architecture with what we call Infinity 2.0, which will provide very robust and comprehensive cloud security architecture, one that I think nobody has and nobody is actually building at the moment. So I think that in general on the overall cloud we are positioned quite nicely. -- Okay. Thank you. And then I just had a question on your product revenue growth, or lack thereof. You had some new product launches this quarter at the high end, and I know you said you're going through a big mix shift to subscriptions, but I'm just wondering, when do you think revenue will perhaps return to growth, given some of the new appliances you launched? Thanks. -- It's a very good question. I think first of this quarter, we had some positive trends around that. So internally the metrics that I'm seeing is actually quite positive. I did mention in my comments that in the US, for example, when we had the challenge with product growth, we did see appropriate growth this quarter, which is a very good sign. I think overall I would say that my main focus is looking at the business growth overall. I think moving to subscription is a very positive thing, and then I think that part of the business is growing, and unsteady, and we're developing more and more methods to understand, to analyze, to understand the real impact of that because sometimes it can be confusing. Like when you signed a multi-year deal, it looks like subscriptions are growing, but they are not really growing. So we actually have good metrics for that and we are positive this quarter from everything I've analyzed, and I've seen the trends are positive. And hopefully if we do the right thing, then also product growth will be stronger. And when all of that comes together, we will have even better results. -- I would just add, though, when you look at the longer term, our goal is to grow in products naturally. We focused on it, we have a lot of focus on that, and we saw like you said, nice trends this quarter. But I will say when you look at the long-term trends, it's clear that the entire industry, and we cannot ignore it in the background, is putting a lot of pressure on product by choice and moving all of it into subscription, support type of revenues, which is recurring. Infinity is recurring model, cloud is recurring, virtual licensing now is recurring revenues, also in subscription. So all the new products have been launched as a subscription. Now historically, you had the gateway as the product, and all of the add-on security solutions as subscription. Now, even the product itself, which is the license for the firewall if you want to call it that way, is built on the cloud or as a virtual in the private cloud, is now being the subscription as well from two years ago.So it's naturally putting a lot of pressure on that line that is called product, and that's why our focus is on the total growth. -- Understood. Thank you very much.Our next question is from Dan Ives with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed. -- Yeah, thanks. To the prior question, when you think about cloud and the dynamics going on there, do you continue to think you can get there organically, building out sales and obviously the product portfolio? Or just maybe talk about M&A and obviously you've done some M&A, but just maybe talk about that philosophically, how you're thinking about out organically versus M&A? -- First, we've already made a couple of acquisitions in the cloud. So it's not a theoretical question. We do think that we can use our technologies in the domain as an example, and the ForceNock that we made at the beginning of the year is another example. I think overall my belief with the strength of what we provide -- and not just the strength of what we provide, but the real value of security -- is not having a supermarket of few dozen products, each one addressing a slightly different niche of security from a different standpoint, but sold from the same vendor. The value of security is really combining it to one architecture. At this point, from what I see in the marketplace, we remain the only vendor that is actually implementing this approach.Our competitors are not doing well in terms of providing unified architecture, and the ones which are expanding are doing it with, again, many different fragmented solutions that don't really connect to each other and don't provide one high level of security for all the different needs. And I think in the long run, I'm a big believer that that approach is a must, and will win. And I think, I mean, so the combination of one, what we have the FRED cloud, one set of technologies that are very strong in security and multiple delivery methods -- delivery on the cloud, delivery on the network, within-the-cloud delivery for a SaaS cloud application, and so on and so forth, is critical. That's the only way to deliver the security level that the world needs, and that's what we have today, and that's what we are expanding and building. -- Thank you.Our next question is from Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed. Greg, please check and see if your line is muted. -- Thanks very much and good afternoon, guys. Gil, I didn't hear much commentary on Infinity in your prepared remarks this quarter. And so, just wondering how demand for Infinity is tracking relative to your expectations thus far? -- So actually, we're doing fine with Infinity. Revenues from Infinity were better this quarter, basically because we've got deals both from this quarter and previous quarters. And new deals, we signed pretty much the same amount of deals that we signed in the first quarter, which is good. Much more than, of course, what we've done in the previous years when we just started. And the overall pipeline Infinity keeps growing, and keeps growing in pretty big numbers. So I think overall, I'm pleased with what we're doing with Infinity. T the potential is high. The execution, actually, the nice things to see is that it scales from small businesses to medium businesses to few even very large deals. So we have potential in all the different market segments. So I think we're making good progress on that. -- Okay. Thanks, Gil and then you also talked about R80.30 I know it has enhanced SSL inspection, as well as threat extraction in some other capabilities. Do you see R80.30 though as something that can drive incremental revenue per customer on a go-forward basis? How are you thinking about that? -- I think we [indecipherable] potential for more revenues more customers, more potential with the new features that customer needs. On the same time, keep in mind and not that I'm saying that there is any other option on the same time when you come with the new version that means that the customers have to spend the time upgrading and investing in the upgrade process itself, but sometimes slows them down from expanding because upgrade in our marketplace is still -- especially by the way, the large customers, for them doing an upgrade cycle is a very long and resource-intensive process. So overall I think in our market, the right thing to do and what we must and I think we are the strongest in one is upgrading the customer base, bringing them all the time with the best security with the highest level of security I think that's where we excel and from an operational standpoint to upgrade our time consuming for everyone. -- Okay, thank you very much.Our next question is from John DiFucci with Jefferies. Please proceed. -- Thank you. I have a two-part question. And I think the first one sort of a follow-up to Shebly's, so Tal, I think even even the short-term or current billings were a little bit below our expectations. They were up less than a percent year-over-year. I guess can you provide any more commentary on that? That's not affected by duration. And perhaps the product launches at the end of the quarter could have delayed some purchases and thinking, but it sounds like sales execution has seen some progress, so that's the first part. And the second part is what follow-through have you seen after those launches over the last, it's only been 3.5 weeks since the end of the quarter, especially as Gil said, that you've announced the highest-end 26,000 Series model launched today. So just kind of trying to get a sense here because business looks stable, but it just feels like you could be doing a little better? -- Sure. First, also, when you calculate the implied booking it's also affects the multi-year, even in the short run, because if you would have got each year and the right time. The deal of that year, then you would have seen the growth because the deal that was signed last year was not just a renewal, it was a significant growth. So you missed that growth in the calculation of the implied this year. But putting that discussion aside, you're absolutely right when we talk about the launch of the new products Typically when you have a new product line, then it takes time for the customers to check it, and when you talk about the high-end, then high end need to get an approval for this new products, what you call certify the new product, and that can delay some transactions. Remember that the launch of the high-end was toward the end of the quarter. So it's still within the reflecting the numbers almost. Also remember that when you launch a new product, you can have some cannibalization between families, when people get much more throughput in a new product and they can choose to go one level down get more throughput and pay less. It's a short-term but phenomena. But it's good for the business because it increases throughput of the customers. When they're more throughput than they can adopt new technologies and new subscriptions in the later stage. So it's good for the longer, but sometimes in the short run, it's creates pressure and it definitely creates pressure, yes. -- Any commentary over the last three and half weeks? I mean I'd, let's say, that's a very short time. I know, since the end of the quarter. But we sort of expect to see some benefit after the launch of these products. -- It's very high. I haven't seen since updated numbers. The quarter started strong and very well, which we never say. But even if I say, it doesn't matter, some quarters start strong and end weak, some quarters start weak and end strong. So I just think I look this morning on my dashboard all the lights were green and I was very happy. But it's not an indication to how we will end the quarter, just to be just to be clear. -- Okay. But we like to hear when you're happy, Gil. So thanks a lot.Our next question is from Walter Pritchard with Citibank. Please proceed. -- Thanks. I guess, Tal, just to clarify the comment before on the product side, it sounds like it's too early to tell the impact of the new products. Any sense as to whether or not some of those impending product launches impacted negatively product sales in Q1 and Q2, just given customers new those were probably coming and might have been waiting and not purchased in front? -- It's absolutely impossible to calculate it, but we can you can theoretically see what was things that were in commit or in best case and didn't happen, and been delayed to a quarter after. But it's too theoretical to calculate. It's obvious because we've been doing this refreshes for a while, we know when we come with the new product line, the market is evaluating it, it takes time to go through the channel. Many times their partners want to sell the old until they learn about the new. It takes time, right? So it's typically -- but the high-end, what I recall from the last time, and the high-end typically take slightly longer because it's sometimes required, if it's a very large customer, then it requires internal certification from their end. -- I would also add that we use the new product to make some more Just, replacing your model with a faster model. We did use that opportunity to make slight changes to the business model. For example, how we do subscription for the new models, so we are trying a new model for subscription, which we think is very competitive. And any change like that kind of positive effects, and can have some negative effects because the changes business behavior. That's for the model that we launched the to 16.000 and 26,000. We are trying to, we are applying the same changes now for the 6500 which we introduced in the first quarter. And again, there we also been some changes to how we conduct business, with for example, it came up with models with are more competitive and have much better price performance. So we try to limit the level of discounting that are given to them. I think it was successful, but again it sometimes delays things in sometimes caused some disruption. So it's not just technical changes in the product. We are using the new product launches to try some new business changes that hopefully in the long run will have positive effect. -- And then, Tal, on the sales investments, can you talk about, as you move into the second half and then looking at next year, how are you determining and especially how could we, in terms of us looking at the financial statements, get a sense as to whether not it makes sense for you to be investing incrementally more into sales and marketing in 2020? -- I think it's way too early. I mean, you know everything happens in Q4. I think we don't look at that yet. We need to see how the year is closed, we need to look at the productivity, we need to look at everything in Q3, and specifically in Q4, in order to make the plan for 2020. Typically we start our planning in Q3, but it stands there and waits until the results of Q4 enough to, that we do, we have the final budgeting. So it's a bit early to talk about it now. -- Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions.Our next question is from Ken Talanian with Evercore ISI. Please proceed. -- Hi, thanks for taking the question. First off, I was wondering, were there any changes to your renewal rates on either maintenance or software blades? -- Not really, no. -- Okay. And then, are you seeing any sales cycles extend as Infinity is presented as a purchase option? -- Can you repeat the question please? -- Are you seeing sales cycles extend as Infinity is presented as a purchase option to customers? -- Infinity, by definition, basically offers the customer the entire product portfolio -- from the network, to the endpoint, to the cloud, to the mobile. So when customers are interested in that, it can take longer time having that I saw some transactions that closed really fast, and I saw some transactions that closed longer than we felt. So it really depends on the size of the customer and his readiness. -- Maybe as a quick follow-up to that, are you giving an incentive to sales reps or channel partners to push Infinity? Are they getting an extra benefit if they are able to close a deal there? -- Yes, they do. But again, it's more, I think, about the customer. The customer is the one who is supposed to take all these technologies and implement them over the next few years. So the answer is yes, we give more incentive, but it's an incentive there is in proportion to the potential for us and the growth opportunity for us. -- And by the way, there's an inherent incentive because Infinity deals are much, much larger than point product deals. But still I think the main value is not -- especially on a strategic deal for the customer, the customer is the one to determine if they need to get convinced and they need to do the due diligence. And by the way, in many cases, they need to combine different forces from different sub-departments of security, networking, and operation to make the decision, so yes. -- Thanks very much.Our next question is from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. Please proceed. -- Hi, thank you. I had two related questions, I'll ask concurrently. The first is per the previous question. I just want to try to clarify, do you believe that you're seeing an impact, or the market impact, from offload capabilities like Zscaler? Is that impacting firewalls, in your judgment? And the second is, as you think about today, you've talked about the move to subscriptions and Infinity, but as you think about your portfolio how much do you think, or could you give us some estimation about how much your revenues are non-firewall today? And how do you think about that over the next two to three years? How do you feel like you want to, or seek to, diversify your revenue streams? Thank you. -- So first, I don't think that right now technologies like what Zscaler has, has much impact or direct competition with what we're doing. It may be a marginal one, but not in the mainstream market and we don't see a lot of, I mean, a real head-to-head competition between the two areas. It's definitely an area for expansion for us, at least. As for how to classify the revenue, that's a very interesting question. It really depends what you classify as firewall, what you classify as non-firewall. For example, take all over subscription revenues, which is a advanced technology which is way beyond the basic firewall and with today, bigger than the basic firewall sales. So that's one example. So I think it's -- I don't have the number from the top of my head, but if I look at the beyond the maintenance and support that we sell, the portion of advanced technology, advanced security technologies and capabilities today, it is probably bigger than the basic network firewall portion of our sales. -- I would have said as a rule of thumb, it's exactly what Gil said in the sense that what you have right now in the product line, and that's why it's such a tough line to grow, is basically the appliance or the initial license, which includes the architecture and the firewall. And everything else is in the line of the subscription, meaning the antivirus, anti-spam, advanced threat protection, and Next Generation Threat Protection, our SandBlast, our cloud licensing, and our mobile, and the endpoints. The majority of the rest, which is the add-on technologies is not all, but in a high-level, I would say is in that line. And as you can see, even if you look at this quarter, you will see that the product realizes what was $122 million and the subscription was already $149 million. So it's, bypass that. -- All right, thanks very much, team.Our next question is from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Please proceed. -- Hi guys, this is Matt, on for Sterling. Thanks for taking the question. So I know someone was asked previously about the Europe performance. I just wanted to ask if there are any changes happening in the sales force similar to what was done in the US, and if there are other factors that contributed to the result? Thanks. -- No, I think in Europe, we are quite stable, management structure is good. We did have a very good Q1. I think Q2 figs continue to happen, but wasn't the strongest Q1. And hopefully we began will see few more quarters that are strong very later in the year. -- Great, thanks.Our next question is from Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. -- Well, thank you. I just had two clarifications. Gil, your comment that product growth resumed in the US, I thought was interesting and encouraging. Just to put it in context, when was the last time you saw US product growth? Was it the first half 2017, when Check Point's overall product growth was last positive? And then I've got a followup. -- I don't remember exactly, but I think you're in pretty much the right, the right time frame. Your calculations, I think, are in the right framework. -- Okay, helpful. And then the second clarification again for you, Gil. In response to a previous question, you used the phrase that there were ""big internal changes at Check Pointy"" you mentioned in Q1, and especially in 2Q. Just to be super clear, what were you referring to? And assuming you are referring to leadership changes, were there one or two that were particularly significant? I just want to be clear on what you meant by that. Thanks a lot. -- First, I'm doing a lot of changes in getting, not just me. I mean, the entire team here focused on a lot of changes in inflecting sales measurement, sales discipline, and being much more clear, and about the activity levels of people in the field. In terms of management changes, we're also filling a lot of positions and sometimes replacing a lot of places. We think we can have more potential. I mentioned Telcos as one. I think we are making more and more changes in the US sales leadership, and you will see some more changes around that pretty soon. We're doing a lot of training to people in the field. At the beginning of the year we brought a new leader for channels worldwide, a position we didn't have before. I don't remember when was the last time we put so much emphasis on working with the channel and doing it in a global level from the highest level to the lowest level. I mentioned the new leader for Asia that we brought in the beginning of the year.So again, if I'm trying to recall from my memory, we are doing a lot of changes. We just promoted somebody internal to run the sales enablement and sales planning and promote somebody else to take her position in another department. So there are a lot of changes. We are OK. Most of these are not big revolutions that effect things negatively, it's growth with a few new people from the outside. And I think the most important one is, I think, we're very, very focused on the things we're trying to achieve -- activity management, new customers, working with the partners, and the whole growing higher level in the food chain, Infinity consolidation, and all with family of attributes that I think are one big focus area. -- All right, OK. Thank you, Gil. That's very helpful.Our next question is from Saket Kalia with Barclays. Please proceed. -- Hi guys, thanks for fitting me in here and taking my questions. I'll just keep it to one, just in the interest of time for you, Tal. Tal, can you just give us a quick refresh on ITP and its impact to billings? Specifically, can you just remind us if these deals are largely annual and advance for multi-year commitments, and how do you sort of think about how we should look at billings as that business grows? Because it clearly sounds healthy, and so I wonder if billings is really capturing all of that as that billings kind of duration changes? -- So, the answer is the opposite. The billing doesn't catch it because it's typically a multi-year deal. And typically the -- let's say the customer signs for three years, he has a commitment for three years. But you see in the billing typically only the first year because they pay annually, unless the chose to pay everything in advance, but in many of the cases, they pay annually. So it hurts your billing, although I got the bookings, which you can't see, so that's one point. Second, I will say -- and it's quite if it can be quite large deals that you can't see in the implied booking. The second, I would say, the accounting. You're absolutely right. When you look at those deals it is split between all the lines -- product, support, and subscription -- but a small portion of the deal is recognized as product revenue, as well as the majority of the deal is recognized as recurring revenues over the life of the contract. Because the way the deals are is that the customer gets everything Check Point can offer. So I gets all the subscription, all the endpoints, all the mobile, it gets everything. So when you do a fair value split of the deal, the majority of the dollars have been sucked into the subscription lines. Although it can get quite a lot of products, but in the product, you will see a smaller portion. So, it will be all the lines, but the majority will go through the recurring, and specifically to the subscription. -- That's very helpful. Thanks very much. -- Thank you.We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for closing remarks. -- Thank you all for joining us today. Obviously we'll catch-up with you throughout the quarter, and if you guys would like to talk after the call, please send me an email and we'll fit you in. If not, we'll catch-up with you during the quarter at the conferences or on the road during an NDR. Thanks,and have a great summer if we don't talk to you.

"ack at the beginning of the year,   looked like  for investors. The company had said goodbye to its conservative growth strategy, and had started spending money again in a bid to remain relevant in its highly competitive space.But following a solid start, Check Point's share price faltered after it turned in a mixed first-quarter earnings report. Though the company's revenue and earnings were on par with analysts' expectations, its second-quarter earnings guidance  of what they were looking for.As a result, Check Point stock has  in the past three months. But this is an opportunity for new investors.Image Source: Getty ImagesCheck Point's Q1 results were actually a bit ahead of expectations on both revenue and earnings. However, the midpoint of the company's Q2 earnings-per-share guidance range was slightly behind the analysts' consensus of $1.38.That two-cent difference isn't much to worry about, but it wasn't surprising to see investors taking money off the table, because the company admitted that there's something wrong with its sales execution in the Americas. In Q1, it got 45% of its revenue from the Americas, and 44% from Europe. The problem was that revenue contribution from the Americas was down on a year-over-year basis, as that region supplied 47% of the top line a year earlier. Meanwhile, overall revenue rose 4% during Q1.Management admitted that it needs to improve its performance in the Americas, and it is already taking steps to do so. During the , CEO Gil Shwed said the company was adding sales capacity so that it could go after new customers. Shwed believes that ""it's a matter of taking the time to see"" the fruits of those efforts.Investors can cross-check the CEO's comments by taking a look at Check Point's selling and marketing expenses. The outlay on this line item increased nearly 13% year over year during Q1. Check Point spent 28.6% of its total revenue on sales and marketing last quarter, up from 26.4% in the year-ago period. data by The company's higher outlays on this front seem to be reaping results. This is evident from the improvement in Check Point's deferred revenue, which increased 13% annually during Q1 to $1.3 billion. The fact that this metric grew at a faster pace than the actual revenue bodes well for the company's long-term growth.This is because  refers to the money received in advance for services that will be rendered at a later date. The double-digit-percentage improvement in this metric indicates that customers are committing to long-term contracts.Moreover, Check Point is witnessing an uptick in the number of large transactions. It struck 47 deals with a transaction sizes above $1 million last quarter, up from 44 in the prior-year period. All of this should help Check Point eventually deliver stronger top- and bottom-line growth.Check Point Software is trading at cheaper price-to-earnings ratios than its cybersecurity peers, and also enjoys a far stronger profit margin. data by This gives it room to ramp up its spending further and get its sales force working harder and smarter. So don't be surprised to see the company stage a comeback with a better-than-expected earnings report and sound guidance when it reports July 24. When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''.  These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand.  Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).  Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

"nvestors in Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd.  (Symbol: CHKP) saw new options begin trading this week, for the August 16th expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CHKP options chain for the new August 16th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $110.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.65.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $110.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $107.35 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CHKP, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $113.87/share today.

Because the $110.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 69%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.41% return on the cash commitment, or 17.24% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.


Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd. , and highlighting in green where the $110.00 strike is located relative to that history:


   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $115.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.00.  If an investor was to purchase shares of CHKP stock at the current price level of $113.87/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $115.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 4.51% if the stock gets called away at the August 16th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CHKP shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd. , as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing CHKP's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $115.00 strike highlighted in red:



   
Considering the fact that the $115.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 52%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.51% boost of extra return to the investor, or 25.14% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.


The implied volatility in the put contract example is 28%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 27%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $113.87) to be 22%.

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. 	For the Scientific Beta US ETF (Symbol: SCIU), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $35.07 per unit.


With SCIU trading at a recent price near $31.27 per unit, that means that analysts see 12.15% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings.   Three of SCIU's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Adobe Inc (Symbol: ADBE), Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd. (Symbol: CHKP), and C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. (Symbol: CHRW). Although ADBE has traded at a recent price of $259.03/share, the average analyst target is 13.85% higher at $294.90/share. Similarly, CHKP has 13.60% upside from the recent share price of $109.40 if the average analyst target price of $124.28/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting CHRW to reach a target price of $90.61/share, which is 13.55% above the recent price of $79.80. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of ADBE, CHKP, and CHRW:  

   Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:

Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

"(NASDAQ:) has pulled back in recent weeks from its post-dot-com boom highs. Cisco stock fell back after rising by almost 43% in less than four months. Since hitting that high, CSCO stock has declined to the $52 a share level.
Source: Shutterstock
	Now flirting with correction territory, many wonder if CSCO will fall further as it reports earnings on Wednesday after the market close. If so, with its double-digit profit growth and the future in 5G, I see CSCO stock as a buy on any pullback.For its third quarter, Wall Street expects Cisco to report earnings of 77 cents per share. If this holds, that would represent a 16.7% increase from year-ago levels of 66 cents per share. Analysts also forecast revenues of $12.9 billion. This would stand as a 3.5% increase from the same quarter last year when the company brought in $12.46 billion.Cisco stock has developed a reputation for frequently beating earnings over the last 20-plus years. I do not expect anything different this quarter. The company has worked to restore its reputation for something it has seen little of since the 1990s tech boom — stock price increases. Since the beginning of 2016, CSCO stock has more than doubled in value. Last month, it reached its highest level since the fall of 2000 before pulling back.Moreover, as my InvestorPlace colleague , the San Jose-based networking giant leads the way in the emerging Wi-Fi 6. The Wi-Fi 6 networking stack will offer 400% greater capacity and better performance in high-density areas. Though it lacks the publicity surrounding 5G, where Cisco has pursued a “” approach, it could become just as significant in many respects. Furthermore, the company’s moves into software and network security have also improved the fortunes of Cisco stock.Detractors point out that this is not the 1990s, and companies such as (NASDAQ:), (NASDAQ:), and (NASDAQ:) present genuine competitive threats. Still, while vendors certainly have other choices, Cisco brings a measure of stability and income not found in newer names.Case in point, CSCO stock trades at a price-to-earnings (PE) ratio that compares well to its younger peers. This valuation stands at around 19.5 times earnings, and it falls to a PE of 15.4 on a forward basis. Moreover, analysts predict the company will deliver profit growth rates of 18.1% this fiscal year and 10.1% in fiscal 2020.The 19.5x PE comes in at the high end of ranges seen in recent years. If the re-emergence of (NASDAQ:) serves as an example, Cisco stock could benefit from multiple expansion. Even if that does not occur, the profit growth rates alone make double-digit returns in CSCO stock likely.Investors should also remember one additional benefit to Cisco stock that did not exist in the 1990s — the dividend. Since the company began paying a dividend in 2011, it has increased its payout every year. The most recent increase went into effect in April. Now at an annual payout of $1.40 per share, the yield stands at around 2.5%.The eight-year streak is a long enough time that the equity’s price will depend heavily on annual payout hikes.  that Cisco stock would achieve dividend aristocrat status (meaning 25-plus years of annual payout hikes) in 17 years. Time will tell if that occurs. Still, for investors wanting a growth and income play in the networking sector, I see CSCO stock as one of the top choices in the coming years.Cisco stock has become a buy on any pullback, and pull back it has. The stock has corrected following a 40%-plus move higher from its December lows. Now, predictions for the upcoming earnings report strongly indicate that its double-digit growth will continue.If its track record serves as an indication, Cisco stock should beat earnings by at least a penny per share. Bolstered by a move into security and software, as well as its position in both 5G and WiFi 6, Cisco’s double-digit profit growth should continue for years to come. It could benefit further if CSCO stock sees Microsoft-like multiple expansion. Moreover, the eight-year track record of payout hikes adds a growing income stream to add to the returns.Perhaps Cisco stock rose too far and too fast over the last few months. Admittedly, it makes buying into earnings a riskier prospect despite a recent pullback. However, even with this potential hiccup, the likely rewards in CSCO stock outweigh the possible risks.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

"etwork security company   started off 2019 by delivering a mixed set of first-quarter earnings.  wasn't positive, but as ever, the devil is in the details. Let's take a closer look at what happened in the quarter.Starting with the headline numbers from the quarter:All told, revenue expanded 4%, but an 11.2% increase in operating expenses to $265.7 million meant operating income declined to $206 million from $213.4 million in the same quarter last year.Image source: Getty Images.As for near-term and full-year guidance, management bracketed the analyst consensus for both revenue and earnings:Management didn't change Check Point's full-year outlook, so the company still anticipates full-year revenue of $1.94 billion to $2.04 billion, representing growth of 1.2% to 6.5%. Similarly, the full-year non-GAAP EPS guidance range of $5.85 to $6.25 implies year-over-year growth of 2.5% to 9.5%.Again, Check Point's guidance is solid enough, but aside from the decline in operating income as a result of rising operating expenses -- which rose by $27 million to $265.8 million -- there were a couple of trends in the earnings that may have caused some concern.Going back to the third quarter of 2017, when Check Point's management first disclosed ""execution challenges"" in the U.S.,  around its sales and marketing efforts in its largest end market.  Management took action to restructure its sales organization and strategy, and by the second half of 2018, . However, the first quarter brought a disappointing performance, with Americas-region revenue similar to that in last year's first quarter. Management put the performance down to its own execution  in the U.S., with CFO Tal Payne stating that ""Europe did well and America still needs to improve."" Data source: company presentations. Chart by author. EMEA = Europe, Middle East and Africa. APAC = Asia-Pacific.The second possible concern is that product and license revenue continues to decline. This is not such a major issue, as Check Point bundles its software blades with its products, and revenue has been shifting toward subscription-based sales for some time -- the key is overall revenue growth.However, top-line growth has remained below 5% for the past six quarters in a row, and it's hard not to conclude that Check Point could do with some product sales growth to increase its installed base and generate future software-based revenue.Data source: company presentations. Chart by author.Check Point is the established leader in its field, and it has a nearly 90% gross margin to boot. As such, it's currently a low- to mid-single-digit revenue growth company with very high free cash flow generation (free cash flow equaled 78.2% of revenue in the first quarter). Given this profile, investors likely hope the company can hold its margin in the future while maintaining some revenue growth prospects.Clearly, Check Point intends to execute better in the U.S. in the coming quarters, and investors will expect the company to keep its operating expenses under control as it seeks to do so.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''.  These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand.  Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).  Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

Check Point assumes no obligation to update information concerning its expectations or beliefs, except as required by law.In our press release, which has been posted on our website, we present GAAP and non-GAAP results, along with the reconciliation of such results, as well as the reasons for our representation of the non-GAAP information.Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Tal Payne for a review of the financial results. -- Thank you, Kip. Good morning and good afternoon to everyone joining us on the call today.I'm pleased to begin the review of the first quarter. Revenues for the quarter increased by 4% year-over-year to $472 million, and our non-GAAP EPS grew by 2% to $1.32, both slightly above the mid of our guidance.Before I proceed further into the numbers, let me remind you that our GAAP financial results include stock-based compensation charges, amortization of acquired intangible assets and acquisition-related expenses, as well as the related tax effects. Keep in mind that as applicable non-GAAP information is presented excluding these items.Now, let's take a look at the financial highlights for the quarter.Product and security subscription revenues were $257 million. Our subscription revenues continue to be strong with 13% growth year-over-year, reaching $144 million. Our software update and maintenance revenues increased to $215 million, representing 4% growth year-over-year. The growth in our subscription revenues is driven by our advanced solutions, mainly cloud, SandBlast Zero day threat prevention and mobile.Infinity consolidated solution also started to flow into the revenues and show a nice trend. During the quarter, we had Infinity deals in variety of industries including finance, manufacturing, software and defense with a significant portion coming from new customers. We continue to see an increase in customers annual run rate in Infinity deals ranging from 10s to 100s (ph) of percentage increase, which is a great result. From an accounting perspective, a small portion of the deals is recognized as product revenues, while majority of the deals is recognized as recurring revenues over the life of the contracts. Majority as subscription and the remainder as support, update and maintenance.Deferred revenues as of March 31st, 2019 reached $1,312 million, a growth of $146 million or 13% over March 31st, 2018.Revenue distribution by geography for the quarter was as follows : 45% of revenues came from Americas; 44% of revenues came from Europe, Middle East and Africa region; and the remaining 11% came from Asia Pacific. Please note, since the beginning of 2019, Middle East and Africa are part of Europe region, while before it was part of Asia Pacific region. The revenue distribution by geography for Q1 last year, after the reclassification would have been 47% of revenues from Americas, no change, 42% of revenues came from Europe, Middle East and Africa regions, after the reclass and the remaining 11% came from Asia Pacific. Those were the numbers for Q1 last year after the reclass.From a deal size perspective, this quarter we had 47 customers with transactions over $1 million compared to 44 in Q1, 2018. Transactions greater than $50,000 was 71% of total order value similar to last year.Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 50% as we planned. We continue to invest in our sales force and marketing in order to execute our strategy, which revolves around prevention, management and consolidation of security. In addition, this quarter, includes the full effect of our recent acquisitions both of Dome9 and ForceNock.Our financial income for the quarter reached $19 million. The increase is in line with the higher interest rate levels in the US. Financial income expected to be around $20 million, $21 million a quarter in the remainder of the year.Effective non-GAAP tax rate for this quarter was 19% as planned again. Please note in the fourth quarter, we expect the tax rate to be around 0%, as the lapse of statute of limitation expected to occur by year-end.GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2019 was $180 million or $1.15 per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $205 million or $1.32 per diluted share, an increase of 2% from the first quarter of 2018 and $0.01 above the midpoint of our guidance.Our cash balance, as of March 31st were $4.2 billion compared to $4 billion in December 31st, 2018. Operating cash flow was $379 million, which includes part of ForceNock acquisition payment of $2 million. Collections continued to be very strong. During Q1 last year, we had $45 million tax refund. Excluding this item, our operating cash flow increased by 2%.During the quarter, we purchased 2.7 million shares for $305 million at an average price of $115 a share. This quarter, we implemented a new accounting standard ASC 842, which changed the recording of long-term operating leases in the financials. Accordingly, we recorded assets of $30 million against liabilities reflecting the value of these leases. There is no significant impact on the income statement.Now, let's take -- turn the call over to Gil for his comments. -- Thank you, Tal, and hello to everyone joining us today. I would like to begin today with a review of the highlight of what we witnessed during the first quarter and provide a little more color on our business beyond the numbers that -- that Tal just shared.Our first quarter was a big quarter in terms of events. We hosted our global Check Point Experience 360 conferences for employees, partners and customers around the world. This year CPX 360 conferences sets a new record for the number of participants and generated a high level of audience interest and enthusiasm. We had 30% more customers and almost 30% more partners attending the conference. During CPX, we are focused on our Gen V and upcoming Gen VI security architecture.As we've highlighted before, the vast majority of enterprises have security to address third generation cyber-attacks, which means that we are almost 10 years behind the current trend, and only 3% believe that we are protected against fifth generation attacks, which we're facing everyday. These stats (ph) brings to light how vulnerable the world infrastructure is today and the potential for catastrophic damage. If enterprises don't take measures to protect themselves against the current generation of attacks.During the last number of years, we've seen an almost 3X increase in the number of vulnerabilities discovered in the world technology infrastructure, operating systems, hardware, software, servers, critical infrastructure, et cetera. Last year, there were over 16,000 reported vulnerabilities with 800 in mobile operating systems and all. The fifth generation of attacks are usually multi vector attacks. It can be an app, which you download on your mobile, which steals your cloud credential and from there it gets into your internal data of the Company. It can be a file, which arrive through email and creates a chain attack like that.Dynamic payloads are using most attack tools today and can potentially turn every computer into an asset in a global cyber warfare. The escalation in Gen V attacks means that we have a huge challenge ahead of us and then even larger opportunity. While a big part of our marketplace still relies on the refresh of Gen II and Gen III customer environment, the real challenge and opportunity is in upgrading these customers to Gen V cyber protection and consolidating their security infrastructure.During our CPX conferences, we've also revealed more details on the sixth generation of our cyber security solution, one that we believe will revolutionize how security systems work. We believe it will evolve how people think about security architecture by changing the way, they are constructed. Today security architectures rely on monolithic systems that includes the delivery and the security technology in one big piece of software or hardware. These consume a lot of resources and are slow to adapt to the evolving trend. We intend to separate the security service and delivery by turning it into a cloud-based architecture that enables nano agent to bring the latest security innovation to every cloud app or IoT device, and of course, to all the aberrant (ph) elements of our network. These nano security agents combined with the smart cloud security brains will be the essential pieces of our Gen VI security architecture.During the first quarter, we introduced a number of new technologies beginning with the new 6,000 appliance series with improved price performance and optimized for Gen V advanced threat prevention. We also delivered Maestro a revolutionary security solution for scalable network that delivers performance, which could be achieved before at the fraction of (inaudible) cost. Maestro achieved these results by changing -- by chaining multiple security appliances together to deliver an almost linear improvement in performance. This hyperscale technology provides cloud-grade resiliency and elasticity. Unlike other solutions that are only targeting the super high-end of the market, Maestro can start at the medium business budget and scale all the way up to the performance needed by the largest networks in the world. Therefore, it opens a much broader marketplace with previous super high-end solution and enable cloud-grade elasticity across the marketplace.During the quarter, Check Point CloudGuard Dome9 received Security Innovation of the Year Award at the latest Cloud Awards. The recognition was for its comprehensive software platform for public cloud security and compliance orchestration. In addition, Check Point SandBlast Agent earned NSS Labs Recommending Rating in 2019 Advanced Endpoint Protection test. SandBlast Agent detected a 100% of HTTP and email threats and a 100% of malware using sophisticated evasion technique, while providing zero false positive.You may have also noticed, the recent Homeland Security announcement regarding remote access vulnerabilities in almost all of our competitors' product. As we've spoken about in the past, our biggest differentiator is the level of security we'll provide to our customers and our focus on prevention and protection. Needless to say that Check Point's product was highlighted as a product that is secured and doesn't suffer from any false vulnerabilities. On the sales front, we've been putting a lot of emphasis on winning new customers, consolidating the security for infrastructure, we were focused on cloud security and our Gen V infinity total solutions.Infinity deals also generated nice results this quarter with new customers ranging from a few 100 users to over 10,000 users and from the construction industry to high tech companies. We've seen some good signs of success in increasing new customer wins, especially in Europe. Once we are able to achieve a similar type of uplift in the US new customer wins, I believe, we will see an acceleration in our growth rate.In the US, we continue to make several improvements to our sales force. We brought senior leadership to our channel organization. We launched Check Point Engage, a new global channel program focused on joint sales activities between our partners and our people. The program featured Check Point, a reward program that measures sales activities at the individual level and rewards them points for their Check Point sales activities. The program will be rolled out gradually starting this month, and we intend to utilize the program as the basis for partner business model next year. Overall, looking at our global sales structure, we've seen areas with great improvements and we've seen areas, where improvement still needs to be realized.I believe that the opportunity ahead of us is much bigger than what we've seen before, while I'm happy with the progress we're making in some areas, our growth rate should be higher than what we've seen. This is a good time to address our projections for the second quarter. You know, my regular caveat projecting future results is very challenging. There is always a high level of uncertainty, results can be better or worse than our projections. With that in mind for the second quarter, revenues are expected to be in the range of $474 million to $500 million and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.32 to $1.40. GAAP EPS is expected to be approximately $0.17 lower than that.Thank you for your time, and I'd like to open the call for your questions.Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question today is coming from Michael Turits from Raymond James. Your line is now live. -- Hey guys, good afternoon, one for Gil, one for Tal. Gil you mentioned Gen VI as cloud delivered security. Does -- does that mean that you're going to try to approach things from -- in terms of cloud delivered securities -- the security from the cloud similar to what some of your competitors, they are doing secured web gateway from the cloud are doing. Is that a direct competition? -- I think, we will have some of these components, but the answer is -- is no. The short answer is, no. I think our architecture will be little bit different. I don't believe in routing all your traffic to the cloud, which slows down things. Companies don't want to do it for their internal traffic, and it's not going to work, fully scalable to bring security everywhere. What our architecture is based on is having this global threat cloud and that queries can be made (ph) to understand if -- if any transaction, a new connection and up transaction or anything basically that we want to test is -- is something that should work or shouldn't work.It -- it has a lot of effects, I mean, from the standpoint that, we can apply all security technologies to every query like that and it brings a lot of control back to the security professional as supposed to the people, who are in charge of the -- another people or go to the manufacturers of the equipment or the developers of application software. But it will have very positive effects on the -- on the overall performance, on the fact that data doesn't have to leave the enterprise, data will remain in its point and that's the whole concept of what we call the nano agents. -- Thanks, Gil. And Tal, your're -- your're glad as your product is being impacted by the shift to subscription and to Infinity, but you have been having moderating declines in product revenue, those worsened this quarter, got steeper again. Should we expect that you could go to either flat or positive product this growth in one of the quarters this year? -- See, I'm not projecting right now. We gave the guidance for the full year, and it does split between the line. The total guidance are -- are taking that into account. If there will be a more than expected quicker shifting to Infinity, while it's great news, it's going to affect bigger on the product. But in general if the products, I don't expect it that short time to become on a positive note, I expect the subscription to continue and grow. -- Okay. Thanks, Tal. Thanks, Gil.Thank you. Our next question is coming from Brad Zelnick from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live. -- Great. Thank you so much. I've got one for Gil and one for Tal as well. Gil, it sounds like there's a lot of exciting things happening in terms of new products and we're hearing more optimism from the channel. And as you said in your comments, there's still improvement to come, as you're making changes especially here in the Americas. So what -- what indicators are you looking at that give you the confidence to continue investing? And how long do you think it will take for Check Point to return to market growth rates? -- I think the indicators that I'm looking at mainly are the level of activities, how many new customers, are we meeting, how many C-level people are we meeting. Of course, we look at our measures like the pipeline and -- and things like that. But for me, the most important one is our own execution. How many of these activities are we making and by the way, how many are the partner -- our channel partners are making. And by the way, that's why we designed the -- the new channel program, the Engage program to work on that instead of measuring the -- the results after the fact measuring every week and every day how many of these activities, marketing, sales and so on, we're conducting. My belief from everything I know that we have more capacity. We can do more, and we can generate much more results that way. -- Great. Thank you. And Tal, I know Gil gave us the updated guidance on Q2, but we didn't hear any update as it relates to the full year. Is it fair to assume that your full-year guidance that you gave us last quarter still stands? -- Yes, definitely the full-year guidance stand. It's -- I gave you a bit more color this quarter, just to make sure that you see, which lines is coming from. You can see our sales and marketing are -- are higher than some of your models. while the financial income is higher, so you can balance between the two. But the results -- the annual results expected to be the same. -- Excellent. Thanks so much.Thank you. Our next question is coming from Shaul Eyal from Oppenheimer. Your line is now live. -- Hi, good afternoon, guys. Actually, I want to start with a question that hasn't been asked in some time now regarding the competitive arena. Do you believe that Check Point is actually gaining market share? -- I think it depends, how you look at. I think overall our growth numbers should be higher and we are aiming at that. I think with Infinity, we are actually capturing new land, we're getting to new spaces, and we are taking full architectures at few customers. The number of these customers right now is still small, but it's growing nicely and the first quarter was a great indicator of that. The dollar volumes on that can be significant, and we are seeing a mix of customers, some are small and small here is -- is hundreds of thousands of dollars, which is kind of large in our average scale (ph) and some are multi-million dollar contracts, which are good invert. And the main value for that -- that we actually give these customers the -- the full security to combat this cyber security challenges, which they have got and believe me, this is needed. -- Understood. And maybe one for -- one for Tal, so good work on deals greater than $1 million. My question is, were there any Dome9 and Infinity related transactions part of this, I think you had 40 -- I think 44 or 47 this -- this quarter, if I'm not mistaken? -- We had 47. I will say no. But some of Infinity deals are part of those deals and in it, you have also the cloud solutions, of course. -- Got it. -- So the answer is yes, on Infinity, and Infinity includes also Dome9 or there is stand-alone Dome9 in that category. I'm not sure. -- Got it. Okay. Thank you so much.Thank you. Our next question is coming from Phil Winslow from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live. -- Yeah. Thanks, guys for taking my -- taking my question. I just have one on the -- on the pricing front. Just curious what you're seeing just on the pricing environment out there, you're starting the year, and -- and then also, you're focusing and obviously specifically on Infinity too. Any sort of color there? Obviously, the pricing and packaging there is very, very different, but any sort of color and feedback that you're getting from -- from customers on Infinity and it's -- it's got a market price it would be great? Thanks. -- Yeah, I -- yeah, I can -- I can talk a bit about the Infinity deals that we sold. So -- so like we spoke before I'm following each one to see the trends there, and I continue to see, what we talked about in the previous quarter. We see deals like Gil said from a customers that have 100 users to customers that have more than 10,000 users, which is very nice to see that it's fitting small companies and very large companies.We see in terms of -- the customers significant portion is new customers, which is actually something, which is nice to see this quarter. It was even more than the previous quarter, so we see it helping us more and more with new customers penetration, again small number, but a nice phenomena, which hopefully will be a consistent trend, and we do see that the run rates are increasing significantly. So if it's customer that maybe had only firewall before, then once you buy Infinity, the increase in the run rate can be 100s (ph) of percentage. And if it's a customer that's already had NGTX and maybe cloud and the increase is only 10s of percentage, but it's still increasing the run rate, increasing the satisfaction, which is very nice to see, so that's the color.Revenue is very, very slow, revenue recognition actually. Remember the deals that we see are on average probably three years deals. You don't see it in the balance sheet. Most of them, you don't even see in the deferred revenues because it's annually invoiced. So it's a backlog that you don't see as part of the deferred revenues, and you see it in the revenue, the subscription and the support over the life of the contract. Majority of it is subscription unlike a typical regular customer that doesn't buy Infinity that's why, we will see a strong shift over there, over time. And smaller portion going to the product, then the product is recognized only once the customer is actually pulling the product. -- Got it. Great. Thanks. And then also just a follow-up for Gil on Dome9, you gave some commentary earlier on that now that you've on that for a couple of quarters there now what's the feedback been from customers and prospects? And how you think about the -- about Dome9 competitively out there? -- I think the feedback is actually very positive. We're seeing nice activity in the field. It's in the very early stages because the field now needs to learn the whole new Dome9. We've made a drastic shift in the go-to-market from a small sales force of -- of a handful of people to a large sales force with 100s of people that basically start from zero and need to learn the whole concept. But when I'm looking at the -- again the activities in the -- in the field what I sampled, I saw a lot of activity around Dome9. In CPX, we got a lot of positive feedback to Dome9. So I think it will take us some time to ramp up, but the feedback so far is -- is terrific. -- Great. Thank you.Thank you. Our next question is coming from Fatima Boolani from UBS. Your line is now live. -- Okay. Good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. I have one for Gil and one for Tal. Gil maybe a bigger picture question for you. Just with regards to the overall demand environment for perimeter based controls and perimeter based security, I think year-in and year-out, we continue to hear sort of next messages on where customers are actually focusing their cyber security energies and dollars, as it relates to product investments. I wanted to get your take on how the customers view on network security and perimeter based security like firewall solution is evolving? And then I have a follow-up for Tal. -- I think we're seeing good level of demand. I think -- I mean, I think people are still refreshing their infrastructure, some companies are still building new data centers. So I think the -- the challenge is not there. I mean, the demand is healthy. I think the challenge is how do we elevate the level of security and not how we compete on or things that are relevant for 10 years ago. It is a competitive marketplace and that is the challenge. But I think overall, there is a healthy demand. I don't see that the challenge is there, right here. -- Fair enough. And Tal maybe for you, just a quick housekeeping. On the reclassification of the geographic revenue. Was there any organizational change that prompted you to do that or it was just sort of a mechanical thing? And then more specific question on your -- subscription and maintenance revenues, they did declined sequentially. So I did want to understand some of the drivers that would have those subscription and recurring revenue line items down sequentially and that's it from me? Thank you. -- Okay. I'm not sure, I understood the second part, but let's first take the -- the first one. So structurally, we changed, Africa and Middle East is reporting to Europe now it's now called EMEA. So if you back -- if you remember 10 years ago, that's exactly how it was, we moved it back to EMEA. So now it's called EMEA and we moved those percentage. Obviously, it's a smaller region, but it's moved to report into the Europe, Middle East and Africa structure versus APAC, Asia Pacific. So as we changed structurally, then we also reclass the revenues in the P&L, of course. -- And I think it's just -- it's internal managerial issue, then mainly if you look at the geography, especially we are in Israel and we are part of the Middle East. Geographically, we're in Asia, but in terms of proximity, we are much closer. In the distance, we are one-third of the distance to Europe and we are to the headquarters in Asia. So it's -- so I mean, there is always these two balances. -- Yeah. -- Yeah. Makes sense. And just to clarify the second question around the sequential decline in blade subscription and maintenance and support revenue in the quarter. Just wanted to understand some of the dynamics that would have those recurring revenue line items down sequentially, whether if you -- whether you can shed light on renewal rate or blade subscription package renewal rates and -- and any dynamics there? Thank you so much. -- (multiple speakers) actually not -- not relating to a renewal rate, it's relating to the fact that in the -- even in the subscription line accounting wise, you have some blades that are recognized like products, the revenue recognition is like product. It's a small portion, but in Q4, you can see a tick up when there is more -- like you have more product revenues, you have more of those type of blades, and then you can have an uptick in Q4 and then it's going back to regular rates in -- in Q1. So that's the generic or it has nothing to do with the renewal. Renewals are pretty much consistent. There is even slight increase there some quarters. So in general, it suggest some subscription that are recognized immediately. -- Got it. Thank you. -- Sure.Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ken Talanian from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live. -- Hi, thanks for taking the question. You mentioned putting more emphasis on acquiring new customers. I was wondering, if you could expand on the changes you're making to the sales incentives for both direct sales in the channel and how they compare to the prior model? -- I think, it's mainly about activity management, is making sure that people go out and do these kinds of meeting. It's the weekly measurement. It's a weekly focus on kind of these things. There is, of course some bonuses and some MBOs and so on, in terms of getting to these activities. But the key is around -- but the key is about being trained and actually going out and doing those meetings. -- Okay, great. That's helpful. And also, I was wondering if you could give us a sense for how the pipeline is building around the Maestro products and the 6000 series of appliances? -- I think it's building up quite well. I mean, we've seen in Maestro, a nice number of deals already in the first quarter even voluntary revolutionary concept. And I think, I don't know if we have a specific pipeline for the 6000 series because it's in line with the general core business that we do. But we're seeing that we get more and more into the marketplace, people are enthusiastic about that. We need to place them correctly, in terms of the price performance and so on. And I think it's working, OK. -- And I'll just add that we don't reveal the numbers obviously, but you see a nice transition. It's been launched only two months ago like in the -- end of January or beginning of February, and it's already, let's say more than 10%, more than 20% transition. So it's quite well. -- Great. Thanks very much.Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Andrew Nowinski from Piper Jaffray. Your line is now live. -- Great. Thank you very much. Just two questions. First, why do you think your growth in Europe continues to outperform the Americas? -- I think it's execution management and focus on the right thing. I think it's also better alignment with the channel partner, which I think works well in Europe. And I think we continue to -- to focus on executing on both areas because I think we have far more potential in both places. -- Okay. Very good. And then on -- with regard to billings, it was up about 3.4% off of arguably and easier comp from last year, which looks like it may have been a bit below the market growth rate, and I know, you launched a number of new appliances over the last few quarters, including the 6500 and 6800. So I'm wondering is that lower growth rate maybe simply due to the Infinity sales model? Is there another reason why your new appliances are not driving -- translate into better growth in billings? Thanks. -- So I think in related to that. I mean we don't talk about the billing. But you're right, when you calculate the implied booking, you're around 4%. Remember some of the deals are off balance sheet. But in general, we said that Europe did well and America still needs to improve. -- Thank you.Thank you. Our next question is coming from Gregg Moskowitz from Mizuho. Your line is now live. -- Okay. Thank you. The first question is just on -- on Infinity. So for the customers, where you are seeing a big uplift, in other words, a 100% uplift or more, are those customers actually displacing third-party technologies or is there deployment additive to what they previously had? -- I think both. I think they are displacing and they are also using technology, which we didn't have before, which is most of the Gen V capabilities. And by the way, remember we've said that this quarter, we've actually had a very nice contribution to Infinity from brand new customers in which case, they basically displace their entire -- their entire security infrastructure with the Check Point solution, which is great to see. -- Okay. Thanks, Gil. And then a few months ago, you brought on a new channel head and you did touch on some channel changes a little bit in your prepared remarks. But what changes should we expect to see over the -- the course of 2019? -- I think the main -- the main change, but I mean, there is actually two changes. One is the day-to-day way we work with partners, and the other is the programs that needs to support that. So in terms of the program, I spoke about the Check Point' Engage Partner Program. Again, it is designed to work on the activity level, partners actually collect points for every activity that we do meeting, conference and so on. And they can see every time is there active (ph), how are they scoring on their activity level and what level of attainment, they've got to. And -- and this is driven I think -- which is kind of a way to encourage, to gamify and to support the day-to-day activity in the field, which is designed around the exact same thing. If we go out together, if we pitch together, if we go to customers, I believe that we will win a lot more. -- Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.Thank you. Our next question is coming from Shebly Seyrafi from FBN Securities. Your line is now live. -- Yeah. Thank you very much. So I want to talk about the gross margin, which declined year-to-year by 0.4 percentage points year-over-year. It looks like the product side declined more. Is that correlated with the hiring of Frank Rauch, as the new channel head. We're hearing from our channel checks that Israel is allowing North America with Frank leading it in the channel to make more pricing decisions on its own. And I'm wondering if that's leading to more price aggression and therefore a decline in the product gross margin? -- Really. I think if you look at the numbers, the total gross margins actually moved up. I think it's more relating to the mix. You're right that there is in general, price pressures for -- the last few years, there is price pressures. I think it's -- it's the mix of the product sometimes can shift it a few -- a few percent -- not even percent -- it's less than a percent, but 1%, up, 1% down. It's nothing material change in the US versus the other regions. And the same with the policies, I mean, they -- they can compete in effective way anywhere around the globe. -- I'm hear (ph) that the feedback that people feel better about -- about the changes and the authority that people have. We are definitely trying to make that happen, and -- and to support the people in the field and make it easier for them. The success of us will be determined not by the way we managed the gross margin at the end, but the way we managed the top line. So I'm -- so I mean that should be our focus, and that is our focus. -- Okay. And you also stated that you're not happy with growth, and I think you elaborated with Americas growth, in particular, what do you think is the -- are the key factors driving that disappointment? Is it increased competition from Palo Alto and Fortinet? What are the other factors? -- I think the main factor is our own execution, is what we do in the go-to-market, the level of activities that we do, whether we address the right targets. I think we have an amazing set of people in the field. I think we have a very good set of customers. But I think in many cases, for example, we are working with the same people on the same projects, but what we need to do is to aim higher at the C-level and find new -- new projects and that's true for existing customers. And of course, the most important element for me is going to new customers. Again, it's not easy to change the sales person behavior on that because with the existing customer, you always find the place with the higher win rate because it's an existing customer, with a bigger projects again because we already have a large installed base.So to get into this more challenging market of -- of the greenfield of new customers is always more challenging. But again as I said, I think we've -- that we are adding the capacity, I think our people do have that capacity and it's a matter of training, it's a matter of focus, it's a matter of activities, marketing and so on, and I think we're -- we've made all the investment. We have more people, and we've done more marketing and we are doing far more of all of that. So it's a matter of taking the time to see all of that happening.And by the way daily execution challenges that our people are dealing, we're going to think we're dealing with it very well. The last sampling that I did showed that there are real changes happening now. As I said, in Europe they already produced some good results in the first quarter. So that's very encouraging. In the US, what I've seen so far is that there are changes in the behavior and the activities, and the result still needs to come. -- Okay. Lastly for me, ForceNock what is the expected revenue contribution this year? -- None really. It's more technology that we acquired, as part of our Gen VI future product. -- Thank you.Thank you. Our next question is coming from Walter Pritchard from Citi. Your line is now live. -- Thanks. Just wanted to kind of trace back the narrative, we heard here in the last say three quarters or four quarters that you felt like first half of last year was a little bit challenging and then Q3 sort of hit the inflection, you talked about bookings improving and Q4 was really strong coming through on the P&L. It feels like this quarter took a little bit of a step back with the results being back in the midpoint of the guide was there, I'm curious if there was sort of like deal slippage or anything that was kind of seasonal factors that you might just expect in the Q1 or is it truly just sort of execution, some of the things you talked about that -- that just need to -- to ramp up in the Americas? -- I think first, Q1 is always the seasonal weak quarter. People try to finish the year with the biggest project, refreshing the budget, customers have new budget. Our people are basically starting from a very low level of pipeline. During the year, we build a pipeline and again it reaches the top in Q4 and again reaches the bottom or -- in the beginning of the pipeline in Q1. Also remember that with all the marketing activities that we've talked about the Check Point Experience Conferences and so on, people are not at the office all the time, people are building their plans for the year. So Q1 is always the quarter that's -- that's challenging.With that in mind, by the way, I think that we've done quite well in the -- in the first quarter. I think as the year goes, we are building more and more into that. And again, my expectation is that there is a lot of upside, whether it will come Q2, Q3, Q4 or 2020 I think time will tell. So I think right now, we have a balanced expectation from ourselves. And I think there is -- there is a lot that we need to do, that we need -- that we can and we should improve, but again, I'm not sure when it will come. -- Great. And then Tal, just a quick clarification. I didn't quite catch what you said on tax rate. For Q4 -- Q4, the GAAP tax rate was really low in -- in 18% (ph), you said near 0% in 4Q of this year? -- Yeah, just reminded you what we said in the annual that I said expect around 19% in Q1, Q2 and Q3, and in Q4, 0%. And I just reiterated that -- that was the guidance -- Okay. Thank you.Thank you. Our next question is coming from Karl Keirstead from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now live. -- Thanks. Just back to the go-to-market, I had two more specific questions. In terms of accelerating the new logo acquisition in the US, is there a plan to meaningfully accelerate sales rep hiring through year-end. The fact that you're reaffirming, I think the 50% operating margin guide for the full year suggests not, but I just want to ask?And then secondly, as part of the channel changes, are you thinking about altering the economics or margins to the channel partners? Thank you. -- In terms of the hiring, we still have a plan to grow hiring in the field. But again, right now, the focus is not on more people, but the productivity and the activities of the existing people. I think that's where we will -- especially this year, that's where we will see the results and that's where we will see the most of the investment.In terms of the channel partner economics, I think we want to align it with the new program. I think we want to make it attractive to partners, especially to partners that invest and are active around promoting our solutions, and I think that's what we want to align. It does not based on partner size, but based on the actual investment and the activity that the partner is doing with us. -- Okay. Thank you very much.Thank you. Our next question is coming from Dan Ives from Wedbush Securities. Your line is now live. -- Yeah. Thanks. My question is, obviously now that we're through 1Q in terms of budgets, where you -- the pie you're going out in terms of cyber security especially within the US, is it you are incrementally bigger than maybe we saw a year ago, just given cloud and some of the secular shifts. Maybe you could just talk about that in terms of what the overall pie that you're going after this year versus maybe years past? -- I think customers do have a lot of focus on the cloud. On the other -- on the other hand on cloud, we don't always figure out exactly what we want to spend on security and other things. It's a new field and many customers, by the way are not -- don't have any run rate or don't have any specific plans for what their spend on security should be in the cloud. But again, since we're starting from a small base that should be the major -- the major factor for us at this point.I think overall the what -- the message, which we're giving to customers is, you need to look at security at the top level, you need to consolidate and this way, you can achieve a much better ROI on your investment and mainly much better security to your enterprise. And I think, for example, when you look at the Infinity program, we give the customers the full flexibility, we give customers the full capabilities to implement security on premise, on the cloud for end users, for mobile all of that is included, so the customer doesn't have to worry whether it should be more on-prem or cloud or -- or all the other factor that exist. It comes all included because I think that's what customer needs. -- Thank you.Thank you. Our next question is coming from John DiFucci from Jefferies. Your line is now live. -- Thank you. I just like to go back for a quick question on sales and marketing, you talked about it increasing Tal and it did and Gil talked about focusing on winning new customers. I'm just curious because your new business metrics or at least the way we calculate them actually moderated this quarter, is still better than -- than it was probably the last two quarters, but -- but sort of fell off a little bit from the last two quarters. I'm just curious, is there -- because of the increased expense -- or do you have like more unproductive sales people at this point right now? Or is it just the marketing spend, you just talked about relative to the -- to the new business signings in this quarter? -- I think -- I think, the way I view it is, we -- we invested basically before the growth. So we invest now and we hope and expect and plan to see the growth coming later on. Now, we have two growth drivers, when we look at the increase in our sales and marketing, which is where the main -- the growth is. One is the headcount. We increased that headcount. We talked about it and you mentioned it. It's the majority of the growth is actually already from Q4, it's just that you see the full effect in -- in Q1 that's one effect. We continue of course to increase the headcount, but not in the rate that we saw last year, that's one.Second, we invested lot in marketing. We talked about it that when we start to invest in marketing, we see things starting to be according to plan. We're going to increase our investment in marketing and we do. I'll give you two examples. CPXs, historically we used to have three global CPXs, which we had a huge increase in the presence there this year over 30% increase. So that's one example of CPXs in Q1 that's a significant increase in the expense. Then we are doing local CPXs across the US, across Europe, across Asia, which also will increase the marketing expenses. We increase presence in third-party events and so on. So we do increase headcount and investment in marketing, in events, Check Point events or third-party events. -- Okay. Okay. Thanks. And I guess maybe just one other question, just the sort of desktop and mobile and question has to do with virtual firewalls in the public cloud. Is there any -- is there been any change in adoption or even discussion, I realize it's early, but some of the work survey that we've done says that customers plan, once they do start to move more aggressively enterprises anyway to the public cloud, they -- they plan to use same vendors that you're using on-prem, but customers change their mind all the time, right, and I know there's different kinds of security that has assessed these in the cloud. But I'm just curious in your virtual firewall in your products, is there any change in demand or any change in discussion with your customers? -- That's actually the part that's doing very well in the cloud. I mean, there are other parts in the cloud that are doing well, but our virtual firewall sales (ph) in the cloud are actually -- are actually growing quite nicely. Again, and there is much more -- much more potential there, but growing nicely. We also have nice growth rate for our SaaS solution, which is a completely new field in that regard. So definitely we have a lot. And again, we have at least three, four elements today just in the potential on the cloud and I think it's -- it's going well overall. -- Okay, great. Well, thank you. -- I would just said that, you know, the cloud, when we look at the part in the subscription, it's actually becoming quite nice. It's -- I can't give you the number right now, but I can say, it's growing quite nice. The growth is over 70% and it's growing and it's no longer -- it's a few 10s of millions of year -- a year probably going to be by the end of the year. So it's becoming quite significant there.Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Your line is now live. -- Hey guys, not to mention of new customers and Gil, you mentioned both augmentation and displacement. I'm curious if there's any trends in terms of where you're seeing those win rates either by geography, by industry, by type of customer or even by users (ph)? -- I mean, in terms of industries, it's all over. I think I mentioned that we've seen basically everything from construction to technology and everything in the middle, finance, manufacturing and so on. Geography, Q1 was very strong in Europe, and I think we've talked about it number of times. Europe at least this quarter got it right and is showing nice growth rate in new customers. In the US, I see a nice change in the activity levels and I hope that -- that will be translated to the actual results later on. -- Okay. And then one follow-up. Did you guys make any changes to your pricing for either software blades or support for 2019? -- Nothing, nothing -- we have -- we have tweaks in the pricing. But no -- nothing dramatic I think. -- Okay. Thank you.Thank you. We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments. -- Thank you everyone for joining us today. We look forward to seeing you throughout the quarter. If you do have any calls that you'd like to have with us, please send us an email and we'll try to get back to you, as quickly as possible. Thank you, and have a great day. Bye-bye.Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today. --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  -- Transcript powered by When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"Shares of IT security specialist   plunged more than 11% in early trading on the today before retracing to about an 8.2% loss as of 12:40 p.m. EDT. Check Point reported its fiscal first-quarter 2019 earnings this morning, but earnings weren't the problem this time -- guidance was.An earnings beat could have sent Check Point stock up today. Instead, weak guidance is sending it down. Image source: Getty Images.Using , Check Point earned $1.15 per share in Q1. That was a penny below what the company had earned in Q1 2018. However, pro forma profits for the quarter came in at $1.32 per share, versus the $1.31 per share that Wall Street analysts had predicted -- an ""earnings beat.""Quarterly sales of $471.8 million likewise edged out analyst estimates and were up 4% year over year. Security subscriptions grew 13% year over year.But again, that wasn't the problem. The problem was that after reporting its earnings beat, Check Point proceeded to give new guidance  for the second quarter of 2019, currently under way. Management says it expects to earn between $1.32 and $1.40 per share this quarter, on sales of $474 million to $500 million.When taken at their midpoints, these projections suggest pro forma profit of only $1.36 per share on sales of $487 million. And while that sales number would meet Wall Street's estimate for Check Point in Q2, the earnings number would fall $0.02 short of the $1.38 per share that Wall Street wants to see Check Point earn.Thus, what we're looking at here is a case of an ""earnings beat"" undermined by a ""guidance miss.""

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''.  These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand.  Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).  Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

Revenues for the quarter increased by 4% year-over-year to $472 million, and our non-GAAP EPS grew by 2% to $1.32, both slightly above the mid of our guidance.Before I proceed further into the numbers, let me remind you that our GAAP financial results include stock-based compensation charges, amortization of acquired intangible assets and acquisition-related expenses, as well as the related tax effects. Keep in mind that as applicable non-GAAP information is presented excluding these items.Now, let's take a look at the financial highlights for the quarter.Product and security subscription revenues were $257 million. Our subscription revenues continue to be strong with 13% growth year-over-year, reaching $144 million. Our software update and maintenance revenues increased to $215 million, representing 4% growth year-over-year. The growth in our subscription revenues is driven by our advanced solutions, mainly cloud, SandBlast Zero day threat prevention and mobile.Infinity consolidated solution also started to flow into the revenues and show a nice trend. During the quarter, we had Infinity deals in variety of industries including finance, manufacturing, software and defense with a significant portion coming from new customers. We continue to see an increase in customers annual run rate in Infinity deals ranging from 10s to 100s (ph) of percentage increase, which is a great result. From an accounting perspective, a small portion of the deals is recognized as product revenues, while majority of the deals is recognized as recurring revenues over the life of the contracts. Majority as subscription and the remainder as support, update and maintenance.Deferred revenues as of March 31st, 2019 reached $1,312 million, a growth of $146 million or 13% over March 31st, 2018.Revenue distribution by geography for the quarter was as follows : 45% of revenues came from Americas; 44% of revenues came from Europe, Middle East and Africa region; and the remaining 11% came from Asia Pacific. Please note, since the beginning of 2019, Middle East and Africa are part of Europe region, while before it was part of Asia Pacific region. The revenue distribution by geography for Q1 last year, after the reclassification would have been 47% of revenues from Americas, no change, 42% of revenues came from Europe, Middle East and Africa regions, after the reclass and the remaining 11% came from Asia Pacific. Those were the numbers for Q1 last year after the reclass.From a deal size perspective, this quarter we had 47 customers with transactions over $1 million compared to 44 in Q1, 2018. Transactions greater than $50,000 was 71% of total order value similar to last year.Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 50% as we planned. We continue to invest in our sales force and marketing in order to execute our strategy, which revolves around prevention, management and consolidation of security. In addition, this quarter, includes the full effect of our recent acquisitions both of Dome9 and ForceNock.Our financial income for the quarter reached $19 million. The increase is in line with the higher interest rate levels in the US. Financial income expected to be around $20 million, $21 million a quarter in the remainder of the year.Effective non-GAAP tax rate for this quarter was 19% as planned again. Please note in the fourth quarter, we expect the tax rate to be around 0%, as the lapse of statute of limitation expected to occur by year-end.GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2019 was $180 million or $1.15 per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $205 million or $1.32 per diluted share, an increase of 2% from the first quarter of 2018 and $0.01 above the midpoint of our guidance.Our cash balance, as of March 31st were $4.2 billion compared to $4 billion in December 31st, 2018. Operating cash flow was $379 million, which includes part of ForceNock acquisition payment of $2 million. Collections continued to be very strong. During Q1 last year, we had $45 million tax refund. Excluding this item, our operating cash flow increased by 2%.During the quarter, we purchased 2.7 million shares for $305 million at an average price of $115 a share. This quarter, we implemented a new accounting standard ASC 842, which changed the recording of long-term operating leases in the financials. Accordingly, we recorded assets of $30 million against liabilities reflecting the value of these leases. There is no significant impact on the income statement.Now, let's take -- turn the call over to Gil for his comments. -- Thank you, Tal, and hello to everyone joining us today. I would like to begin today with a review of the highlight of what we witnessed during the first quarter and provide a little more color on our business beyond the numbers that -- that Tal just shared.Our first quarter was a big quarter in terms of events. We hosted our global Check Point Experience 360 conferences for employees, partners and customers around the world. This year CPX 360 conferences sets a new record for the number of participants and generated a high level of audience interest and enthusiasm. We had 30% more customers and almost 30% more partners attending the conference. During CPX, we are focused on our Gen V and upcoming Gen VI security architecture.As we've highlighted before, the vast majority of enterprises have security to address third generation cyber-attacks, which means that we are almost 10 years behind the current trend, and only 3% believe that we are protected against fifth generation attacks, which we're facing everyday. These stats (ph) brings to light how vulnerable the world infrastructure is today and the potential for catastrophic damage. If enterprises don't take measures to protect themselves against the current generation of attacks.During the last number of years, we've seen an almost 3X increase in the number of vulnerabilities discovered in the world technology infrastructure, operating systems, hardware, software, servers, critical infrastructure, et cetera. Last year, there were over 16,000 reported vulnerabilities with 800 in mobile operating systems and all. The fifth generation of attacks are usually multi vector attacks. It can be an app, which you download on your mobile, which steals your cloud credential and from there it gets into your internal data of the Company. It can be a file, which arrive through email and creates a chain attack like that.Dynamic payloads are using most attack tools today and can potentially turn every computer into an asset in a global cyber warfare. The escalation in Gen V attacks means that we have a huge challenge ahead of us and then even larger opportunity. While a big part of our marketplace still relies on the refresh of Gen II and Gen III customer environment, the real challenge and opportunity is in upgrading these customers to Gen V cyber protection and consolidating their security infrastructure.During our CPX conferences, we've also revealed more details on the sixth generation of our cyber security solution, one that we believe will revolutionize how security systems work. We believe it will evolve how people think about security architecture by changing the way, they are constructed. Today security architectures rely on monolithic systems that includes the delivery and the security technology in one big piece of software or hardware. These consume a lot of resources and are slow to adapt to the evolving trend. We intend to separate the security service and delivery by turning it into a cloud-based architecture that enables nano agent to bring the latest security innovation to every cloud app or IoT device, and of course, to all the aberrant (ph) elements of our network. These nano security agents combined with the smart cloud security brains will be the essential pieces of our Gen VI security architecture.During the first quarter, we introduced a number of new technologies beginning with the new 6,000 appliance series with improved price performance and optimized for Gen V advanced threat prevention. We also delivered Maestro a revolutionary security solution for scalable network that delivers performance, which could be achieved before at the fraction of (inaudible) cost. Maestro achieved these results by changing -- by chaining multiple security appliances together to deliver an almost linear improvement in performance. This hyperscale technology provides cloud-grade resiliency and elasticity. Unlike other solutions that are only targeting the super high-end of the market, Maestro can start at the medium business budget and scale all the way up to the performance needed by the largest networks in the world. Therefore, it opens a much broader marketplace with previous super high-end solution and enable cloud-grade elasticity across the marketplace.During the quarter, Check Point CloudGuard Dome9 received Security Innovation of the Year Award at the latest Cloud Awards. The recognition was for its comprehensive software platform for public cloud security and compliance orchestration. In addition, Check Point SandBlast Agent earned NSS Labs Recommending Rating in 2019 Advanced Endpoint Protection test. SandBlast Agent detected a 100% of HTTP and email threats and a 100% of malware using sophisticated evasion technique, while providing zero false positive.You may have also noticed, the recent Homeland Security announcement regarding remote access vulnerabilities in almost all of our competitors' product. As we've spoken about in the past, our biggest differentiator is the level of security we'll provide to our customers and our focus on prevention and protection. Needless to say that Check Point's product was highlighted as a product that is secured and doesn't suffer from any false vulnerabilities. On the sales front, we've been putting a lot of emphasis on winning new customers, consolidating the security for infrastructure, we were focused on cloud security and our Gen V infinity total solutions.Infinity deals also generated nice results this quarter with new customers ranging from a few 100 users to over 10,000 users and from the construction industry to high tech companies. We've seen some good signs of success in increasing new customer wins, especially in Europe. Once we are able to achieve a similar type of uplift in the US new customer wins, I believe, we will see an acceleration in our growth rate.In the US, we continue to make several improvements to our sales force. We brought senior leadership to our channel organization. We launched Check Point Engage, a new global channel program focused on joint sales activities between our partners and our people. The program featured Check Point, a reward program that measures sales activities at the individual level and rewards them points for their Check Point sales activities. The program will be rolled out gradually starting this month, and we intend to utilize the program as the basis for partner business model next year. Overall, looking at our global sales structure, we've seen areas with great improvements and we've seen areas, where improvement still needs to be realized.I believe that the opportunity ahead of us is much bigger than what we've seen before, while I'm happy with the progress we're making in some areas, our growth rate should be higher than what we've seen. This is a good time to address our projections for the second quarter. You know, my regular caveat projecting future results is very challenging. There is always a high level of uncertainty, results can be better or worse than our projections. With that in mind for the second quarter, revenues are expected to be in the range of $474 million to $500 million and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.32 to $1.40. GAAP EPS is expected to be approximately $0.17 lower than that.Thank you for your time, and I'd like to open the call for your questions.Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question today is coming from Michael Turits from Raymond James. Your line is now live. -- Hey guys, good afternoon, one for Gil, one for Tal. Gil you mentioned Gen VI as cloud delivered security. Does -- does that mean that you're going to try to approach things from -- in terms of cloud delivered securities -- the security from the cloud similar to what some of your competitors, they are doing secured web gateway from the cloud are doing. Is that a direct competition? -- I think, we will have some of these components, but the answer is -- is no. The short answer is, no. I think our architecture will be little bit different. I don't believe in routing all your traffic to the cloud, which slows down things. Companies don't want to do it for their internal traffic, and it's not going to work, fully scalable to bring security everywhere. What our architecture is based on is having this global threat cloud and that queries can be made (ph) to understand if -- if any transaction, a new connection and up transaction or anything basically that we want to test is -- is something that should work or shouldn't work.It -- it has a lot of effects, I mean, from the standpoint that, we can apply all security technologies to every query like that and it brings a lot of control back to the security professional as supposed to the people, who are in charge of the -- another people or go to the manufacturers of the equipment or the developers of application software. But it will have very positive effects on the -- on the overall performance, on the fact that data doesn't have to leave the enterprise, data will remain in its point and that's the whole concept of what we call the nano agents. -- Thanks, Gil. And Tal, your're -- your're glad as your product is being impacted by the shift to subscription and to Infinity, but you have been having moderating declines in product revenue, those worsened this quarter, got steeper again. Should we expect that you could go to either flat or positive product this growth in one of the quarters this year? -- See, I'm not projecting right now. We gave the guidance for the full year, and it does split between the line. The total guidance are -- are taking that into account. If there will be a more than expected quicker shifting to Infinity, while it's great news, it's going to affect bigger on the product. But in general if the products, I don't expect it that short time to become on a positive note, I expect the subscription to continue and grow. -- Okay. Thanks, Tal. Thanks, Gil.Thank you. Our next question is coming from Brad Zelnick from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live. -- Great. Thank you so much. I've got one for Gil and one for Tal as well. Gil, it sounds like there's a lot of exciting things happening in terms of new products and we're hearing more optimism from the channel. And as you said in your comments, there's still improvement to come, as you're making changes especially here in the Americas. So what -- what indicators are you looking at that give you the confidence to continue investing? And how long do you think it will take for Check Point to return to market growth rates? -- I think the indicators that I'm looking at mainly are the level of activities, how many new customers, are we meeting, how many C-level people are we meeting. Of course, we look at our measures like the pipeline and -- and things like that. But for me, the most important one is our own execution. How many of these activities are we making and by the way, how many are the partner -- our channel partners are making. And by the way, that's why we designed the -- the new channel program, the Engage program to work on that instead of measuring the -- the results after the fact measuring every week and every day how many of these activities, marketing, sales and so on, we're conducting. My belief from everything I know that we have more capacity. We can do more, and we can generate much more results that way. -- Great. Thank you. And Tal, I know Gil gave us the updated guidance on Q2, but we didn't hear any update as it relates to the full year. Is it fair to assume that your full-year guidance that you gave us last quarter still stands? -- Yes, definitely the full-year guidance stand. It's -- I gave you a bit more color this quarter, just to make sure that you see, which lines is coming from. You can see our sales and marketing are -- are higher than some of your models. while the financial income is higher, so you can balance between the two. But the results -- the annual results expected to be the same. -- Excellent. Thanks so much.Thank you. Our next question is coming from Shaul Eyal from Oppenheimer. Your line is now live. -- Hi, good afternoon, guys. Actually, I want to start with a question that hasn't been asked in some time now regarding the competitive arena. Do you believe that Check Point is actually gaining market share? -- I think it depends, how you look at. I think overall our growth numbers should be higher and we are aiming at that. I think with Infinity, we are actually capturing new land, we're getting to new spaces, and we are taking full architectures at few customers. The number of these customers right now is still small, but it's growing nicely and the first quarter was a great indicator of that. The dollar volumes on that can be significant, and we are seeing a mix of customers, some are small and small here is -- is hundreds of thousands of dollars, which is kind of large in our average scale (ph) and some are multi-million dollar contracts, which are good invert. And the main value for that -- that we actually give these customers the -- the full security to combat this cyber security challenges, which they have got and believe me, this is needed. -- Understood. And maybe one for -- one for Tal, so good work on deals greater than $1 million. My question is, were there any Dome9 and Infinity related transactions part of this, I think you had 40 -- I think 44 or 47 this -- this quarter, if I'm not mistaken? -- We had 47. I will say no. But some of Infinity deals are part of those deals and in it, you have also the cloud solutions, of course. -- Got it. -- So the answer is yes, on Infinity, and Infinity includes also Dome9 or there is stand-alone Dome9 in that category. I'm not sure. -- Got it. Okay. Thank you so much.Thank you. Our next question is coming from Phil Winslow from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live. -- Yeah. Thanks, guys for taking my -- taking my question. I just have one on the -- on the pricing front. Just curious what you're seeing just on the pricing environment out there, you're starting the year, and -- and then also, you're focusing and obviously specifically on Infinity too. Any sort of color there? Obviously, the pricing and packaging there is very, very different, but any sort of color and feedback that you're getting from -- from customers on Infinity and it's -- it's got a market price it would be great? Thanks. -- Yeah, I -- yeah, I can -- I can talk a bit about the Infinity deals that we sold. So -- so like we spoke before I'm following each one to see the trends there, and I continue to see, what we talked about in the previous quarter. We see deals like Gil said from a customers that have 100 users to customers that have more than 10,000 users, which is very nice to see that it's fitting small companies and very large companies.We see in terms of -- the customers significant portion is new customers, which is actually something, which is nice to see this quarter. It was even more than the previous quarter, so we see it helping us more and more with new customers penetration, again small number, but a nice phenomena, which hopefully will be a consistent trend, and we do see that the run rates are increasing significantly. So if it's customer that maybe had only firewall before, then once you buy Infinity, the increase in the run rate can be 100s (ph) of percentage. And if it's a customer that's already had NGTX and maybe cloud and the increase is only 10s of percentage, but it's still increasing the run rate, increasing the satisfaction, which is very nice to see, so that's the color.Revenue is very, very slow, revenue recognition actually. Remember the deals that we see are on average probably three years deals. You don't see it in the balance sheet. Most of them, you don't even see in the deferred revenues because it's annually invoiced. So it's a backlog that you don't see as part of the deferred revenues, and you see it in the revenue, the subscription and the support over the life of the contract. Majority of it is subscription unlike a typical regular customer that doesn't buy Infinity that's why, we will see a strong shift over there, over time. And smaller portion going to the product, then the product is recognized only once the customer is actually pulling the product. -- Got it. Great. Thanks. And then also just a follow-up for Gil on Dome9, you gave some commentary earlier on that now that you've on that for a couple of quarters there now what's the feedback been from customers and prospects? And how you think about the -- about Dome9 competitively out there? -- I think the feedback is actually very positive. We're seeing nice activity in the field. It's in the very early stages because the field now needs to learn the whole new Dome9. We've made a drastic shift in the go-to-market from a small sales force of -- of a handful of people to a large sales force with 100s of people that basically start from zero and need to learn the whole concept. But when I'm looking at the -- again the activities in the -- in the field what I sampled, I saw a lot of activity around Dome9. In CPX, we got a lot of positive feedback to Dome9. So I think it will take us some time to ramp up, but the feedback so far is -- is terrific. -- Great. Thank you.Thank you. Our next question is coming from Fatima Boolani from UBS. Your line is now live. -- Okay. Good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. I have one for Gil and one for Tal. Gil maybe a bigger picture question for you. Just with regards to the overall demand environment for perimeter based controls and perimeter based security, I think year-in and year-out, we continue to hear sort of next messages on where customers are actually focusing their cyber security energies and dollars, as it relates to product investments. I wanted to get your take on how the customers view on network security and perimeter based security like firewall solution is evolving? And then I have a follow-up for Tal. -- I think we're seeing good level of demand. I think -- I mean, I think people are still refreshing their infrastructure, some companies are still building new data centers. So I think the -- the challenge is not there. I mean, the demand is healthy. I think the challenge is how do we elevate the level of security and not how we compete on or things that are relevant for 10 years ago. It is a competitive marketplace and that is the challenge. But I think overall, there is a healthy demand. I don't see that the challenge is there, right here. -- Fair enough. And Tal maybe for you, just a quick housekeeping. On the reclassification of the geographic revenue. Was there any organizational change that prompted you to do that or it was just sort of a mechanical thing? And then more specific question on your -- subscription and maintenance revenues, they did declined sequentially. So I did want to understand some of the drivers that would have those subscription and recurring revenue line items down sequentially and that's it from me? Thank you. -- Okay. I'm not sure, I understood the second part, but let's first take the -- the first one. So structurally, we changed, Africa and Middle East is reporting to Europe now it's now called EMEA. So if you back -- if you remember 10 years ago, that's exactly how it was, we moved it back to EMEA. So now it's called EMEA and we moved those percentage. Obviously, it's a smaller region, but it's moved to report into the Europe, Middle East and Africa structure versus APAC, Asia Pacific. So as we changed structurally, then we also reclass the revenues in the P&L, of course. -- And I think it's just -- it's internal managerial issue, then mainly if you look at the geography, especially we are in Israel and we are part of the Middle East. Geographically, we're in Asia, but in terms of proximity, we are much closer. In the distance, we are one-third of the distance to Europe and we are to the headquarters in Asia. So it's -- so I mean, there is always these two balances. -- Yeah. -- Yeah. Makes sense. And just to clarify the second question around the sequential decline in blade subscription and maintenance and support revenue in the quarter. Just wanted to understand some of the dynamics that would have those recurring revenue line items down sequentially, whether if you -- whether you can shed light on renewal rate or blade subscription package renewal rates and -- and any dynamics there? Thank you so much. -- (multiple speakers) actually not -- not relating to a renewal rate, it's relating to the fact that in the -- even in the subscription line accounting wise, you have some blades that are recognized like products, the revenue recognition is like product. It's a small portion, but in Q4, you can see a tick up when there is more -- like you have more product revenues, you have more of those type of blades, and then you can have an uptick in Q4 and then it's going back to regular rates in -- in Q1. So that's the generic or it has nothing to do with the renewal. Renewals are pretty much consistent. There is even slight increase there some quarters. So in general, it suggest some subscription that are recognized immediately. -- Got it. Thank you. -- Sure.Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ken Talanian from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live. -- Hi, thanks for taking the question. You mentioned putting more emphasis on acquiring new customers. I was wondering, if you could expand on the changes you're making to the sales incentives for both direct sales in the channel and how they compare to the prior model? -- I think, it's mainly about activity management, is making sure that people go out and do these kinds of meeting. It's the weekly measurement. It's a weekly focus on kind of these things. There is, of course some bonuses and some MBOs and so on, in terms of getting to these activities. But the key is around -- but the key is about being trained and actually going out and doing those meetings. -- Okay, great. That's helpful. And also, I was wondering if you could give us a sense for how the pipeline is building around the Maestro products and the 6000 series of appliances? -- I think it's building up quite well. I mean, we've seen in Maestro, a nice number of deals already in the first quarter even voluntary revolutionary concept. And I think, I don't know if we have a specific pipeline for the 6000 series because it's in line with the general core business that we do. But we're seeing that we get more and more into the marketplace, people are enthusiastic about that. We need to place them correctly, in terms of the price performance and so on. And I think it's working, OK. -- And I'll just add that we don't reveal the numbers obviously, but you see a nice transition. It's been launched only two months ago like in the -- end of January or beginning of February, and it's already, let's say more than 10%, more than 20% transition. So it's quite well. -- Great. Thanks very much.Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Andrew Nowinski from Piper Jaffray. Your line is now live. -- Great. Thank you very much. Just two questions. First, why do you think your growth in Europe continues to outperform the Americas? -- I think it's execution management and focus on the right thing. I think it's also better alignment with the channel partner, which I think works well in Europe. And I think we continue to -- to focus on executing on both areas because I think we have far more potential in both places. -- Okay. Very good. And then on -- with regard to billings, it was up about 3.4% off of arguably and easier comp from last year, which looks like it may have been a bit below the market growth rate, and I know, you launched a number of new appliances over the last few quarters, including the 6500 and 6800. So I'm wondering is that lower growth rate maybe simply due to the Infinity sales model? Is there another reason why your new appliances are not driving -- translate into better growth in billings? Thanks. -- So I think in related to that. I mean we don't talk about the billing. But you're right, when you calculate the implied booking, you're around 4%. Remember some of the deals are off balance sheet. But in general, we said that Europe did well and America still needs to improve. -- Thank you.Thank you. Our next question is coming from Gregg Moskowitz from Mizuho. Your line is now live. -- Okay. Thank you. The first question is just on -- on Infinity. So for the customers, where you are seeing a big uplift, in other words, a 100% uplift or more, are those customers actually displacing third-party technologies or is there deployment additive to what they previously had? -- I think both. I think they are displacing and they are also using technology, which we didn't have before, which is most of the Gen V capabilities. And by the way, remember we've said that this quarter, we've actually had a very nice contribution to Infinity from brand new customers in which case, they basically displace their entire -- their entire security infrastructure with the Check Point solution, which is great to see. -- Okay. Thanks, Gil. And then a few months ago, you brought on a new channel head and you did touch on some channel changes a little bit in your prepared remarks. But what changes should we expect to see over the -- the course of 2019? -- I think the main -- the main change, but I mean, there is actually two changes. One is the day-to-day way we work with partners, and the other is the programs that needs to support that. So in terms of the program, I spoke about the Check Point' Engage Partner Program. Again, it is designed to work on the activity level, partners actually collect points for every activity that we do meeting, conference and so on. And they can see every time is there active (ph), how are they scoring on their activity level and what level of attainment, they've got to. And -- and this is driven I think -- which is kind of a way to encourage, to gamify and to support the day-to-day activity in the field, which is designed around the exact same thing. If we go out together, if we pitch together, if we go to customers, I believe that we will win a lot more. -- Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.Thank you. Our next question is coming from Shebly Seyrafi from FBN Securities. Your line is now live. -- Yeah. Thank you very much. So I want to talk about the gross margin, which declined year-to-year by 0.4 percentage points year-over-year. It looks like the product side declined more. Is that correlated with the hiring of Frank Rauch, as the new channel head. We're hearing from our channel checks that Israel is allowing North America with Frank leading it in the channel to make more pricing decisions on its own. And I'm wondering if that's leading to more price aggression and therefore a decline in the product gross margin? -- Really. I think if you look at the numbers, the total gross margins actually moved up. I think it's more relating to the mix. You're right that there is in general, price pressures for -- the last few years, there is price pressures. I think it's -- it's the mix of the product sometimes can shift it a few -- a few percent -- not even percent -- it's less than a percent, but 1%, up, 1% down. It's nothing material change in the US versus the other regions. And the same with the policies, I mean, they -- they can compete in effective way anywhere around the globe. -- I'm hear (ph) that the feedback that people feel better about -- about the changes and the authority that people have. We are definitely trying to make that happen, and -- and to support the people in the field and make it easier for them. The success of us will be determined not by the way we managed the gross margin at the end, but the way we managed the top line. So I'm -- so I mean that should be our focus, and that is our focus. -- Okay. And you also stated that you're not happy with growth, and I think you elaborated with Americas growth, in particular, what do you think is the -- are the key factors driving that disappointment? Is it increased competition from Palo Alto and Fortinet? What are the other factors? -- I think the main factor is our own execution, is what we do in the go-to-market, the level of activities that we do, whether we address the right targets. I think we have an amazing set of people in the field. I think we have a very good set of customers. But I think in many cases, for example, we are working with the same people on the same projects, but what we need to do is to aim higher at the C-level and find new -- new projects and that's true for existing customers. And of course, the most important element for me is going to new customers. Again, it's not easy to change the sales person behavior on that because with the existing customer, you always find the place with the higher win rate because it's an existing customer, with a bigger projects again because we already have a large installed base.So to get into this more challenging market of -- of the greenfield of new customers is always more challenging. But again as I said, I think we've -- that we are adding the capacity, I think our people do have that capacity and it's a matter of training, it's a matter of focus, it's a matter of activities, marketing and so on, and I think we're -- we've made all the investment. We have more people, and we've done more marketing and we are doing far more of all of that. So it's a matter of taking the time to see all of that happening.And by the way daily execution challenges that our people are dealing, we're going to think we're dealing with it very well. The last sampling that I did showed that there are real changes happening now. As I said, in Europe they already produced some good results in the first quarter. So that's very encouraging. In the US, what I've seen so far is that there are changes in the behavior and the activities, and the result still needs to come. -- Okay. Lastly for me, ForceNock what is the expected revenue contribution this year? -- None really. It's more technology that we acquired, as part of our Gen VI future product. -- Thank you.Thank you. Our next question is coming from Walter Pritchard from Citi. Your line is now live. -- Thanks. Just wanted to kind of trace back the narrative, we heard here in the last say three quarters or four quarters that you felt like first half of last year was a little bit challenging and then Q3 sort of hit the inflection, you talked about bookings improving and Q4 was really strong coming through on the P&L. It feels like this quarter took a little bit of a step back with the results being back in the midpoint of the guide was there, I'm curious if there was sort of like deal slippage or anything that was kind of seasonal factors that you might just expect in the Q1 or is it truly just sort of execution, some of the things you talked about that -- that just need to -- to ramp up in the Americas? -- I think first, Q1 is always the seasonal weak quarter. People try to finish the year with the biggest project, refreshing the budget, customers have new budget. Our people are basically starting from a very low level of pipeline. During the year, we build a pipeline and again it reaches the top in Q4 and again reaches the bottom or -- in the beginning of the pipeline in Q1. Also remember that with all the marketing activities that we've talked about the Check Point Experience Conferences and so on, people are not at the office all the time, people are building their plans for the year. So Q1 is always the quarter that's -- that's challenging.With that in mind, by the way, I think that we've done quite well in the -- in the first quarter. I think as the year goes, we are building more and more into that. And again, my expectation is that there is a lot of upside, whether it will come Q2, Q3, Q4 or 2020 I think time will tell. So I think right now, we have a balanced expectation from ourselves. And I think there is -- there is a lot that we need to do, that we need -- that we can and we should improve, but again, I'm not sure when it will come. -- Great. And then Tal, just a quick clarification. I didn't quite catch what you said on tax rate. For Q4 -- Q4, the GAAP tax rate was really low in -- in 18% (ph), you said near 0% in 4Q of this year? -- Yeah, just reminded you what we said in the annual that I said expect around 19% in Q1, Q2 and Q3, and in Q4, 0%. And I just reiterated that -- that was the guidance -- Okay. Thank you.Thank you. Our next question is coming from Karl Keirstead from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now live. -- Thanks. Just back to the go-to-market, I had two more specific questions. In terms of accelerating the new logo acquisition in the US, is there a plan to meaningfully accelerate sales rep hiring through year-end. The fact that you're reaffirming, I think the 50% operating margin guide for the full year suggests not, but I just want to ask?And then secondly, as part of the channel changes, are you thinking about altering the economics or margins to the channel partners? Thank you. -- In terms of the hiring, we still have a plan to grow hiring in the field. But again, right now, the focus is not on more people, but the productivity and the activities of the existing people. I think that's where we will -- especially this year, that's where we will see the results and that's where we will see the most of the investment.In terms of the channel partner economics, I think we want to align it with the new program. I think we want to make it attractive to partners, especially to partners that invest and are active around promoting our solutions, and I think that's what we want to align. It does not based on partner size, but based on the actual investment and the activity that the partner is doing with us. -- Okay. Thank you very much.Thank you. Our next question is coming from Dan Ives from Wedbush Securities. Your line is now live. -- Yeah. Thanks. My question is, obviously now that we're through 1Q in terms of budgets, where you -- the pie you're going out in terms of cyber security especially within the US, is it you are incrementally bigger than maybe we saw a year ago, just given cloud and some of the secular shifts. Maybe you could just talk about that in terms of what the overall pie that you're going after this year versus maybe years past? -- I think customers do have a lot of focus on the cloud. On the other -- on the other hand on cloud, we don't always figure out exactly what we want to spend on security and other things. It's a new field and many customers, by the way are not -- don't have any run rate or don't have any specific plans for what their spend on security should be in the cloud. But again, since we're starting from a small base that should be the major -- the major factor for us at this point.I think overall the what -- the message, which we're giving to customers is, you need to look at security at the top level, you need to consolidate and this way, you can achieve a much better ROI on your investment and mainly much better security to your enterprise. And I think, for example, when you look at the Infinity program, we give the customers the full flexibility, we give customers the full capabilities to implement security on premise, on the cloud for end users, for mobile all of that is included, so the customer doesn't have to worry whether it should be more on-prem or cloud or -- or all the other factor that exist. It comes all included because I think that's what customer needs. -- Thank you.Thank you. Our next question is coming from John DiFucci from Jefferies. Your line is now live. -- Thank you. I just like to go back for a quick question on sales and marketing, you talked about it increasing Tal and it did and Gil talked about focusing on winning new customers. I'm just curious because your new business metrics or at least the way we calculate them actually moderated this quarter, is still better than -- than it was probably the last two quarters, but -- but sort of fell off a little bit from the last two quarters. I'm just curious, is there -- because of the increased expense -- or do you have like more unproductive sales people at this point right now? Or is it just the marketing spend, you just talked about relative to the -- to the new business signings in this quarter? -- I think -- I think, the way I view it is, we -- we invested basically before the growth. So we invest now and we hope and expect and plan to see the growth coming later on. Now, we have two growth drivers, when we look at the increase in our sales and marketing, which is where the main -- the growth is. One is the headcount. We increased that headcount. We talked about it and you mentioned it. It's the majority of the growth is actually already from Q4, it's just that you see the full effect in -- in Q1 that's one effect. We continue of course to increase the headcount, but not in the rate that we saw last year, that's one.Second, we invested lot in marketing. We talked about it that when we start to invest in marketing, we see things starting to be according to plan. We're going to increase our investment in marketing and we do. I'll give you two examples. CPXs, historically we used to have three global CPXs, which we had a huge increase in the presence there this year over 30% increase. So that's one example of CPXs in Q1 that's a significant increase in the expense. Then we are doing local CPXs across the US, across Europe, across Asia, which also will increase the marketing expenses. We increase presence in third-party events and so on. So we do increase headcount and investment in marketing, in events, Check Point events or third-party events. -- Okay. Okay. Thanks. And I guess maybe just one other question, just the sort of desktop and mobile and question has to do with virtual firewalls in the public cloud. Is there any -- is there been any change in adoption or even discussion, I realize it's early, but some of the work survey that we've done says that customers plan, once they do start to move more aggressively enterprises anyway to the public cloud, they -- they plan to use same vendors that you're using on-prem, but customers change their mind all the time, right, and I know there's different kinds of security that has assessed these in the cloud. But I'm just curious in your virtual firewall in your products, is there any change in demand or any change in discussion with your customers? -- That's actually the part that's doing very well in the cloud. I mean, there are other parts in the cloud that are doing well, but our virtual firewall sales (ph) in the cloud are actually -- are actually growing quite nicely. Again, and there is much more -- much more potential there, but growing nicely. We also have nice growth rate for our SaaS solution, which is a completely new field in that regard. So definitely we have a lot. And again, we have at least three, four elements today just in the potential on the cloud and I think it's -- it's going well overall. -- Okay, great. Well, thank you. -- I would just said that, you know, the cloud, when we look at the part in the subscription, it's actually becoming quite nice. It's -- I can't give you the number right now, but I can say, it's growing quite nice. The growth is over 70% and it's growing and it's no longer -- it's a few 10s of millions of year -- a year probably going to be by the end of the year. So it's becoming quite significant there.Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Your line is now live. -- Hey guys, not to mention of new customers and Gil, you mentioned both augmentation and displacement. I'm curious if there's any trends in terms of where you're seeing those win rates either by geography, by industry, by type of customer or even by users (ph)? -- I mean, in terms of industries, it's all over. I think I mentioned that we've seen basically everything from construction to technology and everything in the middle, finance, manufacturing and so on. Geography, Q1 was very strong in Europe, and I think we've talked about it number of times. Europe at least this quarter got it right and is showing nice growth rate in new customers. In the US, I see a nice change in the activity levels and I hope that -- that will be translated to the actual results later on. -- Okay. And then one follow-up. Did you guys make any changes to your pricing for either software blades or support for 2019? -- Nothing, nothing -- we have -- we have tweaks in the pricing. But no -- nothing dramatic I think. -- Okay. Thank you.Thank you. We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments. -- Thank you everyone for joining us today. We look forward to seeing you throughout the quarter. If you do have any calls that you'd like to have with us, please send us an email and we'll try to get back to you, as quickly as possible. Thank you, and have a great day. Bye-bye.Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today. --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  -- Transcript powered by When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Instead, weak guidance is sending it down. Image source: Getty Images.Using  , Check Point earned $1.15 per share in Q1. That was a penny below what the company had earned in Q1 2018. However, pro forma profits for the quarter came in at $1.32 per share, versus the $1.31 per share that Wall Street analysts had predicted -- an ""earnings beat.""Quarterly sales of $471.8 million likewise edged out analyst estimates and were up 4% year over year. Security subscriptions grew 13% year over year.But again, that wasn't the problem. The problem was that after reporting its earnings beat, Check Point proceeded to give new guidance for the second quarter of 2019, currently under way. Management says it expects to earn between $1.32 and $1.40 per share this quarter, on sales of $474 million to $500 million.When taken at their midpoints, these projections suggest pro forma profit of only $1.36 per share on sales of $487 million. And while that sales number would meet Wall Street's estimate for Check Point in Q2, the earnings number would fall $0.02 short of the $1.38 per share that Wall Street wants to see Check Point earn.Thus, what we're looking at here is a case of an ""earnings beat"" undermined by a ""guidance miss.""

"Chicago, IL - March 13, 2019 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Check Point  , Qualys, Inc.  , Fortinet, Inc.  , CyberArk Software Ltd.  and Palo Alto Networks, Inc.  .Demand for cybersecurity solutions is expected to remain healthy in 2019 due to the increasing frequency and technologically advanced nature of cyber-attacks. These attacks are not only affecting companies but are also threatening the national security of some countries.Per Absolute Markets Insights  , cyber-attacks can cost companies almost $5.2 trillion every year. According to a USA Today  , data breaches and cyber-attacks in 2018 affected billions of people - 765 million in April, May and June alone.Moreover, the massive data breach by suspected Chinese hackers at hotel group Marriot International in December 2018 exposed the records of nearly 500 million customers.Further, in October last year, Bloomberg Businessweek claimed that Chinese spy chips were present in numerous American corporate giants' hardware, indicating the seriousness of data breach and sensitive information theft by hackers.Additionally, in May 2018, two of the largest Canadian banks reported a major hacking of personal and financial information of nearly 90,000 of their customers. The following month, Ukraine reported that it successfully warded off another sophisticated cyber-attack against a chlorine distribution plant.Recently, a research carried out by Check Point revealed that a massive distribution of the GandCrab ransomware has spread across Japan, Germany, Canada and Australia, among others, over the last two months, including an advanced version of the ransomware.Enterprises are realizing the need for stricter security measures, which is pushing companies to further increase spending in this space. Ongoing digital transformation and proliferation of smart connected devices supported by artificial intelligence (AI) and its tools like machine learning (ML) are exposing vulnerabilities in security systems globally.The growing incidents of AI and ML driven advanced security attacks or ""smart attacks"" have become a headwind for cybersecurity solution providers. As most enterprises transition to the cloud, traditional control panels are becoming insufficient to prevent and manage smart attacks.In 2019 and beyond, cyber criminals are likely to use malicious chatbots to interact with potential victims and manipulate private information out of them. Current technologies like firewalls and host-based security tools are not strong enough to effectively combat threats of this kind. This is making it increasingly important for more stringent and advanced security like identity-based application security, and considerable amount is being spent on research and development in this area.With the global IT spending on ""Security Technology"" projected to exceed $124 billion in 2019 by Gartner, the industry's prospects look promising from a near-term perspective, as it spells rise in sales of security products.Recently, at the RSA Conference held at San Francisco, several interesting updates on the cybersecurity industry surfaced. For instance, it was projected that cybersecurity budgets can grow about 20% year over year in 2019, which is encouraging for the overall industry.Moreover, per MarketsAndMarkets, the cybersecurity market is  to see a CAGR of 10.2% between 2018 and 2023 to reach $248.26 billion.Here, we have picked four cybersecurity stocks that have the potential to make the most of the increasing enterprise budget. These stocks either have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see  . is headquartered in Redwood City, CA. The company's partnerships with the likes of Amazon's AWS Security Hub and IBM's X-Force Red are expected to continue to be a major growth driver. This Zacks Rank #1 stock outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in all the trailing four quarters, average being 19.2%. , headquartered in Sunnyvale, CA, is optimistic about its portfolio of integrated secured SD-WAN and 5G products; Security Fabric product suit; and its security processor unit, SPU, ASIC technology, and a high-performance E-series product announced recently. This Zacks Rank #1 stock surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in all the trailing four quarters, average being 18.8%. is headquartered in Petach Tikva, Israel. Enhanced functionality of Version 10 of the company's core privileged access security solutions coupled with its new simplified pricing model is helping it drive customer acquisition. This Zacks Rank #2 stock beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in all the trailing four quarters, average being 57.8%. is a Santa Clara, CA-based provider of network security solutions to enterprises, service providers and government entities worldwide. Recent talks over its acquisition of InfoSec company Demisto is expected to boost its information security capabilities further. This Zacks Rank #2 stock topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in all the trailing four quarters, average being 8%.Firms operating in the security industry are positioned to benefit immensely.

FireEye's early loss-making days were pushed even deeper into the red by a string of  . There was always a method to the madness though. In 2016, the company finally began to weave all those different tools together into one  , and began ""renting"" cloud-based access to those constantly updated tools rather than selling them as one-time purchases.That business model has created a recurring revenue machine that's expected to lead FireEye to its first-ever full-year profit in 2019.Palo Alto had already borrowed that play from FireEye's playbook though, even if it applied the idea a bit differently. Rather than offering cloud-based access to cybersecurity tools, much of Palo Alto's subscription revenue is specifically linked to its hardware, it now accounts for  .Clearly, subscription revenue leads to much more certainty regarding cash flows and earnings.The other way Palo Alto Networks now offers investors a tough choice: Its Cortex AI product is  - at least by Palo Alto - ""the industry's only open and integrated, AI-based continuous security platform.""The essence of the statement is true, though it also glosses over the fact that FireEye's threat-detection platform is  algorithms. Though not 'open' to the degree Palo Alto's Cortex system is, the need for openness remains to be fully seen.Nevertheless, it's a development that at least some existing FireEye users will be checking out as an impressive alternative. Some already have, in fact.

With what and how remains unclear, but no cybersecurity player rests on its laurels for long.Still, for investors that liked the idea of FireEye but just couldn't get past its historic losses and thin margins that are likely to persist for the foreseeable future, reliably profitable Palo Alto Networks just became an even stronger prospect.Just wait for the profit-takers to finish their business before wading into any new PANW position.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@2 Reasons Palo Alto Networks Stock Is a Solid Alternative to FireEye@2019-03-06@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-reasons-palo-alto-networks-stock-solid-alternative-fireeye-2019-03-06

" (NYSE:) fourth-quarter earnings featured strong results and decent guidance. Going forward, BB and BlackBerry stock continue to have multiple strong, positive drivers, including continued expansion of QNX, synergies between core BlackBerry offerings and those of Cylance, continuous, strong licensing revenue and an effective executive team.Source: Shutterstock
	Despite all of these positive catalysts, some on Wall Street, as I , were concerned about the impact of the Cylance deal on the company’s near-term profit margins. Those concerns weighed heavily on BlackBerry stock on Monday.Although BB stock may drop back to $8.50 or so over the next month, investors with a time horizon of a year or more should buy BB stock on pullbacks, since the company’s longer-term outlook is definitely extraordinarily bright.Here are five key takeaways from the company’s Q4 results and its .BlackBerry’s overall easily beat expectations on both the top and bottom lines. The revenue of the company’s BlackBerry Technology Solutions unit jumped nearly 20% year-over-year to $55 million, an encouraging increase that indicates that the company’s previous QNX deals are starting to generate rapidly increasing revenue. BlackBerry’s licensing and IP revenue jumped over 70% to $99 million. The unit is likely to continue generating strong revenue going forward.Finally, the top line of BlackBerry’s Enterprise Software and Services (ESS) fell roughly 15% year-over-year, but both  and  blamed the decline on a new accounting standard. One analyst, TD Securities’ Daniel Chan, said that the timing of a major deal also contributed to the YoY decline.Moreover, BlackBerry CEO John Chen said during the company’s  that ESS’ “billings grew strongly on a sequential basis,” while BB expects the unit’s revenue to rise this year. The CEO noted that he expects the top line of the company’s unified endpoint management (UEM) offerings, which make up much of ESS’ revenue, to rise by about 10% in FY20, which began in February. He also reported that BB had received over 400 orders from banking customers during the quarter, while the unit also received orders from all three major branches of the U.S. military. All of that information certainly bodes well for the futures of the ESS unit, BB overall and BlackBerry stock.Turning to the company’s guidance, using the data Chen provided, BB appears to expect, at the mid-point of its 23%-27% FY20 revenue growth guidance, about $1.13 billion of overall revenue in FY20.Chen explained that the company is “investing for growth,” and will have to spend money on integrating Cylance, causing its expenses to rise meaningfully. But the CEO emphasized that the company’s profitability will rise throughout the year, meaning after Q1, it will likely be profitable after the current quarter. Additionally, BlackBerry did not clarify the extent to which the guidance includes potential large settlement deals, with court verdicts against a number of companies that BB has sued for patent infringement, including(NASDAQ:),  (NYSE:) and (NYSE:).Based on price-sales and price-book ratios, the current valuation of BlackBerry stock is meaningfully lower than that of a number of other companies that focus on IT security. For example, using Chen’s guidance and excluding cash, the forward price-sales ratio of BB stock is 4.66, versus forward price-sales ratios, excluding cash and based on analysts’ consensus 2019 revenue estimates of 9 for  (NASDAQ:), 7.5 for  (NASDAQ:) and 6.1 for  (NASDAQ:). The price-book ratios of CyberArk, CheckPoint and Fortinet are 12.8,  5.2 and 14.3, respectively, versus 2 for BB stock, according to Yahoo Finance.QNX generated a huge number of design wins — 22 — in Q4. Moreover, the operating system’s design wins expanded to areas beyond automotive, with eight of the design wins in areas other than automotive. Chen said he expects QNX’s revenue to rise 16% this year. Both the high number of design wins and the expansion beyond automotive bode very well for BlackBerry’s results and for BlackBerry stock over the long term.Radar, the company’s asset-tracking system, added eight new customers in Q4 and received nine repeat orders from existing customers. Additionally, “a number of very large customers” are interested in Radar, Chen stated.Some analysts and investors who have been bearish on BlackBerry stock have sought to portray the company’s licensing and IP revenue as “lumpy” and unreliable.  Meanwhile, the fact that the unit’s revenue jumped $41 million or 71% YoY in Q4 led some on the Street to assert that it was primarily responsible for the company’s better-than-expected results. Taken together, these views may have caused the Street to discount BlackBerry’s overall Q4 beat as a one-time phenomenon.But during last week’s conference call, Chen and the company’s CFO, Steve Capelli, took pains to demonstrate that the licensing and IP revenue will continue to flow indefinitely.Capelli said that the company has been able to deliver “consistent” IP and licensing revenue due to its “pipeline” of patents, while Chen said that the company expects the unit’s revenue to drop only 5% this year. He also noted that BB has 10 or 11 years remaining on most of its current patents, has applied for over 100 more patents. and acquired more patents through its Cylance deal. So the owners of BlackBerry stock should expect the company’s licensing and IP revenue to be consistently strong going forward.The only disappointing part of BlackBerry’s results was the guidance for Cylance, which is not expected to be profitable until next year and whose revenue is expected to rise “only” 25%-30%.Nonetheless, it’s clear why Chen decided to acquire Cylance. It’s strong in PCs and laptops, Chen said, while BlackBerry’s strength lies with mobile devices. The acquisition will enable BlackBerry to sell more of its core products to companies that emphasize PCs and laptops, while introducing Cylance’s products to companies that focus on securing their mobile devices. Companies that worry about the security of both mobile devices and PCs will now be able to meet all of their security needs with BB.As I’ve noted previously, Cylance should make BlackBerry’s offerings more appealing to governments. Meanwhile, QNX should be strengthened when Cylance is integrated into the operating system, and BlackBerry should be able to sell its products to many of Cylance’s small and medium-sized customers. Finally, the fact that (NYSE:) recently decided to offer Cylance’s products to its customers should boost BlackBerry’s results and is a tremendous vote of confidence in Cylance’s technology.Chen announced that he was dividing the company into three units; COO Bryan Palma, who has worked for and has a cybersecurity background, will lead BTS (dominated by QNX) and ESS, along with the company’s other Internet of Things businesses; Cylance co-founder and CEO Stuart McClure will continue to head Cylance and Capelli will be in charge of the Licensing and IP unit.All three men will report to Chen.I believe that the change is a vote of confidence by Chen in the company’s business and outlook, as it indicates that he believes the company is healthy enough for him to step back from managing its day-to-day operations. Additionally, Palma’s success at high-level positions in Fortune 500 companies and McClure’s track record of building Cylance into a top-notch IT security company indicate that their leadership should be positive for BlackBerry and BlackBerry stock. Finally, the move should free up Chen to focus more on making higher-level deals and partnerships.As of this writing, Larry Ramer owned shares of BlackBerry stock.   The post  appeared first on .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@BlackBerry Stock Is Bound to Head Much Higher in the Long Run@2019-04-02@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/blackberry-stock-bound-head-much-higher-long-run-2019-04-02
"Another day. Another hack. Another reason to buy a cybersecurity stock. That has been my motto for the better part of the past few years, as a huge surge in digital data volume globally has been accompanied by an equally large surge in headline cyber attacks. The big one was the  (NYSE:  ) scandal back in mid-2017, but that incident is far from isolated. Everyone from  (NYSE:  ) to  (NYSE:  ) to Whole Foods to  to  and U.S. universities has dealt with a cyber attack of some sort over the past several years.Concurrent to the rampant rise in cyber attacks, demand for cybersecurity solutions has burgeoned, and cybersecurity stocks have bounced. The  (NYSEARCA:  ) is up roughly 20% over the past year, almost double the  return of 18%.The pace of these attacks will only increase as more valuable data shifts online over the next several years. As such, demand for cybersecurity solutions will continue to grow and cybersecurity stocks will continue to outperform.With that in mind, here's a list of 15 cybersecurity stocks that investors should watch over the next several years. Indeed, I think a few of them could be huge winners:When it comes to cybersecurity stocks, the cream of the corp is  (NYSE:  ).""Another day, another hack, another reason to buy a cybersecurity stock"" could just as easily read ""another day, another hack, another reason to buy Palo Alto Networks stock."" In other words, Palo Alto Networks is so big and so good at what it does that the company may as well be a substitute for the entire cybersecurity space.This dominance has manifested itself in a long and steady track record of 20%-plus revenue growth and healthy operating margin expansion, the sum of which has powered a 350% rally in PANW stock over the past five years.Recent numbers are strong, the uptrend remains intact, and analysts remain confident on the stock, so it is all around thumbs up for PANW here and now.Source: While Palo Alto Networks may be the cream of the corp in this industry,  (NASDAQ:  ) isn't too far behind.This is another really big, really strong cybersecurity company that has a strong track record of 20%-plus revenue growth and strong share price gains. Over the past five years, FTNT is up 300%.Revenue growth isn't slowing at all (up 21% last quarter), implying that despite increased competition, Fortinet continues to ride secular tailwinds in cybersecurity to 20%-plus revenue growth. Thus, so long as cybersecurity tailwinds remain strong, FTNT stock should do well.Analysts are worried about  here and now, with the stock trading at nearly 50X forward earnings. That does seem a little rich and this stock may be due for a correction in the near future. But thereafter, long-term tailwinds should drive FTNT stock higher.Source: Another cybersecurity industry titan is  (NASDAQ:  ). And, as an industry titan, CHKP stock is a likely winner if cybersecurity tailwinds stay strong.But, CHKP stock has struggled lately. CHKP stock is up just 7% over the past year. A lot of the recent weakness in CHKP stock has to do with anemic revenue growth. Revenue growth was just 2% last quarter, an usually low mark for a cybersecurity giant.Long story short, it looks like competition is weighing on CHKP stock. Thus, go-forward growth prospects, while strong, are muddied by competitive threats. Granted, CHKP stock sports a reasonable valuation at just 20X forward earnings. But, that low valuation runs next to low growth, so the stock really isn't a bargain.Analysts aren't in love with this stock (they see less than  over the next 12 months), and the chart isn't all that great, either. Thus, while CHKP should head higher in the long run thanks to industry tailwinds, the outlook for the stock in the near- to medium-term is much less promising.Source: I'd lump cybersecurity company  (NASDAQ:  ) more into the Check Point pile than the Palo Alto Networks and Fortinet pile.This is a solid company with healthy industry drivers. But, revenue growth isn't robust (just 6% last quarter). Adjusted gross margins are inching higher, but not by much. The company is barely profitable, yet the valuation is fairly sizable at more than 3X trailing sales.As such, FEYE stock doesn't look like a huge winner in the big picture.That being said, there is an argument to buy FEYE stock in the near- to medium-term. Ever since the start of 2016, FEYE stock has been highly cyclical. In that cycle, the stock usually bottoms when the trailing sales multiple hits 3. Right now, we are just above 3. Thus, further weakness in the stock should be expected, but could turn into a medium-term buying opportunity. (NASDAQ:  ) is the nascent, hyper-growth player in the cybersecurity space.The company isn't all that big (under $6 billion market cap, versus nearly $20 billion for Palo Alto Networks). But, what this company lacks in size, it makes up for in growth. Revenue growth last quarter was 40%, and it was 40% the quarter before that, too.Because of this massive growth in a rapidly expanding industry, PFPT stock has done quite well. The stock is up nearly 300% over the past five years.Analysts think this stock  . So do I. Growth rates are huge, the valuation is reasonable, and the chart looks good (big buy signal if the stock drops to $110, its 200-day moving average).There is a lot of noise surrounding  (NASDAQ:  ) right now. But, I think that if you zoom out and look at the big picture, this is a cybersecurity company heading in the right direction.IMPV stock got slammed recently because of mixed quarterly numbers that included a big-cut to the full-year guide. The rationale behind the down-guide was that Imperva is transitioning to a subscription model, and that is adversely affecting revenue and profits in the near-term.Longer-term, though, this is the right move. We are entering the subscription economy era. Moreover, Imperva operates in a rapid growth area of cybersecurity (hybrid cloud), and that gives them exposure to huge tailwinds over the next several quarters.Meanwhile, the valuation on IMPV stock is reasonable at only 4.5X sales. Thus, in a big picture, I think IMPV stock is headed in the right direction. But, IMPV won't be a big winner overnight, so expect some choppiness while Imperva's financials take a near-term hit from the subscription shift.Source: ShutterstockMuch like Proofpoint,  (NASDAQ:  ) is a cybersecurity company characterized by small scale but big growth.CyberArk is even smaller than Proofpoint (just a $2 billion market cap). But, growth is really big. Last quarter, revenues rose 35% year-over-year, and deferred revenue rose by more than 50%.Also much like PFPT, CYBR stock has been a big winner due to its big growth. Over the past year, CYBR stock is up 80%.Analysts think this run will continue, albeit at a much  . That seems reasonable to me. This stock is slightly more expensive than PFPT, but growing at a slower rate, so if you are searching for growth in the cybersecurity space, I'd pick PFPT over CYBR.Source: ShutterstockOne of the bigger companies on this list,  (NASDAQ:  ), is much more than just a cybersecurity company. But, a big part of this company's turnaround narrative is centered on cybersecurity.That part of the Cisco narrative is doing well, and is powering improved financial results. But, Cisco as a whole remains a low-growth business with struggling margins. Moreover, laps are going to get tougher going forward, so slowing revenue growth is a risk this company is looking at it in the near- to medium-term future.That being said, CSCO stock is pretty cheap at just 16X forward earnings, and the chart looks pretty good.Big picture, CSCO stock has good, but not great, upside from here. It is a low-risk, low-volatility investment with a cheap valuation. But, it also lacks big-time growth drivers to unlock huge share price appreciation in the long-term.Source: ShutterstockAlthough it is one of the smaller names on this list,  (NASDAQ:  ) has one of the better growth narratives in all of cybersecurity.This is a company that is positioning itself as a data protection company. Considering the volume of digital data is exploding higher right now on a global scale, data protection is the right niche to dominate over the next several years.Carbonite's numbers are really good. Revenues rose more than 30% last quarter. Gross margins are trending higher. Operating margins, too. Net profits are growing by a whole bunch from a small base.The valuation, meanwhile, isn't all that bad at 4X trailing sales. Plus, the stock is up more than 100% over the past year, and it has a bunch of positive momentum right now. Altogether, CARB stock looks like a winner.Source: ShutterstockThe next cybersecurity stock to watch over the next several years is  (NASDAQ:  ).The value prop of Qualys is getting enterprise customers to sign onto their platform, consolidate their security and compliance stacks, and cut IT spend. That is a pretty promising value prop, and a lot of customers are buying into it.Last quarter, revenues at Qualys rose more than 20%. Same with last quarter, and the quarter before that. Gross margins aren't soaring higher, but operating margins are moving higher as big revenue growth is driving opex leverage.From a valuation perspective, this hyper-growth cybersecurity stock looks fully valued at over 13X trailing sales. That is about as big as it gets in this industry, but Qualys isn't the biggest grower. Thus, going forward, valuation will likely weigh on share price performance.Source: ShutterstockOf all the stocks on this list,  (NASDAQ:  ) is the one that has been under the most pain.SYMC stock is down more than 30% over the past year, mostly thanks to slowing revenue growth, which just turned negative. Considering competition in this space is only intensifying, it is discouraging to see revenue growth already dip into negative territory.That being said, SYMC stock is about as cheap as it gets in this sector. The stock trades at 2.5X trailing sales and 13X forward earnings. Those are pretty cheap multiples for exposure to cyber defense.If the growth trajectory for this company improves, SYMC stock could soar higher. Until then, though, SYMC stock will remain weak. There simply isn't much demand for zero-growth cyber defense stocks.Source: ShutterstockOne cybersecurity stock with a very attractive and multi-faceted growth narrative is  (NASDAQ:  ).The Akamai growth narrative is really quite broad. On one end, the company's fastest-growing segment is its Cloud Security solutions.

This shift is only gaining momentum, and as such, Akamai's growth narrative and numbers are only getting better.Valuation is a concern for this stock. But, the fundamentals are pretty good.

This is a good place to be. It puts Splunk at the heart of a  addressable market. Revenues currently sit around $1.3 billion on a trailing 12 month basis, so there is clearly a long runway for big growth.But, revenue growth has been consistently slowing at SPLK. The valuation, however, has not compressed. That is a worrisome combination. With revenue growth last quarter under 40%, and the price-to-sales multiple above 10X, this stock looks unnecessarily risky here and now.Analysts have been moving to the sidelines on this name, and insiders are  , so now might be the time to heed the warning signs.Source: Shutterstock (NASDAQ:  ) has been a winner to-date. But, that could change soon.There's no doubt about it. FFIV stock has been a cybersecurity winner. Over the past year, the stock is up 60%. Yet, despite the big run, the forward-earnings-multiple on FFIV stock remains below 20.Thus, the valuation is attractive. But, it is on top of what is projected as sub-10% earnings growth over the next several years. A 20X multiple for less than 10% growth isn't all the great, especially considering the market is trading at a lower multiple (17X) for  (16.5%).Perhaps that is why most analysts have a price target on the stock that is  the current price tag. I think the analysts are right on this one. This feels like a low growth company with a big growth valuation.

The IPO was a huge success. ZS stock doubled in its first day of trading, closing at $33. The momentum hasn't really stopped. Today, ZS stock is around $40.The hype makes sense. Zscaler is a cloud security company with nearly 3,000 customers, a huge international presence, 50%-plus revenue growth and 80%-plus gross margins. The company is disrupting a huge, nearly $20 billion cloud and mobility market, and revenues last year were just $126 million.Thus, the long-term growth narrative supporting ZS stock is quite promising. But, this is nearly a $5 billion company that is expected to do under $200 million in sales this year, so the stock is trading at a rather huge 25X-plus sales multiple. That isn't a risk-off investment. As such, ZS is the high-risk, high-reward name in this cybersecurity bunch.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@15 Cybersecurity Stocks to Watch as the Industry Heats Up@2019-02-19@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/15-cybersecurity-stocks-to-watch-as-the-industry-heats-up-2019-02-19
"etwork security company  (NASDAQ: CHKP) delivered a solid set of fourth-quarter earnings this week that should set the company up to have another good year in 2019. Let's take a closer look at its earnings report and guidance.Let's start with the headline numbers from the quarter:The headline numbers look good, and a breakout of the components of sales growth shows how the company's overall low-single-digit growth rate is supported by a shift in revenue from products toward subscriptions.As CEO Gil Shwed  , ""Key drivers to our success and growth this past quarter were our Advanced Security Technologies, primarily our Cloud and Advanced Threat Prevention solutions. These are subscription-based solutions and their continued success is shifting our business into more of an annuity business model."" When software companies turn to subscription-based models, it's a good idea to keep an eye on deferred revenue because revenue won't be recognized up front (as it usually is with products) but instead will be recognized over time. For reference, Check Point's deferred revenue grew 13% year over year in the fourth quarter.The following chart shows Check Point's breakdown of revenue.Data source: Company presentations. Chart by author.Here are management's expectations for 2019:In other words, management expects another year of revenue growth in the low- to mid-single digits and earnings growth in the mid-to-high single digits.As the long-established leader in the industry, Check Point is a relatively mature company and has growth rates to match. Whereas the likes of  or  are aiming at mid-teens growth, Check Point's challenge is to continue its single-digit growth trajectory by developing new products and growing software and subscription revenue from its installed base.In addition, investors will be hoping Check Point can maintain the whopping 53% non-GAAP operating income margin reported in 2018 as well as continue to convert 59% of its revenue into operating cash flow. In a nutshell, Check Point is a mature, high-margin cash cow.Thus, the pressure is on to maintain growth and make its products relevant to the next generation of security threats.

 (NASDAQ:  ) has grown extensively, in tandem with companies' need for cybersecurity. The value of CYBR stock has doubled in recent months. Also, the October swoon of the  that punished most tech equities left CybeerArk stock largely unscathed.Despite this resilience, the attractiveness of CYBR stock still may appear to be questionable. However, after analyzing CYBR's financial metrics and the value proposition offered by CyberArk stock, I think this mid-cap equity is still worth buying.CyberArk provides security for many companies' most critical systems. Industries such as healthcare, financial services, and retail have deployed CyberArk's software to protect their systems.Meanwhile, CYBR stock has enjoyed something that has escaped most other tech stocks in recent months: growth. Since hitting a low in the low $40 per share range in late 2017, CyberArk stock has risen steadily. Instead of falling as most tech stocks did in October, CYBR stayed in a range, and today CYBR stock is above its early-October highs.The only question now is how long the rally can continue. Early indications imply that the rally of CyberArk stock can last for the foreseeable future. The company's profit growth remains robust. Analysts on average expect its profits to increase by 51.7% in fiscal 2018. They predict that its profit growth will slow to 10.2% in 2019. Still, analysts forecast average annual profit growth of 33.2% for CYBR between 2020 and 2025.CYBR stock has more than doubled in value over the last 13 months. As a result, the forward price-earnings ratio of CyberArk stock has risen to 43.8. While that may seem high, it's reasonable, in light of the company's average annual growth rate of 33.2%.Also, CYBR stock has a market cap of just $3.1 billion. That compares to  (NASDAQ:  ) market cap of $13.1 billion and the $17.1 billion market cap of  (NASDAQ:  ). As a result, the rally of CyberArk stock may only have just started.As the development of technology progresses, the role of CyberArk will only grow in importance. For now, IT systems store data critical to our lives such as medical records and financial statements. Before too long, IT systems will probably carry out other, vital tasks, such as driving cars and even performing surgical procedures. At that point, keeping these systems secure will literally become a matter of life and death.Moreover, the advent of 5G will bring CyberArk's software into more of these systems. 5G will also likely lead to new applications that we have not yet imagined. Consequently, we probably do not yet know the revenue-generating potential of CyberArk's products.CYBR stock is not cheap. However, with its low market cap, high growth rates, and a multiple that's reasonable in light of its growth, I think that CYBR stock is the equity of choice in the cybersecurity field.Investors should consider CYBR stock both because of its value and its value proposition. CyberArk software plays a critical role in securing vital technology. Its software will only become more important as technology advances.Many investors may assume that it's too late to buy CyberArk stock simply because the value of the stock has more than doubled since late 2017. However, after the rally, the forward price-earnings ratio of CYBR stock is just over 40. Given that CYBR is expected to grow at a 30%-plus annual rate over the next few years, investors will receive large amounts of growth in exchange for that high multiple.Considering its essential role in securing both healthcare and financial information, CYBR stock currently offers value to investors. However, once 5G launches, new technologies not yet imagined by most investors will proliferate. For that reason, investors should consider not only the current metrics of CYBR, but also its tremendous future potential.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Cybersecurity Needs Make CyberArk Stock a Lock for Investors@2019-01-30@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/cybersecurity-needs-make-cyberark-stock-lock-investors-2019-01-30

he cybersecurity industry is expected to get even bigger this year.  estimates that global cybersecurity spending will jump nearly 9% in 2019 to $124 billion as companies beef up their cyberdefenses to protect against a wide variety of complex threats. This is not surprising, as hackers are employing advanced techniques to carry out attacks.The increasing sophistication of cyberattacks is definitely bad news for all of us, but cybersecurity companies that make a living by selling solutions to protect against such threats stand to gain from this trend.  , for instance, has been  thanks to the rapid adoption of its cybersecurity solutions, while  has turned itself around as demand for its offerings  .But  (NASDAQ: CHKP) has found it  of its peers, thanks mainly to a conservative strategy that focuses on bottom-line growth and share buybacks. But the cybersecurity specialist could change that image in 2019 and step up its game. Let's see why.Image source: Getty Images.Check Point recently acquired Israel-based cybersecurity start-up Dome9 to boost the cloud security features of its Infinity architecture.Check Point's Infinity is an end-to-end cybersecurity platform that covers endpoints, the network infrastructure, the cloud, and mobile devices. The company aims to provide enterprises with complete threat protection against  with this architecture, so it needs to bolster the cloud security part to boost Infinity's adoption and bring it into the limelight.That's exactly what the Dome9 acquisition does. Check Point paid $175 million in cash for this start-up to get Dome9's cloud-centric cybersecurity capabilities that can be deployed across popular public cloud services like  's AWS,  Azure, and Google Cloud. Dome9's key features include identity protection, cloud traffic analysis, and ensuring compliance with security guidelines.Check Point hasn't wasted much time in putting this acquisition to use. The company has integrated its CloudGuard solution with the AWS Security Hub, allowing enterprise customers to have a better idea about the gaps in their security architecture. Customers using the CloudGuard solution on AWS will get real-time alerts regarding potential security events, and Dome9's capabilities will also allow them to analyze and respond to such events.This is a smart move for Check Point, as AWS is the biggest public cloud provider out there, controlling around 40% of this market. So the company is now in a better position to go after the cloud security opportunity that's expected to clock an annual growth rate of nearly 25% through 2024, hitting a size of nearly $24 billion at the end of the forecast period.Check Point has been known to be thrifty when it comes to acquiring new customers. In fact, it spends the least amount of money on sales and marketing when compared to its peers. data by  .However, Check Point's spending on this line item has increased over the past year. The company's sales and marketing expenses increased 17% annually during the las  ed quarter, signifying a change in management's approach. The more important thing is that the bump in Check Point's sales and marketing spending is positively impacting the company's  .Check Point reported an 11% annual increase in deferred revenue during the third quarter, which is an improvement over the second quarter's deferred revenue growth of 8.7%. The faster growth of this metric bodes well for Check Point, as deferred revenue is the money collected in advance by a company for services that will be rendered at a later date.As such, higher deferred revenue means that either Check Point customers are committing to buying more of its solutions, or it is successfully acquiring new ones. Either way, the increase in this metric indicates that the company's ramped-up marketing efforts are working.So it won't be surprising to see Check Point's business kicking up a gear in 2019 thanks to its latest strategies.

ooking today at week-over-week shares outstanding changes among the universe of ETFs covered at  , one standout is the iShares Core MSCI International Developed Markets ETF (Symbol: IDEV) where we have detected an approximate $86.4 million dollar outflow -- that's a 6.0% decrease week over week (from 27,600,000 to 25,950,000). Among the largest underlying components of IDEV, in trading today NXP Semiconductors NV (Symbol: NXPI) is off about 1.1%, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (Symbol: TEVA) is off about 0.4%, and Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd. (Symbol: CHKP) is higher by about 1%.  The chart below shows the one year price performance of IDEV, versus its 200 day moving average:Looking at the chart above, IDEV's low point in its 52 week range is $47.05 per share, with $59.87 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $52.21. Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@IDEV, NXPI, TEVA, CHKP: Large Outflows Detected at ETF@2019-02-04@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/idev-nxpi-teva-chkp-large-outflows-detected-etf-2019-02-04

In our press release, which has been posted on our website, we present GAAP and non-GAAP results, along with a reconciliation of such results, as well as the reasons for our presentation of non-GAAP information.Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Tal Payne for a review of the financial results. -- Thank you, Kip. Good morning and good afternoon to everyone joining us on the call today. I'm pleased to begin the review of the fourth quarter and full year.Revenues for the fourth quarter increased by 4% year over year to $526 million, toward the high end of our guidance. And our non-GAAP EPS grew by 6% to $1.68, exceeding the high end of our guidance. Before I proceed further into the numbers, let me remind you that our GAAP financial results include stop base compensation charges and monetization of acquired intangible assets and acquisition-related expenses as well as the related tax effects. Keep in mind that, as applicable, non-GAAP information is presented including these items.Now, let's take a look at the financial highlights for the quarter. Products and securities subscription revenues were $307 million. Our security subscription revenues continue to be strong with 13% growth year over year, reaching $147 million this quarter. Our software updates and maintenance revenues increased to $218 million, representing 4% growth year over year. The growth in our subscription revenues is driven by our Advanced Threat Protection Solution, the SandBlast, and our CloudGuard business.During the quarter, we closed an impressive Infinity deal in a variety of industries, including a large information and data corporation and a retail company. Deferred revenues as of December 31, 2018 reached $1,338,000,000, a growth of $151 million or 13% over December of last year. The deferred revenue growth is a reflection of the strength in our security subscription and support.Revenue distribution by geography for the quarter was as follows: 45% of revenues came from the Americas, 39% of revenues came from Euro, the remaining 16% came from Asia-Pacific, Japan, Middle East, and Africa regions.From a deal side perspective, this quarter we had 102 customers with transactions over $1 million. The total value of these transactions continues to increase. Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 53%, similar to the previous quarter, Q3.Effective non-GAAP tax rate for this quarter was 11%. This quarter, similar to last year and as expected, our tax expenses included tax benefits from lapse of statutes of limitations on certain provisions.GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $238 million or $1.51 per diluted share, an increase of 4% from the fourth quarter of last year. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $264 or $1.68 per diluted share, an increase of 6% for the fourth quarter of 2017. EPS exceeded the top end of our guidance.Our cash balances were $4,039,000,000 as of year-end. Operating cash flow was $249 million, similar to last year. Collections from customers continue to be very strong. This quarter part of Dome9 acquisition payment is presented in operating cash flow according to the accounting rules. Excluding this payment, the operating cash flow increased by 7%. During the quarter, we purchased 2.8 million shares for $305 million at an average price of $111 per share.Now, let's take a look in to our 2018 full year highlights. Revenues for the year was $1,916,000,000, an increase of 3% from last year. During the year, subscriptions continued to be the main growth driver. The subscription revenues include majority of our new products and services, including our cloud and mobile solutions. Bear in mind this cloud license is sold as annual subscriptions while before we sold it as a perpetual license.On the Infinity front, in the transaction that was closed during the year, we have seen an increase of 10s to 100s of percentage in the annual run rate. This is great news. The product portion reduced since the allocation to subscriptions is quite large. This is due to the inclusion of all of our available services in the Infinity offeringNon-GAAP operating margins for the year were strong at 53%. We continue to invest in our sales forces and marketing efforts. The full effect for both, the head count and the compensation, increase will be reflected next year. Also, 2019 will include the full effect of both of our acquisitions, Dome9 and ForceNock. Hence, we expect our margins to be around 50%.Effective non-GAAP tax rates for the year of 16%. For 2019, we expect the tax rates for the year to be approximately 14%; around 18%-19% in Q1-Q3 and around 0% in Q4 as the lapse of statute of limitation is expected to occur in the fourth quarter as we've seen in the last few years.GAAP net income for the year was $821 million, or $5.15 per diluted share. GAAP earnings per share grew by 7%. Non-GAAP income for the year was $911 million or $5.71 per diluted share, reflecting an increase of 7% as well.For the year, cash flow from operation increased by 4%, reaching $1,130,000,000 compared to $1,019,000,000 in '17. During the year, the company repurchased approximately 10.3 million shares at a total cost of $1,104,000,000 at an average price of $107.For now, I will turn the call over to Gil for his comments and such. -- Thank you, Tal, and hello everyone joining us today. As you've seen in the fourth quarter, our business results were better than our projection. Key drivers to our success and growth this past quarter were our Advanced Security Technologies, primarily our Cloud and Advanced Threat Prevention solutions. These are subscription-based solutions and their continued success is shifting our business in to more of an annuity business model.During the year, we made progress on all our key areas of focus. We introduced and pushed our 5th Generation security platform, Infinity, and made headway in providing it as a platform to customers. We introduced a new family of cloud security products, the CloudGuard family. It includes CloudGuard GA to secure public and private cloud, and CloudGuard SaaS which secures software as a service application and prevent malware or account hijacking from penetrating in to this environment.The newest addition to our cloud security family is the Dome9 acquisition, which was completed in the fourth quarter and focuses on managing and enforcing security across multi-cloud, public cloud environments. It's a great product to get control over public cloud security implementation and fits very well in to our cloud security offerings.We started 2019 with our CPX 360 sales partners and customers conference. CPX 360 is held in three different locations. The first one was held for our Asia-based customers and partners in Bangkok last week and was a great success. We had higher participation than ever before. We received excellent feedback on the content, and we used it to launch some new initiatives and products for 2019.We've talked about the future of cyber security and our Gen6 Infinity platform, which is under development. Today's IT environment secure primarily endpoints and networks and rely on highly sophisticated software which is operated in relatively few points on the network. Future IT environments will include much more work loads which needs to be secured. In the cloud, we will have new types of assets, virtual servers, containers, web and cloud services, and computerless computing such as cloud functions. Future IT environment will also need to secure many IoT devices that are starting to surround us. Not to mention, the mobile devices which I believe are the number 1 threat to our privacy and security nowadays.Overall, I believe that the amount of assets we will need to secure will increase by 10-fold in the coming three to five years. But it is more than just the amount of assets we will need to secure. If we take an attack method, let's take a malicious file for an example. A malicious file can come from multiple attack vectors: email, file download, file server, mobile messaging app, etc. I can easily count nine different attack vectors in which a file can be delivered. Multiply that by the number of technologies that are needed to prevent the different types of malware that can be imbedded in a single file, at least eight for best measure, you'll get the complexity of 72 different combinations that needs to be resolved and secured.Take it to the next level and look at the entire spectrum of security and you'll easily get 16 attack vectors and 26 technologies, over 400 combinations that needs to be addressed. There is no security expert in the world that can manage this complexity and get it resolved and secured. There is no other way to secure this entire environment without simplifying and consolidating security.Our future Infinity platform is built to support and provide our vast collection of security technologies to all these attack vectors and to support millions of assets. It will rely on cloud architecture that is self-updateable and provides vast amounts of services to many non-security agents which will reside everywhere security is needed and at every performance level. While it may sound futuristic, we are making progress quite rapidly.This month we introduced some new platforms that applied some of these values into our daily business. We introduced two new appliances that are optimized for threat prevention performance and double the performance we provide in their class. These are matched by one of the more interesting products we launched called Maestro. Maestro is designed to provide cloud grade scalability to network security. It provides organization with almost unlimited network security elasticity by chaining network security appliance in a very simple way and turning them into a giant security powerhouse with capability, resiliency, and performance which is hard to match.In the coming weeks we will continue our series of CPX 360 conferences in the US and Europe. We expect to see a record level of attendance in both conferences. But beyond technology, in 2018 we've made some significant changes to our sales force, focusing on new customer acquisition, and going to the C-level of our current and prospect customers.From my meeting with CIOs and CISOs, Chief Information Security Officers, I can say that there is a great level of interest in our approach and platform. We are making great progress but have a way to go to see the full impact of these changes. Last year we appointed a new Chief Customer Officer. We started 2019 with a new Head of Global Partners and a new head for our Asia sales organization. So, clearly, we continue to invest in our sales organization.Our technology and sales efforts are designed with one thing in mind: to be at the forefront of cybersecurity. Our research team is one of the strongest in the world and last year it delivered some major headline. In the fourth quarter, researchers identified the major shift of known and unknown campaigns toward the use of file less techniques. Our new set of SoundBlast technologies were able to uncover and prevent these campaigns despite their highly invasive nature. These included the Gand group Krab ransomware, Ursnif banking trojan, and the 109 crypto jacker.Furthermore, our researchers uncovered several critical vulnerabilities in popular applications and services, including the ability to penetrate drones through the DGI cloud control infrastructure. And for those of your who play Fortnite, or have kids that do, we protected you by finding a vulnerability in the Fortnite cloud that allowed account hijacking. Both DGI and Fortnite were fixed.We often talk about the use of automated tools in Ai cybersecurity. We utilized some of these techniques and our engines were able to find 50 different vulnerabilities in an Adobe Reader in 50 days, highlighting the vulnerability of every piece of software and infrastructure around us.Overall, it looks like the activity in cyberspace isn't slowing down and we'll have plenty of work ahead of us. So, this is a good time to talk about the 2019 projection. We expect to see a gradual change in our business model as we continue to move more revenues into subscriptions. And you know my regular caveat, it's hard to predict the future. Results may vary. There are many factors that can help us achieve better results and many other factors that can cause worse results. With that in mind, let me share the projection for next year.Revenues for the full year of 2019 are expected to be between $1,940,000,000 up to $2,040,000,000. Non-GAAP EPS for the full year is expected to be between $5.85 to $6.25. GAAP EPS for the full year is expected to be approximately $0.70 less.For the first quarter, revenues are expected to be in the range of $460 to $480 million, an EPS in the range of $1.28 to $1.34. GAAP EPS is expected to be approximately $0.16 less.Thank you for all your support and we'll be happy to open the lines for your insightful questions.Thank you. If you would like to ask a question, please press *1 on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate you have arrived in the question queue. You may press *2 if you would like to remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up the handset before pressing the * keys. Please ask one question and one follow-up question.Our first question is from Michael Turtis with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question. -- Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Two questions. One, this looked like a very good quarter, a better quarter, for products on a sequential basis, even with the move to subscription. So, I was wondering if you could talk about what drove that? And then the second question is margins into next year, as you have them going down a bit again. Maybe you could walk through what's flowing through from this year and what the incremental investments are into next year. -- So, I think for the quarter we had a good quarter. Things were as we expected, pretty much. We did win bills from all types, and all types of customers; new customers, renewal customers. Again, we continue to see the shift toward subscription, but we still have a decent number of product sales. I think this quarter, for the first time, you'll notice that our subscription revenues surpassed the product revenues, which I think is a good sign for us and reflect that we're safe for a long time.As for the second time, about margins for next year, I think first, our margins are very high and they've always been very high. So, I'm always thankful since we went public almost 23 years ago. But my focus is not managing the margin but managing the effectiveness of the business, managing the growth, and managing the technologies. Last year, I think, our headcount grew by about 11%. So, as we move into 2019 that will be reflected in additional expenses. We also saw some of the expenses in 2018 and we will see all of it in 2019. We still expect to hire more people in 2019. We still expect to invest more in sales and marketing.Even if I take this first quarter when we have the CPX 360 conferences, we have more attendance than last year and that means a bigger expense, which is a huge project. That's one example of things that we are doing. And I think Tal can speak more about the numbers, but I think the spending is going up and we are investing more in our operations. -- And I will just add, remember there is also the acquisition of Dome that almost had no effect in 2018 because we purchased it toward the end of the year and it's going to have the full year effect in the expenses next year, and the smaller acquisition of ForceNock as well. So, all in all, I would say the effect of the acquisitions and majority of the increase of the headcount of last year, which we will see the full effect of it next year. And you will already see it in Q1. The reduction to those margins you will see in Q1 already. -- You talked about adding more headcount, but if you really think about what needs to be more effective for you in going to market and being competitive, is it just more salespeople? Or do you need a different approach? Something that would make you, let's say, more aggressive from a sales and marketing perspective? -- I think we are doing fine, but I think we need both. The number one, I believe, is quality and not quantity. I always believed in that. So, we are working on how we address C-level, about how we address new customers. That's the majority of the investment. But in terms of coverage, yes. We can have more coverage and we can cover more customers, more areas, more accounts.And I think, one last thing which is very, very important, is working with partners. We are investing in working better in our partners. If you remember, our legacy, our business was with 100 percent reliance on partners. These days, I think we've taken more ownership of directing our business. And we've done an amazing job in that in the last few years. But I think it's time to reinvest in our partners and do both, and get the bigger leverage for our business. I think that's why we hired a new Head of Global Partners at the beginning of this year, and I think we tend to invest more, also, in partnerships. -- Okay. Thanks, guys.Our next question is from Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. -- Great. Thanks so much for taking the question and congrats on another quarter of billings growth at market rates or thereabouts. I've got a question for Gil and then a follow-up for Tal. Gil, from all your meetings with CISOs and other tech executives, how are you thinking about the overall spending environment for security into 2019? Because some are calling for a period of digestion, and as you think about it, how does the environment factor into the 2019 outlook that you've provided? -- I think that can definitely happen. On one hand, everybody's talking about cyber is a top priority and about they want to invest more in cyber. On the other hand, IT budgets are under pressure and every IT department and every purchasing agent is looking to reduce costs with every venture. Nobody is just throwing money. They are all renegotiating their contracts and trying to reduce their costs, which is very understandable. I believe the key to our growth will come not from people throwing money and not from a hyper-growth in the market, and the market is growing but it's not growing in crazy rates right now. I think it will come from really penetrating more project at the higher level and consolidating many things in the customer environment. That is a challenging task, but that's, I think, the future of what we need to invest in because that will be the real solution for security. It's not just a matter of business model. It's not just a matter of practicality. It's a matter of what can really make the world secure.I described in what I said earlier the complexity of security. There is no other way to obtain security than to consolidate and move into a new type of platform. And we are now building the platform that, I believe, can really provide cybersecurity for the next generation. -- Excellent. Thanks, Gil. And Tal, now that we've got another quarter under your belt selling Infinity, can you talk a bit about the impact to the model? I mean, you mentioned it in your caveated full-year guidance to say that you're assuming some portion of the business is taking Infinity. But can you maybe quantify for us what those assumptions are? And is it fair to say that if Infinity adoption is greater than expected it can be a headwind to revenue? How should we think about that? -- Yes. The second statement is correct. We assumed like it will continue at this pace which we see more Infinity deals, and we will see more in the future, but it takes time. We didn't expect anything over excessive here. So, we took that in to account in the model. But the range is exactly relating to items like that, for example. Since, when you think about it, on the one hand the run rate is great, which means from a business perspective it's great deals. If you have a run rate of 100,000 with a customer and it's going up to 150,000 or to 300,000, depends on the customer and what was the opening point, which means in all cases it's a great business deal because we increased in the run rate and it's great for the customer because it's getting much more secure.When you talk about the allocation, the allocation is by definition a lot of it is going into subscription. Not all of it, but a lot of it because we offer everything that Check Point can offer and a majority of those are in a subscription line. Hence, the discount rates for the product is increasing, right? Because more dollars are going into the services, less dollars are going into the product. And that's what I alluded to when I said it's putting pressure on the product growth but can increase the subscription line. So, we took that at the midpoint of what we expect. And if it will be faster, it will have a greater effect on the product, and if it will be slower it will have slightly less.So, that's a general comment about Infinity. But from a business perspective, which is what we are interested about, and our run rate for the future, it looks like really good transactions. Good deals for the customers and for us. -- Thank you so much.Our next question is from Shael Eyal with Oppenheimer and Company. Please proceed.Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Congrats on the solid sets of results. Gil, still sticking on the Infinity topic. So, I think it's been right now about 18 months, probably less than two years or so. Feedback on the channel is quite encouraging. I don't know whether it's too early to gauge a quantitative view, but from a qualitive perspective can you talk to us about the incremental revenue opportunity you might be seeing from customers migrating to this platform even on the expense of the product? -- I think what we've seen between, I think what Tal says, between 50% to -- -- Ten! -- To doubling or even tripling the annual expense that the customer does with us once we shift to Infinity. I think, some of it comes by getting more security, some of it comes by consolidating and getting things that other people have done. Not necessarily our direct competitors, but from the growth security space that we are consolidating into security. So, I think that's kind of what we are seeing.I think Infinity has two major effects right now. One is the immediate one, with which we provide customers more security. We get more stickiness into the environment and we get more revenues for that on an annuity basis. So, it's not affecting the individual quarter, but in the foreseeable future it increases our run rate by, again, big percentages, which is the immediate effect. The second effect is the mind share. When we're struggling, like every vendor by the way, when we are offering a product by product approach, it's a very different level than we speak to when we speak about Infinity. Infinity is where the CIO, and in some cases even the CEOs, CIOs and CISOs are listening. They are open to that approach. Sometimes they are going on that approach, in which case we gain the immediate deal. Sometimes they're not ready to roll their entire infrastructure into this program, but that opens the door to many, many other products which we have.So, I think, from what I get from the field and the customers and the channel, is Infinity is both a very good tool to sell, but it's also a great door opener because we have something at a much higher level that differentiates us. That takes us to the next level of discussion beyond just, ""We have these better projects or these better functions and features."" So, I think that's the two roles that Infinity plays in right now.Got it. And then maybe a follow-up for you, Gil, or for Tal. I think we understand the investments Check Point has been pursuing throughout fiscal '18 and the ones that you will be pursuing during 2019. And my question is, aside from the recent hiring and future hiring, has anything changed in terms of channel compensation? I know you've addressed the need to reinvest within the segment, but anything changes on that front, on channel compensation? And maybe even for Tal, on the growth margins, should we expect growth margins to remain stable, for the most part, throughout 2019? -- So, from a channel perspective not much has changed last year. This year we are investing in a new channel program. And I think the full effects of that will actually be... The main economic effects of that, if there will be any, I don't know yet, will be in 2020. So, we are starting with some new approaches for channel and it's more about working together, managing the activities, and so on. Less about touching the economics. I think this program will result in also some changes to the economics in 2020. I hope for the good, but time will tell.About growth margins, Tal, I don't know if you want to say anything? -- No, growth margin pretty much is, also, it remains in the same area. I always say the same for operating margin and growth margin, taking everything into account, it can be 1% higher, 1% lower. This is acceptable ranges. But I don't expect any material change there.Thank you so much.Our next question is from Andrew Nowinski with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question. -- Okay, thank you. Congrats on the nice quarter. You had very strong growth in billings this quarter, despite the average duration remaining essentially unchanged. I know Q4 is typically a strong renewal period, so I was wondering if you could talk about the impact from renewals this quarter and if that contributed to the strong growth in billings? -- Yeah. So, I think part of this is a reflection, because as you said, it's not about long-term contracts. Because long-term is presented separately and you can see the deferred revenues also grew very healthy in the short-term deferred revenue. If I recall, it was 12%. So, it's pretty strong. The reason is it's Q4 versus Q4. So, it's not an effect of the sequential period. We just had a strong quarter. We have it for two or three quarters. The main reason is that if we see growth in the subscription the majority of that number, well all deferred revenues or substantially all is in subscription. Both of them are showing a healthy growth. -- That's great. And then, last quarter you launched the new 23900 appliance. I was just wondering if you could give us any color on the initial traction of that appliance that you saw in Q4 and heading into 2019? -- Remember, this is a high-end unit. So, it is great. It started great. But remember, we're not talking about thousands or hundreds. It's the top end of the appliances. So, it's doing what we expected. It's doing nice. -- But I don't know if you noticed. This year we started the year, last week we launched two new appliance models more in the midrange; the 6500 and the 6800. They are providing double the performance in their class compared to other models. I think this is going to be something quite exciting this year. And I also mentioned Maestro. I think this can be a big change in the marketplace by being able to chain many, many of these to achieve almost unlimited performance in cloud like operation with resiliency, scalability, flexibility that's never been seen before.So, I think we started the year with some new and exciting products that will hopefully have some traction in the marketplace. -- Okay. Thank you.Our next question is from Gabriela Borges with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. -- Great. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. Gil, I wanted to follow-up on your earlier commentary on overall demand trends. I just want to make sure I understood your comments. Is your base case assumption that there is more pressure this year on overall security spending relative to last year? And any color you can give on specific geographies or verticals like government or carrier for the go forward would also be really helpful. Thank you. -- I don't think that there is any major change, not according to what I see. I'm just saying these are the general trends in security, specifically not in general. People are very open to investing in cyber. At the same time, when you have a contract that's being renewed, any purchasing department is trying to reduce the cost, to negotiate it down. That's one end. The other hand is that companies are really, really confused about what to do with cyber. They want to do more. They really don't know what will be effective and what's the first priority. Sometimes they're addressing the right target. Sometimes they don't. I think we've been saying, I think that was a big thing that we talked about in 2018.We're facing now the 6th generation of cyber-attacks. Most of the organizations in the world are still defending only against the third generation of cyber-attack. This is a huge gap that needs to be breached. By the way, that's the reason why so many attacks happen, and everything is so vulnerable. If we're protecting against Gen3 and a Gen5 attack comes, it's no wonder it's a successful attack.But still, the reason customers are not jumping is not just because they are uninformed or conservative in their approach, which happens too. It's also because if they will now start to address all the hundreds of combinations of things they need to secure, they get really, really confused and they don't know what to do. I think it will take time until our approach will catch up and until we'll be able to show and demonstrate how effective is this approach. And believe me, it's extremely effective. If you look at real-world cases, if we take the Infinity approach and the consolidation approach, we can get much, much higher level of security. And just a real-world example of what a security team of six people can do with Infinity, a security team of 30 people with seven or either different products can not achieve. So, this is huge effectiveness and savings that companies can achieve. -- That's helpful. Thank you. The follow-up, if I may, is on the longer-term way to think about margins and the models for EBIT. Is it right to think about the 50% for this year as being a little bit of a floor? Or is there a scenario where you would consider maybe dipping below 50% for a short period of time based on how you're thinking about the longer-term, lifetime value of the customer? Thanks. -- I'll give you a generic answer because we don't plan the next five years ahead in the margin, as you can see. As Gil said, we don't really manage the margins. What we're trying to manage is the growth and the profitability of the company, which we've been doing very well. I don't expect it to be materially different. For example, you find something very interesting, new market. You want to grow. You want to expand. You have a new investment in the cloud. You find another company, and so on. Things can change. But in general, I think it's a reasonable area. -- That's very helpful. Thank you. -- Thank you. I have a question for Gil and a follow-up for Tal. So, Gil, you mentioned the new 6500 and 6800 appliances and some of that technology looks really interesting. I'm just curious, are these entirely new appliances or do they improve upon existing offerings in the enterprise category? I guess what I'm trying to figure out is will they displace existing products or are they just sort of a new thing supplementing your portfolio? -- I think they will displace existing models. I think they are priced and positioned right in the middle between several different models. I think, because they provide much better price performance and an expansion of almost everything, we will replace some models that we currently have. -- Okay. Great. And, Tal, margins remain very strong, which is nice to see. And we've been expecting sales and marketing expense to sort of ramp up and we're not really seeing that. Is this partly because of ASC 606 or IFRS 15 and the deferral of commissions on subscriptions? Because, as you pointed out, you're seeing more of a mix shift to subscriptions, and even some initial maintenance. Or is there something more operational happening here? -- I think because you're looking at the percentage. And that can be confusing because remember the Q4, because the revenues are so high, then in the percentage you see a reduction. But if you look at the actual expense, you see it increase. And that's why I make sure you pay attention to it because in Q1 you will see the same expense and more. That's why your margin will drop already in Q1.So, the answer is we are investing a lot more and you will see it. That's why it's already a headcount that we have. It's already here. It's just that in Q4, in percentage, you don't feel it because the revenues are much higher. -- Okay. Just to make sure I understand that. You've said similar things in several previous quarters. But are we just seeing in this quarter the revenue being better than perhaps the margin expectation would been with a little bit lower revenue and you sort of out performed so we're just seeing that go to the bottom line? Is that kind of what we're seeing here? -- Sure. Well, sure. If the revenues are higher than you expected, then obviously it helps your volume. That's one thing. And, also, remember that this year we got some headwind? Tailwind? -- Tailwind. -- Tailwind of the dollar versus the other currencies. So, the dollar got stronger against the other currencies. It helped the EPS this year. Next year I don't see it happening. So, take that also into account. -- Perfect. Thank you very much.Our next question is from Saket Kalia with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions here. Tal, maybe for you. You know, Gil had mentioned a new product, Maestro, and that architecture that enables some elasticity in network security. Maybe specifically in Maestro, Tal, can you talk about how that solution is priced? Is that a product type of solution or is that subscription? And then, what are the metrics that a customer is going to pay for when they adopt a Maestro type of solution? -- So, the idea is that the Maestro is enabling you to link a large number of appliances. It's also an appliance, so it's priced the same. It's an appliance that you sell. And you can buy a 6500 or you can buy the 6800 and just link it to Maestro, which is the orchestrator, and then you can have 1-52 appliances. So, it's enabling you to scale very quickly and to get much more performance.In terms of the pricing, you can see it very clearly in our pricing and website. Do you recall the specific price of Maestro? -- We may be offering it right now with selling a cluster of three or more appliances, which is actually priced quite competitively. So, it's no big premium to that because we want people to deploy that technology. And also, the effect can actually be quite high because today most customers buy security in pairs for high availability. So, they buy two, they pay for two, but they get the performance of one. If they buy Maestro, they'll actually buy two or buy three but will 3x the performance. They will get 2x the performance from the same cluster. So, it works in load balancing and not just in high availability mode, which is a great benefit as you scale up. -- And it should make us very competitive in the appliance area as well.That's great. That's great. Maybe just a quick follow-up for you, Gil. The question was asked before about channel compensation. I'm curious about whether anything with the sales force, in terms of compensation year, can change in 2019. Obviously, we've got a new Chief Customer Officer and other kind of senior changes in the organization, and we're trying to sell higher into our customer base in terms of C-level. How are you changing in comp model, if at all, in '19 to sort of encourage that sort of behavior? -- The short answer is every year we make small tweaks. Our plan for 2019 is not revolutionary compared to 2018. It's using the same principles. If you want me to expand on that, I would say that what I'm actually trying to change is not the comp model, in terms of more commissions and so on, but actually shifting some of the compensation to bonus, which will be based on activity. So, we will reward more of the employees on going to new customers and objectives like that because I think the change needs to start with -- When you get to the results, that's not the problem. When you achieve the results, you're happy and everything is fine. I think where we need to drive change in general with our salespeople, with the channel, is the behavior at the beginning of the process, and to encourage them to do the right thing; which is going to C-level, going to new customers, and so on.Very helpful. Thanks, guys.Our next question is from Sterling Auty with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question. -- Yeah, thanks. Hi, guys. I know the two acquisitions are small, but I didn't catch what are you including in the guidance in terms of revenue contribution from those deals? -- You didn't hear because we didn't say. Because you can't split it now, right? It's all consolidated together with our product, with the CloudGuard, with selling it to our entire field. So, when we acquired them there was very minimal revenues and for next year, I hope it will be very large together with our sales force, and our CloudGuard, and our CloudGuard SaaS. Yeah, so it's all going to be combined. -- That's Dome9. The second one, the ForceNock is really small technological approach with no revenues now, and it will be part with the 6th generation platform that we are developing. I think it will be an essential component there to secure a web application, and API, and things that are in the cloud. -- Great. And then one follow-up. Have you made any changes, or do you plan any changes on pricing or support and the Software Blades here for 2019? -- Nothing material. -- For what? For the... -- For the Software Blade. -- We might make some changes with the two new appliances, to the pricing model. -- That's not the Software Blade subscription. We always do a few changes. We see what we can do that is benefiting to the customers and to us. I would say, in general, I don't see anything dramatic at this point in time. Bear in mind that the biggest change in subscriptions is the fact that all the Check Point products are included in Infinity. So, when you think about Infinity as the ultimate package of Software Blades and appliances, right? So, it's all together. And that change has already been made in the last year.Our next question is from Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. -- Hey. Thanks, guys, for taking my question. I just wanted to focus back in on just the pricing environment. I wonder if you could just provide some more detail on what you saw this year, especially as, obviously, you just changed the dynamic with Infinity. Just what you're seeing out there in the market would be great. -- I would say, in general, the market was and remains very competitive. You have the players that play only on price, and that's always a challenge. Where you win is where you provide the value. Value is Infinity. Value is the quality of your solutions. Value is your catch rates and so on. So, some players are fighting only on price. Some players are fighting through very extensive marketing. Some players fight through technology and quality of the solution, we believe this is us. We invest much more in sales and marketing to combat those others. And in general, I would say I didn't see anything changing except for the fact the market was and remains very competitive. -- Got it. And, also, just from a vertical perspective, anything stands out in terms of strengths or weakness? As you look in 2019, similar thing, others have called out for example the service side of market being a little slower. Just any sort of color you could provide on the vertical side would be great. -- On the vertical side? -- Nothing major. I think we remain strong in financials. All the other vectors we're seeing all over. All the different verticals are there. There are verticals that we can invest more and will invest more, like Tel Corps, we're selling a bunch to them. But still, the potential is much, much higher. So, I think there is nothing major here at this point. -- I don't know if there still is, but there was a loud discussion about government and the government in the US regarding budgets. Remember, we are not dependent on the government, so that's an advantage, I think, for Check Point. So, we don't see anything dramatic in any of our verticals in general. -- Awesome. Thanks, guys. -- Thank you.And our last question will be from Dan Ives with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed with your question. -- Yeah, thanks for letting me in. Just a question on cloud. Are conversations starting to change with customers in terms of the move to cloud on the security side? And, obviously, you guys have been more inquisitive. It feels like you're going more on the offense. Maybe you can just walk through, from a high-level, how conversation you're changing in terms of the move to cloud and where Check Point sits there. Thanks. -- So, the answer is yes. Every customer is interested in cloud. It comes up in every conversation. I think it's still early stages, but last year we saw healthy revenues, healthy sales, and I think growth of more than 100% in clouds. We are clearly growing there, and that's starting to be a real business. For us, they are small numbers. The numbers are starting to be meaningful. Hopefully, 2019 it will be slightly more. -- Thanks.Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our question and answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks. -- Thank you for joining us today. We look forward to speaking to you after the call. If you'd like a call back, please just send me an email and we'll follow-up with you. And other than that, we'll see you at the conferences over the next quarter. Thank you and have a great day, guys. Bye-bye.Thank you. This concludes today's conference.

 is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2018 results on Jan 30.Notably, the company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average positive surprise being 3.06%.In the las  ed quarter, Check Point's earnings increased 6% year over year to $1.38, topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.36. The company's revenues increased 4% to $471 million and beat the consensus estimate of $466 million.For the fourth quarter, the company expects revenues to be between $500 million and $528 million. Non-GAAP earnings are projected in the range of $1.56 to $1.67 per share.For the quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimates for earnings is pegged at $1.63, indicating 3.16% increase on a year-over-year basis. The same for revenues stands at $516.13 million, indicating a 2% rise.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Check Point is gaining traction from growing adoption of its cloud-based solutions. Continued strength in security subscription is a major catalyst behind Check Point's growth. It is witnessing a large number of subscriptions, which is expected translate into significant revenues in the quarter to be reported.In the last reported quarter, the company launched SandBlast Mobile 3.0 that offers threat prevention technology to enterprises, enabling employees to safely conduct business using mobile devices. This technology is expected to strengthen its cloud security capabilities.Check Point continues to execute on the enhancement of the Infinity architecture. The pipeline for Infinity deals remains strong. In the last reported quarter, a number of deals were closed in a variety of industries with midsized as well as large companies. This trend is expected to boost the top line.The company is winning new customer accounts, which is driving revenue growth. In the third quarter of 2018, the number of customers who signed deals worth $1 million or more was 58.Check Point is expected to benefit from its Independent Software Vendor partnership with Blackberry  . Moreover, last November, it announced technology integration with Amazon's  AWS Security Hub to improve cloud protection for its consolidated security platform, which is likely to reflect positively in the upcoming quarterly results.However, increased investments in sales and marketing efforts by the company, which led to a 0.4% year-over-year decline in non-GAAP operating income in the last reported quarter, is expected to keep margins under pressure.Moreover, the buyout of Dome9 in the last reported quarter is expected to lead to a fall of 2-4 cents in earnings per share while having no material impact on revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. | According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive  .

"he technology sector is expected to see a weak fourth-quarter 2018 earnings season. Apple's guidance cut along with lackluster results from chipmakers like Texas Instruments and Intel are mainly to be blamed.Sluggish iPhone demand in Greater China and fewer upgrades to its flagship device in developed countries are the primary reasons behind Apple's lowered guidance. Weak iPhone sales expectation had compeled a number of semiconductor companies, including Qorvo, Skyworks, Lumentum, which are also reportedly Apple's suppliers, to trim their top-line outlook.Notably, tariff imposition owing to the U.S.-China trade tussle has been taking a toll on chipmakers for a while now. China happens to be one major market for semiconductors, while the United States is the biggest semiconductor manufacturing country.Texas Instruments stated that demand was weak from Chinese smartphone manufacturers in the reported quarter.Moreover, Intel's warning over sluggish cloud spending doesn't bode well for the sector.

The stock fell as much as 40% at one point in 2018 before bouncing higher, only to end the year back near its lows.Below, we'll take a look at whether its latest decline means Symantec might be an attractive buy candidate heading into the new year.Image source: Getty Images.Let's start with the good news, which includes the fact that Symantec's core security business appears to be on the mend. Sales passed $1.1 billion in the fiscal second quarter to edge past the guidance that CEO Greg Clark and his team issued back in August. Sure, its expansion rate trails that of peers like  (NASDAQ: CHKP) , which grew deferred revenue at an 11% clip last quarter. But Symantec's roughly stable order backlog adds weight to management's claim that sales growth will return in the back half of its fiscal year.The company's finances are mixed, but solid overall. On the one hand, operating cash flow improved to $571 million over the past six months from $390 million in the year-ago period. However, Symantec is seeing profitability fall right now as costs fail to decline as quickly as sales. Its non-  operating margin clocked in at 31.7% of sales last quarter compared to 34.1% a year ago. Check Point Software's comparable figure is 48%.Investors might forgive the relative underperformance in the business, especially considering that Symantec's stock is valued at a big discount to peers. You can purchase shares at about 2.5 times sales, after all, compared to Check Point Software's 8.7 times. Symantec's P/E ratio is sitting at around 10 today, or half of its rival's valuation and well below the broader market's valuation. That discount seems excessive if it's just a reflection of the company's market share struggles and weaker profitability.Yet there's another issue hanging over the stock today. Symantec recently concluded a major accounting audit that resulted in the delayed filing -- and in some cases the restatement -- of several earnings reports including its fiscal 2018 annual report. That internal review is over, but the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is still conducting a formal investigation of the software giant's auditing practices. ""We could be required to pay significant penalties,"" as a result of any SEC action, executives warned in their latest 10-Q filing, ""and become subject to injunctions, a cease and desist order, and other ... remedies.""Symantec voluntarily brought its accounting issues to the SEC's attention, and through performing its own audit and correcting the record it has made the right moves to speed along the conclusion of this challenge. Still, the ongoing investigation adds significant uncertainty to the stock. Combine that issue with the fact that Symantec hasn't yet demonstrated evidence of a sustainable operating rebound, and investors have good reasons to pass on this stock for now despite its relative bargain pricing. Symantec might navigate past both its accounting and operating issues in 2019, but until it does, there are other  in the cybersecurity industry.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

" recently announced that it has acquired Israel-based security technology provider, ForceNock Security Ltd for an undisclosed amount.The company believes that the growing usage of Cloud, Network, Mobile, Endpoint and IoT requires comprehensive yet powerful security technologies. To address this requirement, Check Point aims to integrate ForceNock's technology into its Infinity architecture, which provides effective protection from Gen V and succeeding generations of cyber-attacks. Infinity consolidates security in a platform, which encompasses the network, mobile and cloud.ForceNock, about a couple years old, uses machine learning-based, easily deployable security engine for Web Application and API (Application Program Interface) Protection, to eliminate the need of security teams to manage various complicated configurations while maximizing security. This makes it suitable for enhancing Check Point's Infinity architecture.Dorit Dor, Vice President of Products, Check Point said ""Incorporating ForceNock's technology into our Infinity Architecture will enable us to continue to provide the highest level of security for our customers worldwide and strengthens our machine learning protection capabilities.""Acquisitions have helped Check Point in broadening portfolio, capabilities and enter into newer market, which has eventually driven its revenues.In the last two decades, the company acquired 11 businesses to expedite growth. The notables among them were Lacoon Mobile Security, Hyperwise, Liquid Machines, Dynasec Ltd., and the security appliance business of Nokia Corporation.In the las  ed quarter, Check Point acquired Dome9, with which it expects to boost Infinity architecture and CloudGuard security offering.With the ForceNock buyout, the company will not only enhance its portfolio, but will also boost its Infinity sales strategy, which is currently one of its prime focuses.Though the terms of the deal were not disclosed, we believe that Check Point is comfortably positioned to make acquisitions. This is evident from the last reported quarter, which the company exited with cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and short-term deposits of $4.07 billion compared with $4.04 billion in the prior quarter. | Check Point currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader Computer and Technology sector are Synopsys, Inc.  , Infineon Technologies AG  and Marvell Technology Group Ltd.  , each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see  .Long-term earnings growth rate for Synopsys, Infineon and Marvell is projected to be 10%, 8.62% and 9.38%, respectively.Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

 has been awarded with the 2018 Tekne Cybersecurity Award for its Stealth family of software.The Tekne Award is another feather in the cap for Stealth. Unisys, especially Stealth, has received accolades for its microsegmentation, encryption, authentication and authorization techniques in the past.In September this year, Stealth secured the Healthcare Innovator of the Year Award by The Philadelphia Business Journal. Moreover, last year, Frost & Sullivan gave it the North American Customer Value Leadership Award.Stealth microsegmentation software runs on zero-trust security model, which provides end-to-end protection and minute supervision of an organization's network compared with the traditional security practice of protecting only the periphery of the network, leaving the internal threats go unnoticed.Unisys is heavily focused on the growth of its Stealth business. In the September quarter, this segment recorded a whopping 90% year-over-year surge, with the total contract value growing 15%. | The company's continued efforts to integrate Stealth into its broader solutions are adding value across its portfolio. Its expertise in biometric systems integration, in combination with Stealth software solution recently resulted in a contract with the U.S. Army for the first phase of a new generation biometric collection capability.In May this year, the company launched InteliServe, a user-centric service desk platform, which showed momentum as Unisys signed contracts with two key clients just within a few months of its launch.In August, the company launched Unisys TrustCheck service to keep security professionals constantly updated on their organization's cybersecurity position, among other features.Per MarketsandMarkets, the global cybersecurity market is expected to reach $248.3 billion by 2023, reflecting a CAGR of 10.2% through 2018 to 2023. This projection bodes well for Unisys, which is focused on growing its security capabilities across all its business segments.However, the intensifying competition from major players in this space poses a bit of a concern for the company.

all Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Check Point Software (CHKP) reports results for the quarter ended December 2018. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 30. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the  , it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.This data security company is expected to pos  of $1.63 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +3.2%.Revenues are expected to be $516.13 million, up 2% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks  (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce  , and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).For Check Point, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Check Point will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the las  ed quarter, it was expected that Check Point would pos  of $1.36 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.38, delivering a surprise of +1.47%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our  to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Check Point doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

 (NASDAQ: CHKP) has  Wall Street with its safety-first approach, but things could soon change for the better. The cybersecurity specialist's third-quarter results turned out to be better than expected, thanks to solid growth across the board.Now, the growth in Check Point's headline numbers wasn't all that great. Its revenue shot up just 4% year over year, which isn't a big number considering the pace at which the cybersecurity market is growing. However, Check Point's latest strategic move makes it clear that the company is looking for ways to boost its tepid growth.Image source: Getty Images.Along with its third-quarter results, Check Point also announced that it has closed the acquisition of cloud security firm Dome9 to bolster its Infinity cyber-defense platform and win over more enterprise customers. Check Point hasn't disclosed the full details of the deal, but it did reveal that it paid  .Check Point has done the right thing by acquiring Dome9's technology, which secures cloud servers and ensures the application of corporate security policies across the entire cloud infrastructure system. It also ensures that apps on the cloud are running with security settings in line with a company's guidelines.As a result, Check Point now has a more comprehensive cloud security offering, which will help it attack a niche that's in its early phases of growth. The cloud security market was reportedly worth $4 billion at the end of last year, but it could triple to nearly $13 billion by 2022, according to one estimate.This isn't surprising, as the deployment of public cloud services is growing at a pace of more than 20% a year. Cloud service providers and users will be spending more money on securing their networks, creating an opportunity for Check Point to grow sales. More importantly, Check Point now has a solution that it can offer to its existing clients and increase the probability of cross-sales.Check Point investors can now expect the company's key metrics, such as deferred revenue and margins, to keep improving in subsequent quarters after a strong showing in the last one.Check Point Software has been displaying tangible signs of improvement of late. For instance, the company's deferred revenue increased 11% year over year last quarter to $1.15 billion, a sequential jump of 2 percentage points. is an important indicator of potential growth, as it's the amount of money received by a company for services to be delivered at a later date. The fact that this metric grew at a faster pace than actual revenue indicates that Check Point is now able to lock more customers into long-term contracts. This should ensure a steady stream of subscription revenue in the long run.Another important change that Check Point investors shouldn't miss is that it is ramping up its marketing expenses. The company spent $124 million on sales and marketing during the third quarter, up nearly 17% from the prior-year period. In fact, Check Point spent just over 26% of its total revenue on this line item, up from 23% last year.Along with the acquisition, the bump in sales and marketing expenses shows a change in how Check Point is approaching its business.

mid the broad market sell-off, the cyber security industry appears well poised on higher IT spending budgets, increased cybercrimes and better-than-expected earnings for the July-September quarter. Most of the cyber security firms beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both earnings and revenues and offered robust guidance (read:  ).Let's check out the earnings of some of the cyber security firms that have the largest allocation to the ETFs in this niche area of the technology sector:Akamai Technologies  reported third-quarter 2018 earnings per share of 68 cents and revenues of $670 million, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 61 cents and $663 million, respectively. On year-over-year basis, earnings surged 51.6% while revenues were up 7%. For the fourth quarter, the company projects revenues in the range of $692-$709 million and earnings between 97 cents and $1.03 per share. It slightly narrowed the revenue guidance from $2.68-$2.71 billion to $2.693-$2.71 for the full year while raised earnings per share projection to $3.53-$3.59 from $3.26-$3.38.CyberArk Software  outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 23 cents for earnings and $6 million for revenues. Earnings per share shot up 228% from the year-ago quarter while revenues jumped 31%. The company expects earnings per share of 58.60 cents on revenues of $94.75-$96.25 million, representing 18-20% year-over-year growth for the fourth quarter. Like its peers, CyberArk also raised estimates for the full year with revenues expected in the range of $328.9-$330.4 million and earnings per share in the range of $1.75-$1.77. This is much higher than the previous projection of $320-$324 million for revenues and $1.43-$1.50 for earnings per share.Check Point Software Technologies  posted earnings per share of $1.38 and revenues of $471 million, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.36 and $466 million, respectively.

For the full fiscal year, Symantec continues to expect earnings per share in the range of $1.47-$1.57 on revenues of $4.67-$4.79 billion.FireEye's  earnings of 6 cents per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 2 cents and improved from the year-ago quarter's loss of 2 cents. Revenues climbed 11.6% year over year to $211.7 million, edging past the estimated $208.4 million. FireEye expects revenues of $214-$218 million and earnings per share of 4-6 cents for the fourth quarter. For the full year, the company raised revenue guidance to $827-$831 million from $820-$830 million and earnings per share guidance to 6-8 cents, up from the previous projection of breakeven to 4 cents.The string of earnings beat and solid outlook has led cyber security ETFs to perform better than the other technology peers.

egendary investor Warren Buffett advises to be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful. One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.In trading on Friday, shares of Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd. (Symbol: CHKP) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 29.1, after changing hands as low as $99.73 per share. By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) is 22.1. A bullish investor could look at CHKP's 29.1 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.

" ' (NASDAQ: CHKP) third-quarter earnings were pretty much in line with what management had planned. Let's take a look at the details behind Check Point's third quarter and what it says about the future direction of the company.Starting with the headline numbers from the quarter:There's nothing to complain about from the headline numbers, but the guidance numbers look a little uninspiring.That said, the devil is in the details and Check Point is a company in the process of making some subtle but significant changes to its market strategy.Check Point is making progress on selling solutions that deal with multiplatform threats. Image source: Getty Images.Management has been highlighting the opportunity for Check Point to benefit from so-called  . In a nutshell, these are highly sophisticated security threats whose complexity means they can attack multiple platforms at once. For example, they could be hidden in network traffic and disguised as content files.Check Point believes such threats are best addressed with holistic security architecture that provides a unified security approach across many platforms. The company's fifth-generation security solution is Infinity, but the problem with selling such a high-level solution is that it usually requires a relatively senior-level executive to make the decision and understand the solution and get budgetary approval.Given this situation, Check Point has had what CEO Gil Shwed described as ""execution challenges,"" particularly in the U.S. These issues extended from the third quarter of 2017 until the  of 2018, when Shwed reported ""a good level of activity and results.""Fast-forward to the current quarter and Shwed sounded a more bullish tone, saying on the  , ""I think Infinity so far is generating a very nice pipeline. We're still closing only a small number of deals because it takes a very long time for a company to make a decision about the long-term commitment and about a change of an architecture. But we are seeing that change is starting to happen.""In other words, Check Point appears to be executing better on its aim of developing Infinity sales.It's a good idea to keep an eye on Check Point's composition of sales. In the past, products and licenses sales led software updates and maintenance sales, but that relationship has been altered by the shift toward subscription-based sales in the software industry. As you can see below, product and licenses sales have fallen five quarters in a row.Data source: Check Point Software Technologies presentation. Chart by author.When an analyst asked during the  about product sales, CFO Tal Payne had a very interesting answer: ""... Most of the new things are subscription. Having said that, product can and should be positive and that's what we're talking about, continued improvement on the execution of their fields.""She went on to add that her goal was to see product sales turn positive in the future -- something to look out for in future quarters.Check Point beat its projections in the quarter. Investors will be looking for  more of the same in the coming quarters while keeping an eye on whether Check Point can build more traction with Infinity sales and return to product sales growth.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Check Point Software Technologies wasn't one of them!

 is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2019 results on Nov 1. The company beat estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 5.60%.In the last reported quarter, Symantec's earnings, per the ASC 605, remained flat year over year at 33 cents, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.The company's revenues had decreased 5.5% to $1.18 billion, per ASC 605. Nonetheless, the top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.15 million.For the fiscal second quarter, Symantec anticipates non-GAAP revenues in the range of $1.130-$1.160 billion. Non-GAAP operating margin is projected to be about 30%. Further, management estimates earnings between 31 cents and 35 cents on a non-GAAP basis.Let's see how things are shaping up for the upcoming announcement.Symantec is gaining from data breaches as security-related purchases continue to shoot up.The company's continuous efforts to strengthen its product suite are likely to benefit its top line, given the surge in demand for cybersecurity-related products.The company continues to benefit from Integrated Cyber Defense Platform, which drives significant cross-sell and up-sell opportunities. Moreover, key customer wins for Cloud Proxy, Cloud Access Security Broker and cloud e-mail offerings are expected to remain positives.Moreover, the company's cost-saving strategy and successful acquisitions of Blue Coat and LifeLock, which primarily drive the Consumer Digital Safety business, continue to aid its earnings.The Consumer Digital Safety segment, which constitutes nearly half of the entire business, is likely to remain strong in the to-be-reported quarter.However, the company expects continuation of longer sales cycle to negatively impact Enterprise Security revenues. Moreover, foreign exchange headwinds are also expected to affect the top line.Moreover, the Enterprise Security segment continues to display weakness due to decreased billings. This is likely to remain an overhang.Furthermore, increased competition from the likes of Proofpoint  , FireEye  , and Check Point  is a major headwind for the company.For the fiscal second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 33 cents, indicating a year-over-year decline of 17.5%. For revenues, the consensus estimate stands at $1.14 billion, indicating 7.71% decrease. | Symantec has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

"As the scope of IT expands, cybersecurity stocks and the field of online security come more into focus. Once confined to PCs, online security now has become critical for mobile devices, cloud platforms and data centers. Once 5G becomes commonplace, cybersecurity will become necessary to yet another new set of systems.As the need for security expands and becomes emphasized by well-publicized security breaches, it naturally draws the attention of the investment community. Daniel Ives, a long-time equity research analyst, newly hired by Wedbush Securities, is among these investors. Ives recently released a list of cybersecurity stocks to which he gave an ""outperform"" rating.Although several cybersecurity stocks received this rating, the following three stocks to buy stand out as future drivers of online security - with future gains for investors to match:Based in Israel,  (NASDAQ:  ) sells both hardware and software for network-security business users throughout the world. The equity currently trades at around $113 per share. Wedbush initiated a 12-month price target of $140 per share on CHKP stock.Since its founding in the early 1990s, Check Point has acted as a generalized cybersecurity company. Its hardware firewalls have helped to entrench the company within many global organizations. CHKP's U.S. business has previously suffered from uneven execution. Still, Wedbush believes its U.S. business has finally begun to take off through hiring new reps and improved sales efforts.CHKP stock has found itself range-bound for the last two years. Like other tech stocks, it reached a peak - $120.81 - in mid-September before pulling back. However, it trades only about 7% below its 52-week high, so it has not seen as much of a decline as many other tech stocks.The low P/E ratio of CHKP stock may also explain the muted decline. Currently, CHKP trades at about 19.8 times earnings. This seems low considering that other cybersecurity stocks trade at much higher multiples.Profit growth rates also appear steady. Analysts forecast profits increasing by 6.4% this year. They also believe this growth rate will rise to 8.3% next year. While that remains in the single-digits, the low P/E and the improved outlook for U.S. growth should give CHKP stock the catalyst it needs to move out of its trading range and reach the $140 price target forecasted by Wedbush. (NASDAQ:  ) currently trades at around $71 per share. Wedbush gave it a 12-month price target of $85 per share.CyberArk specializes in privileged access management (PAM) software. One challenge in the cybersecurity field involves protecting the identities and credentials of privileged account users. The company sees this as both a critical and often ignored avenue by which hackers can breach security systems. To counter this, CyberArk creates software to address both the internal and external threats related to these credentials.Wedbush believes the company has obtained a leadership position in this niche. They also estimate this market has only seen a 5% penetration rate.CyberArk currently supports a P/E ratio of just under 48. While that may appear expensive compared to the  , investors may take an interest due to the company's profit growth. Analysts believe the company will grow its profits by 26.7% this year. They also think that the growth rate will hold and possibly improve in the years to come. The five-year estimate for average annual growth comes in at 29.3%.The CYBR stock price has also increased as a result. It rose from just above $40 per share around the new year and peaked at $81.24 in September, not far from Wedbush's target. It has since retreated to around the $70 per share range. However, with its $2.5 billion market cap, its massive growth, and its leadership in a vital security niche, the run for CYBR stock has probably just begun.Wedbush chose  (NYSE:  ) as another outperform in the cybersecurity space. The stock trades at just below $200 per share currently. Wedbush initiated a 12-month price target of $225 per share for PANW stock.PANW's next generation firewall products protect cloud networks. As such, their business has grown with the cloud. PANW boasts over 54,000 customers around the world, including 85% of the Fortune 100. In 2017,  rated Palo Alto as one of the ""50 companies changing the world.""The growth figures, both from the past and from projections, both reflect this success. The company saw average an annual profit growth rate of 79.2% per year over the last five years. While analysts believe that average annual growth will slow to 30.6% per year for the next five, they will remain among the fastest-growing cybersecurity stocks.Even with this growth, the P/E ratio comes in at just over 40. While this makes PANW a bit expensive, it remains far from the triple-digit P/E ratios seen in other tech stocks. Investors should also note that the 52-week high of $239.50 per share stands above Wedbush's $225 per share price target. The PANW stock price has more than doubled from levels seen in early 2017. However, a correction beginning in September has taken the stock down by about 15%.Still, I agree with Wedbush and believe the correction constitutes a hiccup in a long-term uptrend. With the massive growth and the company's leadership in cloud security, I think the PANW stock price will reach and move beyond the $225 per share price target.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@3 Cybersecurity Stocks That Should Match Wedbush’s Outperform Rating@2018-10-23@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-cybersecurity-stocks-should-match-wedbushs-outperform-rating-2018-10-23

Our Software Update and Maintenance revenues increased to $213 million, representing 4% growth year-over-year. Deferred revenues as of September 30, 2018 reached $1,148,000,000, a growth of $112 million or 11% over September 30, 2017.Revenue distribution by geography for the quarter was as follows; 47% of revenues came from Americas; 37% of revenues came from Europe; and the remaining 16% came from Asia-Pacific, Japan, Middle East and Africa regions.From a deal size perspective, this quarter we had 58 customers with transactions over $1 million. This quarter, similar to last quarter, the total value of these transactions increased significantly. Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter were 53%, similar to the previous quarter. We continue to invest in our sales force and marketing efforts. The full effect of this will be reflected naturally in the next quarters.Effective non-GAAP tax rate for this quarter was around 18%. Our Q4 tax rate is expected to be lower at 10% to 12%, related mainly to expiration of tax provisions at the end of the year.GAAP net income for the third quarter of 2018 was $198 million or $1.25 per diluted share, an increase of 7% from the third quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $219 million or $1.38 per diluted share, an increase of 6% from the third quarter of 2017, and toward the top end of our guidance.As the share price increase significantly during the quarter, the number of options included in the diluted outstanding shares increased. Our cash balance continue to increase, reaching $4,072,000,000 as of September 30. Operating cash flow was $249 million. Collection from customers continues to be strong. Our cash payments increased, in line with our continued investments in sales and marketing.In July 2018, we approved an increase of our buyback program to $2 billion and with quarterly amount that may vary, but will not exceed $325 million. During the quarter, we purchased 2.6 million shares for $300 million, at an average price of $113.Now let's turn the call over for Gil for his comments. -- Thank you Tal and hello everyone joining us today. In the first quarter, we continue to see results that are better than our projections. Overall, this is the second quarter we've seen improved trending in execution by our sales force. We continue to focus on further improvements to the sales organization and we'll continue to invest as we move forward.At the end of July, we made important change in the leadership of our sales organization and appointed Dan Yerushalmi to be Chief Customer Officer. Dan has been not only a tremendous sales leader in his past, but also a CIO of a major banks in his last position, making his experience very relevant to C-level interaction.We continue to execute on our major initiatives, primarily around the Infinity architecture. A recurring trend in the feedback we hear from our customers is that Infinity represents a truly differentiated approach to security. Infinity accomplishes this by consolidating security and providing a universal platform, encompassing the network, mobile and across the Cloud with a focus on the prevention of cyber-attacks, rather than merely detecting them after the fact.The pipeline for Infinity deals continues to build. During the quarter, we closed some nice deals in a variety of industries, from mid-sized law firms and not-for-profit organization, all the way up to some of the world's largest financial institutions. We've continued to build the breadth and depth of the Infinity platform.This quarter, we extended our mobile security offerings, introducing advanced threat prevention capabilities to mobile devices, with the launch of SandBlast Mobile 3.0. This makes our product unique by preventing mobile phishing attack on all apps, prevents browsing to malicious sites, and blocks infected devices from leaking sensitive data to botnets or accessing corporate data.On the Cloud front, we just went GA last quarter and launched our CloudGuard SaaS security solution to address security needs of software-as-a-service Cloud applications such as Office 365, Salesforce and ServiceNow. There is an entire industry of solution for SaaS Security called CASB, where the focus is mainly on detecting the use of such Cloud application and a little bit on user identification.CloudGuard SaaS is much more than it CASB. It focuses on actually preventing malicious access, blocking malicious content within SaaS application, while also providing transparent and reliable user identification. We already have more than a 100 enterprises that have begun to utilize CloudGuard SaaS.Today, we announced the further expansion of for Cloud Security offering with the acquisition of Dome9. The acquisition bolsters our Infinity platform by extending the breadth of our Cloud Security offering. One of the key challenges in public Cloud environment is to ensure the enforcement of corporate security policies across all elements of the Cloud infrastructure.Dome9 addresses exactly that challenge. It enforces the corporate security policies and manages all Cloud assets accordingly. It makes certain that all Cloud servers are protected. It verifies that Cloud apps have the right security settings and manage the native Cloud security features of AWS, Azure and the Google Cloud. It does so while providing compliance with security best practices and company-specific guidelines.These technologies also provide a broader market potential for us, with the ability to address non-Check Point environments by leveraging these technologies as the Cloud service, without the need for any on-premise software or hardware.Dome9 aligns with our strategy to drive prevention and protection across the network, mobile and Cloud environment. Check Point is known for our management capabilities and Dome9 enable us to extend our superior management capabilities further into a Cloud-centric environment. The combination of Dome9 together with our CloudGuard IaaS and SandBlast product families will enable us to expand our Cloud Security capabilities and provide multiple layers of security to Cloud environment.This will be accomplished with server automation and scaling tools that are critical in the Cloud. We evaluated many other technologies in this space and found Dome9 to be the most comprehensive. The one that delivers on the Check Point principle on enforcing security and providing true threat prevention rather than just detection and reporting like many of the other products we evaluated.The acquisition closed today, while we don't disclose the full terms of the transaction, the main effect you're going to see in our financial results in the next quarter will be in cash consideration of approximately $175 million that will be part of our Q4 cash flow. It will not have a material effect on revenues and will reduce our non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.02 to $0.04 a quarter; and our GAAP EPS by approximately $0.07.Now, we would like to shares our fourth quarter projection. Overall, the third quarter produced good results. I do believe that our growth potential is higher than what we have seen in the past few quarters and we will continue to work on making that happen. You know my regular caveat, the future is always hard to predict, there are many -- there may be an upside, and obviously the potential for downside.With that in mind, here are the fourth quarter projections that include the effect of the acquisition. We expect revenues between $500 million and $528 million; non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.56 to $1.67; GAAP EPS is expected to be approximately $0.20 lower than that.Now we'd like to open the call for your insightful question and feedback on our strategy. Thank you.Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Ben (ph) Zelnick with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. -- Thanks, very much. Brad Zelnick, Credit Suisse. Congratulations guys on a nice quarter. It's good to see billings growth back in the business and returning to market levels and congrats on Dome9. Gil, on Dome9, can you just talk a bit about why now. And as you think about integrating the offering into your management console, do you envision that this is going to be something seamless a year from now that we won't even notice it was a separate entity, and what does that take? And then, I've got a follow-up for Tal. Thanks. -- So, first I think now is a very good time to invest in the Cloud and use of Cloud application is getting higher and higher. I don't know if it's getting to mainstream, but definitely almost every enterprise in the world is expanding to the Cloud, and when they do that, they also tighten up security, and I think security is becoming more important to them. We've been working and looking at Dome9 for a long time, so this is not something that happened overnight, and that's something that we've been doing for quite a long time.I think the Dome9 capabilities are far better than anything else in the marketplace. We're the only company in this space to have active protection, network security, threat detection, and better capability in compliance, in multi-Cloud environment and everything else we've seen. So we're very happy to be working with them.We've passed on several other companies that we look along the -- a long time, and I think we are very fortunate that we've been able to pull this deal through. And hopefully we will be able to integrate it quite quickly. All the Dome9 employees are now Check Point, are now part of Check Point. The deal is closed so we can -- we are ready to act right now, and it will probably take us a couple of months to integrate all the different departments, and all the different -- and all the employees and provide the true Infinity cyber protection for Gen V attacks and strengthening the Cloud, which I think is more and more important. -- Thanks Gil. And just Tal, and following-up on the financial impact. Is -- I trust it's all subscription revenue, can you just confirm for us where these annual subscriptions paid in advance. Does it flow through to the balance sheet or just directly to the income statement on a consumption basis, and is it fair to say that the business was doing roughly $25 million run rate, and anything else that you can tell us that appreciate the impact would be great? -- No, the run rate is not $25 million, is less than $10 million, just to clarify. That's why we said it's immaterial. So you won't see any impact that is relevant from the revenue perspective in our size of company. So that's one comment. And the effect that we talked about is relevant mainly as a result of expenses. We continue to invest in the company as well, it's very exciting area. As for the numbers, the range that we talked about is $0.02 to $0.04 on a non-GAAP, and about $0.07 on the GAAP. And it is-- -- Got it. And the $0.02 to $0.04 -- that's helpful. And Tal, $0.02 to $0.04 I mean, were they burning that much cash or do you intend to invest that much more in integrating the business? -- No, they have over 100 employees. They are spending cash, and it's an area that we would probably plan to expand as well. -- Awesome, thanks so much for taking my questions.Our next question is from Michael Turits with Raymond James. Please proceed. -- First, Gil and Tal, can you talk about Dan Yerushalmi and what -- any changes might be in the strategic direction for what he'll be doing around sales. How he will be improving, and again obviously that's a change.And then I'll just throw out my second question too. There are a lot of things taking place at a macro level in the world, obviously. To any extent you feel like you can look out into 2019, talk about how tariffs might impact you and any impact that other macro trends might have on security spending right now; Dan, and then macro? -- Okay. So first, in terms of the sales strategy, I think our sales strategy is the right strategy and our strategy is not something that we change very often. I think the main challenges that we have or the main opportunities that we have, depending how we want to look at it, is execution. We are focused on new customers. We are focused on broader sale for our Infinity architecture, getting higher level in the C-level in the organization.Dan is putting a lot of emphasis on better working with our partners to bringing the products to market. And I think all these things that have been part of our strategy will continue and hopefully we will do them in a better way. So I don't think that there is a huge change in strategy, it is -- I hope, that there's going to be a change in the execution of the strategy; second thing? -- And the second part was relating to macro changes in what area, can you repeat the question? -- Well, you just had bad semiconductor report tonight, people are concerned about tariffs. So in general, general macro concern about next year and potential impacts of that tariffs. How do you think that -- if it does, impact you guys specifically and any anything you could say about the impact on the security market? -- So, when you talk about tariffs, it's nothing that we expect that will affect us. In the macroeconomics, I would just say the general changes that you're familiar with, with the tax regulations in Europe and the tax regulation in the US. We're still waiting for the regulation to come out during Q4 and based on that, we will see what do we believe is the effect on us. -- Okay guys, thank you very much.Our next question is from John DiFucci with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. -- Yes, I have a question for Gil and then a follow-up for Tal. Gil, for Dome9, I'm just trying to, in my mind anyway, figure out now what you have versus what you might need. I read something that Dome9, you didn't have some identity technology? Is there anything here that in the Cloud area that you would -- that you don't have that you'd have to partner with others or that you wouldn't go into -- normally you haven't gone into the identity space either? -- I think we're not going to be a provider of pure Identity software. We're going to connect that identity into making sure systems are locked and that's what we've been doing. By the way, we've started that also in CloudGuard SaaS, our solution for SaaS we were having and now a little bit more of that in Dome9, but that's not our focus. The main -- there are going to more areas in the Cloud that we will get into. The Cloud is a very broad environment and there is much more layers in specific areas which we can secure in both of our Gen V and next year, our 6th generation of security will also focus on that.But Dome9 is not just the feature. Dome9, I think, is a platform that's very, very strategic to us, because it does know how to manage security and enforce security in very large and very complicated and very heterogeneous Cloud environment. And that's critical because the Cloud is not one entity that's simple to manage. Actually if you look at the AWS Cloud, there's probably around 300 different services.And when you activate any service, you want to make sure that automatically the security is applied to web service, otherwise that service becomes unintentionally the back door to the company, to the enterprise data. And I think that's part of what Dome9 have, a lot of automation to automatically set security policies on the -- on all the Clouds automatic detection when things go wrong and automatic remediation, which is even more important, because think about that, if somebody, some operator tries to do some maintenance to a -- let's say a storage server on the Cloud.If they leave something open, they go home; tomorrow morning, you might get an alert that you left your data opened. But if that's too late, during the night somebody might have sacked all your database. Somebody that's using Dome9 for example, automatically these permissions will be reset today to the locks permissions and whether you see the alert or not, it should be in a good state. So which is one example of what Dome9 can do with nobody else in that industry is doing right now. -- Okay, thank you. And Tal, the results were better than we had been looking for anyway. And the subscription growth actually accelerated a little bit, about the same growth, but the product numbers are still coming down year-over-year. And I'm just curious, is that more to do with sort of a transition to within the sales, it's sort of a push more that the platform sales, the Infinity Total Protection type sales like the selling motion? Or is it just, you know customers are buying more subscription at this point? And ITP is exciting, but it's still really early. -- So I would say, in general, when we look long-term, that it's obvious that the industry as an industry is moving to providing new products as a subscription. So, all the relevant product that we present, basically since 2010 in subscription mode or in additional layers, Cloud is subscription, Dome9 is. So it's clear that the new area, mobile is subscription and so on. So everything -- most of the new things are subscription. Having said that, product can and should be positive and that's what we're talking about, continued improvement on the execution of their fields. -- Okay. So we should hope that -- or expect to start see product not only to be numbers but actually turn positive at some point? -- That's our goal, definitely. -- Okay. Okay, great. Thank you very much.Our next question is from Andrew Nowinski with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed. -- All right, thank you and congrats on another good quarter. Maybe just starting with the America's; growth was strong, I think up 8% this quarter, which I think you hinted at last quarter as well. Is that a reflection of share gains or is it a seasonal contribution from the Fed, US Fed or just an overall improvement in the market that drove that growth? -- No, just remember that revenues and booking not always in the same timing right, so revenues is the recognition over a period. So it's not necessarily you have accounting movement in VSOE and so on. So in general you're right, we've seen America positive and the Europe positive and only had a few large deals in the previous quarter in terms of revenue recognition. So you see it's actually in there, I think a small negative. So it's not necessarily a mirror of the booking. -- I would say that I think we did have some slightly better metrics in the US and I'm very happy about that because we are focused on gaining share, on doing more things in the US but we are far from over. I think our potential on what we can and should do in the US should be much better than what we're doing and there is still a long road until we'll all be here and say we are getting everything that we need to from the US. -- Okay, very good. And then just one quick question on -- your long term deferred looks like it went up a little bit this quarter and your duration went off -- also went up. Is that just a factor or is that attributable to the Infinity's sales plan as more customers move to that sales model? -- Not necessarily, of course, Infinity have an effect in the long term, but it's not -- it's still not a big number that will affect it in that way. Remember the long term can be just the effect of a support or subscription contract designed for over a year and then the over a year portion, in case it was invoiced, then you see it in the deferred long term.But also short-term was very healthy with the growth, if I recall, of about 9% year-over-year. So that was quite healthy as well. And remember also that some of the bookings you don't even see because this accumulates on invoice because some of the long-term deals, you issue an invoice only once a year, and that portion is not reflected in the deferred revenue. -- Okay got it. Keep up the good work.Our next question is from Daniel Ives with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed with you question. -- Yes. Hey, how are you and congrats again. I just -- can you maybe just talk about Infinity, just in terms of what you're seeing in the field, in terms of how maybe the conversations are changing from kicking the tires back to deal flow. And I'll just stop there and then a follow-up question? -- I think first, Infinity does brace the conversation to not just product transaction, but how people actually think about security architecture. And in my mind, by the way, that's one of the key elements in building today's cyber security. Well it's not refreshing that product or adding another product is the overall thinking about how to prevent threat. And that gives us much better opportunity to present our vision and to challenge our customers and they challenge us about actually delivering that.I think Infinity so far is generating a very nice pipeline. We're still closing only a small number of deals because it takes very long time for a company to make a decision about the long-term commitment and about change of an architecture. But we are seeing that change is starting to happen and as I've mentioned, it goes from mid-size -- last quarter we even had some small size, this quarter it's more mid-size, going all the way to very large corporations that are willing to subscribe to that and see the potential in that.So I think long-term, it should have a very good effect both on our -- what we call Infinity sales, Infinity Total Protection, but also on the general dialogue and opening doors with customers that might lead to other products deals that expand our footprint within a customer environment. -- Okay. And just lastly, how do you view the Cloud opportunity? I mean you're a veteran of security and you've seen all different phases and facets. How would you compare this, may be over the last decade, versus other opportunities that some bear fruit, others didn't in terms of this Cloud and how real this opportunity is and how Check Point is positioned? Thanks. -- I think first, predicting the future is always challenging. But I do think that the Cloud is more real than everything you've seen, simply because enterprises are truly -- I mean we see that unlike many trends in IT that some happen, some didn't happen, some remained very small, the Cloud is already substantial. Every company in the world is expressing interest in moving systems to the Cloud. There is a new generation of companies that's called born-to-Cloud that only have Cloud environment, and I think all of these are potential.What will happen in five to ten years, it's really hard to predict. It's really hard to predict if Cloud sale will be a small percentage of the market but still relevant or the majority of the market. And I think we'll know that in 10 years and for us, meanwhile, I think it's a quite substantial opportunity to get into. -- Thank you.Our next question is from Ken Talanian with Evercore ISI. Please proceed. -- Hi, thanks for taking the question. So, I was wondering if you could give us a sense for how the deferred growth was driven between either subscription or maintenance? Just trying to get a sense for what's driving that uptick. -- So naturally, that -- the deferred revenues, most of it's relating to, as you said, subscription and support. I would say both been healthy and pretty much in line with what you see in the P&L. We had a very good booking in subscription as well. So I would say nothing abnormal. They both grew and they grew nicely. Naturally, when you talk about double-digit growth, then subscription is the only one that can do that. Support is typically single-digit, low-single-digit. You can see it in the P&L, since it's a renewal of your installed base support. So majority of the growth is driven by subscription. -- Great. And I guess around the Infinity deals. Could you give us a sense for the kind of uplift you might be seeing in some of the initial deals versus the prior run rate for some of these customers? -- I think it's anything from 30% to 200% depending on the customer and depending on how big they were and how much we are getting into that in the future. But I think that's the range that we've seen. It's a wide range. But in general, it's a quite substantial increase per customer. -- But remember, it depends on what the customer has to start with, right, so if it's a new customer, obviously or if it is an uplift. If it's a customer that had only, let's say, firewall and now we added the entire family, it will be a very significant increase. And if you already had before let's say NGTX and threat prevention and then threat extraction then the lift will be smaller. -- Great, thank you very much.Our next question is from Gabriela Borges with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. -- Thanks for taking my question. Tal, you commented last quarter on off balance sheet bookings activity being particularly strong. I know it's not something that you regularly comment on. So I wanted to ask a follow-up which is, how did that bookings activity compared this quarter versus last quarter for deals that may not necessarily show up in the balance sheet? -- But again, we don't report it, but just -- it doesn't look like I'm avoiding. I can tell you it increased this quarter as well. But it's not an indication that I'm going to give, just because, remember it can be very lumpy and depends on large transactions that are coming in that can be multi-year. So -- well you can look at the deferred revenues; you can see the growth there. I think it's a reflection of the run rates which is better than just the fluctuations in the booking. -- That's helpful. And a question for Gil, if I may, earlier comment on how it does take time to close Infinity Total Protect deals because it requires a change of architecture with the customer. For your customers that are coming back to you and saying, thanks for presenting, it's really interesting, but we're not interested right now, we're going to buy on the old model. What are the reasons that they give you for that? -- I think I don't know if that's the typical discussion this year. The typical discussion, and for us, one of the challenges is actually how to go higher in the organization and to present to people that see the broader picture in that regard and that's the opportunity with Infinity. I don't see many cases (ph) that customers say, you know what we're not interested. They might say, you know this is a project for next year. We are right now not evaluating big changes, but this is good.In general almost everything that we have with customer was, yes we're getting on and let start the process or continue the process or let's evaluate and let's see how it would make sense to us. But I think the real challenge for us is simply presenting it to enough customers. When I'm presenting the feedback what I'm getting from customers that say, this is revolutionary, this is -- this is all, by the way, feedback that I got from a group of customers that spent a week with us here last week.A customer delegation like that and their feedback was it's fresh, it's new, nobody else is doing that, the focus on prevention is unique to you, which is all good feedbacks. It still doesn't -- but unfortunately, it's from a very small list of customers that we're actually presenting it and that's why saying that in terms of our execution we need to learn how to take it to more places, and then we need to translate that interest level and that acknowledgment on the strategy to actual deals. -- That's very helpful. Thank you.Our next question is from Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please proceed. -- Hi, thanks. Question for Gil, just on product revenue, I'm wondering if there's areas of the world or territories within the world that are doing consistently better than the down 8 or 6 that you've had the last couple of quarters and I'm wondering what might be different about those areas as leading indicators of how your product revenue could get better as we look into future quarters? -- First, I think it's very non-uniform. We have areas in the world or countries that are performing quite well for -- if I take eight quarters, the six out of eight, they show great metrics and they might have one quarter that's lagging behind and vice versa. So it's not that results -- all of it are uniform.As I said, when I look at some of these territories, the main element is still the execution is focusing on new deals and on new customers. And I think that's one of the things we need to expand and do better. And our culture is how to approach more new customers and not just base our relationship about the existing customers and the existing relations with the existing customers. -- And as a follow-up to that, do we -- I mean just from a feet on the street perspective, if I look at sort of where your peers are spending, it just seems like spending quite a bit more from a sales and marketing perspective. And I'm wondering do -- is there a notion that just more feet need to go on the street or is it inefficiency you're retargeting the folks that you already have in the organization? Thanks. -- I think it's both. I always believe that the way to work is work efficiently and work smart, and if you build the right engine, it will have amazing results, so my focus is on that. Still I think we're going to add more feet in the street because there is more potential and because that will allow us to access more opportunities in more segments. So we will do both, and I think we'll keep doing that in a responsible manner. -- Great, thank you.Our next question is from Philip Winslow with Wells Fargo. Please proceed. -- Hey, thanks guys for taking my question. Just want to get some color on the pricing environment that you're seeing during the second half here, anything that you'd note, change wise, whether it'd be just from competitors on what's called the base product or really maybe the add-on subscriptions, just general color on sort of the competitive environment and pricing? -- I think the environment is quite competitive. There is price pressure. We have a few competitors that their focus is on low price and when they come to a deal, they -- the prices are going down. We have others that are focusing on other attributes. So the market remains competitive. It doesn't seem that it become more competitive in the last quarter, to put it in that perspective. Tal any-- -- No, see, you know typically when you're in a transaction that is large with many competition then you see -- many competitors and large bids, then you see more competition naturally. Remember that product discount is different from subscription, different from supporters. So it can vary; depends also on the mix on a specific order. -- Got it. And then just one follow-up for Gil from a previous question about the Cloud, I mean, if you believe that the world is going to be hybrid going forward and that you're going to see workloads both on-premise and in the Cloud. Can you talk about just from a -- call it a policy and management and sort of like the operation side of security. What do you guys discuss about sort of having sort of a single pane across both Cloud and on-premise versus let's say using Check Point on-premise and then let's say just a native product and call it a Cloud vendor and having to maintain two policies. What is your thought process? What are you hearing from customers on that? -- Absolutely, that's an excellent question. So first I think customers are more and more aware. If I took two, three years back, customers didn't have -- their whole security thinking was very silo-ed. Customers and more and more understand that the role of the CISO needs to be on overall security policy management, on overall security policy enforcement and that's a new trend, again which happened in the last maybe one or two years, but something that is changing in the world.In terms of managing the Cloud, you are absolutely right. There is a hybrid environment almost everywhere. Today, we do have that advantage that from our smart center console we can manage our CloudGuard IaaS and have uniform management of wherever your instance, is physical appliance or virtual security gateway in the Cloud, Dome9 addresses exactly that.Dome9 is exactly getting to the point of how do I manage multi-Cloud. Our motivation here is to incorporate that into the Infinity architecture and give the customer a single pane of glass, but not just a single pane of glass, it's really the uniform thinking about I can know what's in the Cloud is very important, to know what are your assets, to know what's changing, to automatically provision sync (ph) and most importantly, to enforce that policy everywhere. And I think that's exactly the value of Dome9, and that's why we like them, and that's why it's worked for us, doing that kind of deal. -- Great, thanks guys.Our next question is from Sterling Auty with JP Morgan. Please proceed. -- Yes, thanks. Hi guys. So clearly you saw a really good step-up in execution in North America. Well this is actually the first quarter that Europe has slowed down underneath the growth of North America. Anything in particular that maybe caused some deceleration in Europe? -- I think Tal indicated already that the revenues and the business trends that you're seeing underneath don't always correlate and Europe is actually doing quite fine and we're pretty happy with the performance of Europe at this point. -- Okay. And then, Gil, one trend that we're obviously seeing is the number of vendors in security plays into EDR, the Endpoint Detection and Response and use of machine language to ingest a lot of data and then go out in either threat seek, threat hunt to protect their customers. I'm curious that now you're making with the Dome9 investment, is this another area that you think you're going to need to have a presence in, either through organic development or through acquisition? -- First, I think that we do have some presence in that our SandBlast agent for the endpoint does have many of these capabilities and does have amazing capabilities of EDR and I think the strategy on that looking forward is quite challenging, not because there's no technologies around and not because we don't have good capabilities. Actually there was just a test now and we rated very, very high; far better than many vendors, both traditional vendors and new vendor, in terms of our endpoint security capabilities and especially these new ones. We got -- I don't remember what was the score, but again it was one of the highest in the industry.But the challenge for me strategically, and I'll share it openly, the end-point market itself is very fragmented. There are very large, well-established vendors. There are many tiny start-ups and there are even companies now in the middle in the hundreds of millions of dollars of revenues that are mid-size companies but are quite sizable in the high-tech world. And the question is how to play in that game? Can any vendor can just have an end point with good -- and get a real important market share in that?And I think I do have few ideas. I won't share all the ideas. I'll share the challenge and the strategic thinking. In terms of ideas, yes we have a product and I think it's a great product and we can also acquire more technologies and there are few interesting technologies that's I've seen around. It's really unclear to me what's the right play in that market and what's the right way to provide that overall security? Currently, I must say, we're the only vendor that has everything connected and has the Cloud, the endpoint, the mobile, the Data Center, the network; all connected in one platform and we do have it now and we do have customers that are using it. -- Thank you, Gil.Our next question is from Jonathan Ho from William Blair. Please proceed. -- Hi, good morning. I just wanted to maybe start out with the sales and marketing investments that you talked about. Can you maybe give us a sense of magnitude and maybe where you are making those investments in terms of what the sales force is asking for? -- I think the investments are quite uniform and around the world. I mean let's take an example; this quarter we had like 20 local conferences, what we call CPX. We have one big CPX -- not one, three big CPXs regional in European, in the Americas and in Asia at the beginning of the year we call it CPX360. Then we roll it into a local program of local conferences. This quarter we had like 20 of them and it is all around the world. This quarter was actually more focused on North America. But again, we had the huge one in Singapore and actually just this week we had a big one in Russia. So I mean, it is all over, and I think the potential is all over.In terms of sales investment, again, the potential is all over the world. The potential -- there is a big potential, again, in the US. But I don't think that I can say if it was one area that is more important than the other. In marketing expense, there are spent on everything, on trade shows, on conferences and so one -- in sale, the biggest investments is simply headcount. That's the number one driving and that's, by the way, most of the spend that we have on sales and marketing. -- Got it. And then just as a follow-up, can you talk a little bit about whether you're seeing an impact from SSL traffic increases, either drive people to purchase larger boxes or potentially on installed base renewals drive any type of upsell? -- Okay, that's an excellent one, and I think technically SSL is a very challenging thing because more traffic is moving toward the sale and we need to inspect --and we need to inspect that and that requires much more horsepower. So yes, we are seeing more demand for more performance and more computing power. By the way, we came last quarter with a new model called the 23900, the high-end model and that's exactly it's positioning. With more SSL traffic, you need more power to do more threat prevention and actually it's going quietly well in that regard.I do believe, by the way, that the biggest differentiator is not just speeds. Our SSL, our new capabilities in our latest version of R80.20 on SSL are far better than the competition. I don't want to go into the technicalities right now, but everybody is claiming to have SSL inspection. We will show soon how can you -- how we are doing the checks in a much more rigid way and a much -- in a way that doesn't let anything go unlocked when, if you're a malware developer, you can easily developing an SSL malware that will bypass other company's SSL, simply because they say yes, we have an SSL, but it's easy to bypass their SSL security.So these are things that were actually discussed in the last few weeks here internally that we can show the value of what we do. And by the way, I'm amazed in every technology review that I'm doing to our people that they're working on the right stuff, we're providing the right security, and sometimes I'm simply puzzled to see that a lot of the competition is very negligent on the level of security that they provided, and SSL was a perfect example from last week. -- Thank you.Our next question is from Erik Suppiger with JMP Securities. Please proceed. -- Yes. Two questions on Dome9. First off, I think Dome9 was used in a lot of environments where they were not using a third-party firewall, be it Check Point or anybody else. Is the strategy here to get into environments that are not using firewalls or is the strategy to leverage Dome9 to bring Check Point into those environments and integrate Check Point into the broader security profile? And then secondly, do you have any incentives to keep the management of Dome9, as part of the terms of the agreement? -- I'll start from the second one. It's easy, yes, and I think that -- by the way in all the acquisition, the recent acquisition that we've done we put incentives for management to stay and as far as I can say, they did stay. I mean, unlike what we see in the industry and what I've seen in our -- I mean, historical past, many years ago, here in the last few acquisitions that we've done the management stayed three, four years and it's working well; so, that's for the second part.For the first part, I think you're right about the need for Dome9. I think that we are able to get into environments that haven't been using advanced security like our CloudGuard IaaS or other gateways. So Dome9 clearly lets us get into that environment and provide your management. If you're not a Check Point customer the value is there. If you're a Check Point customer, it's easy to see why you have tools to manage your network security right now you need to have similar tools for the Cloud. So Dome9 should be an easy decision to expand your control.And once you have that, it's very easy to see with the visibility tools, but here I'm using, let's say Level 1 security I want to go through Level 5 and we can provide also the Level 5 or the Gen V Security with our advanced threat capabilities. But I think we need to start from securing the environment when the Cloud is getting and it is out of control in most enterprises today. -- Very good, thank you.Our next question is from Fatima Boolani, Please proceed with your question. -- Good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. Tal, maybe to start with you, I wanted to follow up on your comments around product growth and your confidence about going forward this could and should stabilize and in fact grow i.e. beyond focusing your execution and continuing to improve your execution, are there fundamental aspects that you see that maybe we don't that is underpinning your confidence in the form of maybe better client shipments than we can see or a better refresh opportunity within your install base that we could see and a follow up for Gil if I may? -- Yes. Actually I didn't say that, just to clarify. I said that when you look in the long run, then the more technologies you have that are subscription and virtual and Cloud and mobile, than actually we see less products. So I think in the long-term, there is a trend that is clear that everything moving to a -- majority is moving to subscription, even when you look at Infinity, then the more people will buy Infinity, the more portion of the deal is going to subscription and support and less on the product because the entire bundle has much more layers of service-orientated portions versus the appliances and the product.So long-term actually I think it's not. Now we're talking in the short-term that once we continue and see the improvement, then you can start to see the improvement on the execution then I want to see also growth in the product. But long-run, it's -- I don't know whether the industry will go there. -- All right, fair enough. Gil, just as a segue, just off that point, as Check Point endeavors to become essentially a security-as-a-service provider with Infinity Total Protection. What implications does that have from how you manage and build out your infrastructure, because the onus of SLAs and delivery of the security service would be from you instead of the appliance that the customer would have to buy to enjoy the security subscriptions? -- So, some of the things we're doing and some of the future architectures that we'll be speaking about will be like that, where we provide more and more Cloud services. We have been doing that for quite few years on several areas, and we will expand that, like our sandboxing and threat emulation is done mostly on our Cloud and we've been doing it quite effectively. And I think that's an area that we are building and growing and learning, and so far, it's working well I believe that we're serving almost 7,000 customers today with security capabilities that we supply from the Cloud. Today it's a hybrid environment. Eventually some of this might become not-hybrid, but full Cloud. I think -- but for the foreseeable future, it will all be in hybrid environment in that regard. -- That's very helpful. Thank you.Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our question and answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to Management for closing remarks. -- Thank you guys for joining us today. We'll be looking forward to seeing you during the quarter. And also, if you'd like to have a call back today, pop me an email and we'll get you in the queue. Thanks and have a great day. Bye, bye.Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation.

" (NASDAQ: CHKP) is dawdling even as the broader cybersecurity market is growing at a solid pace. The cybersecurity specialist has been more concerned with share buybacks and growing its bottom line, even as rivals are  to get more customers.Not surprisingly, Wall Street has been disenchanted with Check Point over the past year. Its stock is down over the past 12 months. data by However, the stock has found some momentum of late thanks to BTIG analyst Joel Fishbein's upgrade. The  ""it is now time to get constructive on the name again;"" Check Point seems to have bottomed and its sales force is now ""more effective.""The good news is that investors won't have to wait long to see if Check Point is making progress, as it will be reporting its fiscal third-quarter results on Oct. 24. Here's what the company needs to deliver to keep up its newfound momentum.Image Source: Getty Images.Check Point Software's recent rise has been helped by the company's second-quarter results, reported in July. Its top and bottom lines were  of its guidance range, though growth wasn't robust. Its revenue was up just 2% year over year thanks to the company's transition from product-based sales to subscriptions.Non-GAAP net income also grew a paltry 2% compared to the prior-year period. The situation could be similar this time, as Check Point's third-quarter revenue is expected to increase just 2.5% year over year to $466 million. The company is expected to deliver earnings of $1.36 per share as compared to $1.30 a share in the prior-year period.Check Point shouldn't have much difficulty in meeting expectations. The company has doubled its share repurchase program to $2 billion, and this should support its bottom line.Part of the weakness on the top line is due to the company's move toward a subscription-centric model. Product-based revenue is usually recognized upfront, while subscription revenue is recognized over a period of time. Investors have been willing to give Check Point a long leash as it makes this transition, however, the company needs to show that it can accelerate its growth.Though Check Point has been growing at a snail's pace, there are indications that its growth could speed up in subsequent quarters. For instance, the company signed 58 transactions that were worth $1 million or more during the second quarter. The total value of such large transactions increased by $50 million on a year over year basis during the second quarter.This boosted Check Point's deferred revenue by 9% annually. However, the company claims that there were ""some large multi-year contracts that were not fully invoiced,"" so they were not recognized as  . Investors will be watching the deferred revenue metric in this month's report closely.The good part is that Check Point now has the tools to lock customers into long subscription contracts thanks to its Infinity Architecture, an end-to-end cyber-defense platform. Check Point believes that Infinity is the only cybersecurity architecture that can protect users against so-called fifth-generation cyber attacks.The company's own surveys reveal that just 3% of enterprises are equipped to handle the latest generation of cyberattacks, which usually take place on a large scale across different devices using advanced techniques. Check Point believes that the advantages of the Infinity Architecture are helping it attract more customers across several verticals, though the company also points out that deals are taking longer to materialize.Check Point recently highlighted that its sales execution is tracking ahead of expectations. If that's indeed the case, then it should report stronger deal activity when it releases quarterly results. That would go a long way toward assuring investors that Check Point is capable of accelerating its growth, which will eventually give the stock a nice shot in the arm.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"n recent trading, shares of Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd. (Symbol: CHKP) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $117.70, changing hands for $117.73/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 17 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd. , but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $99.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $136.00. The standard deviation is $10.599.But the whole reason to look at the  CHKP price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with CHKP crossing above that average target price of $117.70/share, investors in CHKP have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $117.70 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd. :

 is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Oct 24.The company's results surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive earnings surprise of 6.61%.In the last reported quarter, the company's non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.24 increased 20.2% year over year and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.86. Moreover, F5 Networks' revenues grew 4.7% to $542.2 million and topped the consensus estimate of $540 million. | For fourth-quarter fiscal 2018, F5 Networks expects revenues in the range of $555-$565 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $560.55 million. The company expects non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $2.61-$2.64. The consensus estimate is pegged at $2.63.Let's see how things are shaping up for the upcoming announcement.F5 Networks' growth in services and software solutions segment is a key driver. The company's traction in public cloud deployments, given the surge in demand for security in the multi-cloud environment, is a tailwind.In its last , management hinted that it expects the fiscal fourth quarter to witness continued strength in product revenues. Continued adoption of flexible consumption models is expected to continue its uptrend, driving the adoption of company's new cloud offerings, including the BIG-IP Cloud Edition launched recently.The company's enhanced network functions virtualization offering for services to simplify consumption of F5 Network's portfolio of VNFs (based on BIG-IP capabilities) is expected to give further impetus.Moreover, F5 Networks' growth opportunities in the security market are driven by its advanced Web Application Firewall (WAF). It is witnessing an expansion in its addressable market and revenue growth prospects on the back of its WAF offerings. The strong adoption of advanced WAF in existing as well as new customers is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter.Additionally, in the last reported quarter, customers increasingly deployed a combination of both the iSeries systems as well as software in multi-cloud environments. Customers are likely to continue to adopt F5 Networks' offerings to securely and easily manage workloads across such mixed environment. This will boost the company's top line.In an effort to expand its stand-alone security portfolio, F5 Networks released the F5 Access Manager to enable organizations to migrate on-premise application functionality to the cloud. This technology is expected to gain momentum in the quarter.However, higher spending on cloud and security is likely to lead to $23-$25 million of restructuring costs in the to-be-reported quarter. This might keep the margin slightly under pressure.Moreover, a volatile spending environment and increasing competition remain headwinds for F5 Networks' revenue growth. Notably, Cisco Systems  poses the most significant competitive threat to F5 Networks, given the dominance of the former in the overall networking market.Further, T-Mobile's  recent partnership with Cisco to build the largest virtual packet core in preparation of 5G has put further pressure on F5 Networks' market share.Also, competitor CheckPoint's  commendable efforts in the soon-to-be-reported quarter, icluding its launch of Generation V security gateway and Sandblast Mobile 3.0 is a potential threat to F5 Networks' market share.F5 Networks currently carries a ZacksRank #3 (Hold).

The chart below shows the one year price performance of IXUS, versus its 200 day moving average:Looking at the chart above, IXUS's low point in its 52 week range is $57.97 per share, with $67.93 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $58.85. Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@IXUS, ERUS, NXPI, CHKP: ETF Inflow Alert@2018-09-06@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ixus-erus-nxpi-chkp-etf-inflow-alert-2018-09-06
"n recent trading, shares of Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd. (Symbol: CHKP) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $116.72, changing hands for $117.68/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 18 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd. , but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $99.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $136.00. The standard deviation is $11.097.But the whole reason to look at the  CHKP price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with CHKP crossing above that average target price of $116.72/share, investors in CHKP have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $116.72 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

" 's (NASDAQ: CSCO) cybersecurity business is getting better with each passing quarter. The networking specialist's cybersecurity revenue now exceeds many pure-play specialists thanks to  , and it won't be long before it establishes a viselike grip over the market.In the recently reported fourth quarter, Cisco's cybersecurity revenue shot up 12% annually to $627 million, making cybersecurity Cisco's fastest-growing segment. By comparison, pure-play cybersecurity company  posted a revenue increase of just 2% last quarter.What's even more impressive is that the networking giant's cybersecurity revenue growth has accelerated over time.
  
Data source: Cisco quarterly reports.It is not difficult to understand how Cisco has managed to bump up the growth of its cybersecurity business. The company's legacy as a provider of networking equipment such as routers and switches gives it an immense advantage over pure-play rivals, since it can simply bundle its cybersecurity solutions at the hardware level.This is what Cisco has been doing for the past few years through its ""Security Everywhere"" strategy. The company has been pushing its cybersecurity solutions into mission-critical areas such as networking hardware, the cloud, and endpoints, promising customers that it can better close gaps within the network to prevent, detect, or remedy attacks.Image Source: Getty Images.Cisco's cybersecurity revenue growth shows that the strategy is working. What's more, the company is doing the right thing by lapping up smaller companies to bolster its expertise in specific cybersecurity niches and to enhance the appeal of its offerings. For instance, Cisco  for $2.35 billion, the latest in a line of cybersecurity-specific acquisitions made by the networking giant.Duo adds a new dimension to Cisco's cybersecurity business thanks to its expertise in two-factor authentication. According to  , 63% of data breaches are a result of using weak, default, and even stolen passwords. This is where multifactor authentication services come into play, as the user will have to authenticate access on at least two fronts.Grand View Research estimates that demand for multifactor authentication will increase at an annual pace of 15% for the next seven years. So Cisco has entered yet another fast-growing pocket of the cybersecurity industry that should help boost its cybersecurity segment's growth and help drive greater profitability in the long run.Cybersecurity is Cisco's fastest-growing segment, but it only provides around 5% of its total revenue. This means that the cybersecurity business isn't moving the needle in a big way for Cisco just yet, but at the same time, investors cannot ignore that cybersecurity is driving a transformation at Cisco.As it stands, recurring revenue now makes up 32% of the company's top line, up 1 percentage point from the prior-year period. Additionally, subscription revenue now makes up 56% of the company's software segment compared to 51% in the prior-year period. The improvement in these metrics led to a 23% annual jump in Cisco's deferred revenue from software and subscription sales last quarter to $6.1 billion.This is a step in the right direction for Cisco, as recurring revenue sources generally yield higher profitability, since it costs less to service an existing customer than going out to acquire a new one. Additionally, Cisco can cross-sell any new cybersecurity features to its existing customers and boost margins, since it will be able to lower the cost of sales.Now, there isn't any hard evidence to prove how much of a catalyst cybersecurity growth is to Cisco's margins, but there's a way to establish the positive correlation between the two. Back in 2016, cybersecurity was just 3.8% of Cisco's total revenue. As the contribution of this business to Cisco's top line has improved, so has the company's margin profile. data by Cybersecurity could be a big driver of Cisco's growth in the long run, as the company is positioning itself to grab a bigger piece of this space by using acquisitions and its influence in networking hardware. At the same time, cybersecurity will allow the company to grow its business profitably because it has the potential to generate stronger margins. This is one of the reasons why analysts expect Cisco's earnings growth to clock a higher annual growth rate of nearly 9% over the next five years as compared to the 5.5% annual increase it has clocked in the last five.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

t has been about a month since the last earnings report for Check Point Software (CHKP). Shares have lost about 1.1% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Check Point due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Check Point Software reported solid results for second-quarter fiscal 2018, wherein its top line and bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate.The company's non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) of $1.37 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.31. Also, the bottom line climbed 8% year over year, driven mainly by higher security subscriptions, reduced cost of revenues and a lower share count, partially offset by higher operating expenses.Fiscal second-quarter revenues came in at $468 million, up approximately 2% year over year. The revenue figure came within the company's guidance of $445-$475 million and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $461 million.Security subscription revenues continued to be strong at $132.1 million, increasing 12% year over year. However, revenues of $125.7 million from Products lagged the year-ago quarter by 9.1%.Software updates and maintenance revenues increased to $210 million, representing 3.8% growth.Geographically, the Americas generated 48% of the total revenues, Europe accounted for 36% of total revenues, while the Asia Pacific, Japan and the Middle East and Africa accounted for the remaining 16%.Notably, performance of the U.S sales force, which had negatively impacted the revenues of the previous quarter, showed improvement in the fiscal second quarter and results were on par with the company's expectation.Talking about deal size, the number of new customers - who signed deals worth $1 million or more - totaled 58. Customers, who signed deals worth $50,000 and more, contributed 76% to the total order value.Non-GAAP operating income came in at $247.1 million, falling 0.4% year over year. Non-GAAP operating margin contracted 130 basis points (bps) to 52.8%. This can be attributed to increased investments in sales and marketing efforts by the company.Non-GAAP net income was $218.2 million or $1.37 per share, up from $212 million or $1.26 reported in the year-earlier quarter.Balance Sheet & Other Financial DetailsCheck Point exited the second quarter with cash balances of $4.042 billion, compared with $4.009 billion in the previous quarter.During the reported quarter, the company generated cash worth $213 million from operational activities, compared with $419 million in the last quarter.The company repurchased approximately 2.5 million shares for $250 million. Check Point also announced doubling its share repurchase plan to $2 billion and increasing the quarterly repurchase by 30%, subject to quarterly variations.The company has provided guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Revenues are expected to be between $454 million to $474 million. Non-GAAP EPS is projected in the range of $1.30 to $1.40.Check Point reiterated its guidance for the full year fiscal 2018, wherein revenues are anticipated to be in the range of $1.85-$1.93 billion.Non-GAAP earnings are projected in the band of $5.45-$5.75 per share.In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates.Currently, Check Point has a subpar Growth Score of D, however its momentum is doing a lot better with a B. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Our style scores indicate that the stock is more suitable for momentum investors than value investors.Estimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Interestingly, Check Point has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"Another day. Another hack. Another reason to buy a cybersecurity stock.That has been my motto for the better part of the past year, as a huge surge in digital data volume globally has been accompanied by an equally large surge in headline cyber attacks. The big one was the  (NYSE:  ) scandal back in mid-2017, but that incident is far from isolated. Everyone from  (NYSE:  ) to  (NYSE:  ) to  to  to  and U.S. universities has dealt with a cyber attack of some sort over the past several years.Concurrent to the rampant rise in cyber attacks, demand for cybersecurity solutions has burgeoned, and cybersecurity stocks have bounced. The  (NYSEARCA:  ) is up 34% over the past year, almost double the  return of 18%.The pace of these attacks will only increase as more valuable data shifts online over the next several years. As such, demand for cybersecurity solutions will continue to grow, and cybersecurity stocks will continue to outperform.With that in mind, here's a list of 15 cybersecurity stocks which investors should watch over the next several years. Indeed, I think a few of them could be huge winners.When it comes to cybersecurity stocks, the cream of the corp is  (NYSE:  ).""Another day, another hack, another reason to buy a cybersecurity stock"" could just as easily read ""another day, another hack, another reason to buy Palo Alto Networks stock"". In other words, Palo Alto Networks is so big and so good at what it does that the company may as well be a substitute for the entire cybersecurity space.This dominance has manifested itself in a long and steady track record of 20%-plus revenue growth and healthy operating margin expansion, the sum of which has powered a 350% rally in PANW stock over the past five years.Recent numbers are strong, the uptrend remains intact, and analysts remain confident on the stock, so it is all around thumbs up for PANW here and now.While Palo Alto Networks may be the cream of the corp in this industry,  (NASDAQ:  ) isn't too far behind.This is another really big, really strong cybersecurity company that has a strong track record of 20%-plus revenue growth and strong share price gains. Over the past five years, FTNT is up 300%.Revenue growth isn't slowing at all (up 21% last quarter), implying that despite increased competition, Fortinet continues to ride secular tailwinds in cybersecurity to 20%-plus revenue growth. Thus, so long as cybersecurity tailwinds remain strong, FTNT stock should do well.Analysts are worried about  here and now, with the stock trading at nearly 50X forward earnings. That does seem a little rich and this stock may be due for a correction in the near future. But thereafter, long-term tailwinds should drive FTNT stock higher.Another cybersecurity industry titan is  (NASDAQ:  ). And, as an industry titan, CHKP stock is a likely winner if cybersecurity tailwinds stay strong.But, CHKP stock has struggled lately. CHKP stock is up just 7% over the past year. A lot of the recent weakness in CHKP stock has to do with anemic revenue growth. Revenue growth was just 2% last quarter, an usually low mark for a cybersecurity giant.Long story short, it looks like competition is weighing on CHKP stock. Thus, go-forward growth prospects, while strong, are muddied by competitive threats. Granted, CHKP stock sports a reasonable valuation at just 20X forward earnings. But, that low valuation runs next to low growth, so the stock really isn't a bargain.Analysts aren't in love with this stock (they see less than  over the next 12 months), and the chart isn't all that great, either. Thus, while CHKP should head higher in the long run thanks to industry tailwinds, the outlook for the stock in the near- to medium-term is much less promising.I'd lump cybersecurity company  (NASDAQ:  ) more into the Check Point pile than the Palo Alto Networks and Fortinet pile.This is a solid company with healthy industry drivers. But, revenue growth isn't robust (just 6% last quarter). Adjusted gross margins are inching higher, but not by much. The company is barely profitable, yet the valuation is fairly sizable at more than 3X trailing sales.As such, FEYE stock doesn't look like a huge winner in the big picture.That being said, there is an argument to buy FEYE stock in the near- to medium-term. Ever since the start of 2016, FEYE stock has been highly cyclical. In that cycle, the stock usually bottoms when the trailing sales multiple hits 3. Right now, we are just above 3. Thus, further weakness in the stock should be expected, but could turn into a medium-term buying opportunity. (NASDAQ:  ) is the nascent, hyper-growth player in the cybersecurity space.The company isn't all that big (under $6 billion market cap, versus nearly $20 billion for Palo Alto Networks). But, what this company lacks in size, it makes up for in growth. Revenue growth last quarter was 40%, and it was 40% the quarter before that, too.Because of this massive growth in a rapidly expanding industry, PFPT stock has done quite well. The stock is up nearly 300% over the past five years.Analysts think this stock  . So do I. Growth rates are huge, the valuation is reasonable, and the chart looks good (big buy signal if the stock drops to $110, its 200-day moving average).There is a lot of noise surrounding  (NASDAQ:  ) right now. But, I think that if you zoom out and look at the big picture, this is a cybersecurity company heading in the right direction.IMPV stock got slammed recently because of mixed quarterly numbers that included a big-cut to the full-year guide. The rationale behind the down-guide was that Imperva is transitioning to a subscription model, and that is adversely affecting revenue and profits in the near-term.Longer-term, though, this is the right move. We are entering the subscription economy era. Moreover, Imperva operates in a rapid growth area of cybersecurity (hybrid cloud), and that gives them exposure to huge tailwinds over the next several quarters.Meanwhile, the valuation on IMPV stock is reasonable at only 4.5X sales. Thus, in a big picture, I think IMPV stock is headed in the right direction. But, IMPV won't be a big winner overnight, so expect some choppiness while Imperva's financials take a near-term hit from the subscription shift.Much like Proofpoint,  (NASDAQ:  ) is a cybersecurity company characterized by small scale but big growth.CyberArk is even smaller than Proofpoint (just a $2 billion market cap). But, growth is really big. Last quarter, revenues rose 35% year-over-year, and deferred revenue rose by more than 50%.Also much like PFPT, CYBR stock has been a big winner due to its big growth. Over the past year, CYBR stock is up 80%.Analysts think this run will continue, albeit at a much  . That seems reasonable to me. This stock is slightly more expensive than PFPT, but growing at a slower rate, so if you are searching for growth in the cybersecurity space, I'd pick PFPT over CYBR.One of the bigger companies on this list,  (NASDAQ:  ), is much more than just a cybersecurity company. But, a big part of this company's turnaround narrative is centered on cybersecurity.That part of the Cisco narrative is doing well, and is powering improved financial results. But, Cisco as a whole remains a low-growth business with struggling margins. Moreover, laps are going to get tougher going forward, so slowing revenue growth is a risk this company is looking at it in the near- to medium-term future.That being said, CSCO stock is pretty cheap at just 16X forward earnings, and the chart looks pretty good.Big picture, CSCO stock has good, but not great, upside from here. It is a low-risk, low-volatility investment with a cheap valuation. But, it also lacks big-time growth drivers to unlock huge share price appreciation in the long-term.Although it is one of the smaller names on this list,  (NASDAQ:  ) has one of the better growth narratives in all of cybersecurity.This is a company that is positioning itself as a data protection company. Considering the volume of digital data is exploding higher right now on a global scale, data protection is the right niche to dominate over the next several years.Carbonite's numbers are really good. Revenues rose more than 30% last quarter. Gross margins are trending higher. Operating margins, too. Net profits are growing by a whole bunch from a small base.The valuation, meanwhile, isn't all that bad at 4X trailing sales. Plus, the stock is up more than 100% over the past year, and it has a bunch of positive momentum right now. Altogether, CARB stock looks like a winner.The next cybersecurity stock to watch over the next several years is  (NASDAQ:  ).The value prop of Qualys is getting enterprise customers to sign onto their platform, consolidate their security and compliance stacks, and cut IT spend. That is a pretty promising value prop, and a lot of customers are buying into it.Last quarter, revenues at Qualys rose more than 20%. Same with last quarter, and the quarter before that. Gross margins aren't soaring higher, but operating margins are moving higher as big revenue growth is driving opex leverage.From a valuation perspective, this hyper-growth cybersecurity stock looks fully valued at over 13X trailing sales. That is about as big as it gets in this industry, but Qualys isn't the biggest grower. Thus, going forward, valuation will likely weigh on share price performance.Of all the stocks on this list,  (NASDAQ:  ) is the one that has been under the most pain.SYMC stock is down more than 30% over the past year, mostly thanks to slowing revenue growth, which just turned negative. Considering competition in this space is only intensifying, it is discouraging to see revenue growth already dip into negative territory.That being said, SYMC stock is about as cheap as it gets in this sector. The stock trades at 2.5X trailing sales and 13X forward earnings. Those are pretty cheap multiples for exposure to cyber defense.If the growth trajectory for this company improves, SYMC stock could soar higher. Until then, though, SYMC stock will remain weak. There simply isn't much demand for zero-growth cyber defense stocks.One cybersecurity stock with a very attractive and multi-faceted growth narrative is  (NASDAQ:  ).The Akamai growth narrative is really quite broad. On one end, the company's fastest-growing segment is its Cloud Security solutions. Revenues in this segment are consistently growing around 25% to 35% year-over-year each quarter, and momentum is strong due to the security portfolio including new products.On the other end, Akamai provides solutions that enable the shift from linear content to internet content. This shift is only gaining momentum, and as such, Akamai's growth narrative and numbers are only getting better.Valuation is a concern for this stock. But, the fundamentals are pretty good. Thus, while I don't think AKAM stock has another 20%-plus upside in its tank over the next 12 months, I do see this stock heading higher in a multi-year window.Another high-growth name in this space is  (NASDAQ:  ).Splunk essentially operates in the world of turning data into actionable insights. This is a good place to be. It puts Splunk at the heart of a  addressable market. Revenues currently sit around $1.3 billion on a trailing 12 month basis, so there is clearly a long runway for big growth.But, revenue growth has been consistently slowing at SPLK. The valuation, however, has not compressed. That is a worrisome combination. With revenue growth last quarter under 40%, and the price-to-sales multiple above 10X, this stock looks unnecessarily risky here and now.Analysts have been moving to the sidelines on this name, and insiders are  , so now might be the time to heed the warning signs. (NASDAQ:  ) has been a winner to-date. But, that could change soon.There's no doubt about it. FFIV stock has been a cybersecurity winner. Over the past year, the stock is up 60%. Yet, despite the big run, the forward-earnings-multiple on FFIV stock remains below 20.Thus, the valuation is attractive. But, it is on top of what is projected as sub-10% earnings growth over the next several years. A 20X multiple for less than 10% growth isn't all the great, especially considering the market is trading at a lower multiple (17X) for  (16.5%).Perhaps that is why most analysts have a price target on the stock that is  the current price tag. I think the analysts are right on this one. This feels like a low growth company with a big growth valuation. Cybersecurity tailwinds are strong, but there are better cybersecurity stocks on this list with more upside potential.Freshly public and relatively small,  (NASDAQ:  ) is one of the most exciting and risky cybersecurity stocks on this list.Zscaler went public at $16-per-share in March. The IPO was a huge success. ZS stock doubled in its first day of trading, closing at $33. The momentum hasn't really stopped. Today, ZS stock is around $40.The hype makes sense. Zscaler is a cloud security company with nearly 3,000 customers, a huge international presence, 50%-plus revenue growth and 80%-plus gross margins. The company is disrupting a huge, nearly $20 billion cloud and mobility market, and revenues last year were just $126 million.Thus, the long-term growth narrative supporting ZS stock is quite promising. But, this is nearly a $5 billion company that is expected to do under $200 million in sales this year, so the stock is trading at a rather huge 25X-plus sales multiple. That isn't a risk-off investment. As such, ZS is the high-risk, high-reward name in this cybersecurity bunch.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@15 Cybersecurity Stocks to Watch As the Industry Heats Up@2018-08-21@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/15-cybersecurity-stocks-to-watch-as-the-industry-heats-up-2018-08-21
"he global cybersecurity market has grown incredibly over the past dozen or so years, hitting an estimated $120 billion last year, according to Cybersecurity Ventures. The pace of spending isn't going to slow down anytime soon as corporate organizations and governments have been bolstering their defenses to tackle the constantly evolving threats from hackers.The firm estimates that the market will keep growing at an annual rate of 12%-15% over the next four years as threats become more advanced.

Buying shares of the Prime Cyber Security ETF gives investors a piece of 50 cybersecurity stocks, and that diversity has the benefit of spreading risk and potential volatility across more than one cybersecurity stock.This is a big advantage as cybersecurity stocks, especially the pure-play ones, have been prone to  . Additionally, the Prime Cybersecurity ETF has an  of just 0.60%, so an investor who owns $1,000 worth of this ETF will have to pay just $6 toward the ETF's operating costs.This is a small price to pay to mitigate the risk of volatility, and also get access to diverse cybersecurity plays. Here's the top five holdings of the ETF:
  
Source:  .The top five holdings of the Prime Cybersecurity ETF, which account for nearly 22% of the fund, make it clear that it tracks a mix of both fast-growing and relatively mature cybersecurity stocks. Palo Alto, for instance, spends nearly half of its revenue on sales and marketing to acquire new customers, and recently hired former Google exec Nikesh Arora  .The company has been aggressively reducing its  net loss by increasing subscription-driven sales that carry a lower cost of revenue than the legacy product business. The subscription business is currently 62% of the company's total sales, so the growing contribution from this bucket will improve its earnings power in the future.Check Point Software, on the other hand, is a play for conservative investors. The Israel-based cybersecurity specialist  over the top line. Its operating margin of nearly 50% is way above Palo Alto's negative operating margin of around 5%. But this doesn't mean that the company isn't looking to take a bigger bite out of the cybersecurity opportunity.Check Point has been gradually boosting its subscription business and striking bigger transactions. Its subscription-based business increased 18% year over year during the last reported quarter, and now accounts for two-thirds of the total revenue. What's more, the number of $1 million-plus deals struck by the company had increased 11% annually, to 110 last quarter, indicating that customers are spending more money on its offerings.With a  (P/E) ratio of 21, Check Point should fit the bill of those looking for a reasonably priced cybersecurity play (outside of an ETF), as the industry average is more than 100. Risk-averse investors would also be inclined toward Cisco. The networking giant has done well to expand its cybersecurity business by  its legacy hardware business.Its cybersecurity revenue is on track to exceed $2 billion this fiscal year. The company generated nearly $1.6 billion in cybersecurity revenue in the first nine months of the fiscal year, an increase of 12% over the prior-year period. Cisco is well-placed to sustain, or even ramp up, the growth of its cybersecurity business thanks to its integration strategy.It is building cybersecurity capabilities right into its hardware products with the Talos platform that underpins Cisco's entire ecosystem. The company claims that ""if you own a Cisco security product, you're harnessing the power of Talos' threat intelligence, which flows to each and every one of our products.""Such a strategy allows Cisco to replace pure-play specialists as it can provide an end-to-end solution by embedding cybersecurity features right into the network. Moreover, Cisco is able to continually upgrade Talos thanks to the huge amount of data it receives and analyzes on a daily basis.Finally, the fact that cybersecurity is just one of Cisco's many businesses means that investors will be able to benefit from more than one catalyst, such as  .

 (NASDAQ: CHKP)  . The cybersecurity specialist was propped up by an analyst upgrade and a second-quarter earnings beat, and news that it is going to double its share repurchase program also boosted investor confidence. But a closer look at how the company has been performing over the past few quarters makes it clear that it is not getting its priorities right, and could end up a laggard in the cybersecurity market compared to the likes of  (NYSE: PANW) .Check Point's top-line growth has been stalling, which should give investors sleepless nights as the company is missing out on the cybersecurity market's massive opportunity.Data from Check Point's quarterly reports, Chart by authorIt is clear that Check Point's revenue has barely grown over the past few quarters. This isn't surprising, as it hasn't grown spending on research and development (R&D) or marketing over that time period. Check Point's total outlay on these two line items stood at $175 million last quarter, up just 8% from the prior-year period.For comparison, rival Palo Alto Networks spent a total of $376 million on R&D and marketing during the last-reported quarter, an increase of 20% over the prior-year period. In fact, Palo Alto spends two-thirds of its revenue on these two line items, compared to Check Point's conservative outlay of 37%, which is why the former has been able to grow its customer base at a terrific pace.Palo Alto's top line shot up an impressive 31% year over year in its fiscal third quarter as its  to 51,000, up from 39,500 during the year-ago period. Check Point, meanwhile, doesn't specify the number of customers it has. What's more, Palo Alto Networks' momentum won't be dying out anytime soon, as another key metric indicates.Palo Alto's  jumped an impressive 34% last quarter to $2.2 billion, while Check Point saw just 9% annual growth in deferred revenue to $1.15 billion. Deferred revenue is an important metric for subscription-selling cybersecurity companies, as it is the amount of money received by a business for services to be delivered at a later date. This item is recognized as revenue on the income statement once the actual service delivery happens, so it indicates how strongly a company's subscription business is growing.In the case of Check Point, there's hardly been any growth on this front. In fact, the company's deferred revenue growth has been patchy at best, just like its top line. This isn't surprising considering the tepid rate at which its subscription-centric revenue streams have been growing.Data from Check Point's quarterly reports, Chart by author..In all, Check Point isn't working aggressively enough to attract more customers, which is surprising given its solid balance sheet: The company is debt-free, is sitting on nearly $1.9 billion in cash, and has seen a strong increase in free cash flow over the past year. data by But management thinks that it's best to use these resources to support the stock price through  , rather than spending aggressively to enhance its share of the cybersecurity market. Check Point has boosted its repurchase authorization by 100% to $2 billion.Not surprisingly, analysts expect Check Point's earnings growth to come down big time over the next five years. Its earnings are expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of just 6% over the next half decade, down from the 12% rate it's clocked over the last five.Check Point Software seems to be losing the plot in the cybersecurity market, thanks to misplaced priorities that could cost it dearly in the long run.

"Three years ago, over 11 million documents belonging to a large law firm were hacked in a breach commonly referred to as the Panama Papers. Since then, numerous other law firms have been compromised.On top of that, big-name companies like  (NYSE:  ) and  (NYSE:  ) have been  the personal information of customers. Add it up, and it's clear cybersecurity remains a significant challenge for enterprises of all sizes and industries.While that's bad news for the companies struggling to safeguard information and for customers who have been compromised, it suggests a rising tide for cybersecurity companies.Spending on cybersecurity is slated to hit $90 billion this year - good for 19% year-over-year growth, according to a  . With that in mind, let's take a look at three cybersecurity stocks worth considering for your portfolio.Cybersecurity platform  (NASDAQ:  ) just announced a  for its endpoint security offering, showing innovation is a top priority of this cyber pick. The stock has gained 10% so far this year - double the broader market - despite losing ground in recent days.The company is expected to swing its $750 million in annual sales to a two-penny profit this year and is expected to expand earnings to 17 centers per share in 2019 - not bad considering the second-quarter is expected to end in the red, while last year's ""earnings"" were 16 cents in the red.No wonder the median analyst price target is $20 - good for 28% upside.Israeli company  (NASDAQ:  ) has posted comparable results so far this year, currently sitting 9% higher than it did at the start of the year. It has a far more established business model but, in turn, slightly less growth on tap.Over the next five years, earnings should expand by 6% per year. But I still like Check Point software because of its fundamentals: The company has margins near 50%, for instance, and just beat Wall Street's expectations for sales and earnings the most recent quarter. As cybersecurity spending continues to gain momentum, so will shares.The stock doubled over the last five years and could do the same again. (NASDAQ:  ) is the final pick on this list because it combines the strengths of the first two companies: a track record of profits plus strong bottom-line upside.Last year, Fortinet earned $1.04 cents per share and is expected to improve on those results by 48% this year. Over the next half decade, growth should smooth out to 23% per year. The only catch is that investors are well aware of the company's potential.Shares have climbed almost 45% so far this year - nearly nine times the broader market - and have booked nearly 200% in the last five years.

Fishbein said in an investor note that:Image source: Getty Images.Investors were likely also optimistic about the company's future after Check Point Software reported its second-quarter results toward the end of the month. The company's revenue came in at $467.7 million, which was toward the higher end of management's forecast and outpaced Wall Street's estimate of $461.6 million. Similarly, the company's non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.37  and easily beat analysts' consensus estimates of $1.30 per share.Check Point Software's share price has been mostly flat this month, but investors will likely be watching this company very closely. Management is forecasting revenue to be between $454 million and $474 million in the third quarter, with non-GAAP earnings in the range of $1.30 to $1.40.

"T security company  ' (NASDAQ: CHKP) second-quarter earnings were solid enough, but the real news from the report this week relates to the stabilization of performance in its U.S. operations. Check Point appears to be making progress on its operational objectives, even if its reported numbers don't look great. To understand what's going on, let's take a closer look at the earnings report.Image source: Getty Images.Starting with the headline numbers from the quarter:Despite its impressive free cash flow generation Check Point doesn't pay a dividend, but management announced it would double its  plan from $1 billion to $2 billion, which should help support the share price.Clearly, the headline numbers were positive compared to the lower end of expectations, but as ever with Check Point, it's important to read between the lines. The company has transitioned itself from more product-based revenue toward more software subscriptions in recent years, and this has a tendency to move the company's metrics around.For example, product & licenses revenue has declined for four straight quarters on a year-on-year basis. However, double-digit growth in security subscriptions and single-digit growth in software updates and maintenance mean that overall revenue growth remains in positive territory.Data source: Check Point Software presentations. Chart by author.There are two key points of note in the company's second quarter. First, revenue growth of just 2% is somewhat disappointing, and long-term deferred revenue actually declined sequentially to $302.5 million from $304.4 million in the first-quarter of 2018.Deferred revenue is a good way to monitor the development of future revenue, as subscription-based revenue is booked over time as compared to product revenue, which tends to be booked upfront. For reference, Check Point usually sees a nice lift in deferred revenue from the first and second quarterOne reason for the superficially weak results was given by CFO Tal Payne on the : ""... we had 58 customers with transactions over $1 million. This quarter, the total value of these transactions increased by over $50 million and included some large multiyear contracts that were not fully invoiced, and hence, are not part of the deferred revenues.""In other words, the company's shift toward larger, more complex and holistic solutions -- so-called  architecture -- is making its revenue and deferred revenue growth look superficially weak.Second, the company has had issues with its sales execution in the U.S. In a nutshell, Check Point reorganized its sales organization and strategy in order to adjust to the need to sell its more sophisticated solutions to higher-level executives. Unfortunately,  and  the U.S has disappointed for the last few quarters.However, the second-quarter saw improvement with CEO Gil Shwed noting: ""I have reported in the past about execution challenges in our U.S. sales force. In the second quarter, we saw a good level of activity and results. Total business volume in the U.S. last quarter was very good.""One swallow doesn't make a summer, and Shwed acknowledged that Check Point has work to do, but investors can take heart from a good quarter of execution in the U.S.Investors will want to see a continued recovery in sales execution in the U.S and increased adoption of its fifth-generation security threat solutions. The success in signing big deals in the quarter is an indication that Check Point is back on track with its medium-term objectives and hopefully this will be shown in the headline numbers in future quarters.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

These forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 include, but are not limited to, statements related to Check Point's expectations regarding business, financial performance and customers; the introduction of new products and programs and the success of those products and programs; the success of our sales and marketing efforts, the environment for security threats and trends in the market; our strategies and focus areas, demand for our solutions and our business and financial outlook including our guidance for Q3 2018. Because these statements pertain to future events, they are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from Check Point's current expectations and beliefs.Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences are contained in Check Point's earnings release press issued on July 25, 2018, which is available on our website; and other factors and risks including those discussed in Check Point's Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2017, which is on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Check Point assumes no obligation to update information concerning its expectations or beliefs, except as required by law. In our press release, which has been posted on our website, we present GAAP and non-GAAP results, along with a reconciliation of such results, as well as the reasons for our presentation of non-GAAP information. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Tal Payne for a review of the financial results. -- Thank you, Kip. Good morning and good afternoon to everyone joining us on the call today. I'm pleased to begin the review of the second quarter. Revenues for the second quarter increased by 2% to $468 million, toward the high end of our guidance, and our non-GAAP EPS grew by 8% to $1.37, exceeding the top of our guidance.Before I proceed further into the numbers, let me remind you that our GAAP financial results include stock-based compensation charges, amortization of acquired intangible assets and acquisition-related expenses as well as the related tax effects. Keep in mind, as applicable, non-GAAP information is presented excluding these items. Now let's take a look at the financial highlights for the quarter. Products and security subscription revenues were $258 million.Our security subscription revenues continued to be strong, which represent growth year over year, reaching $132 million. Our software updates and maintenance revenues increased to $210 million, representing 4% growth year over year. Deferred revenues as of June 30, 2018, reached $1.158 billion, a growth of $94 million, or 9%, over June 30, 2017. Revenue distribution by geography for the quarter was as follows: 48% of revenues came from Americas; 36% of revenues came from Europe; and the remaining 16% came from Asia Pacific, Japan, Middle East, and Africa region.From a deal-size perspective, this quarter we had 58 customers with transactions over $1 million. This quarter, the total value of these transactions increased by over $50 million and included some large multiyear contracts that were not fully invoiced and hence are not part of the deferred revenue. Transactions greater than $50,000 were 76% of total-order volume. Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 53%, similar to the previous quarter.We continued to invest in our sales force and marketing efforts. This investment increased our headcount and compensation in line with our plan. Effective non-GAAP tax rate for this quarter was 17%, similar to the previous quarter. GAAP net income for the second quarter of 2018 was $198 million, or $1.24 per diluted share, an increase of 10% from the second quarter of 2017.Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $218 million, or $1.37 per diluted share, an increase of 8% from the second quarter of 2017, and exceeded the top end of our guidance. Our cash balances as of June 30 were $4.042 billion. Operating cash flow was $213 million, compared to $226 million in the second quarter of 2017. This quarter we had strong collection from customers as well as reduction in the tax-exempt paid to the authorities compared to last year.We hedge our balance sheet against currency fluctuation. The hedge affects our cash flow with a minimal effect on our P&L as intended. During the quarter, the dollar strengthened against most currencies in the world, resulting in a hedge cost of approximately $14 million in our cash flow with no effect on the P&L versus cash income of $11 million last year. Our operating cash flow excluding the hedge effect increased by 5%.We continue to implement our share-buybacks program during the quarter and repurchased approximately 2.5 million shares for a total cost of approximately $250 million. We believe that our market leadership and long-term growth prospect make this an effective time to further utilize our cash to increase shareholder value. As such, we've announced today doubling our buyback plan to $2 billion and increase the quarterly repurchase by 30%, up to $325 million a quarter. The quarterly amounts may vary.Now let's turn the call over to Gil for his comments. -- Hi, everyone, and thank you, Tal. I'm pleased to report that we completed the second quarter with better results than our plan. This is a reflection of solid execution of our global sales force, which delivered nice results out of the U.S. and Europe.As you are aware, our business model is becoming increasingly more annuity and subscription-based. In the second quarter, this trend continued with nice growth in annuities build, reflected an increased advanced threat prevention cloud subscription. Our revision of providing fifth-generation cybersecurity solution continues to make headwind in the marketplace. We continue to promote our revision with addition field activities and, this quarter, we realized a significant increase in our marketing indicator, double-digit growth in meetings, conferences and our web traffic.I have reported in the past about the execution challenges in our U.S. sales force. In the second quarter, we saw a good level of activity and results. Total business volume in the U.S.last quarter was very good. While one quarter may not indicate the full turnaround, it is good to see the changes we have made in our U.S. sales force have begun delivering healthy results. As for Europe, internal metrics were very good pretty much across-the-board, which makes me even more pleased with the results.We believe our second-quarter results started to benefit from the increased sales and marketing activities. While top revenues only grew slightly, behind the scenes, we experienced solid execution, especially with our subscription. In terms of product segment, we've continued to see healthy growth in both private and public cloud. Key customers in many sectors have adopted our cloud solutions.We also had a good quarter with our enterprise and super high-end 40K and 60K series security solution. The World Cup attracted worldwide attention last quarter. And as you would expect, there was plenty of malicious activity around the games. Phishing websites that attracted World Cup audiences allowed malware to be downloaded onto the victim's computer.There was mobile malware hidden inside World Cup apps, all provided us with an opportunity to demonstrate our multivector prevention capabilities. The World Cup infrastructure also generated huge volumes of traffic and with them a very high volume of attacks. I'm proud to report that our super-high-end products were used to protect some of the most critical World Cup infrastructure. We've continued to elevate our level of customer-facing activities by increasing the number of skill-level meetings and promoting the Infinity architecture.I believe that Infinity is the only architecture available today in our marketplace that provides prevention capabilities against all five generations of cyberattacks. In surveys we have conducted, only 3% of enterprises believe that they are ready for the fifth generation of cyber attacks. Quite an astonishing fact that 97% are not prepared by their own admission. We've continued to see our pipeline for Infinity Total Protection solution build.As we spoke about last quarter, these deals typically take longer to bring to fruition. During the second quarter, we continued to see several customer adoption of the various elements of the Infinity architecture, ranging from local companies in the transportation business, all the way to some of the world's largest telecommunication and system integrator. This success is very exciting and we continue to see increasing numbers of opportunities in almost every segment and vertical. Our sales execution remains the key to unlocking the full potential of our security offerings in the marketplace.Overall, the second-quarter internal metrics and execution were better than I anticipated, which leads me to our projection for the third quarter. You know my regular caveats, the future is always hard to predict. There may be upside and obviously the potential for downside. Remember, the third quarter can be challenging with summer vacation and seasonal fluctuation.With that in mind, here are the third-quarter ranges we are targeting. We expect revenues between $454 million to $474 million, non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.30 to $1.40, GAAP EPS is expected to be approximately $0.15 lower. There is no change to our full-year projection. Now I would like to open the call for your insightful questions and feedback.Thank you very much.Thank you. Our first question today is coming from Fatima Boolani of UBS. Please go ahead. -- Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. Maybe a question for Tal, as you think about investments and the pace of investments for the rest of the year.Maybe just trends, sales productivity trends that you've seen as you wrap some of the heavy hiring from the middle of last year and sort of your expectations for hiring for the remainder of the year? -- So we continue to -- we're meeting our plan of a headcount recruiting. We still have growth to do as part of our plan, as we discussed before. So we are in line. In terms of sales metrics, we measure them regularly as we have metrics and measurements for everything.We measure their booking, their pipeline, different stages in the pipeline. We see the pipeline is growing. So all in all, I would say we see good indication in terms of improvement there and still a way to go that's why we continue to invest in that area. -- Thanks, Tal. And just a very quick one for Gil on the pricing strategy around Infinity. I wanted to understand with one full quarter in - almost two full quarters in, what the customer response has been around the per-user model and how that's making its way through the channel partner community, because it's just fundamentally different way of selling your portfolio? And that's it for me. Thank you. -- The early feedback is quite positive. We haven't seen any objections and I think the pricing is catching up. I think it's too early to say if it's really a success or not because there's only a small number of deals and it's too early to say. But overall, it's received quite well. -- Next question.Our next question is coming from Brad Zelnick of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. -- Thanks very much. Nice to see things begin to stabilize. I've got two questions, first for Tal. On the margin, I think this is the first time I can remember in a long time you seeing operating income decline year on year, which I appreciate the investments that you're making in sales and marketing and the time that that will then take to yield returns.But you also mentioned in your remarks that in the quarter, it included some large multiyear deals that were not invoiced, which I think is a new way of going to market for you. Can you just talk a little bit about that and the extent to which you pay commissions upfront or defer those commissions over time? -- So actually -- again, it depends on the type of transaction. But in general, we pay for the first year, as a general comment, with some bonus for the next three years. You're right in the sense that if we sell Infinity, as an example of subscription, it can carry with it larger deals, which is a nice thing and also longer in terms of the period that's why you see a significant increase, which we usually don't disclose. We just thought it will be an interesting data point for you to understand that sometimes, what you see in the balance sheet is not -- you don't see what's happening behind the scene relating to what Gil said about internal metrics.So when you have this type of transaction, invoicing can happen quarterly or monthly or annually while the contract and the commitment is for two, three, or four years. That's why I gave this color. Another thing that I can say, we did talk about investing ahead of the growth, which is the investments in the headcount and in the marketing, which is expected to see some reduction in the margin. I have to say the margin is higher than we expected and planned.So you can see at the end, our operating profit and EPS are higher. And we did have a small negative effect from the currency, probably about $0.01, as a result of the currency effects of -- on the P&L. -- Very helpful color. And for Gil, Gil, more than ever I think we're hearing every software company talk about security as a priority. Microsoft in recent weeks announced Azure Firewall, Amazon has GuardDuty. To what extent, are you seeing customers comfortable with some of the native controls that are available in various clouds and other software platforms relative to coming to a company like Check Point for specialized protection? Thank you. -- In the general marketplace, I mean, I think customers have definitely adopted a security company to secure their businesses. In the cloud, there's definitely some room for the native controls. And in the cloud, as we can see, the world is not protected. We've seen some of the biggest information leakage over the last years.Almost all of them were results of breaches to cloud infrastructures. And in general, I won't -- I mean, our job, both Check Point and few other companies in our industry, is to add a level of security on top of every whatever native product is doing in the marketplace. And I don't know, fortunately or unfortunately, no matter how you look at that, we have plenty of work to do. The world that we are living in is more vulnerable today than ever. -- Thanks.Thank you. Our next question is coming from Shaul Eyal of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. -- Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Congrats on my end as well. Two quick questions.Gil, with respect to sales and marketing and hiring, part of those investments, have you been taking any different actions with respect to channel relations, investing more in that respect? -- OK. So the answer is yes. And again, it varies where you are talking about the channel. We did invest a little bit in analyzing the status of the channel and how are we doing and what we should improve.It varies by different regions. There are regions of the world when we're doing very well and we continue in the same pace. In the U.S. specifically, we need to improve the woodwork that we are doing with the channel, and we had some changes also in the management of the channel in the U.S.just at the end of the quarter, so it will still take time until we do that. There's definitely much more potential in the U.S. to do more with our channel partners and to get more value from this relationship that we have for so many years. -- Understood. And maybe on the decision to double the buyback, so I think most of us here know Check Point's strategy with respect to acquisitions and dividends. And I think looking at the way you have been increasing your buybacks over the years, this one stands out a little bit, like doubling it. And I know we did might have sort of an indefinite time frame, but talk to us about the decision to double the buyback. -- I think it's based on feedback that we received from shareholders. I mean, Tal and Kip and -- I mean, our IR team is doing a lot of work to really get quantitative data, to survey investors about those preferences. I think we do see that there is a potential to increase the buyback. We've also analyzed the economical effects on that and we see that they were positive.So I think overall, it's a good decision. I think we have the resources. I think we have the upside potential. So hopefully, it will have the positive effect moving forward.It doesn't impact our ability or our motivation to execute some acquisitions. And I hope that we will find the right companies, and we will execute some of these acquisitions even though in the amount of universe that we are and in the innovation that we have internally in Check Point, it's not easy to find the right acquisition. And right now, by the way, I'm seeing plenty of innovation coming from within Check Point to the marketplace. -- Thank you.Thank you. Our next question is coming from Andrew Nowinski of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. -- Great. Thanks for taking the questions. So I know you talked about this last quarter that Infinity was delaying some product refreshes, but I was hoping to get more color on it again. So if we look at your product and subscription revenue, it only grew about 0.6%, And I realize the comps are tough, but they did get a little easier in Q2, yet your growth further decelerates.I'm wondering if you'd just give any updates on the product and subscription growth deceleration and the impact from Infinity. -- So remember that what you see in revenues is usually the effect of the booking of the last two quarters because it takes time to translate into the P&L. So we discussed it in length. That's the reason why we lowered the guidance in the previous quarter. This quarter, we actually had a strong booking when it came to the subscription and those items, but it takes time to translate.Product is lagging behind. -- OK. And then on the Americas, I know you said that the volume improved this quarter, but it looks like growth in Americas was essentially still flat. I guess, how long do you think it'll take to get growth back in the Americas to accelerate again? -- So first, I did mention that in terms of our internal metrics, we actually had a pretty decent volume of total business in the U.S. last quarter. And I think, as Tal just said, what you see now is the reflection of what we had in previous quarters, not just in this quarter, especially because we've increased subscription that are, actually will be reflected only in this quarter and future quarters. Now I don't want to be -- so if I take the trends that we've seen in the second quarter, I should be very optimistic.But I don't think that one quarter is a good indication of a full turnaround. So I'll be watching closely what will happen in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter. And hopefully, we'll have things in the U.S. stabilized and get to continue the trends that we've started there seeing.But Q1 and Q2 were not similar at all in terms of the behavior of the -- of our results in the U.S. -- Thanks, Gil. Thanks, Tal.Thank you. Our next question is coming from Michael Turits of Raymond James. Please go ahead. -- Hey, guys. Michael Turits. Thanks a lot. First, can you comment on discounting both in general, on maintenance in particular, and on whether or not there was any discounting required in those multi-year deals? -- Actually, multiyear is not necessarily the hardest deals, right? It's not the -- the discounts are attractive but competitive, competition on specific accounts. So when you compete on a new customer, for example, then you see larger discounts. If you have competition in that account, you see larger ones. So the trend didn't change.When it's competitive, you see much more pressure. Some players are leading with price, probably related to differentiation in product. Our differentiation is the quality of the product. Some player differentiation is pricing.So when it comes to pricing, then it affects the discounts. So nothing new there. I can tell you from looking at the last few quarters, I will say, as a generic comment, continued pressure on the discounts on the product and some stabilization in the subscription and the support discounts. -- And then speaking of product, this was a slight beat to expectations or consensus on license, but still down. Is there some point where you feel that we could be stabilizing that decline and moving back toward positive growth in product? -- I think the answer is yes. But I will just put a caveat that remember, there's a few things that are moving. So if we penetrate to more new customers and expand the installed base in existing customers, naturally, we should move to the positive. So -- but remember, if customers moving to subscription models, management models, vtech, cloud, all these solutions that -- all of them are sold by the subscription from Check Point.And therefore, it will be part of the subscription. -- OK. Thanks, Tal. Thanks, Gil.Thank you. Our next question is coming from John DiFucci of Jefferies. Please go ahead. -- Thank you. I think it's Tal or maybe Gil, these are solid results, especially given what you'd been posting last few quarters. As Gil said, this was -- the strength was especially -- or the solidness was from subscription. I realize it's still early, but I'm just wondering how much Infinity Total Protection had on -- had with that if that's truly a subscription.Or was it simply improved results for more traditional subscriptions like you're selling? I realize it's early for ITT. -- Right now, this quarter, most of the results are affected by the more traditional subscription, not all of them are traditional. Again, the SandBlast, some of that -- we had some very nice mobility installations in the quarter, more -- tens of thousands of mobile clients for one large customer. So I mean, we have some nice -- so we had some nice changes and nice successes in deployments and sales during the quarter. And I think we continue to see that part of the business strengthening.We definitely need to do more on other aspects of the business, and we will. -- I will just add one thing. -- OK. -- I will just add one thing. I will say, remember that many times when you discuss with a customer, you can talk about Infinity, and then he ends up buying three items out of the 10 that can be included. So it's a great way to discuss with the customer the potential, the road map and what we have to offer. And a deal like that can end up with subscription of a SandBlast and not necessarily a full Infinity. -- Got it. OK. Great. And if I could -- somebody mentioned in an earlier question that the results are -- certainly improved.And you really haven't -- at least I don't know of any product cycle benefit you're seeing in the quarter. And it's still a difficult comp. So I guess -- because you called it out, Tal, the deferred revenue, all -- every metric was better than what we're looking for, except for long-term deferred. I mean, you called out that hey, listen, you did some long term -- some multiyear deals that are not on the balance sheet.But I would expect that that would probably be like that every quarter. Or is this -- you certainly called it out, so is it -- was it somewhat of an anomaly this quarter? And I guess the next question is why would that happen if that's not normal? -- So remember, I always say that booking -- and that's why it's not one of the metrics that we share with you typically. I always say that booking can fluctuate between quarters and can move between quarters that's why we don't provide it. And we look at the consistency of the deferred revenues. Having said that, you're right.This quarter was significantly high-booked but uninvoiced amount, and that's why I just gave you a feel to it. -- OK. Fair enough. Thank you very much.Thank you. Our next question is coming from Gregg Moskowitz of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. -- OK. Thank you very much. Gil, you referenced the improved global sales force execution, but have you noticed any change in the network security spending environment over the past few months? -- Haven't seen a big change in the network security in the spending environments that much. And I think it's still a relatively positive environment that we're in. I think we are shooting now very high on the more overall cybersecurity. And I have more and more meetings with the CEOs, CIOs, CISOs, promoting that vision of looking at the bigger picture and not just updating and upgrading their old network security infrastructure.Again, that vision will take time to grow, to come to fruition, but I think that's the future, not just the future for Check Point as a vendor. But if customers in our world wants to keep ourselves guarded from the threats out there, all the generation of threats, we must take a different approach. Just the approach of making slightly stronger security to the existing mechanism that we have is not enough. We need to make the leap forward and get an overall consolidated architecture.And that's what I'm trying to promote these days. -- OK. That's helpful, Gil. And then just in terms of Infinity, I realize it's early, but do you see this as being - as it unfolds, as being primarily geared toward new customers or winning net new business, or very much toward existing customers as well? Thanks. -- I think the answer is both. We have some new customers that threat model is more attractive for them, and we won some of those deal. And the existing customers definitely can see the benefit of more security, more consolidation in the new business model which makes it an easier thing to procure and then to live with. So I think when I look at the pipeline, it's -- we have both opportunities.And by the way, it's definitely a very good door opener for discussion. I think Tal mentioned that not every time we offer Infinity, we will win the deal, especially the bigger the customer, the more difficult for them to consolidate. But it's definitely changing the whole nature of the discussion and getting us to places that we haven't been before. -- OK. Great. Thank you.Thank you. Our next question is coming from Saket Kalia of Barclays. Please go ahead. -- Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions here. Tal, maybe for you. I think you touched on this before, but I just want to ask the question directly.Can you just talk about how billings terms on Infinity deals differ, if at all, versus traditional Check Point billings terms? Now I mean, clearly, Check Point does -- the vast majority of deals are one year unlike a lot of your competitors. So I imagine that there won't be much of a difference. But for the larger deals that are two or three years in duration, for example, what's been the trend in some of the early Infinity deals in terms of opting for 100% paid upfront annual in advance, quarterly payments? What have you -- what are sort of seeing in terms of changing billings terms with Infinity, if at all? -- So I'll say from thinking -- A, we had only a few deals and only so -- and a few callers even on those. But I will say, the default theoretically is annually. Some choose to pay it in advance, but majority will pay the annual amount. So it, by definition, says if you sign the contract of $1 million for four years, $250,000 a year, then you will see in the deferred only the invoice amount, which, in most cases, will be the $250,000 in my example.So it will be the annual amount. If you will decide to pay it in advance, naturally, you will see the full amount. And in the revenues, it will take you over four years to see it. -- Got it. That's helpful. Maybe for my follow-up, assuming that the multi-year contracts that you signed that were not yet invoiced in Q2, assuming that those are traditional Check Point sort of paid upfront, can you just give us a sense for kind of what the aggregate dollar amount is that's maybe moved from Q2 into Q3, just to maybe have a sense for how the billing seasonality might change at all? -- I'm not even sure I understand... -- I think, first, they are not - I think they are not billed yet because they will not necessarily be paid upfront but will be paid annually even though the customer has committed to multiple years, more than one year. So that would be the main reason that we are saying that the deal - we received the deal, it's a commitment, it's a multiyear commitment, but it's not invoiced because the payment is annual. -- Got it. Very helpful. Thanks, guys.Thank you. Our next question is coming from Anne Meisner of Susquehanna Financial Group. Please go ahead. -- Hi. Thanks for taking my question and nice quarter. Tal, just to follow up on the multiyear deals not fully invoiced, not to beat a dead horse here, but I had a slightly different question. Are you going to be providing any metrics around your off-balance-sheet backlog? I'm not sure how it works for Check Point since you're not a domestic filer.But the other companies are actually providing that as part of the performance obligation disclosure that's related to 606, so -- and that's typically in their 10-Q. So I'm just wondering if you would expect to share any of those specific metrics on your remaining performance obligation. -- Sure. Whatever we need to disclose will be disclosed as part of the 20-F definitely. -- OK. So it would be in an annual filing and not in a quarterly. Obviously, you don't do quarterly, but OK, that's fair. So a quick follow-up for Gil.Gil, I know you've talked about focusing more on new business and selling higher into the -- higher up in the organization as you may see go-to-market changes. Is there any additional detail you can share on specifically how you're structuring the sales compensation plans, and particularly, as it relates to new business versus renewal business for purposes of quota retirement? Any -- just speak to it. I don't know if there's any change in the strategy there. -- First, we are working very hard with the sales force mainly to change the behavior. And I think the change in behavior is not driven by compensation. It's driven by training, by focus, by many, many other things. And the salespeople do get a nice portion of their compensation.It's a bonus that's driven by meeting the objectives and not just by the booking amount. So actually, now we're in the middle of the year and half of the -- I mean, the portion on top of the annual bonus will be paid based on meeting this criteria of meeting with new customers, winning new customers, getting to higher level in the organization and so on. So the sales plan that we have right now is not 100% commission. It involves both commission and deals. -- Perfect. Thank you.Thank you. Our next question is coming from Philip Winslow of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. -- Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Actually, a couple of questions here. First, Gil, wondered if you could just talk about the competitive environment with the traditional firewall players here and just sort of what your win rates look like and pricing.And then also, one of the questions I get from a lot of investors is the potential competition with the Secure Web Gateway vendors, whether they'd be traditional appliance vendors or those in the cloud. How do you think about sort of your positioning versus those secure web gateway players, especially when you think about sort of appliance-based versus in the cloud? -- I think we are doing OK in terms of the competition in our traditional market. We had few displacement of our traditional competitors like Palo Alto and so on. And it's good to see that, that customers realize the difference in security and the difference between hype and the reality. And the differences are huge, by the way.I mean, it's a -- I mean, we have the only products that actually prevents attacks from getting into the network when most of our competitors would allow a Gen V malware to get inside the network and only later will give you an alert that something went wrong. It's ridiculous to see that some of our competitors' product actually under load will let connections come in -- malicious connection come and won't block them when our product will stay protected no matter what load there is on the product. So there are a lot of differences, and that's more toward the regular competitors that we have in the marketplace. Secure Web Gateway, I don't see that right now is a competitor.So I mean, it's not a -- I mean, theoretically, I can speak about the differences, what we are doing, what they are doing, where is the overlap. But in terms of the real competition, it's not that I can say that we won over them and they won over us. It's right now two complementary solutions. -- Got it. Thanks, guys.Thank you. Our next question is coming from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. -- Yeah, thanks. Hi, guys. Just wondering if you could give some commentary to the performance in Asia Pacific. What did you see that was kind of market-related versus execution? -- So I think in all areas in terms of our internal metrics, we had good results, we had positive results this quarter. Asia Pacific was a little bit behind and the other countries there that performed well, but there are a few countries that we did see some slowdown and we're working on that. It's been for a few years a nice growth engine. Right now, last quarter wasn't as good, and I think we'll work on that. -- Do you think that it will require some additional headcount changes or are the people in place and it's more just about training and programs? -- First, I don't -- and I don't think it's fair to give my comments on the internal performance of our people in a public call. I think -- but I think if I'll answer in more generic way, the process of management is a constant process of, first, coming up with the right program, educating, improving the execution in the existing people. And if things don't work out, also replacing some of the existing people. So I'm saying that so -- and I don't want any person -- again, inside Check Point or outside Check Point thinks that I have any specific comment on that.That's the general process of management, and we do it all over the world, in the U.S., in Europe, in Asia, everywhere in the world. And that I think we do have a lot to do because I think we can unlock a lot of potential in the execution of our sales force. I think we have great people, but I think we have much, much higher potential than what we are getting to right now. -- Understood. Thank you.Thank you. Our next question is coming from Walter Pritchard of Citi. Please go ahead. -- Hi. A question for Gil. Just as it relates to investing for growth, can you help us understand, are you looking to invest to grow at the market rate or are you looking to invest - we're trying to understand sort of the - maybe the optimal rate to grow in terms of level of investment that Check Point's looking to put in the business. And then I just had a follow-up question for Tal on cash flow. -- I think right now, we have a -- we still have a lot of work to do in order to grow in the right pace that we should be growing. I don't think that the key to that is hiring even though we do have a nice number of openings in our sales force. So it's not that we are -- exhausted our headcount and we are now thinking about the next stage for investment, we still have enough people that we can hire. And I think in sales, it's actually quite simple.Whenever we see that what we have is working and working well, we shouldn't have any problem to invest more and hire more people. I mean, our people are profitable. They generate nice amount of business. And if productivity is becoming good, we shouldn't have any issue in terms of our resources as a company or our business model to invest even more. -- Great. And then, Tal, for you on the cash flow, it seems like you were pointing out that there was about a swing of $25 million year over year as it related to hedging. Does that encompass all the FX-related impacts on cash flow? And can you help us understand what the impacts on cash flow, if FX rate stays at these levels, what the FX impact on cash flow may be for the rest of the year? -- That's actually the only thing that you can't predict because let me remind you what's the goal. The goal is that if you have asset minus liabilities in local currencies -- in our case, we have more liabilities in local currencies versus asset because all of our assets, including account receivable, is in dollars. So what you do, if we don't hedge, then the fluctuation in the currencies will hit the P&L. So the way to prevent a hit in the P&L, if we wouldn't have hedged this quarter, it would have got a hit and the other quarters will get income.So what you do is you hedge the balance sheet exposure. That means the effect in the P&L will be 0 because the hedge will cover the evaluation of the liabilities in the balance sheet. The goal is to have that effect being 0. The only place you will see the effect is in the cash flow.The size of the effect depends on what happens to those currencies during the quarter. Because we don't know, that's exactly why we hedge. So I can tell you, you're absolutely right. This quarter, the effect was an expense or a payment in our cash flow of $14 million versus an income of $11 million that we had in Q2 last year, net $25 million, that's why I said the effect is actually the cash flow was positive and increasing 5%.How much will it be next quarter? I really don't know that's why we'll have the hedge. -- I guess, just to be clear there, though, if FX rates stay the same as they are today, does that continue to be an FX or a cash-flow headwind for the rest of the year? Thanks. -- No. Not at all. Not at all. Because you roll them every month, right? So if the rates will stay stable, it should have a zero effect. -- Thank you.Thank you. Our next question is coming from Karl Keirstead of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. -- Thanks. Gil, I haven't heard you mention the R80 architecture in a while. If I have my facts straight, I think R80 released two, just went G. And I'm just curious whether you think that has the potential to be any kind of an upgrade catalyst for Check Point in the second half or in 2019.And then for Tal, Tal, if I take the midpoint of your 3Q revenue guide and your full-year revenue guide, it implies that in 4Q, growth goes from, call it, plus 2% to negative 1%. And I just wanted to ask whether you'd call out anything or is this just you being a little conservative given the variables that Gil talked about in terms of the sales turnaround. Thank you. -- So first, R80, in general, is in the marketplace and it's the default version. And many people are using it even though we do have some customers that are still on R77.30, which is also a great release, very stable, and again, giving more security than any other products in the marketplace. R80.20, the second or maybe actually, third version of R80, is not yet out. It's expected hopefully this quarter to be out.It will give a lot of benefits and will give a lot of boost to our performance as well as to several other security capabilities. I think people expect it. It's in early access with many customers. And we are -- the management part of it is I think in the more production grade.The gateway side of it, again, expected these quarters, and we are working hard to release it shortly again this quarter. -- And to your question regarding the guidance. I mean, Gil alluded to that. We don't change the guidance during the year unless there is something material. So we keep the guidance.And understand that the numbers if you take out Q3, then the planned number is Q4, but we have to see Q3 in order to know what will happen in Q4. So it's more like that the math of taking out Q2 and Q3 and seeing what Q4 will do. So it's not that I see anything different. It's just that the numbers are the guidance that we provided.We need to wait and see what happen in Q3 and then see -- and give you a guidance for Q4 specifically. -- Yeah. Got it. Thank you, both.Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ken Talanian of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. -- Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could give us a sense for the trends on your Software Blade net retention rate. -- It's actually quite good, so we don't provide it, I explained many times why, but I can just say that it's very good. It's stable, in some areas increasing, but in general, stable and doing well, including the new blade that's our - the SandBlast Blade for advanced threat protection. -- And as we look forward, what should we think of as the primary drivers to potentially expand that net retention rate? -- I have to say it's been that way very stable for the last probably two years. We started very low and it improved and reached to those levels that we have now. And hopefully over time, as people will adopt more Infinity, Infinity can be a driver in the sense that if people purchase Infinity, that means they are interested in moving from Gen II, III to Gen IV and V in protection, that means higher adoption and utilization, if people are adopting and utilizing these capabilities then renewals should increase. -- Got it. Thanks very much. -- Sure.Thank you. Our next question is coming from Gabriela Borges of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. -- Great. Thank you for taking my question. I have a -- for Gil or Tal, on Infinity Total Protection. I'm hoping you can frame for us a way to think about the upside that you're able to extract as customers move from the traditional model to Infinity Total Protection, maybe based on the early deals that you've closed or the way you've thought about the price points.How much logic could the deals be on the Infinity Total Protection when you look over a three- or five-year period versus the traditional model? Thanks. -- So when you look at the total, it can be significantly higher, like hundreds of percentage, of course. But when we try to look at it in terms of the size annually, then also that can grow significantly, meaning annual comparison depends on where the customer was before he moved to Infinity. So an example, a new customer, obviously, it's all growth, so that's nice. Existing customer, if it's an existing customer that was maybe only on Gen II and is now taking Infinity and moving to Gen V, it can be a very significant, very high tens of percentage increases, right? If he already had SandBlast and he now just adopted the mobile and the cloud, then it can be a lower increase.So it depends where you are as a starting point. -- But the potential is very, very high. And I think it depends on the type of customers and the amount of consolidation that we do. And the real economic -- again, the benefit for the customer is not the economics. The benefit for the customer is the level of security and the fact that they can jump 10 years forward in terms of our security architecture.Economically, it really varies how much we can consolidate from our products. What we've seen in the past is that customers have consolidated four, five vendors into our one solution when they moved to the Infinity Total Protection. -- That's helpful. Thank you. And a follow-up, if I may. Gil, you mentioned during the prepared remarks some of the indicators that you look to as forward indicators, double-digit increases in meetings, conferences, web traffic.Just curious how do those indicators compare to maybe a year ago or a quarter ago? -- So I think they are double-digit growth compared to a year ago and those -- actually compared to last quarter in both cases. I think we are investing much more in sales and marketing. Again, some of it you see in the dollar spend, but most of it is not the dollar spend. It's the focus, the execution, it's what we do.And it's really, really nice to see, in some cases, the -- I mean, the growth here is really nice. In some cases, it's 30% increase. In some cases, it's 60% and even 80% increase, more engagements, more activities and even more leads that we are getting from the different marketing activities. -- Thank you.Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jonathan Ho of William Blair. Please go ahead. -- Good morning. I just wanted to maybe dig a little bit more into your endpoint solution. You talked about some recent success there and I just wanted to get a sense for how meaningful of a contributor that is to revenue and whether you're going to be making additional investments in endpoint. -- So I think -- first, I mean, what we've been surprised and even overwhelmed by the success of our endpoint products over the last year. I don't know particularly on the last quarter, but over the last year, we've seen great success there. The last quarter, we received some really nice reviews and analyst reports all around the success of our endpoint, which, by the way, shows the innovation and the creativity and the power of our architecture because there are so many next-generation endpoint companies and yet our development team was able to produce products that are beating many of these products in the marketplace. And again, you see it from the reviews we just received in the last quarter.Having said all of that, my main focus is not in turning the endpoint into our -- us becoming a big endpoint vendor in the marketplace. There are good, established vendors in that marketplace. It's very hard to displace them. And there are also many start-ups with innovation around that place.I think the role that we should play is within the Infinity architecture. When a customer wants to consolidate their whole solution, when they want to get an holistic approach to security, we can supply them with all the relevant components. And again, looking at the success that we have and the reviews that we are getting for the product, it seems that we do have the best-of-breed next-generation endpoint solution in our portfolio. -- Got it. And then relative to the sales execution challenges that you mentioned, can you talk about maybe which improvements have had the most impact on the business and maybe where we are in terms of those impacts being shown through? -- I think it's too early to say. As I said, we've seen very good indicators in the last quarter and we're very happy with the total business volume in the U.S. And almost all the parameters in Europe, that's been very positive. I can't say which initiative; we're doing several initiatives.Most of the initiatives that we've started around new customers, around C level and so on will still need to bear fruit in the future. So what we're seeing now is the sales force executing and motivated and working on what they should be working. -- Thank you.Thank you. We're showing time for one additional question for today. Our last question will be coming from Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. -- Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my questions. Gil, on the competitive environment for the Infinity architecture, two kinds of questions on that. One, other vendors are talking to us about sort of a broader more holistic approach to security and consolidating a lot of functionality, whether it'd be Symantec or Palo Alto networks.Are you seeing them in any of these discussions or any of these competitive situations around the more holistic approach to security? No. 1. And No. 2, it might be early days, but have you guys seen any examples or are there any instances where you actually are displacing some of the legacy vendors like a legacy endpoint vendor while -- when you're deploying Infinity? -- So -- I mean, first, I think our approach in how the Infinity architecture is, by far, a broader and more holistic approach to security. I don't think that you can take any of the vendors that you mentioned in solution and get full security for an entire enterprise, definitely not to environments like mobile and others that's very, very unique to what we are doing. I think if you look at the security benefits, again, being the only vendor that does first-time prevention on very connection and by default, making it prevention and not detection later on after the attack has happened. And guys, I mean, we may underestimate the level of threats that we have, but believe me, when you take a room full of people, at least one of your -- at least one of the mobile phones in the room is infected with malware.And that malware can proliferate to the entire network, so -- when talking about mobility as an example. Are we seeing other vendors preaching on that vision? Not as much. I think we are probably approaching different customers because while we do compete with some of the vendors that you mentioned, the competition on the overall architecture is not something that we see often in these accounts. And I mean, the good news is that we did have some displacement over the last quarters, displacements of Palo Alto, some also of Symantec even though, again, I won't look at Symantec as my direct competitor.I'd like to -- I think in general, we are more complementary and more partners of ours than competitor. -- Excellent. Thank you, guys.Thank you. At this time, I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any additional or closing comments. -- Thank you, guys, for attending the call today. It was a little less noisy than our last call and we'll look forward to seeing you throughout the quarter. Also, look forward to hearing from you right after the call. Thank you.And have a great day.

 is scheduled to report second-quarter 2018 results on Jul 25.Notably, the company has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 3.6%.In the last reported quarter, Check Point's earnings per share increased 8.3% year over year to $1.30, topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.28. The company's revenues increased 4% but narrowly missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $453 million.For the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimates for earnings is pegged at $1.31 per share, indicating 3.97% increase on a year-over-year basis, and for revenues, at $490.92 million, indicating 0.51% increase from the prior-year quarter.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Check Point Software's rapid adoption of information technology security solutions is boosting its top and bottom-line growth.The company's shift towards subscription-based business model is a tailwind.. In the last reported quarter, revenues from its Software Blades subscription increased about 14% year over year. Rapid growth rate of this segment is expected to contribute significantly to the company's revenue increase.Moreover, Check Point continues to benefit from strong demand for cybersecurity solutions. With increasing and more sophisticated cyber security breaches, the market for security solutions is expanding. Checkpoint continues to earn positive remarks for its threat detection capabilities, positioning it among the leaders in the security market.However, we note that the company's efficient expense management method of not growing at the cost of margins and earnings might continue to keep it profitable in spite of obstructing the top-line growth.Moreover, the ongoing issues related to the changes made in its U.S. sales force make us doubtful about the company's near-term performance.The company on its latest  stated that new employees are taking much longer than expected to reach their full potential. As a consequence of this, the company's top-line remains under pressure.According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive  . Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) are best avoided.Check Point has a Zacks Rank #2 but its Earnings ESP is -0.15%. This indicates that the company is unlikely to beat estimates.

hough the cyber security industry appears well poised on higher IT spending budgets and increased cybercrimes, strong corporate earnings failed to impress the stocks. This is especially true as most of the stocks suffered even after topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both fronts and offering robust guidance (read:  ).Let's dig into the earnings of some of the cyber security firms that have the largest allocation to the ETFs in this niche area of the technology sector:Fortinet  posted earnings per share of 41 cents and revenues of $441.3 million, easily topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 35 cents and $424 million, respectively. On a year-over-year basis, earnings increased from 27 cents in the year-ago quarter while revenues were up 21.4%. The company projects revenues in the range of $445-$455 million and earnings per share of 41-43 cents for the ongoing third quarter. For 2018, it raised revenues guidance to $1.770-$1.790 billion from $1.715-$1.735 billion and earnings per share guidance to $1.63-$1.67 from $1.51-$1.55.CyberArk Software  outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 12 cents for earnings per share and $5 million for revenues. Earnings per share shot up 71.4% from the year-ago quarter while revenues jumped 35.2%. The company expects earnings per share of 25-28 cents on revenues of $77.75-$79.25 million for the third quarter. Like its peers, CyberArk also raised estimates for the full year with revenues expected in the range of $320-$324 million and earnings per share in the range of $1.43-$1.50. This is much higher than the previous estimate of $315-$319 million for revenues and $1.31-$1.37 for earnings per share.Check Point Software Technologies  reported Q2 earnings per share of $1.37 and revenues of $468 million, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.31 and $461 million, respectively. On year-over-year basis, earnings grew 8% while revenues were up 2%. For the third quarter of 2018 and full year, the company expects earnings per share in the range of $1.30-$1.40 and $5.45-$5.75, respectively. Revenues are expected in the range of $454-$474 million for the third quarter and $1.85-$1.93 billion for the full year (see:  ).Second-quarter earnings per share at Qualys  came in at 39 cents, 4 cents ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate while revenues of $68.2 million edged past the expectation of $67 million. Earnings were also ahead of 26 cents reported in the year-ago quarter and revenues grew 23% year over year. For the third quarter, Qualys expects revenues of $70.9-$71.5 million and earnings per share of 37-39 cents. For this year, it raised the revenue guidance to $278-$2379.2 million from $276.8-$278.5 million and earnings per share view to $1.46-$1.50 from $1.43-$1.48.Proofpoint's  earnings per share came in at 26 cents, well ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 17 cents and up 52.9% from the year-ago period. Revenues of $172 million increased 40.5% year over year and outpaced the estimated $170 million. For the third quarter, the company expects revenues in the range of $180-$182 million and earnings per share in the range of 25-29 cents. For the full year, Proofpoint increased its revenue guidance to $705-$709 million from $702-$704 million and earnings per share outlook to $1.12-$1.19 from $1.00-$1.09.The string of earnings beat and solid outlook failed to excite cyber security ETFs as both ETFs targeting this niche space have shed more than 2.5% each in a month. Below we have highlighted them in detail (read:  ):The fund provides global exposure to the cybersecurity industry comprising companies that offer hardware, software, consulting and services to defend against cybercrime. It tracks the Prime Cyber Defense Index, holding 50 securities in its basket. It is well spread out across components with the in-focus five firms accounting for at least 4% share each. From an industrial look, software and programming accounts for nearly 56% of the portfolio while communication equipment, Internet & mobile applications and IT consulting & data services round off the next three.In terms of country exposure, U.S. firms take the top spot at 81%, followed by United Kingdom (7%), Israel (6%), Japan (5%), the Netherlands (1%), and South Korea (1%).

"n recent trading, shares of Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd. (Symbol: CHKP) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $106.50, changing hands for $108.37/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 18 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd. , but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $95.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $120.00. The standard deviation is $8.19.But the whole reason to look at the  CHKP price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with CHKP crossing above that average target price of $106.50/share, investors in CHKP have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $106.50 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd. :

" has an impressive earnings surprise history, having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters and delivering an average positive surprise of 3.6%.With expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 9.7% and a market cap of $15.8 billion, it seems to be a stock that investors need to hold on to if they are looking to reap long-term gains.Check Point software's rapid adoption of information technology (IT) security solutions is driving top and bottom-line growth.However, the company's share price movement reflects that investors are concerned about the ongoing issues related with the changes it made in its U.S. sales force. The company on its latest  stated that new employees are taking much longer than expected to reach their full potential. The same is reflected in the company's outlook too.Nonetheless, we believe that this is a temporary issue and will be resolved soon.Its approach of doing business makes us confident about the company's growth prospects. Let's have a look at management's approach and why the company is expected to continue its momentum in the next year as well.It is not a secret that Check Point Software intends to boost revenues by selling subscription-based solutions and services. In the first three months of 2018, Software Blades subscription revenues jumped approximately 14% year over year.Although the company's subscription-based Software Blades constitutes only approximately 26% of total revenues currently, looking at its fast growth rate, its contribution to total revenues is likely to increase significantly in the next few years.It should be noted that this business model has very unique features - it generates stable recurring revenues with high gross margin. Therefore, the more the company sells subscription-based solutions and services, the more it will able to generate steady revenues - the benefit of which will trickle down to its bottom line.We believe that Check Point Software's approach of not growing at the cost of margins and earnings keeps it ahead of its peers like Palo Alto Networks  , Fortinet  and Cisco  .However, many believe that this approach might somewhat impede its top-line growth. Nevertheless, better control on spending has kept Check Point Software consistently profitable unlike its aforementioned peers, which are struggling with escalating overhead costs.Notably, the trend shows Check Point Software spends only a quarter of its revenues toward sales and marketing, while its peers spend about 40-60% of revenues. This makes a huge difference, as with just a 7% rise in revenues, Check Point Software's non-GAAP EPS grew 13% in 2017. | The company's debt free balance sheet, along with a huge cash balance of approximately $4 billion as of Mar 31, makes it easier for the company to fund growth initiatives, such as investments in research and developments, sales and marketing as well as acquisitions.Also, its ability to generate substantial operating and free cash flow every quarter helps it enhance shareholders' value through share repurchases.We consider that Check Point Software could be a good long-term safe bet for risk averse investors, given its steady revenue growth, increasing subscription-based revenues contribution, continued focus on cost minimization and a huge available cash balances to fund its growth opportunities.On the valuation front too, the company looks very attractive. The stock currently trades at forward earnings multiple of 17.3, which is way lower than the peer group average of 82.7.Check Point Software currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@iShares MSCI EAFE Growth ETF Experiences Big Inflow@2018-06-15@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ishares-msci-eafe-growth-etf-experiences-big-inflow-2018-06-15

"hares of  (NASDAQ: SYMC) dropped off a cliff on May 11 after the cybersecurity giant delivered a double whammy of bad news. The company's fourth quarter numbers easily beat analyst estimates on the top and bottom lines, but it provided soft guidance of fiscal 2019 and disclosed an internal investigation into past financial reports.But after that big sell-off, Symantec trades at just 14 times this year's earnings and 12 times next year's earnings. Should value-seeking investors looking for a cybersecurity play consider buying Symantec at these depressed levels?Image source: Getty Images.Before we discuss the bad news that crushed Symantec's stock, we should examine some positive figures from its fourth quarter report. Symantec's revenue rose 4% annually to $1.23 billion during the quarter, beating estimates by $40 million. Symantec's previous five quarters of double-digit sales growth were inflated by its acquisition of  in Aug. 2016.During the conference call, Symantec CEO Greg Clark attributed its fourth quarter growth to steady demand for its Enterprise Security and Consumer Digital Safety products. Its Enterprise Security revenues rose 1% annually, while its Consumer Digital Safety revenues climbed 6%.Symantec won over the biggest customers in the enterprise market with its Integrated Cyber Defense Platform, which offers a cost-effective, end-to-end security solution. It saw more than 100 deals greater than $1 million during the quarter, along with a ""large number of deals"" exceeding $5 million. It also closed an ""eight-figure deal with a large global professional services company.""On the consumer front, Symantec expanded beyond its core Norton AntiVirus product with comprehensive security solutions that bundle together malware, identity protection, and privacy protection products. Clark noted that the business had room to grow, since ""40% of US citizens"" were affected by a cybersecurity issue last year.Image source: Getty Images.Symantec's adjusted deferred revenue, a key indicator of forward demand, also rose 21% annually -- with 34% growth in Enterprise Security and 3% growth in Consumer Digital Safety. All these figures indicate that Symantec's growth will remain on track as businesses and consumers take cyber threats more seriously.Its non-GAAP operating margin expanded 980 basis points annually to 36.5% thanks to higher sales growth and better cost controls. As a result, its non-GAAP net income jumped 68% to $310 million, or $0.46 per share, beating estimates by seven cents.Symantec's fourth quarter numbers looked solid, but its guidance came up short. It expects between -1.7% to 1.1% sales growth for 2019, while analysts anticipated 1.9% growth.On the bottom line, it expects its non-GAAP earnings to slide between 2.4% and 11.2% due to its divestiture of Website Security and related PKI solutions, as well as higher investments aimed at boosting its revenue growth. Analysts had anticipated 6.5% earnings growth for the year.Those numbers look dismal compared to the company's cybersecurity peers. For example, Symantec's bigger industry peer  (NASDAQ: CHKP) is expected to post 2% sales growth and 5% earnings growth, yet its stock trades at just 17 times this year's earnings.Investors might have forgiven Symantec's soft guidance, but then it dropped a second bomb on investors: Its board has launched an internal probe into its finances and voluntarily alerted the SEC about the investigation. Symantec stated that the investigation was launched in response to ""concerns raised by a former employee,"" and that it had ""retained independent counsel and other advisors to assist it in its investigation.""Symantec didn't say much more about the investigation, but warned that its past results and guidance ""may be subject to change based on the outcome of the Audit Committee investigation,"" and that it was ""unlikely"" that the probe would conclude in time for it to file its 10-K for fiscal 2018. That probe cast a dark cloud over its already gloomy outlook for the year, which exacerbated the stock's big drop.Value investors often look for ""broken"" stocks, which are oversold due to short-term concerns, instead of broken companies, which face long-term challenges. Unfortunately, Symantec is the latter right now -- its core business faces growth issues this year, and the internal audit is deeply troubling. Therefore, investors should stick with  like Check Point until the clouds over Symantec dissipate.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Symantec wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. to learn about these picks!The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Is Symantec a Broken Company or a Broken Stock?@2018-05-17@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/symantec-broken-company-or-broken-stock-2018-05-17

"Surprise!  (NYSE:  ) shareholders who were prepping for a post-close earnings report from the cybersecurity outfit were thrown something of a curveball on Monday. Breaking from tradition, the company dished out its fiscal Q3 numbers on Monday morning instead.The accelerated timeframe doesn't change the numbers, of course, nor does it change the company's forward-looking guidance… unfortunately. Palo Alto is still the biggest and arguably the best name in the firewall and digital security business - and it saw tremendous progress for the recently completed quarter. But the quarter underway may not be as thrilling as some investors were hoping.For the quarter ending in April, Palo Alto Networks earned an  on revenue of $567.1 million. Both were well up from year-ago levels, when the company turned  into a profit of 61 cents per share of PANW stock. Both also topped analyst outlooks of 96 cents per share on revenue of $545.7 million.Billings were up 33% to $721.0 million during the company's third fiscal quarter, and deferred revenue ramped up 34% to $2.2 billion.Outgoing CEO Mark McLaughlin commented of the Q3 numbers, ""We delivered strong fiscal third quarter results with record revenue, deferred revenue and billings, while continuing to capture market share at rates that far outpace the competition."" CFO Kathy Bonanno echoed the observation, saying ""We drove market-leading top-line results through robust new customer acquisition and lifetime value expansion in the third quarter,"" adding ""We also delivered continued leverage in our operating model and generated strong cash flow, ending the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $2.2 billion.""She's right, though with a significant footnote. That is, the PANW earnings report isn't quite as solid as it may seem on the surface. After factoring in stock-based compensation, property purchases and the expenses related to a relocation of the organization's headquarters, Palo Alto Networks logged yet another GAAP loss. This one to the tune of $46.7 million.The GAAP losses are still shrinking, however.McLaughlin wasn't wrong to suggest Palo Alto was winning market share. Although rivals like  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ) are doing well in their own right by riding the rising tide of the overall cybersecurity market, Palo Alto's sheer size gives it an edge over its competition.And, the market seemed to know this well before the PANW earnings report was posted Monday morning. Shares were up more than 50% for the past year, with the last piece of the rally coming late last week in the wake of a raised price target from Stifel Nicolaus. Analyst Gur Talpaz  - tied for the highest target among the professional stock-pickers - explaining ""While the majority of our checks pointed to strength, we garner the most comfort from our checks into the company's supply chain, where we again saw Palo Alto slow down shipments into the end of the quarter, a clear indication in our view of 'cushion building' for F4Q18.""The stock could still get there, though it's not going to do it immediately, and it's not going to do it with McLaughlin at the helm. Shares were down almost 4% on Monday morning - largely in response to the company's disappointing Q4 outlook - as  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (OTCMKTS:  ) executive  with the organization.Palo Alto Networks said it was modeling for revenue of $625 million and $635 million for the fourth fiscal quarter currently underway. That should be enough to yield between $1.15 and $1.17 per share. Analysts had been, on average, expecting a profit of $1.21 per share, but were also only looking for a top line of $618.1 million.Given those numbers, the company is now expecting to report full-year revenue of between $2.24 and $2.25 billion, versus the analyst consensus of $2.21 billion, up 25.6% from last year's $1.76 billion. Profit-wise, fiscal 2017's bottom line of $2.71 was expected to grow to $3.89, while the company is modeling PANW earnings of between $3.86 and $3.89 per share.While respectable, the stock's mostly-unbridled strength for the past year implies investors were looking for growth.Of course, the company's  in almost every quarter for the past four years. It's unlikely it wouldn't continue doing so in the foreseeable future, possibly suggesting Palo Alto is lowballing to ensure a nice earnings beat three months from now.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Take the ‘Weak’ Guidance from Palo Alto Networks Inc With a Grain of Salt@2018-06-04@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/take-weak-guidance-palo-alto-networks-inc-grain-salt-2018-06-04

ontinuing its upbeat performance for the seventh straight quarter,  , yesterday, reported strong results for first-quarter 2018, wherein revenues and earnings came ahead of the company's expectations, and also surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company's revenues, margins and earnings per share, all coming ahead of expectations, were the main highlights of the quarter.Fortinet's non-GAAP earnings per share of 33 cents beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 24 cents. Also, earnings came in higher than management's guided range of 21-32 cents and marked an improvement over the year-ago quarter's earnings of 17 cents. This was mainly driven by higher revenues and improved gross profit due to sales mix shift to higher-margin subscription services, which were partially offset by elevated operating expenses, particularly sales and marketing (S&M).Fortinet reported first-quarter revenues of $399 million, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $390 million. The reported figure also came in 17.1% higher than the year-ago tally. Revenues also came ahead of management's guided range of $387-$393 million. A large number of deal wins and customer additions during the reported quarter proved conducive to top-line growth.Segment wise, Product revenues increased approximately 6% year over year to $143 million, while Services revenues jumped 25% to $256 million.During the quarter, the company witnessed 21% year-over-year growth in the number of deals worth more than $100,000, while the number of deals, worth more than $50,000, climbed 20%.Billings were up 15% on a year-over-year basis to $463.2 million.Non-GAAP gross profit jumped 20.6% from the year-ago quarter to $301.8 million. Moreover, gross margin expanded 220 basis points (bps) to 76.4%. It also came above management's expectation of 75-76%. The robust gross margin performance was mainly driven by aforementioned shift in sales mix to higher-margin subscription services.Furthermore, non-GAAP operating expenses jumped 11.5% year over year to $234 million. The figure includes a benefit of $11.7 million from adoption of new accounting standards which resulted in lower commission. Excluding the same, operating expenses flared up 17% to $247 million.Management noted that the increase was mainly due to an impact of $7 million from unfavorable currency exchange rates and a 16.8% increase in S&M expenses. Hiring was the main factor that resulted in higher S&M costs. The company revealed that since last September head counts in S&M department has increased 12%.Non-GAAP operating profit surged 65.6% to $70.7 million from approximately $42.7 million in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating profit margin expanded 520 bps to 17.7%. The figure includes a 390-bps benefit from the aforementioned accounting standard adoption. Excluding the same, operating income improved 130 bps to 13.8%, which came above management's guided range of 12-13%. Increase in operating margin mainly attributed to higher gross margin. | Fortinet exited the reported quarter with cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments of approximately $1.30 billion, down from $1.25 billion recorded at the end of the previous quarter. Accounts receivable were $313.1 million compared with $348.2 million recorded at the end of fourth-quarter 2017.During the first quarter, the company generated operating cash flow of $139.7 million. Free cash flow came in at $128.1 million. Fortinet bought back 2.5 million shares for $115.5 million during the quarter.Buoyed by overwhelming first-quarter results, Fortinet raised guidance for full-year 2018.For 2018, management now projects revenues at $1.715-$1.735 billion (mid-point: $1.725 billion), up from the previous range of $1.695-$1.715 billion (mid-point: $1.705 billion). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $1.71 billion. Billings range has also been raised to $2.040-$2.065 billion from $2.030-$2.050 billion forecasted previously.However, non-GAAP gross margin remained unchanged at 75-76%. Non-GAAP operating margin projections have been raised to 20.2-20.7% from the previous range of 17.7-18%. Non-GAAP operating margin include a 250-bps benefit related to the adoption of new accounting standards.Non-GAAP earnings per share are now estimated between $1.51 and $1.55 (mid-point $1.53), up from earlier forecast of $1.30-$1.32 (mid-point $1.31). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.42 per share. The updated range includes a 19-cent benefit from new accounting rules adoption.The company initiated outlook for the second quarter.The company's forecasts for the second quarter are impressive. Management expects revenues of $420-$430 million (mid point: $425 million), which is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $415.3 million. Billings are estimated in the range of $485-$495 million.Non-GAAP earnings per share are anticipated in the band of 34-36 cents (mid point: 35 cents). The guidance range is higher than the Consensus Estimate of 33 cents, but represents a year-over-year increase of 27-33%. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected in the range of 75-76%, whereas non-GAAP operating margin is anticipated between 18.5% and 19%.Fortinet's network security solutions include firewall, VPN, application control, antivirus, intrusion prevention, web filtering, anti-spam and WAN acceleration. The company started 2018 on a strong note, reporting solid results for the first quarter, and provided an impressive outlook for the upcoming quarter as well as full year.We believe Fortinet's initiative to change its business model to subscription-based service provider is paying off as evident from improving margins. Subscription-based service is a high gross margin business (approximately 80%) compared with the hardware-centric model.Notably, the company generates more than 50% of the total revenues from these services, which helped it generate a 70-bps gross-margin expansion in 2017 and 220 bps in the first quarter of this year. We anticipated this strategy will continue to improve the company's bottom-line performances as well.Nonetheless, we are slightly concerned over the company's slowing revenue growth rate. Notably, over the last seven quarters, the company's revenue growth rate has been around 20%, significantly lower than its previous rates of over 30%. Additionally, Fortinet's second-quarter revenue growth rate guidance range of 15.5-18.3% is also under 20%.In addition to this, competition from key network security players such as Cisco Systems Inc.  , Check Point  , Juniper Networks  and Palo Alto Networks, remains a concern.Currently, Fortinet has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over.

These are the good days for  (NASDAQ:  ). Opening this morning at $46, CSCO stock is at its highest since those glory days of the dot-com boom, when Cisco was briefly the world's most-valuable company, above $68 a share in early 2000.After the company blew past its 2007 high of $32 a share last September, it has not looked back, even while funding a rising stream of dividends that are now up to 33 cents per share, and full supported by earnings. So far in 2018 it's the best performing stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average,  .Cisco is due to report earnings on May 16, with analysts expecting it to earn 65 cents per share, and  , on revenue of $12.33 billion.Can it go higher?Cisco can indeed rise ahead of earnings,  , thanks to a cash hoard of $74 billion, against debt of less than $30 billion. Take out the cash, and the company is worth about $180 billion, a little over four times its fiscal 2017 sales.The company is thus in a good position to buy back CSCO stock, raise the dividend, or make the proverbial game-changing acquisition.The problem is that such acquisitions aren't on the horizon. Cisco has become heavily involved in computer security over the last few years. The best plays - like   (NYSE:  ), and  (NASDAQ:  ) would be too dilutive, trading at 10 times their annual revenue. Buying a rival like  (NYSE:  ) would cost half as much as Palo Alto but would likely run into antitrust problems.None of Cisco's recent acquisitions have been game changing. They have been easily affordable for a company with a $200 billion market cap - AppDynamics and its application performance management software cost $3.7 billion, while Broadsoft and its cloud collaboration software was had at a price of $1.9 billion.Most of today's  , but Cisco is increasingly more of a software than a hardware company.A wider future in software could be reflected in Cisco's latest acquisition, the  , which provides digital profiles on-the-fly off databases. The deal moves board member Amy Chang into a line role, running the company's collaboration technology group, units like Broadsoft. , as software defined networking eats into its router and switching business. The idea is to own applications on top of software defined networking, much as   (NASDAQ:  ) built an applications business on top of Windows, or  (NYSE:  ) on top of databases.It's the  , so far, that has made CEO Chuck Robbins, 52, something of a star. The transition also provides more certainty on both revenue and earnings.But the strategy does have risks. Cisco recently dumped its video software business, formerly known as NDS Group, back to its original owners  than the $5 billion it originally paid in 2012.Cisco is not just one company anymore, selling hardware to phone companies. It's a collection of networking software operations, selling through the cloud to enterprises.That may be a more secure place for CSCO stock holder to be, but it doesn't offer spectacular growth, because as one set of markets is growing ,another set may be dying. Cisco's top line has shown no growth for the last three years, its balance sheet and cash flow showing equally sound stability.Stability is good for a dividend investor. Cisco yields 2.9%. That's why you buy the stock.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Cisco Systems Inc.

"etwork security company  's (NASDAQ: CHKP) recent first-quarter earnings report was slightly disappointing, but it's what management said about future execution challenges and opportunities that really counts. The company, and the IT security market in general, is going through a period of change. Here's the lowdown.Starting with the headline numbers from the quarter:Image source: Getty Images.As you can see above, it was a satisfactory result for the quarter, but management was moved to cut its full-year 2018 guidance.The reduction in full-year revenue and earnings guidance is due to the changes Check Point is making in its sales operation, according to comments from CEO Gil Shwed on the  with analysts. Let's take a closer look at what he's talking about.The issue of sales execution, notably in the U.S.,  in the third quarter of 2017 with Shwed then outlining how restructuring the Americas region sales operation caused him to be cautious about near-term execution and give disappointing guidance.Fast-forward to the fourth quarter (revenue only came in at the midpoint of guidance) and  its second quarter in a row of declining sales in the Americas. It wasn't much better in the first quarter -- Americas region sales barely rose in the quarter, and Shwed outlined how changing the sales execution was taking longer than he'd hoped.The impact on Check Point's sales growth in the last few quarters can be seen in the chart below.Data source: Check Point Software Technologies presentations. Chart by author.Shwed outlined that the increasing sophistication of cyberattacks means many potential customers aren't ready to implement what Shwed calls fifth-generation security solutions.On the , he suggested that most IT middle managers are focused on second-generation threats (which try to penetrate the network) and third-generation threats (which try to exploiting application vulnerabilities in the network). However, there are fourth-generation and fifth-generation threats that are hidden in network traffic and often disguised as content files -- delivery often uses the cloud or mobile.Fifth-generation threats require a holistic approach to security architecture, and the kind of unified security platform that usually requires higher level executives to purchase. According to Shwed on the , ""CISOs [chief information security officers], CIOs [chief information officers], and others have the ability to see the bigger picture and update their overall security architecture to fifth-generation protection.""As anyone who's ever worked in sales will tell you, it's a lot harder and more time-consuming to get hold of a higher-level executive and convince them of the merits of a significant strategic investment than it is to sell a simple solution to a middle manager. ""We're asking them to learn new sales techniques, reach much higher in the organization and learn new tactics in approaching new customers and opportunities,"" Shwed said.The company needs to transition its U.S. sales force toward selling its new generation of security products. Shwed argues that it's mainly an issue of its sales people starting to approach people ""higher in the organization."" Investors will be looking to monitor progress on this front in the coming quarters.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

hares of cybersecurity outfit  (NASDAQ: CHKP) have been underperforming for the past year. As cyberattacks have gained notoriety, lots of competition has cropped up and taken a bite out of the company's market share. Even with an attractive valuation, it may not be time yet for investors to double down on Check Point as the business gets serious about marketing new security tools.During the first quarter of 2018, Check Point's revenue only rose 4% year over year. Meanwhile, younger competitor  (NYSE: PANW)  with aggressive marketing and newer technology.Data by  .The silver lining here is that the better-established Check Point is a profitable company, whereas upstarts like Palo Alto Networks are not. In spite of lackluster revenue, Check Point's earnings per share increased 7% year over year, helped by the company's share repurchase program. A switch to cloud-based recurring revenue streams has also been under way, which is helping push down the cost of sales and enabling more investment into research and marketing. Security subscription revenue grew 14% last quarter and represented only 28% of total revenue, so there is much that can be improved on here.To that end, Check Point launched a new holistic  security offering that helps organizations stay secure against older types of threats as well as newer, more complex attacks all in a single package. Management said many of its smaller competitors only protect against niche threats, something it views as inferior to its offering. Because of the scope of coverage, Gen V deals are bigger and income from them typically lasts longer, but they are also slower to ink.Image source: Getty Images.Because of sluggish growth, investors have lost enthusiasm for the stock. After months of declines that started during the summer of 2017, its trailing price-to-earnings ratio sits at 20. Price to free cash flow, which adjusts earnings to only reflect money left over after basic operations are paid for, is a lowly 13.9. With the cybersecurity industry growing and Check Point launching new product and sales campaigns, that makes the stock look like a pretty cheap buy.While Check Point is executing on a turnaround that could lead to stronger growth, it might be too soon to get greedy. Management was pleased with its early progress, but admitted that pushing its new solutions and retraining its sales force is taking longer than it would like. Thus, full-year 2018 revenue guidance was downgraded to $1.85 billion to $1.93 billion from an estimate of $1.9 billion to $2.0 billion. That would be flat to a 4% increase over 2017, hardly the sales momentum investors may have been looking for. Adjusted earnings are expected to be 2% to 8% higher, a big slowdown from the 13% gain last year.Shares look cheap, but with both the top and bottom lines decelerating, there could be further declines. I am waiting to see if the recent trend continues to deteriorate and pushesCheck Point's revenue into contraction. If it reverses and sales accelerate again, I'm a buyer. But until the cybersecurity company can recapture sales growth and start pushing back against its newer competition, getting greedy doesn't seem like the right move.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

In this episode of ETF Spotlight, I talked with Steven Schoenfeld, founder and CIO at BlueStar Indexes. Steven is an expert in Israeli stock market. We discussed Israel's booming tech sector and the BlueStar Israel Technology ETF  that focuses on Israeli tech companies.Israel has more than 90 companies listed on the Nasdaq. Big tech giants have many R&D centers located in the country. In particular, Israeli companies are leaders in cybersecurity and autonomous vehicles technologies.Steven explained how such a small country with a population of about 9 million, became a high-tech hub.Given Israel's location, geopolitical risks remain high. We discussed how Israeli companies continue to thrive despite challenges.We then talked about the index, which includes tech companies listed in Israel as well as globally. Steven described how companies are selected and weighted in the index.The ETF holds some well-known companies like Check Point  , Amdocs  , Nice  , and CyberArk  . These companies are very global in their operations and there are some that are focused on the domestic market.Many US investors have a lot of exposure to US tech and the sector has delivered excellent performance over the past few years. But now there are concerns about increased regulatory oversight and stretched valuations.Steven explained why investors should take a look at this ETF given very low representation of Israeli tech stocks in broader tech indexes.We also talked about BlueStar's indexes in Israel that are increasingly being used by domestic investors, and why that is relevant for ITEQ.To learn more about this ETF, please visit And please visit the ETF section of zacks.com for more information on this ETF and other ETFs.Please make sure to tune in for our next podcast.

ooking today at week-over-week shares outstanding changes among the universe of ETFs covered at  , one standout is the iShares MSCI EAFE ETF (Symbol: EFA) where we have detected an approximate $84.6 million dollar outflow -- that's a 0.1% decrease week over week (from 1,105,200,000 to 1,104,000,000). Among the largest underlying components of EFA, in trading today Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (Symbol: TEVA) is down about 0.3%, Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd. (Symbol: CHKP) is up about 2.2%, and Coca-Cola European Partners plc (Symbol: CCE) is lower by about 0.3%.  The chart below shows the one year price performance of EFA, versus its 200 day moving average:Looking at the chart above, EFA's low point in its 52 week range is $63.75 per share, with $75.27 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $70.78. Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@EFA, TEVA, CHKP, CCE: ETF Outflow Alert@2018-04-26@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/efa-teva-chkp-cce-etf-outflow-alert-2018-04-26

"aintaining its earnings streak,  once again reported better-than-expected bottom-line result for first-quarter 2018. The company's non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.30 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.28 and came in line with the mid-point of management's guided range of $1.25-$1.35 (mid-point $1.30). Non-GAAP earnings also climbed 8.3% on a year-over-year basis, driven mainly by higher sales, reduced cost of revenues and a lower share count, partially offset by higher operating expenses.Despite this, shares of Check Point depreciated more than 6% yesterday as first-quarter revenues, as well as top-line outlook for the second quarter fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Notably, the stock has underperformed its  in the year-to-date period. The industry has recorded growth of 20.2% during the period, while Check Point lost 7% of its value.First-quarter revenues came in at $452.3 million, up approximately 4% year over year. The revenue figure marginally came in above the mid-point of the company's guidance of $440-$460 million (mid-point $450 million). However, revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $452 million.The company's statement during the first-quarter  hints that the U.S. sales force, which has undergone a significant change, is yet to attain its full potential, and this has affected overall sales growth. Notably, the company generates approximately 45% of its total revenues from the Americas.However, Check Point noted that its Infinity platform continues to register strong adoption among customers.Geographically, the Americas region generated 47% of the total revenues, Europe accounted for 37% of total revenues, while the Asia Pacific, Japan, and the Middle East and Africa accounted for the remaining 17%.Segment wise, the company witnessed sales growth of 3% in Product and Security Subscriptions, and 5% in Software Updates and Maintenance. The company also reported 14% jump in subscription revenues at Software Blades.Talking about deal size, the number of new customers - who signed deals worth $1 million or more -totaled 44. Also, customers, who signed deals worth $50,000 and more, contributed 71% to the total order value, which is equal to the first-quarter 2017 tally.On a year-over-year basis, non-GAAP gross profit climbed 5.7% to $409.4 million. As a percentage of revenues, gross profit expanded 160 basis points (bps) to 90.5% ""mainly as a result of changes in the mix of revenues and products.""Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 10.5% year over year to $170.4 million. As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses advanced 230 bps to 37.7%.Non-GAAP operating income came in at $239 million, up nearly 2.5% year over year. However, margins shrunk 70 bps to 52.8% as benefits from higher gross margin were more than offset by elevated operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues.Non-GAAP net income was $209.9 million or $1.30 per share, up from $201.5 million or $1.20 reported in the year-earlier quarter.Check Point exited the first quarter with cash balances of approximately $4 billion, up from $3.8 billion recorded at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017. In addition to this, during the reported quarter, the company generated cash worth $355 million from operational activities - marking an 18% year-over-year improvement. The robust growth in operating cash flow is primarily attributable to a tax refund of $45 million related to the prior year. Excluding this, operating cash flow increased 5%. Additionally, Check Point repurchased about 2.4 million shares for a total cost of $249 million in the quarter.Taking into account the ongoing challenges related with the U.S. sales force, the company provided outlook for the second quarter and updated full-year 2018 guidance. Notably, Check Point's revenues and earnings guidance for both periods remained below Zacks expectations.For the second quarter, the company expects to generate revenues between $445 million and $475 million (mid-point $460 million). The mid-point of the guidance is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $478.7 million. Non-GAAP earnings are projected at $1.25-$1.35 per share. GAAP earnings per share are anticipated to be 15 cents lesser than the non-GAAP figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.36.For the current year, Check Point now anticipates generating revenues between $1.85 billion and $1.93 billion (mid-point $1.89 billion), down from the previous guidance of $1.9-$2.0 billion. The guided range is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.95 billion. Non-GAAP earnings are now projected in the band of $5.45-$5.75 per share (mid-point $5.60), down from the previous range of $5.50-$5.90. GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be 62 cents lesser than the non-GAAP figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $5.74.Check Point's ongoing issues related with the changes it made in its U.S. sales force makes us skeptical about the company's near-term performance. It looks like the recently-joined people are taking more-than-expected time for reaching their full potential. The same is reflected in the company's outlook too. Although the issue is temporary, it is wise to wait and watch right now until we get some clear visibility on the company's sales-force execution in the United States.The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Mellanox Technologies, Ltd.  , Fortinet, Inc.  and Varonis Systems, Inc.  .

One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.In trading on Wednesday, shares of Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd.

By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) is 40.0.

" (NASDAQ: CHKP) plies its trade in the fast-growing cybersecurity market -- a market that's expected to hit $96 billion in revenue this year, an increase of 8% over 2017, according to  's estimates. However, one look at the cybersecurity specialist's recent performance indicates that it hasn't been able to capitalize on that vast potential.For instance, Check Point's  year over year during the quarter that ended in Dec. 2017. This was a result of several factors, including a reduction in product and license revenue, and continued weakness in the American market. The company has altered its sales and marketing strategy to better contend with rivals in this highly competitive space, but the changes will need time before delivering results.However, investors' patience could pay off in the long run -- there's a lot to like about Check Point's business that could help get its growth back on track.Image source: Getty ImagesCheck Point Software has a robust balance sheet with a cash position of $1.41 billion and no debt. Additionally, it generated just over $1 billion in free cash flow in fiscal 2017. So Check Point has solid financial muscle, and it can even access the debt markets if it needs more money to boost sales through marketing or product development.Another factor that will play in Check Point's favor is its superior margin profile as compared to its industry peers.
  
Data Source: Yahoo! Finance, TTM = trailing twelve monthsAs such, it can afford to market its services more aggressively by way of discounts or other freebies in a bid to increase sales and capture a greater portion of the cybersecurity market. Fortunately, Check Point seems to have realized that it needs to boost its marketing spend, so it enhanced the same by 3% last fiscal year.This wouldn't move the needle much, as rival Palo Alto increased its sales and marketing expenses by 17% during the first half of the fiscal year. However, given Check Point's solid financial resources, it won't be surprising if it decides to step on the gas and give its marketing team more money to play with.In fact, Check Point recently admitted that it will follow a more aggressive marketing plan this fiscal year, but investors shouldn't expect any quick gains. The new plan will need some time before bearing fruit.I have already mentioned that Check Point has a really strong margin profile when compared to rivals. Looking ahead, its margins could keep improving thanks to the growing contribution of the subscription business.Now, it costs less to service and retain a subscription customer than acquire a new one, so the increase in the number of subscription customers bodes well for Check Point. The good news -- the company's subscription-based revenue has started gaining critical mass, as evident from the 18% revenue jump from this segment last quarter. This was driven by an increase in the average transaction size, with the number of $1 million-plus customers increasing 11% year over year to 110.What's more, subscriptions and the software updates businesses together supply 67% of Check Point's total revenue. So there's a lot of room for growth over here that should boost the company's bottom line, driven by the increase in the deal size and a potential increase in the number of subscription customers.Check Point Software's impressive valuation makes it a solid pick for investors looking to get into the cybersecurity space without paying too much. The stock's  (P/E) ratio of 21x is substantially lower than the industry's more than 100x multiple. Meanwhile, the forward P/E ratio of 17x is an indicator of bottom-line growth.At this valuation, Check Point Software looks like a good bet considering analysts expect its earnings to grow at a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of almost 10% for the next five years. However, it won't be surprising if Check Point logs stronger growth by enhancing its marketing spend to attract more customers and develop a bigger contribution from the subscription business.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

" is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 25. The question lingering on investors' minds is whether this provider of information technology (IT) security solutions can deliver a positive surprise.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4.6%. Notably, Check Point Software has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 3.6%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Check Point continues to gain from strong demand for its cyber security solutions. Rapid adoption of Check Point's data-center appliances and continued enhancement in data-center product lines are anticipated to provide adequate support to revenue growth.Notably, during the soon-to-be-reported quarter, the company unveiled three new types of ""Smart-1 security management appliances"" meant for Gen V (5th generation) cyber protection. Check Point also announced the ""CloudGuard product family"" targeting Gen V cyber threats.Additionally, the company collaborated with Orange Cyberdefense. Per the agreement, Check Point Sandblast Mobile technology will be used for the development of Orange Mobile Threat Protection.However, ongoing issues related to the changes it made in its U.S. sales force makes us skeptical about the company's near-term performance. Per management, its fourth-quarter revenues were hurt by significant changes made in U.S. sales force that has not yet reached full potential. This might continue to affect financials for some time now. | According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive  . Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) are best avoided.Check Point has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of -0.69%. This indicates that the company is unlikely to beat estimates.

"hares of cybersecurity company  (NASDAQ: FEYE) have struggled since going public back in 2013. The stock has been cut in half from its debut price in spite of the fact that its revenue has doubled several times during that same period. It looks like a great growth story waiting to happen, but there are a few factors cautious investors should weigh first.FireEye, valued at only $3.5 billion, is a small company in the fast-growing cybersecurity industry. With the rising need for businesses to keep their digital assets secure, FireEye has been investing for growth at the expense of the bottom line.
  
Chart by author. Data source: FireEye quarterly earnings.FireEye's spending spree on R&D and S&M has pushed the company into the red, but those efforts paid off early on with big revenue increases. Losses in the short term are acceptable as long as the company has something to show for it, but that's been the problem lately. Sales have sputtered to annual single-digit growth, causing the stock to plummet.The cybersecurity industry is growing, but  is viewed as more of an add-on to a company's existing threat-detection system rather than a comprehensive plan. As a result, some of its larger peers like  (NYSE: PANW) ,  (NYSE: JNPR) , and tech giant  (NASDAQ: CSCO) have fared much better the last few years. In response to its slowdown, FireEye has begun offering  and features to create a more well-rounded menu for its customers. Image source: Getty Images.Additional risks arise with this strategy, though, especially as FireEye begins to compete more directly with other cybersecurity companies. The good news is that revenue growth accelerated to 10% year over year in the last reported quarter. Management thinks that 2018 sales will be $815 million to $825 million, at least a 10% annual increase. That pales in comparison to growth a few years back, but it's nevertheless an improvement over the last 12 months, if those numbers transpire as forecast.Expenses on R&D and marketing are being trimmed, too, bringing profitability a little closer. Losses in 2017 were $1.71 per share compared with $2.94 the year prior. Management again struck an upbeat tone for 2018 as it expects losses to continue decreasing.So, does FireEye have the potential to make investors lots of money? Maybe, but a shift in strategy to reach more potential customers is still unproven. Though cybersecurity is in high demand and likely to stay that way for some time, FireEye's current growth trajectory is underwhelming and lagging behind the competition.For investors looking for a cybersecurity stock, I think a bigger security company like Palo Alto Networks or  (NASDAQ: CHKP) would be a better option. At this juncture, I think FireEye's high expenditures and sluggish revenue growth outweigh the potential benefits of buying the stock.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

" recently announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Israel-based automated endpoint security provider, Secdo. Subject to customary closing conditions, the buyout is expected to complete in the acquirer's third-quarter of fiscal 2018. Terms of the deal were kept under wraps.Particularly, Palo Alto's chairman and CEO, Mark McLaughlin, was optimistic about the ""endpoint detection and response, or EDR, capabilities"" that are expected to enhance the company's solutions portfolio, once the integration is completed.Also, Secdo's unique ""thread-level approach"" of collecting and visualizing data provides better clarity, which optimizes the efficiency level of responding against cyber attacks. Furthermore, the company's engineers are anticipated to enrich Palo Alto's talent pool.We note that this is the company's second acquisition announcement within a month. Prior to this, Palo Alto had acquired Evident.io - a public could security provider - in an all-cash transaction worth $300 million in mid-March.In fact, the company has been strengthening its product portfolio via inorganic additions since a very long time. Over the last few years, Palo Alto has acquired entities like LightCyber, Cyvera and CirroSecure. These acquisition synergies have proved conducive to the company's top line, which jumped 28% year over year to $542.4 million, in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. | Apart from acquisition, new product launches and increasing adoption of the company's next-generation security platforms are beneficial for the company. Customer wins coupled with expansion of the existing customer base are added positives.Moreover, Palo Alto's strategic partnerships with the likes of VMware, Splunk and Citrix are encouraging. The company's focus on selling a higher percentage of subscription-based services is also helping it to generate stable revenues while expanding margins.Per a report by MarketsandMarkets, the cybersecurity market is expected to reach $231.94 billion by 2022. Going ahead, we expect Palo Alto to grab the growth opportunity to its fullest, courtesy of its wide range of solutions portfolio.However, stiff competition from industry peers like Check Point Software  , Cisco Systems  , and Juniper Networks  remains a concern for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company.You can see Zacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

 has an impressive earnings surprise history, having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 3.6%.With expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 9.7% and a market cap of $16.1 billion, it seems to be a stock that investors need to hold on to if they are looking to reap long-term gains.Let's take a look at the factors aiding the company's performance.Check Point's information technology (IT) security solutions have been experiencing rapid adoption. This is evident from the company's impressive top-line performance in fourth-quarter 2017. Revenues in the quarter came in at $506 million, up 4% year over year and marginally above the mid-point of the company's guidance of $485-$525 million (mid-point $505 million). | Also, management was particularly positive about the performance of Infinity platform, which was launched in the third quarter. Talking about deal size, the number of new customers - who signed deals worth $1 million or more - totaled 110, up 11% from the year-ago quarter.We believe a better control on spending has kept Check Point consistently profitable when compared to its peers like Palo Alto Networks  , Fortinet  and Cisco  . Notably, the company spends only a quarter of its revenues toward sales and marketing while its peers spend about 40-60% of the same. This makes a huge difference as with just a 6.5% rise in revenues Check Point's non-GAAP EPS grew 13% in 2017.Meanwhile, Check Point's ongoing issues related to the changes it made in its U.S. sales force makes us skeptical about the company's near-term performance. Per management, its fourth-quarter revenues have been hurt by significant changes made in the U.S. sales force that has not yet reached full potential.However, this seems to be a temporary issue. Given its wide range of cyber security solutions, Check Point is likely to make the most of growth opportunity in the global threat intelligence market, which, per Grand View Research, is expected to reach $12.6 by 2025 with a CAGR of 17.4% through 2017 to 2025.Check Point has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

"Did you ever notice that people generally don't think about cybersecurity stocks to buy except when a big company has been hacked or a key government installation has been compromised?Said to be a $100 billion industry on an annual basis, it takes something along the lines of what  (NASDAQ:  ) is currently going through for most investors to consider the consequences of a connected world where information and data flow relatively easily without too much oversight.My brother is a computer geek and he regularly warns me about the cybersecurity threats out there. I've personally avoided several online products and services simply because it was questionable whether my privacy would be protected.I'm not paranoid or anything, but it does make you wonder when a company as large as Facebook isn't able to protect its users' information from unscrupulous third parties.The following seven cybersecurity stocks to buy provide investors with an opportunity to profit from the very real threats happening in the cloud-based world we live in.Last July, I called  (NASDAQ:  ) one of ""The 10 Best Investments for the Next Decade."" My reasoning was simple: Cybersecurity is a huge deal for Fortune 100 companies that store a lot of information and data in the cloud.""Estimates put the annual cost of cyber attacks to the U.S. economy at $100 billion, or 0.64% of America's GDP,"" I  . ""That might not seem like a lot … until you consider that it costs the country 500,000 jobs annually. That's a lot of people removed from the economy simply because of insufficient cybersecurity. And it's only going to get worse.""Since then, CYBR stock is up 17%, but that's not what I'm excited about.No, what gets me juiced about Cyberark's future is what Bank of America analyst Daniel Bartus recently said about the company's Privileged Account Management (PAM) product, which helps keep out undesirables from a company's most important information and data.By 2020, Bartus suggests  of large enterprises will be using some kind of PAM product, up from 45% today. He expects Cyberark to be a big part of that growth - and so do I.Also based in Israel,  (NASDAQ:  ) is one of the big players in firewalls, a critical component to any business's cybersecurity protection.It's not a big grower by any means, but if you're looking for stability in your cybersecurity stocks, Check Point provides that in spades.In fiscal 2017, Check Point's revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share grew by  and 13%, respectively to $1.9 billion and $5.33 a share. Its operating cash flow in the past year was $1.1 billion, an 18% increase over a year earlier. It has no debt and $3.8 billion in cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet.As anyone who follows the tech industry knows, the business is moving to a subscription-based model as opposed to a product-driven one; in fiscal 2017, CHKP grew its subscription revenue by 23% to $480 million or 44% of its overall revenue. Five years ago, it was just  of revenue.So, despite only growing overall revenue by 7% year-over-year, it's routinely able to deliver double-digit earnings growth as it grows subscription revenues. It's a winning model.I have quite the history with  (NASDAQ:  ) stock.First, I  in January 2017, that FEYE stock would never make it back to $20 - at the time it was trading around $13, falling from over $80 just three years earlier - but softened my stance thanks to an email from an employee who got me to look at the bigger picture.A few months later in June 2017, I presented a more optimistic picture of the cybersecurity stock.""It certainly is headed in the right direction. The question is whether it's growing fast enough to merit a $20 valuation,"" I  . ""I'm not convinced FEYE is there yet, but unless the company has a real stinker of a quarter in fiscal 2017 or the tech correction turns into a meltdown, I see a better-than-50/50 chance of hitting $20 within the next 12 months.""A couple of months after that I suggested that hitting $20 wasn't going to happen in 2017, which it didn't, hitting a high of $18 in October. I really felt like the company needed to demonstrate that it could continue to grow its subscription revenues, overall gross margins and show that it was cutting its operating expenses.In fiscal 2017, it grew subscription revenues by  , gross profit margins by 230 basis points to 64.2% and lowered its operating expenses by 16% or $146 million.Not surprisingly, it went from negative operating cash flow to positive in 2017.Next stop, $30?One look at the solutions  (NASDAQ:  ) provides and it's easy to see why its stock's gained 518%, since it went public at  in April 2012. Back then it had 4,800 customers using its data analytics and security platform; today, that's well over  , including 85% of the Fortune 100.At the end of 2017,  (NASDAQ:  ) announced it was acquiring Shazam, a music app that allows users to enjoy a deeper content experience, for  . That's peanuts for Apple, but for Shazam, the tie-up allows it to use more of Splunk's products to be the best music app it can be.By multiplying that usefulness over 14,000 customers, Splunk was able to grow its revenues and free cash flow by  and 55% respectively in 2017.

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the PowerShares Dynamic Networking Portfolio ETF (Symbol: PXQ), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $54.64 per unit.With PXQ trading at a recent price near $49.71 per unit, that means that analysts see 9.91% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of PXQ's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are ARRIS International PLC (Symbol: ARRS), Imperva Inc (Symbol: IMPV), and Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd. (Symbol: CHKP). Although ARRS has traded at a recent price of $26.67/share, the average analyst target is 28.89% higher at $34.38/share. Similarly, IMPV has 14.00% upside from the recent share price of $44.65 if the average analyst target price of $50.90/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting CHKP to reach a target price of $111.97/share, which is 12.69% above the recent price of $99.36. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of ARRS, IMPV, and CHKP:Combined, ARRS, IMPV, and CHKP represent 9.92% of the PowerShares Dynamic Networking Portfolio ETF.

Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past.

The company reported fourth-quarter revenues of $202.3 million, which increased 9.5% year over year and outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $194 million. | Apart from innovations, inorganic growth also aided the enrichment of the solutions suite. In January, the company announced the acquisition of X15 Software with an aim to incorporate the latter's Big Data platform to its security solutions against cyber attacks. With the incremental usage of Big Data and machine learning in cyber security, this acquisition is expected to be beneficial for the company going ahead.Notably, the company is gaining from a business model shift from product based to subscription based, improved operational efficiency and sales productivity, as well as healthy demand for intelligence-led security products.However, a shorter contract length is likely to adversely impact the company's near-term top-line performance. But margins are likely to improve. Stiff competition from other well-established players such as Check Point Software  and Fortinet  in the cyber security space is a major headwind for the company.FireEye carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the same industry space is Paycom Software, Inc.  , sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see Long-term expected EPS growth rate for Paycom is projected to be 25.8%Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

"hares of  (NYSE: PANW) have surged nearly 60% over the past 12 months, fueled by four straight quarters of big earnings beats. That crushed the 25% return of the  (NYSEMKT: HACK) , a commonly used benchmark of the cybersecurity market.But after that big run, is it too late to invest in this next-gen firewall provider? Let's examine the bull and bear cases to find out.Image source: Getty Images.Palo Alto serves more than 48,000 customers in more than 150 countries -- including over 85% and 63% of the Fortune 100 and Global 2000 companies, respectively. Gartner has named it an enterprise firewall market leader for the past six years.That best-in-breed reputation indicates that Palo Alto is well poised to profit from surging demand for cybersecurity solutions worldwide. Its revenue rose 28% in 2017, outpacing the rest of the industry, and analysts expect 26% growth this year.Although Palo Alto is best known for its next-gen firewall, it also upsells new products -- like its hybrid cloud software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform -- that boost its overall revenue per customer. This ""land-and-expand"" model widens Palo Alto's moat against bigger rivals like  (NASDAQ: CSCO) , which bundles cybersecurity solutions with its networking hardware and software.Palo Alto is also profitable on a non-GAAP basis. Its non-GAAP earnings climbed 43% last year, and Wall Street anticipates another 43% growth this year. Based on that estimate, its forward P/E of 49 still looks surprisingly reasonable. It finished last quarter with $915 million in cash and equivalents, which is a comfortable cash cushion for launching new products or acquiring smaller companies.The bears will point out that Palo Alto is actually deeply unprofitable on a GAAP basis, due to high stock-based compensation (SBC) expenses. Here's how much money Palo Alto actually lost over the past four quarters, with SBC expenses factored back in.
  
Data source: Palo Alto Networks quarterly reports.In other words, Palo Alto spent 25% of its revenue on SBC expenses last quarter. If it had simply cut that figure in half, it would have reported a GAAP profit.Image source: Getty Images.Palo Alto spends so much money on SBC expenses because it's based in Silicon Valley, which has a cutthroat job market and high living costs. Palo Alto doesn't have enough cash to pay competitive salaries, so it pads its salaries with big stock bonuses. That's a classic strategy for younger tech companies, but Palo Alto was founded 13 years ago.Comparable cybersecurity companies based in  markets don't have this problem. Israeli firewall provider  (NASDAQ: CHKP) ,  by both non-GAAP and GAAP measures, spent just 5% of its revenue on SBC expenses last year.If we accept the fact that Palo Alto is unprofitable, the stock looks pricey at nine times sales -- which is higher than the industry average of seven for application software makers. Meanwhile, competitors like Cisco -- which can undercut Palo Alto to gain market share -- remain a threat to long-term growth.I think Palo Alto's best days are still ahead of it. Its best-in-breed reputation in firewalls, the expansion of its firewall into a cloud-based security platform, and the surging number of  worldwide should all bolster its top-line growth for the foreseeable future.Those strengths outweigh its weaknesses, and indicate that Palo Alto could still have a lot more room to run.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

alo Alto Networks () will report second quarter fiscal 2018 earnings results after Monday’s closing bell. And with the cybersecurity market projected to soar in 2018, according to research firm, Gartner, Palo Alto is seen as one of the best ways to play that growth.As corporations heighten their  and implement solutions to fight off hackers and malware, Gartner estimates global enterprise cybersecurity spending will rise 8% this year, reaching $96.3 billion. Palo Alto’s next-generation security platforms, which (among other features) enables enterprises to identify network traffic by application, user and content, is gaining traction.These innovative security tools puts more threat-prevention controls in the hands of companies by offering in-depth visibility into all forms of traffic and applications on their network. As such, not only can companies control network usage, they can better assess security risks at the user level by content or by the application. The question is, can Palo Alto gain enough market share from competitors such as Cisco (), Check Point () and Fortinet () to make its share price more attractive?For the three months that ended January, Wall Street expects the California-based company to deliver adjusted earnings per share of 79 cents, which would rise 25% year over year, while revenue of $524.82 million would rise 24% year over year. For the full year, ending July, earnings are projected to rise 25.4% year over year to $3.40 per share, while full-year revenue of $2.17 billion would rise 23.2% year over year.Beyond the top- and bottom-line numbers, on Monday investors will want to see two things: First, that the company’s remarkable turnaround, particularly after a difficult start in 2017, has more upside. Secondly, in light of Gartner’s growth estimates, Palo Alto, thanks to strong customer gains on a back of an improved sales strategy, will increase its 2018 guidance as it has done in the previous two quarters.Analysts will look for a strong “billings,” which, in the software subscription business, underscores the strength of future revenue. In the first quarter, deferred revenue surged 37% to $1.9 billion, surpassing the 27% increase in revenue. Assuming Palo Alto was able to convert deferred revenue totals to actuals, it can easily beat this quarter’s top-line totals. And with better margins, the bottom-line should also see a boost.Elsewhere, the company, over the past couple of years, has invested heavily in its cloud-based subscription offering, launching services such as Traps, WildFire and AutoFocus. In Q1 Palo Alto, which now has more than 45,000 global clients, added more than 2,500 new customers. On Monday, investors will want to see the rate of adoption among organizations continue to trend higher.PANW stock closed Friday at $165.54, up 2.2%. The stock is up 14.21% year to date, besting the 2.71% rise in the S&P 500 index. I’ve been covering this stock for some time, including  when it traded at $117 in May 2017, which has since returned 40%. And given that the company’s fundamentals have only improved since my last buy recommendation, I’ve decided to take my own advice and buy the stock ahead of Monday’s results.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Palo Alto Networks (PANW) 2nd Quarter Earnings: What to Expect@2018-02-26@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/palo-alto-networks-panw-2nd-quarter-earnings-what-expect-2018-02-26

"nvestors in Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd. (Symbol: CHKP) saw new options begin trading today, for the May 18th expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 91 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CHKP options chain for the new May 18th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $100.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.90. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $100.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $97.10 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CHKP, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $103.04/share today.Because the $100.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 100%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.90% return on the cash commitment, or 11.64% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd. , and highlighting in green where the $100.00 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $105.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.50. If an investor was to purchase shares of CHKP stock at the current price level of $103.04/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $105.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.30% if the stock gets called away at the May 18th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CHKP shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd. , as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing CHKP's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $105.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $105.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@IEFA, TEVA, CHKP, MLCO: Large Inflows Detected at ETF@2018-02-20@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/iefa-teva-chkp-mlco-large-inflows-detected-etf-2018-02-20

 (NASDAQ: CHKP)  that it isn't losing ground in the cybersecurity market, but its latest set of results indicates otherwise. The cybersecurity specialist  Wall Street's revenue expectations during the fourth quarter, reporting its slowest top-line growth in the past five years.Check Point is facing execution challenges in the U.S., where its revenue has been declining for the past two quarters despite efforts to reorganize its sales force. The company believes that the reorganization will take time to deliver, raising a red flag for investors, as rivals such as  and  are moving at a greater pace to tap the fast-growing cybersecurity market.Palo Alto's revenue  last quarter. Meanwhile, Cisco's cybersecurity business is its fastest-growing segment, reporting 14% year-over-year growth in the last-reported quarter.Image Source: Getty Images.On the other hand, Check Point's guidance turned out to be a big disappointment, representing a stark slowdown in revenue growth. The company's revenue guidance range of $440 million to $460 million and the adjusted earnings per share range of $1.25 to $1.30 are well below the consensus estimates. Wall Street was originally expecting $1.32 per share in earnings on revenue of $462 million.The full-year forecast was also disappointing, indicating that Check Point's top line will grow just a shade over 5% in fiscal 2018, down from the 6.3% growth seen in 2017. This is alarming when you consider that overall cybersecurity spending is expected to rise at least 8% this year, according to  .So Check Point's quarterly results and the accompanying guidance don't inspire any confidence. But there were some positives that could keep investors interested in the company.Check Point reported solid bottom-line growth once again. The company's net income jumped close to 8% last quarter, outpacing the top-line growth as it managed to keep costs under control. In fact, the company's spending on sales and marketing dropped almost 9% year over year thanks to the growing contribution of subscription revenue to its top line.Check Point's subscription-based revenue increased 18% year over year to $130 million, while software updates and maintenance revenue jumped 5.6%. With the company's subscription revenue growing at a decent pace, this implies that the updates and maintenance business will gain momentum as Check Point sells more subscriptions.The increase in subscription sales also led to an improvement in Check Point's deferred revenue base.  is the amount collected by a company in advance for services to be provided later, and it is recognized on the income statement when the actual delivery takes place. So the year-over-year increase in deferred revenue indicates that Check Point has been signing up more subscription customers, which will contribute to its long-term growth.Check Point provided proof about the upswing in its business when it revealed that the number of deals of $1 million or more increased 11% in the latest quarter. This increase in large deals should help Check Point improve its margin profile in the future -- it costs less to retain existing subscription customers than it does to acquire new ones.Investors might miss all these positive takeaways from Check Point Software's latest quarterly report in light of its slowing top-line growth.Check Point's recent quarterly report is giving out mixed signals. Its revenue growth is slowing because of execution challenges in a crucial market such as the Americas, which supplies 45% of its total revenue, but disciplined cost management is having a positive impact on margins and earnings.Additionally, Check Point's deal activity is gaining pace, as shown by the number of large transactions it struck last quarter. So, conservative investors looking to get into a cybersecurity stock on the cheap can definitely consider Check Point, as it trades at a forward earnings multiple of just 18 as compared to the extremely high industry average of 148.But investors with a higher risk profile looking for a more aggressive cybersecurity play will be better off looking elsewhere as Check Point has a few challenging quarters ahead of it. The company is doing well right now by keeping costs low, but it needs to put some life into its revenue -- you can't cut costs forever to boost earnings.In the highly competitive cybersecurity market, Check Point needs to loosen its purse strings and become more aggressive with its sales and marketing strategy to keep pace with rivals. Check Point is quite capable of doing that given its strong cash position of $1.5 billion and no debt, though investors will need to be patient before its strategies start bearing fruit.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

he global cybersecurity market is expected to boom in the coming years as organizations and governments scramble to protect sensitive data and systems from ever-evolving threats. According to one estimate, global cybersecurity spending will increase from $135 billion last year to more than $202 billion in 2021, a 50% increase.There are quite a few cybersecurity specialists for investors looking to take advantage of this burgeoning market, but one of them stands tall above the rest:  (NASDAQ: CSCO) . You might argue that Cisco isn't a pure-play cybersecurity company because its primary business is selling networking equipment such as routers and switches. But that is what separates Cisco from the rest of the field, and a closer look at the performance and size of its security business will make clear why it is one of the best bets in this space.Image Source: Getty Images.Cisco's quarterly revenue rose for the first time in over two years in the recently reported second quarter. The 3% year-over-year increase was partly due to the growing contribution from the company's subscription business.This impressive performance sent the stock to a 17-year high. The company's turnaround wouldn't have been possible without the strong contribution from cybersecurity, which was one of Cisco's fastest-growing businesses last quarter, clocking 6% year-over-year growth. And this segment has grown 7% in the first six months of the current fiscal year, outpacing the overall growth in the company's revenue.Security might not be a big part of Cisco's overall business at present; it supplied just 4.8% of total revenue during the first six months of the fiscal year. But its $1.14 billion in cybersecurity revenue during this period easily eclipses pure-play rivals such as  ,  (NYSE: PANW) , and  . data by In fact, Cisco's half-yearly cybersecurity revenue exceeds FireEye's trailing-12-month revenue by a wide margin. And Cisco's annual amount should exceed Check Point's and Palo Alto's top line since it remains firmly on track to achieve more than $2 billion in revenue from this segment this fiscal year.What's more, the growth of Cisco's cybersecurity business is also boosting its recurring revenue. The company's recurring revenue increased 2 percentage points year over year during the fourth quarter to 33%, thanks largely to the massive jump in subscriptions for security services. More specifically, Cisco's deferred revenue increased 38% last quarter, and management attributed this to an increase in sales of software subscriptions. is the revenue collected by a company for services that will be provided at a future date, and it will be recognized on the balance sheet when the actual delivery happens. So, the rapid rise in deferred revenue is good news for Cisco as it points toward stronger top-line growth in the future.The rising contribution from recurring sources of revenue is also good news because it should indicate rising margins. Ideally, it costs less to service an existing subscription customer than it does to acquire a new one. So as customer acquisition costs fall, margins will rise.The increasing tilt toward subscription-based services is already boosting the company's gross margin. Last quarter, Cisco's gross margin increased 230 basis points year over year.Cisco's rapid deferred-revenue growth also eclipses its rivals'.For instance, Check Point Software's latest quarterly report showed that its deferred revenue increased just 11% year over year. FireEye's deferred revenue increased just 2.6% year over year during the quarter including December. Palo Alto is yet to release its latest results, but it was the only one to have posted respectable deferred-revenue growth (37%) during its last reported quarter.However, Palo Alto's aggressive marketing means that it is still a loss-making entity. The company's net loss in the recently reported quarter increased 12.4% year over year despite a 27% increase in revenue. This is because Palo Alto spent over 51% of its revenue on sales and marketing in a bid to cut its teeth in the competitive cybersecurity space, and this hurts its bottom line.Cisco, meanwhile, spent just under 19% of its total revenue on sales and marketing in the latest quarter, and this is for all its business segments, including security. This puts Cisco above the rest because it can utilize its existing sales channels in the networking hardware business to undercut rivals.For instance, Cisco can bundle its security offerings with other products, lower the pricing, and carve out more market share. It recently deployed a new service known as Cisco Security Connector, which can gather all the network traffic generated by iOS devices and applications. The product then prevents the user from going to malicious sites. Moreover, this application can be deployed using Cisco's cloud-based enterprise mobility management software, which means that Cisco can simply push this new service to customers without spending a fortune.This strong cross-selling opportunity puts Cisco at an advantage over its cybersecurity rivals, which are spending a lot to acquire new customers. This is why Cisco's margin profile will be better than its rivals'.In all, Cisco's size and financial muscle allow it to quickly accelerate the cybersecurity business. Cisco looks like the best-of-breed bet in the cybersecurity space.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Shutterstock photoLegendary investor Warren Buffett advises to be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful. One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.In trading on Thursday, shares of Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd. (Symbol: CHKP) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 28.7, after changing hands as low as $97.95 per share. By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) is 34.8. A bullish investor could look at CHKP's 28.7 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. The chart below shows the one year performance of CHKP shares:    Looking at the chart above, CHKP's low point in its 52 week range is $97.95 per share, with $119.20 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $98.36.According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, CHKP makes up 11.37% of the iShares MSCI Israel ETF (Symbol: EIS) which is trading lower by about 2.5% on the day Thursday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Oversold Conditions For Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP)@2018-02-08@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/oversold-conditions-check-point-software-technologies-chkp-2018-02-08
n just the first six months of 2017, there were 918 known data breaches around the world, through which a total of 1.9 billion data records were stolen. If you compare that to 2016, it's an increase of 164% in data breaches, according to research firm Gemalto.One of the most notable last year was, of course, the  in which hackers gained access to the personal information of 143 million people. That security failure led to the company's CEO being forced to resign.Clearly, it's more important than ever for companies to have strong cybersecurity systems set in place, including firewalls, and companies like  (NASDAQ: FTNT) ,  (NYSE: PANW) , and  (NASDAQ: CHKP) make some of the best security tools out there. Read on to find out why each of them should be on investors' firewall stock short lists.Image source: Getty Images.Fortinet offers its customers a wide variety of cybersecurity solutions, including its FortiWeb and FortiMail services. But the company's real breadwinner is its Fortigate firewall service, which provides about three-quarters of the company's revenues.The company is just coming off a very strong third quarter where its sales increased 18% year over year, to $374.2 million. Net income surged a staggering 322% to $26.6 million and earnings per share hit $0.28, up by 55.6% year over year.A significant share of Fortinet's recent growth is coming from the government sector, as U.S. federal agencies are looking to the company to meet more of their cybersecurity needs. It said that its government segment increased sales 35% in Q3 from the year ago quarter, and it just signed a seven-figure deal with the U.S. military. This should lead to even more work with the government, according to CFO Andrew Del Matto. As he he said on the  back in October:To make the stock even more appealing, Fortinet has zero debt right now, and finished Q3 with about $1.5 billion in cash. Its shares are trading at about 38 times the company's estimated forward earnings, though, which makes it a bit pricey right now compared to the broader tech sector. But Fortinet is  , is consistently adding new customers, and offers some of the best cybersecurity products available. All of which mean investors would be wise to give this firewall stock some consideration.When it comes to data protection, Palo Alto is a bit of a rock star. The company's next-generation firewall products are used by 42,500 companies around the world, and it added 3,000 of those customers in the last quarter alone.Palo Alto's revenue jumped 27% to $505.5 million in the first quarter of its fiscal 2018, and subscription and support sales -- which make up about 60% of the company's top line -- spiked 36% year over year.Investors should note that while Palo Alto is steadily growing its sales, the company still isn't profitable and it posted a $64 million loss in the first quarter. Management has focused much of its attention on growing the company's services and adding new customers, which has led it to spend most of the money it makes.Image source: Getty Images.Palo Alto expects even more customer and sales growth once it releases its new Application Framework in the first half of this year. The service will use analytics and automated workflows to deliver increased security to apps and other services. On the  CEO Mark McLaughlin said:Palo Alto's stock is trading at about 37 times the company's forward earnings, which, like Fortinet, makes it a bit pricey relative to the overall tech industry average. But it's still in a perfect position to benefit from the growing cybersecurity market. Its leading firewall services and its new applications security network should ensure that it continues to be a top player in this space. Just keep an eye out for any long-term problems Palo Alto might have with turning its sales into actual profits down the road.Of all three of these companies, Check Point Software is probably the most stable. It sells firewalls and other cybersecurity services, has more than 100,000 enterprise customers right now, and is slowly -- but consistently -- growing its business.Check Point increased its sales by 6.3% last quarter to $455 million and non-GAAP operating income ticked up 8.8% to $251 million. That was enough to lift the company's non-GAAP earnings per share by 15% year over year to $1.30.You're probably noticing that most of those growth numbers aren't as high as Palo Alto's or Fortinet's. Check Point may not be growing as fast as the other two, but it makes up for it by being profitable, and by getting a huge chunk of its sales from steady recurring revenue. Recurring software sales now account for more than 70% of Check Point's top line.On third-quarter , CEO Gil Shwed said:In addition to its strong ongoing revenue opportunities, Check Point also has no debt and finished Q3 with $3.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents. The cybersecurity company's shares also trade at just 18 times forward earnings, which is far below the ratios of both Palo Alto and Fortinet. Investors looking for a solid firewall stock that will likely see slow, but steady, growth should give this company strong consideration.All of these companies are well-positioned to continue benefiting from the firewall and security needs of enterprise businesses in the coming years. The broad cybersecurity market is expected to expand from the $137 billion it was worth last year to about $232 billion by 2022, according to Markets and Markets. That rapid growth should allow Fortinet, Palo Alto Networks, and Check Point and their investors to benefit for years to come.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"etwork security company  . (NASDAQ: CHKP) had a decent fourth-quarter performance, but it wasn't blemish-free and management still has execution issues to overcome in the Americas region. Let's take a look at the earnings update investors got this week.Starting with the headline numbers:Image source: Getty Images.Revenue growth of just 4% in the quarter represented the lowest quarterly growth rate since 2013. This was also the second quarter in a row that products and licenses revenue decreased. Additionally, it was also the second quarter running in which Americas revenue declined. It's possible that all three are related -- here's why.Data source: Check Point Software Technologies Ltd.While it's true Check Point's revenue has been shifting toward security subscriptions, if you add revenue from products and licenses [P&L] to security subscriptions and compare it with the same quarter last year, the increase is just 2.8%. It was a point made by Piper Jaffray analyst Andrew Nowinski on the . CFO Tal Payne replied that ""America was weaker so as a result that's the 3% that you see in the P&L.""The reason for the weakness in the U.S.? It's a continuation of what CEO Gil Shwed called ""execution challenges"" on the  . In a nutshell, Check Point has been making substantial changes to its sales organization and strategy in the U.S. ""The changes we have implemented in the field didn't bear fruits yet and as noted before it will take a few quarters to ramp up the level of productivity and results as we expect,"" Payne said in the conference call this week.As one of the established industry leaders, Check Point has long been known for having technological expertise, but the security market is highly competitive, with fast-growing companies like  and  trying to  .That's why Check Point decided to step up sales and marketing efforts by rearranging the sales force.

 reported mixed results for fourth-quarter 2017 wherein earnings topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues fell short of the same. However, on a year-over-year basis, the company registered growth on both counts.Check Point's non-GAAP earnings per share (excluding stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets) of $1.58 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.51 and came in above its guidance range of $1.45-$1.55. Non-GAAP earnings also climbed approximately 8% on a year-over-year basis, driven mainly by elevated revenues, efficient cost management and a lower share count.Fourth-quarter revenues came in at $506 million, up 4% year over year and marginally came in above the mid-point of the company's guidance of $485-$525 million (mid-point $505 million). However, the figure fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $509 million.Quarterly revenues were mainly driven by strong adoption of the company's products, particularly its Infinity platform, which was launched in the third quarter. The company, during the fourth-quarter , hinted that its revenues have been affected due to significant changes made in the U.S. sales force which has not yet reached full potential. Notably, the company generates approximately 45% of its total revenues from the Americas.However, dismal performance in the Americas was more than offset by strong performance across the Europe and Asia Pacific, Japan, Middle East and Africa regions. Europe accounted for 39% of total revenues, while the Asia-Pacific, Japan, and the Middle East and Africa added the remaining 16%.Segment wise, the company witnessed sales growth of 2.8% in Product and Security Subscriptions, and 5.6% in Software Updates and Maintenance. The company also reported 18% surge in subscription revenues at Software Blades.Talking about deal size, the number of new customers - who signed deals worth $1 million or more -totaled 110, up 11% from year-ago quarter. Also, customers, who signed deals worth $50,000 and more, contributed 75% to the total order value, which is equal to the fourth-quarter 2016 tally.On a year-over-year basis, non-GAAP gross profit climbed 4.6% to $448.8 million. As a percentage of revenues, gross profit expanded 50 basis points (bps) to 88.7%.Non-GAAP operating expenses decreased 3.7% year over year to $156.7 million. As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses contracted 200 bps mainly due to efficient cost management.Non-GAAP operating income came in at $292.1 million, up nearly 9.7% year over year. In addition, margins advanced 300 bps to 57.7% primarily due to higher gross margin and lower operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues.Non-GAAP net income was $259.2 million or $1.58 per share, up from $247.2 million or $1.46 reported in the year-earlier quarter. | Check Point exited the fourth quarter with cash balances of approximately $3.848 billion, slightly down from $3.865 billion recorded at the end of the third quarter. During 2017, the company generated operating cash flow of $1.09 billion.In addition to this, during the reported quarter, the company generated cash worth $248.1 million from operational activities - marking a 36% year-over-year improvement. The robust growth in operating cash flow is primarily attributable to strong collections from customers and a reduction in the tax advances paid to the authorities in Israel.Additionally, Check Point repurchased about 9.6 million shares for a total cost of $995.3 million in 2017.Taking into account the ongoing challenges related with the U.S. sales force, the company provided outlook for the first quarter and full-year 2018. However, Check Point's revenues and earnings guidance for both periods remained below our expectations.For the first quarter, the company expects to generate revenues between $440 million and $460 million (mid-point $450 million). The mid-point of the guidance is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $460.7 million. Non-GAAP earnings are projected in the range of $1.25-$1.35 per share. GAAP earnings per share are anticipated to be 14 cents lesser than the non-GAAP figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.33.For the current year, Check Point anticipates generating revenues between $1.9 billion and $2.0 billion (mid-point $1.95 billion). The mid-point of the guided range is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.98 billion. Non-GAAP earnings are projected in the band of $5.50-$5.90 per share (mid-point $5.70). GAAP earnings per share are projected to be 62 cents lesser than the non-GAAP figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $5.74.Shares of Check Point remained highly volatile during yesterday's trade. Following the earnings announcement, the stock opened its trade at a price 2.3% lower than the closing price on Jan 30. However, by the end of the day, it recovered much of this loss and eventually closed trade below 1%.Notably, the stock has underperformed the  to which it belongs to over the past year. The industry has recorded growth of 12.4% during the period, while Check Point has gained a meager 5.6%.Check Point's ongoing issues related with the changes it made in its U.S. sales force makes us skeptical about the company's near-term performance. It looks like the recently-joined people are taking more-than-expected time for reaching their full potential. The same is reflected in the company's outlook too. Although the issue is temporary, it is wise to stay away from investing in this stock right now until we get some clear visibility on its sales force execution in the United States.The stock carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Mellanox Technologies, Ltd.  , Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.  and SMART Global Holdings, Inc.  . While Mellanox Technologies sports a Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy), Advanced Micro Devices and SMART Global Holdings carry a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy). You can see  .Mellanox Technologies, Advanced Micro Devices and SMART Global Holdings have expected long-term EPS growth rates of 15.5%, 7.8% and 15%, respectively.Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

"hares of  (NASDAQ: FTNT) rallied nearly 40% over the past 12 months, easily outperforming the NASDAQ's 30% gain. The cybersecurity company impressed investors with a streak of double-digit sales and earnings growth, and it benefited from surging data breaches sparking interest in security-related stocks.But after that big run, Fortinet's stock looks a bit pricey at 93 times trailing earnings. Let's take a closer look at Fortinet to see if the stock can keep outperforming the market this year.Image source: Getty Images.Fortinet is the  network security appliance vendor in the world by annual revenues after  (NASDAQ: CSCO) ,  (NYSE: PANW) , and  (NASDAQ: CHKP) . It's also the market leader in terms of total units sold.Fortinet's core product is a next-gen firewall called Fortigate, which is tethered to security appliances via its Fortinet Security Fabric. That ""fabric"" offers end-to-end protection for on-premise, cloud-based, and Internet of Things (IoT) services and devices. The company serves over 330,000 customers, including the ""majority"" of the Fortune 500.Fortinet's revenue rose 18% annually to $374 million last quarter, as its billings climbed 24% to $432 million. Its deferred revenue, a key indicator of forward demand, jumped 30% to $1.22 billion.Looking ahead, Fortinet's estimated growth rates compare favorably to Palo Alto and  .
  
Data source: Yahoo! Finance.Last quarter, Fortinet founder and CEO Ken Xie declared that ""the expanding cloud security market, and the future of securing critical infrastructure and IoT technologies, will enable Fortinet to continue to grow at multiples of the market over the coming years.""Fortinet is also cheaper than Palo Alto and Check Point on an EV/Revenue basis. It currently has an EV/Revenue ratio of 4.5, while Palo Alto and Check Point have higher ratios of 7 and 8.3, respectively.Fortinet's long-term strategy consists of upselling more products to its existing customers, and using higher-margin subscription-based software revenues to offset the lower margins of its hardware business. That strategy enabled it to significantly expand its gross margin over the past few years.Image source:  .That margin expansion also enabled Fortinet to stay profitable by both non-GAAP and GAAP metrics. This matters, because Palo Alto is only profitable on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes its high stock-based compensation expenses. Check Point, like Fortinet, is profitable by both measures.Last quarter, Fortinet's non-GAAP net income rose 57% to $50.5 million, while its GAAP net income  to $26.6 million. Analysts expect that rosy growth to continue, with its non-GAAP earnings rising 40% this year and 17% next year.By comparison, analysts expect Check Point and Palo Alto's non-GAAP earnings to respectively rise 25% and 11% this year. Based on these expectations, Fortinet's forward P/E of 37 -- which is higher than Check Point's multiple of 18 but matches Palo Alto's multiple -- looks fairly reasonable.Fortinet's strong market position, solid growth rates, reliable profit growth, reasonable valuations, and lack of debt attracted buyout buzz from  , Cisco,  , and  over the past few years. After all, its enterprise value of $6.5 billion still seems like a small price to pay to establish a leading position in the network security appliance market.It's unclear if Fortinet will ever be acquired, but I think the same attributes that make it a buyout target make it a sound investment for most investors. Fortinet offers better overall growth than Check Point and stronger profits than Palo Alto, and it isn't weighed down by legacy businesses like Cisco -- which make it a great stock to buy and hold this year.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

ontinuing with its upbeat performance for the sixth straight quarter,  , yesterday, reported better-than-expected results for fourth-quarter 2017, wherein revenues and earnings came ahead of the company's expectations, and also surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate.Fortinet's non-GAAP earnings per share of 32 cents beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 29 cents. Also, earnings came in higher than management's guidance range of 28-30 cents and marked an improvement over the year-ago quarter's earnings of 30 cents, driven mainly by higher revenues which were partially offset by elevated operating expenses.Fortinet reported fourth-quarter revenues of $416.7 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $409 million and up 14.8% year over year. Segment wise, Product revenues increased 2% year over year to $162.1 million, while Services revenues jumped 24.8% to $254.6 million. A large number of deal wins and customer additions during the reported quarter also proved conducive to top-line growth.During the fourth quarter, the company witnessed 21% year-over-year growth in the number of deals worth more than $100,000, while the number of deals worth more than $250,000 and $500,000 climbed 31% and 24%, respectively.Billings were up 15% on a year-over-year basis to $534 million.Non-GAAP (excluding stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets) gross profit jumped 14.4% from the year-ago quarter to $313.9 million. However, gross margin contracted 40 basis points (bps) to 75.3%. It also came in below the mid-point of management's expectation of 75-76% (mid-point 75.5%).Furthermore, non-GAAP operating expenses jumped 21.6% year over year to $235.3 million. As a percentage of revenues, non-GAAP operating expenses advanced 320 bps year over year to 56.5%.Non-GAAP operating profit declined 3% to $78.7 million from approximately $81.1 million recorded in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating profit margin contracted 350 bps to 18.9%, mainly due to lower gross margin and escalating operating expenses as a percentage of revenues which more than offset the benefit of higher revenues. Operating margin, however, came at the higher-end of the company's guidance range of 18-19%. | Fortinet exited the reported quarter with cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments of approximately $1.25 billion, down from $1.28 billion recorded at the end of the third quarter. Accounts receivable were $346.2 million compared with $258 million witnessed at the end of the previous quarter.During the year, the company generated operating cash flow of $594.4 million. Free cash flow for 2017 came in at $459.1 million. Fortinet bought back 11.2 million shares for $446.3 million during the year.Fortinet initiated outlook for first-quarter and full-year 2018.The company's forecasts for the first quarter are slightly lackluster. Management expects revenues in the range of $387-$393 million (mid point: $390 million), which is marginally lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $390.7 million at mid-point. Billings are estimated in the range of $449-$457 million.Non-GAAP earnings per share are anticipated to come in the band of 21-22 cents (mid point: 21.5 cents). The guidance range is much lower than the Consensus Estimate, but represents a year-over-year increase of 26.4%. Non-GAAP gross margin is estimated in the range of 75-76%, whereas non-GAAP operating margin is projected to be between 12% and 13%.For 2018, management projects revenues in the range of $1.695-$1.715 billion (mid-point: $1.705 billion). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $1.70 billion. Billings are forecast in the band of $2.030-$2.050 billion.Nevertheless, the company anticipates that its cost-management initiatives will drive margins and earnings per share. Non-GAAP gross and operating margin projections are in the range of 75-76% and 17.7-18%, respectively.Non-GAAP earnings per share are estimated to lie between $1.30 and $1.32 (mid-point $1.31). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.19.Fortinet's network security solutions include firewall, VPN, application control, antivirus, intrusion prevention, web filtering, anti-spam and WAN acceleration. The company reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter results. Nonetheless, lackluster first-quarter 2018 outlook makes us slightly cautious about its near-term performance.Moreover, we are concerned over the company's sluggish revenue growth rate. Notably, over the last six quarters, the company's revenue growth rate has been around 20%, significantly lower than the previous rates of more than 30%. Additionally, Fortinet's first-quarter revenue guidance marks an even lower growth rate of 13.8-15.6%.In addition to this, competition from key network security players such as Cisco Systems Inc.  , Check Point  , Juniper Networks  and Palo Alto Networks, remains another concern.Nonetheless, we believe Fortinet's initiative to change its business model to a subscription-based service provider will drive the company's bottom-line results over the long run. Subscription-based service is a high gross margin business (approximately 80%) compared with the hardware-centric model.Notably, the company generates more than 50% of the total revenues from these services, which helped it generate a 70-bps gross-margin expansion in 2017. We anticipate this strategy will continue to improve the company's bottom-line performance in the near future as well.Fortinet has outperformed the  to which it belongs over the past year. The stock has gained 15.9%, while its industry registered growth of 6.5% during the same time frame.Currently, Fortinet has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see  .It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it.

"he cybersecurity industry saw impressive growth last year as corporations scrambled to get their houses in order following a series of serious breaches throughout the year. For example, the economic damage of ransomware attacks (which lock computer screens and demand a ransom) grew to an estimated $5 billion in 2017 from just $325 million in 2015.Not surprisingly, Gartner estimates that the cybersecurity market's revenue will hit $93 billion this year, a jump of 7% from last year.

Last quarter, its revenue shot up 27% year over year thanks to  , allowing the company to increase its full-year revenue guidance.It's likely Palo Alto will be able to sustain its impressive momentum in 2018 as customers are spending a higher amount on its services. Last quarter, the company saw a 53% year-over-year jump in the lifetime value of its top 25 customers to an average of $23.2 million. Customer lifetime value is determined by removing the acquisition and servicing costs of a particular client account from the revenue generated.The increase in customer lifetime value led to an increase of 1% in Palo Alto's operating margin last quarter as it now costs less to acquire and service a customer. More specifically, the company's sales and marketing expenses dropped to 51.1% of revenue from 55.2% in the year-ago period.Palo Alto's deferred revenue also increased 37% year over year to $1.9 billion last quarter, outpacing the growth in actual revenue.  is the revenue received by a company against goods and services that haven't been provided yet, and will be recorded on the income statement when the actual delivery is done.Palo Alto has slightly over $1 billion in short-term deferred revenue, which will be recorded on the books within a year. This means that the company has already secured almost half its projected fiscal 2018 revenue of $2.16 billion. So it looks to be in a good position to hit its target thanks to its updated Traps end-point protection system, which should help sustain its impressive customer growth.One of the new features of Palo Alto's updated security platform includes behavior-based ransomware protection. This update could bring more customers into the company's fold as the ransomware protection market is slated to grow at an annual pace of 16%, according to Markets and Markets.Check Point Software has a very different approach to the cybersecurity market. The company isn't going all-out to capture revenue at the expense of profit, unlike Palo Alto.In the last reported quarter, Check Point's revenue increased ""just"" 6% year over year. This might look very disappointing compared to Palo Alto's rapid growth, but its  earnings increased 18% year over year. By comparison, Palo Alto's GAAP net loss had increased over 12% from the prior-year period in the last reported quarter.Check Point's bottom-line improvements are a result of its disciplined sales and marketing spend. Last quarter, the company's outlay on sales and marketing was almost flat year over year as compared to a 17% jump at Palo Alto.Not surprisingly, Check Point has one of the best valuations in the cybersecurity space. It trades at a trailing P/E ratio of 22.1 and a forward P/E ratio of 17.9. The industry-average trailing P/E ratio is way higher at 148.4, as most of the companies in this space are unprofitable, choosing revenue growth rather than earnings growth.This makes Check Point the preferred choice for investors with a conservative risk profile. But the company's cautious approach doesn't mean that it is a slouch when tapping the huge end-market opportunity. In fact, the company's subscription business is in fine form, reporting 22% year-over-year growth last quarter.The software business could gain more momentum thanks to the Check Point Infinity Architecture. This platform consolidates security across different endpoints such as the network, cloud, and mobile, giving customers advanced threat protection and real-time system monitoring under a single umbrella.Cisco isn't a pure-play cybersecurity company, but it is definitely one of the best bets to take advantage of this market. Last quarter, Cisco pulled in $585 million from its cybersecurity business, a jump of 8% from the prior-year period. By comparison, Palo Alto's cybersecurity revenue was $505.5 million last quarter, while Check Point had generated $455 million.Cisco's cybersecurity business eclipses the pure-play companies in this space. This isn't surprising, as Cisco has been earning its credentials as a networking equipment company for a long time, giving it an existing clientele to which it can sell its cybersecurity services.Cisco can bundle its cybersecurity products into existing networking hardware and software products without having to spend much money on customer acquisition. This gives Cisco an advantage over pure-play rivals who have to fight aggressively for a share of the competitive cybersecurity market.The company's existing network of clients is already driving the company's cybersecurity business. Its deferred revenue from this segment grew 42% year over year in the last reported quarter, outpacing Palo Alto's growth by a substantial margin. Check Point Software, meanwhile, had reported 17% year-over-year growth in its deferred revenue during the last reported quarter.More importantly, Cisco is continually improving its cybersecurity offerings by integrating features like artificial intelligence for predicting threats and accelerating the response time upon detection. Additionally, Cisco has very deep pockets compared to its rivals. The company is sitting on almost $72 billion in cash compared to Palo Alto's $1.5 billion and Check Point's $1.8 billion.So Cisco looks set to dominate the cybersecurity market for a long time given its financial muscle and an established network of clients.Palo Alto Networks, Check Point, and Cisco give investors three different ways to take advantage of cybersecurity growth. While Palo Alto is an aggressive play, spending a lot of money to capture a bigger portion of the market, Check Point's focus is on steady but profitable growth. Finally, for investors looking for some diversity, Cisco represents the best bet given its varying business segments and  .When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

 is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 31. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4.8%. Notably, Check Point Software has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, generating an average positive surprise of 6.7%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Check Point Software is anticipated to benefit from strong demand for cybersecurity solutions. During the soon-to-be reported quarter, the company's flagship product, SandBlast Security was adopted by Mississippi Secretary of State for ensuring end-to-end cybersecurity.In the month of October, Check Point discovered a vulnerability called HomeHack that exposed LG SmartThinQ users to security threats and LG came up with patches for the same. We note that in August, the company had teamed up with LG Electronics for detecting security issues in the latter's systems.Furthermore, the rapid adoption of Check Point's data-center appliances and the continued enhancements in the data-center product lines are estimated to provide adequate support to revenue growth.However, in spite of these positives, Check Point's soft fourth quarter outlook is a concern. The company on its third-quarter  hinted that its fourth-quarter revenues might be hit by significant changes in U.S. sales force, which may take some time to reach its full potential.Additionally, the company's overdependence on distribution channels keeps us apprehensive as this increases customer concentration risk.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter is pegged at $1.51, which represents a meager 3.4% increase from the year-ago figure. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has remained unchanged over the past 30 days. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $508.6 million, up 4.5% from the year-ago quarter. | Our proven model does not conclusively show that Check Point is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components.

"ybersecurity represents a $93 billion market in 2018, according to research firm  . That is music to the ears of cybersecurity providers  (NYSE: PANW) and competitor  (NASDAQ: CHKP) .But despite the opportunity securing data represents, Palo Alto and Check Point shareholders haven't enjoyed the explosive growth seen by others in the tech industry. Check Point stock is up ""just"" 16% while Palo Alto's is up 13% in the past year. Rather than a negative, the relatively muted growth for the two companies translates to greater upside potential.Which is positioned as the better buy for long-term investors? An argument can be made for both, but for a couple of reasons, one does have the edge.Image source: Getty Images.If not for its most recent record-breaking quarter, Palo Alto's so-so growth the last 12 months would have been even less positive. But after reporting a 27% jump in revenue to a record $505.5 million and earnings per share excluding one-time items of $0.74 in its fiscal 2018 first quarter,  .Revenue and the 34% jump in EPS year over year handily beat analyst estimates. Palo Alto topped off its quarter with strong guidance as well. CEO Mark McLaughlin expects revenue to climb 23% to 25% this quarter, equal to $518 million to $528 million. To its credit, Palo Alto was one of the few in its peer group expecting another period of stellar top-line growth.Another strong point was Palo Alto's addition of more than 2,500 new customers to begin its fiscal year. It now boasts over 45,000 customers worldwide. Subscription and support revenue, a means of building a foundation for steady growth, skyrocketed 36% to $319 million. Deferred revenue, a good indicator of Palo Alto's sales pipeline, rose 37% and now sits at $1.9 billion.The problem was Palo Alto's spending and the negative impact it had on EPS including one-time items. Operating expenses rose 21% to 418.4 million, which, combined with the 40% increase in cost of revenue, negated revenue growth. The end result was that Palo Alto's actual profitability -- in other words, including all costs -- sank 11% to a loss of $0.70 a share.Image source: Check Point.At first glance, it may appear Check Point doesn't warrant consideration compared to Palo Alto. Check Point's $455 million in revenue last quarter was a mere 6% improvement year over year, a drop in the bucket compared to Palo Alto's.However, CEO Gil Shwed made it clear years ago that his business model is predicated on managing expenses and growing Check Point's recurring revenue base. What the company lacks in a ""wow factor"" is made up for by containing overhead and driving ongoing sales. Check Point's business model translates to  .Last quarter was a microcosm of what investors can expect from Check Point. In keeping with Shwed's long-term plan, product sales declined 6% to $128.7 million last quarter. However, the all-important software subscription revenue soared 22% to $120.33 million. Combined with software service revenue of $205.6 million, 72% of Check Point's total revenue is derived from predictable subscription and service revenue.Check Point's focus on efficiency was evident last quarter as cost of revenue rose a meager 3% to $51.8 million and operating expenses were up just 3.8% to $229.69 million. In what has become a recurring theme, Check Point's EPS increased nearly three times its total revenue growth to $1.16 a share, a 17% improvement compared to last year.For investors who are comfortable with risk and a wild stock-price ride, Palo Alto -- with its potential for significant long-term growth -- is a sound choice. If Palo Alto is able get a handle on its spending while maintaining its outstanding top-line gains, the sky's the limit.However, for investors like myself who appreciate consistent profitability gains and reliable, if not mind-blowing, revenue growth, Check Point is the hands-down better choice. For those reasons, along with Shwed's relatively conservative approach to growth, Check Point earns the nod as the better buy.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

" (NASDAQ: CHKP) is often considered a pioneer in the cybersecurity industry. The Israeli company, which was founded by three former members of the Israel Defense Forces in 1993, upgraded traditional enterprise firewalls with ""stateful inspection"" tools which track the operating state of all network connections that pass through a system. It also sells ZoneAlarm, a popular firewall for mainstream users.Check Point shares rallied 23% in 2017, beating the 20% gain of the  (NYSEMKT: HACK) , which owns a basket of top cybersecurity stocks. For comparison,  (NYSE: PANW) , the high-growth firewall provider founded by former Check Point employee  , rallied just 16%.Image source: Getty Images.With data breaches  , investors might be wondering if Check Point is a decent investment for 2018. Let's examine the bull and bear cases for Check Point to find out.Check Point serves over 100,000 businesses and millions of users worldwide. It's constantly expanded that ecosystem via acquisitions of smaller companies like Zone Alarm, NFR Security, Protect Data,  's Security Appliance Business, Liquid Machines, Dynasec, and Lacoon Mobile Security.Research firm  ranked Check Point as a market leader in the enterprise network firewall, mobile data protection, and unified threat management markets over the past several years. That ""best in breed"" reputation generates steady growth for Check Point, fueled by strong demand for its appliances and management gateways, along with higher subscription revenues for software ""blades"". Its customers are also upgrading to pricier packages with advanced threat protection solutions, and it's inking more deals with bigger customers with an aggregate transaction value exceeding $1 million.Check Point's revenue rose 7% to $1.7 billion last year, and analysts anticipate another 7% growth this year when it reports its full-year numbers on Jan. 31.Yet that revenue growth pales in comparison to that of Palo Alto Networks, which posted 28% sales growth last year. However, Palo Alto is only profitable on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes its big stock-based compensation expenses.Check Point is profitable by  GAAP and non-GAAP metrics. Its GAAP and non-GAAP EPS both rose 21% annually last year, and analysts expect its non-GAAP earnings to grow 11% this year. Its stock also isn't expensive at 18 times next year's earnings, compared to Palo Alto's forward P/E of 45.Check Point's reliable revenue growth, stable profitability, and low valuations make it a solid play on the growing cybersecurity industry. However, several analysts recently downgraded Check Point for a variety of reasons.Image source: Getty Images.Credit Suisse lowered its price target from $110 to $105 in early November and reiterated its ""neutral"" rating on Check Point, citing a broader slowdown in demand for enterprise firewalls. However, the global enterprise firewall market is still growing at a steady rate -- research firm Wise Guy Reports expects the market to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 7.7% between 2015 and 2019.RBC Capital also cut its price target from $120 to $115, stating that stabilizing blade growth rates couldn't offset its execution issues in the United States. Check Point acknowledged those issues last quarter, but attributed them to an expansion of its sales force, which resulted in a temporary period of adjustment ""with many new people in key positions.""BMO Capital also cut its price target by a dollar to $114, questioning the sustainable growth of its network security business. But during last quarter's conference call, Check Point CEO Gil Shwed countered speculation that customers were shifting away from network security purchases toward other security products. Shwed stated that the ""simple answer"" was that he hadn't ""seen customers shifting"" to other security markets.In December, JPMorgan downgraded the stock to ""Neutral"" while reiterating its $121 price target, stating that it didn't expect Check Point to repeat the ""exceptional performance"" of its 2017 software sales in 2018.I believe that Check Point's strengths clearly outweigh its supposed weaknesses. Whether or not its stock can repeat its strong rally in 2017 is questionable, but I believe that it remains one of the safest long-term bets on the  today.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

 recently announced the acquisition of X15 Software with an aim to incorporate the latter's Big Data platform to its security solutions against cyber attacks. FireEye will be paying $15 million in equity and $5 million in cash for the acquisition per the terms of the transaction.X15 Software, which was founded in 2013 by Val Rayzman, has offices in California and India. The company currently employs around 20 employees who after this acquisition will work from their current locations.At a time when data generation is increasing at an exponential rate, management of the data to extract useful trends, patterns or information has become important.X15 Software's Big Data platform assists in collecting, retrieving and analyzing huge volumes of machine generated data in a scalable fashion in real time, per the press release. Hence, the buyout is anticipated to enhance FireEye's abilities of managing security related data for better decision making, thereby helping its clients to counter the risks against them more effectively.Apart from adding capabilities related to big data management, X15 Software will also be adding a single management console for on-premise, hybrid and pure cloud environments including the likes of Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform as well as Oracle Cloud. Given the varied adoption of different cloud platforms by organizations, this feature will be a lucrative addition.This acquisition is anticipated to be a good buy for FireEye as the application of Big Data and machine learning in cyber security is increasing. This will eventually boost the adoption of the company's offerings and benefit its top line.We believe impressive financials will help the company to rebound, which has otherwise underperformed the industry in the last six months. FireEye stock has gained 0.5% in the last six months, underperforming the 3.3% rally of the  it belongs to.Notably, for the past several quarters, the company has been losing business to its rivals. FireEye faces stiff competition from other well-established players such as Check Point Software  and Fortinet  in the cyber security space.FireEye's management has been striving to turn the business around through a string of initiatives, which includes product launches, acquisition and cost optimization. We consider that FireEye's turnaround strategies are paying off as reflected from its back-to-back three quarters of splendid results.However, the company's guidance for the ongoing quarter fell short of analysts' expectations, which has been a drag. Although a shift from product-based to subscription-based business model will lead to more stable revenues over the long run, it will have a negative impact on FireEye's near-term results, which is a headwind for the company.FireEye carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A better-ranked stock in the same industry is NetApp, Inc.  , sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@EFAV, CHKP: Large Inflows Detected at ETF@2018-01-02@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/efav-chkp-large-inflows-detected-etf-2018-01-02
"For years now, researchers have sought to make a security approach called ""  "" a practical technology, though there have been many obstacles.Earlier this year, I met a startup in Bellevue, Washington, just outside Seattle, called . This group of 19 people, and growing, believes they've finally made moving target work..The story has implications for the entire field of computer security, including  (),  (),  (),  (), and  (). There were a few extra points to be made about the company, hence this Web extra for Barron's readers.There's not a lot of understanding of what  and his team are doing. People I spoke with before and after meeting with Polyverse know either that its technology is to scramble code or that it is doing something with "" ,"" the method of bundling applications with their dependencies made popular by San Francisco startup , and now used all over the place.Both are true, and both leave out some important elements.Gounares, with the help of , a fairly well-regarded scientists of  (he wrote the libcc compiler some years ago), has found a way to change which assembly-language instructions perform an operation, so that techniques of return-oriented programming and the like get starved for the familiar opcodes they need to function.As Gounares explained, you could take a typical instruction sequence such asand get the same end result withAs Gounares describes it, this is ""still getting to the same answer, but just by taking a different route.""""Across a large program, there are literally billions of different permutations available to get to the same answer,"" he observes.For people familiar with techniques such as "" ,"" or ASLR, Gounares likens what he and Fraser have built to "" .""But Polyverse's technology is much more comprehensive, according to Gounares:One amazing thing little realized by those outside the company is that the technology is not just for  and its applications; Fraser and Gounares have developed the ability to binary scramble Microsoft's (MSFT) .Unlike Linux, whose source code is readily available, ""It's mathematically impossible"" to binary scramble Windows, ""but we did it anyway,"" says Gounares.At Microsoft, where Gounares worked starting in 1993 - he later would become the personal advisor to  on technology matters - Gounares in fact wrote some of the Windows ""boot code.""Gounares didn't take source code with him. Instead, with Fraser, he found a way to spy on Windows as it is loading up from the hard disk drive and change its stream of instructions in flight.""It's actually running as we're doing the scrambling, and then once it's started, it's all in memory as a unique version.""""We sort of change it as it's being born, it doesn't get to exist in a vulnerable state.""The other part of the story that's not well understood is the profound shift in perspective of , who ran what's called ""  "" for  (AMZN) e-commerce operations for several years, handling 40,000 servers in data centers across multiple continents, including peak times during the holidays, with virtually no down time over the course of five years.At Amazon, with constant demands for new code to be entered into the system, and to add features such as one-day shipping for Amazon goods, Gore learned to embrace failure, or more precisely, manage failure.Amazon commerce computers never ran the same batch of computer code for more than two days at a time.""We had one powerful tool, we had the capacity to roll out fast, we could fix things cheap, we could roll back fast,"" he describes the constantly shifting nature of Amazon's servers, in what sounds like an echo of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's axiom, ""Move fast and break things.""In a sense, the system is being frequently crashed, but in a controlled way, so that attacks never have much time to progress, if they even get started.Failing creatively is an answer, in Gore's view, to the fact that perfect code never exists.Security, says Gore, "" ,"" meaning, correct code. But, ""we cannot write a system that can assure you that a certain piece of code is correct.""The alternative is to constantly stop things and restart. ""The most you can do is to return it to a known good state.""""If my machine doesn't meet my specs, we don't go fix it, we just kill the damn thing!"" declares Gore.Gore's role is to design the tools by which devs can works with security administrators at the very start, designing a policy for how containers will be recycled - how frequently, with what triggers, etc.Many of those tools borrow from what's called ""  "" programming, also known as "" ,"" which is increasingly becoming a hot topic in .Both Gore and Gounares are fans of the  programming language. Erlang defined the idea that rather than specifying computer management based on tasks, CIOs can define it based on results and let the infrastructure handle the complexity. Like Erlang, Polyverse's tools will define goals of security, and let the scrambling and cycling implement those goals.The payoff is in increasing the complexity for an attacker, which pleases Gore, who is student of . Reducing incentives, making things uneconomical, for the bad guys, is for him the point to what Polyverse does.Put together Gounares and Fraser's work with Gore's container management, and what you have is an interesting kind of havoc in the data center, a controlled chaos, that makes security more a product of the way computers operate, rather than a barrier implemented after the fact, like a firewall. Security becomes an approach of dev-ops practice, rather than an afterthought.If they can pull it off, it could be a big deal.(Those interested in looking at the past history of moving target efforts may want to consult  of  and his colleagues at 's Lincoln Labs; they've done extensive work cataloging and testing various moving target work.)The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Scramble, Cycle, Repeat: Polyverse's Fascinating Take on Computer Security@2018-01-06@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/scramble-cycle-repeat-polyverses-fascinating-take-computer-security-2018-01-06

lenty of things could happen to  (NASDAQ: CHKP) over the next five years. But assuming co-founder and CEO Gil Shwed remains in charge and there are no other major changes, the IT security firm will likely stay on a similar course to the one it has charted for the past several years.That may not be exciting, but Check Point is ideal for conservative investors. Why? Because its business model translates to predictable quarterly financials, and they're usually good.Image source: Getty Images.Thanks to a shift in focus Shwed initiated several years ago, last quarter can justifiably be viewed as a bellwether. As usual, Check Point's total revenue growth of 6% to $454.6 million didn't wow investors. But mid- to high-single-digit percentage sales increases are what investors can expect over the next five years.As it continues its transition to a cloud software subscription model, Check Point continues to build a  , as last quarter demonstrated. Though product sales dropped 6% to $128.7 million, subscription sales (and the recurring revenue they represent) soared 22% to $120.3 million. Subscription revenue continues to inch closer to parity with product sales, and will almost certainly do so again this quarter.When Check Point's $205.6 million in subscription updates and maintenance are added to the mix, 72% of total revenue is predictable and recurring. Check Point isn't the only data security provider building such a revenue foundation -- it's just the best at it. One distinction between Check Point and its peers it that its stable revenue and strict expense management translate to impressive earnings-per-share (EPS) growth quarter in, quarter out.Analyst darling  (NYSE: PANW) ideally illustrates the differences between Check Point and its rivals. Palo Alto reported a record $505.5 million in revenue in its fiscal 2018 first quarter, a 27% increase compared to a year ago. Problem is, its expenses skyrocketed -- again.Its cost of revenue grew a mind-numbing 40% last quarter to $141.4 million. Operating expenses also jumped 21% to $418.4 million. Despite its strong top line, Palo Alto's EPS actually sank 11% to a loss of $0.70 a share.Palo Alto isn't alone, both  and  also spend heavily, though they are making headway in their respective  .By contrast, Check Point's cost of revenue rose all of 3% to $51.8 million last quarter. Operating expenses were also up, but by less than 4% to $229.7 million. The end result was a 17% jump in EPS to $1.16 a share. Better still, rising profitability has become a recurring theme.Image source: Check Point.Based on its deferred revenue, Check Point's future is rock solid. As of last quarter, Check Point boasted $1.04 billion in deferred revenue, a 17% improvement from last year. And like its EPS and its subscription sales, unrecognized revenue on the books soars each quarter.Another indicator that steady growth will continue over at least the next five years can be found in the cybersecurity market broadly. According to one recent study, between 2017 and 2021, a cumulative $1 trillion will be spent on data security. Given the growing number of security breaches occurring around the globe, sky-high growth in the prevention space isn't surprising.The icing on the cake for investors is that Check Point recently upped its share repurchase program, adding authorization for another $1 billion in stock buybacks. In the third quarter, Check Point had 166.2 million shares outstanding , nearly 6 million less than a year prior. That may not sound like much, but with Check Point's relatively low number of diluted shares, the repurchase program is an added bonus.Looking for a stock to provide steady, reliable growth?

"hares of  rallied to a 52-week high of $46.63, eventually closing a tad lower at $46.01 on Jan 19.We believe that this provider of network security appliances is gaining from product ramp ups, deal wins and continuous growth of the network security market.Fortinet stock has gained 42.9% in the past year, substantially outperforming the 14.7% rally of the  it belongs to.You can see .Fortinet's network security solutions include firewall, VPN, application control, antivirus, intrusion prevention, web filtering, anti-spam and WAN acceleration.Cyber security is becoming an essential requirement for the financial well-being, brand image and reputation of enterprises, and governments. Fortinet's experience in the security space and continued delivery of mission-critical solutions helped it gain substantial market share in this segment.Most recently, at Customer Electronics Show (CES) 2018, the company announced its security and threat protection abilities related to connected cars. Fortinet in association with Renesas Electronics has developed this technology that will be beneficial for preventing attacks on connected vehicle networks.We believe that with the company's sustained focus on enhancing its Unified Threat Management (UTM) portfolio through product development and acquisitions, the company is expected to retain its position in this sector, one of the fastest growing segments in network security, per industry analysis.Per a recent report by Gartner, spending on enterprise security is expected to increase 8% year over year in 2018 to reach $96 billion. With all these initiatives, Fortinet is expected to make the most of the opportunity.Additionally, Fortinet's initiative to change its business model to subscription-based service provider is positively impacting its margins and bottom line.However, this transformation, which is affecting the near-term results of the company and stiff competition from key network security players such as Cisco Systems Inc.  , Check Point  , Juniper Networks  and Palo Alto Networks remain headwinds.Fortinet has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see  .Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

espite reporting another surprisingly solid quarter,  (NASDAQ: FEYE) shareholders took it on the chin thanks to lower-than-expected guidance. Before long-term growth investors head for the hills, note that FireEye's expectations for the current quarter and fiscal year are fine, and it's delivering where it counts.Knee-jerk reactions based on pundits' estimates is not indicative of a stock's true potential. Particularly in FireEye's case, given the strides CEO Kevin Mandia has made in just over a year are nothing short of remarkable. And, assuming it continues its successful strategic transition, FireEye will end up being a growth investor's dream over the next five years.Image source: Getty Images.Last quarter was somewhat surprising in that FireEye generated $189.6 million in revenue, good for a 2% increase over 2016. Many analysts were expecting no top-line growth, or even worse. The  is a head-scratcher for FireEye bulls like myself.There are a couple of reasons fourth-quarter guidance of between $190 million to $196 million, and annual expectations of $739 million to $745 million, aren't concerning. One, at this stage in its transition, FireEye's total revenue takes a back seat to its emphasis on cloud-based software and cutting overhead.Secondly, at the midpoint of guidance, FireEye estimates a 4.5% increase in fourth-quarter revenue compared to 2016. For the year, FireEye expects a 4% increase over 2016's $714.1 million -- again, at the midpoint of guidance. But don't be surprised when FireEye beats expectations, let alone meets them.When Mandia took over as CEO in mid-2016, he had two objectives for FireEye. The plan was to drastically cut costs and focus on a cloud-based software model to build a foundation of recurring revenue. Sweeping changes take time, and FireEye is no exception.What matters is how well FireEye is meeting its objectives, and in both regards Mandia has earned an A+. Operating expenses dropped 20% last quarter to $183 million, and cost of revenue eased 1% to $68.2 million. Clearly there's a way to go, but FireEye is making huge strides with each passing quarter.For some perspective, in the first nine months of 2017 FireEye shaved 24% off its operating expenses to $542 million, and it's spending 4% less on cost of revenue. As its efforts to become more efficient continue, FireEye will be soaring in five years. In fact, investors need look no further than FireEye peer  (NASDAQ: CHKP) for a glimpse at the future.Image source: FireEye.Check Point CEO Gil Shwed implemented a plan several years ago, much like FireEye is in the early stages of executing today. Last quarter was an example of what FireEye shareholders can expect in the years to come. Check Point reported a 6% increase in total revenue, just so-so by many investors' standards.However, thanks to Check Point's growing foundation of  , its earnings per share (EPS) skyrocketed 17% to $1.16 a share. Check Point's $120.33 million in software subscriptions in the third quarter was a 22% improvement compared to a year ago. When combined with software updates and maintenance of $205.6 million, 72% of Check Point's revenue is recurring. That's where FireEye is headed, and it should be up and running in five years.Much like Check Point, FireEye's new emphasis on cloud software sales has resulted in steady declines in product revenue. Year to date, FireEye's product revenue of $85.4 million is down 28%, which isn't surprising given its new direction. However, the $463.4 million in recurring software revenue is a 13% increase and more than makes up for the expected drop in product sales.With the growth of its subscriptions, combined with slashing overhead, FireEye's operating margins improved last quarter, as did EPS, to negative $0.41 a share compared to the $0.75 per-share loss a year ago. Excluding one-time items, FireEye lost $0.04 a share, a fraction of last year's negative $0.18 a share.Where will FireEye be in five years?

 is one of those cybersecurity companies that have demonstrated remarkable share price performance in the year so far. The stock has rallied 23.5% in the year so far, outperforming the ETFMG Prime Cyber Security ETF's  return of 18.8%.It is worth mentioning that the stock has managed to register this gain despite witnessing a significant plunge in the last two months. Notably, Check Point Software has lost about 12% of its value since last earnings (reported on Oct 31) as the revenue guidance for fourth-quarter 2017 fell short of street expectations.The company, during its last , hinted that the fourth-quarter revenues might be hit slightly due to significant changes made in the U.S. sales force which may take some time to reach its full potential.However, we believe this is a temporary issue and the newly joined sales forces will reach their full potential in the next quarter, and will once again display good revenue growth. Therefore, investors need not to worry about its growth prospects.It is not Check Point Software's earnings results, but its approach of doing business makes us confident about the company's growth prospects. Let's check out management's approach and consider why the company will continue its momentum in the next year as well.(Looking for the Best Stocks for 2018? Be among the first to see our  .)It is not a secret that Check Point Software intends to drive more revenues by selling subscription-based solutions and services. In the first nine months of 2017, Software Blades subscription revenues have jumped approximately 25% year over year.Although, the company's subscription-based Software Blades constitute only approximately 26% of the total revenues currently, looking at its fast growth rate, its contribution to total revenues is likely to increase significantly in the next few years.It should be noted that this business model has very unique features - it generates stable recurring revenues with high gross margin. Therefore, the more the company sells subscription-based solutions and services, the more it will able to generate steady revenues - the benefit of which will pass onto the bottom-line performance.We consider that Check Point Software management's approach of not growing at the cost of margins and earnings keep it ahead of its peers like Palo Alto Networks  , Fortinet  and Cisco  .This approach has remained a controversial point for the company as many believe this might somewhat impede its top-line growth. However, a better control on spending has kept Check Point Software consistently profitable unlike its aforementioned peers which are struggling with escalating overhead costs.Notably, Check Point Software spends only a quarter of its revenues toward sales and marketing, while its peers spend about 40-60% of revenues. This makes a huge difference, as with just a 6% rise in revenues, Check Point Software's non-GAAP EPS grew 15% in the last quarter.The company's debt free balance sheet, along with a huge cash balance of approximately $3.865 billion as of Sep 30, makes easier to fund its growth initiatives, such as investments in research and developments, sales and marketing as well as acquisitions.Also, its ability to generate substantial operating and free cash flow every quarter helps it enhance shareholders' value through share repurchases.We consider that Check Point Software could be a good long-term safe bet for risk averse investors, given its steady revenue growth, increasing subscription-based revenues contribution, continued focus on cost minimization and a huge available cash balances to fund its growth opportunities.On the valuation front too, the company looks very attractive. The stock currently trades at forward earnings multiple of 19.6x, which is way lower than the peer group average of 43.28x.Also, Check Point Software has a  of B. Notably, the VGM Score rates each stock on their combined weighted styles, helping to identify those with the most attractive value, best growth, and most promising momentum, across the board. This assures our point that the stock has still plenty of upside potential left.The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

"he cybersecurity market could grow from $138 billion this year to $232 billion in 2022, according to research firm Markets and Markets. However, technical jargon and volatile growth can make it tough to understand this industry's long-term prospects. So today I'll highlight the seven key trends investors should follow in the cybersecurity industry next year.The number of data breaches has surged over the past few years. Digital security company  reports that 708 million records were breached in 2015, 1.38 billion records were breached in 2016, and a whopping 1.9 billion records were lost in  of 2017.Image source: Getty Images.The leaked personal data from those breaches often leads to identity theft, which hit a historic high in the US last year and affected 15.4 million consumers, according to Javelin Strategy & Research.To counter these hackers, companies are introducing new levels of security. Many retailers switched to EMV chip cards to curb identity theft. Many apps now require two-factor authentication or fingerprint sign-ins.Looking ahead, we'll likely see the growing importance of facial recognition, led by  's Windows Hello biometric technologies and  's Face ID. However, adoption rates for these technologies could be sluggish as consumers cling on to older devices and operating systems.Meanwhile, hackers will likely start using more sophisticated attacks. Over the past year, we saw the  and its variants wreak havoc on unsecured Internet of Things (IoT) devices like IP cameras and routers. Meanwhile, ransomware attacks  held hundreds of thousands of PCs hostage until Bitcoin payments were made. These attacks clearly indicated that many individuals and organizations were poorly shielded (or not shielded at all) from evolving cyber threats.The  at  (NYSE: EFX) , one of the nation's three largest credit reporting firms, revealed just how lax some security measures were. The company's chief security officer was a music major with no cybersecurity experience, it used ""admin"" as a login and password for a major database, and sent its customers to a fake ""phishing"" site for nearly two weeks.Image source: Getty Images.The Equifax debacle indicated that companies desperately needed to hire experienced security professionals and invest in ""best in breed"" cybersecurity solutions. However, the US government's own efforts remain sluggish, with President Trump's ""Cybersecurity Executive Order"" yielding almost no improvements since it was signed in May.This means that companies like  (NYSE: PANW) , the  in next-gen firewalls, should experience robust growth in 2018 and beyond as customers take data breaches more seriously.Palo Alto already serves 85 of the Fortune 100 companies and 63% of the Global 2000, but those figures should climb even higher. That's why analysts expect Palo Alto's revenue and non-GAAP earnings to respectively rise 23% and 25% this year.Other noteworthy ""best in breed"" players include  (NASDAQ: CYBR) , which protects company networks from internal threats like disgruntled employees or corporate spies; and  (NASDAQ: CHKP) , which provides firewalls and other security solutions to a wide range of businesses.Many cybersecurity companies post robust revenue growth but remain unprofitable due to high stock-based compensation (SBC) expenses, rising marketing and R&D costs, and tough price competition.Therefore, investors should keep an eye out for the security players with consistent earnings growth. For example, Silicon Valley-based Palo Alto Networks is only profitable on a non-GAAP basis due to its high SBC expenses, yet CyberArk and Check Point -- which are both based in Israel -- are profitable by both non-GAAP and GAAP measures.Standalone players like Palo Alto and CyberArk face growing competition from bigger tech companies like networking giant  and security solutions provider  . can bundle comparable cybersecurity products with their other products and services to undercut smaller stand-alone players. However, companies like Palo Alto and CyberArk already boast strong market penetration in the enterprise market -- which makes them attractive takeover targets.There's already been a lot of takeover chatter about Palo Alto, CyberArk, and other companies. That buzz might finally lead to some big buyouts next year.Investing in the cybersecurity market might seem daunting, but it becomes manageable once you understand a company's core technology, assess the market demand, size up the competition, and evaluate its roadmap toward profitability.Investors looking for a simpler play on the cybersecurity sector can also consider buying the  (NYSEMKT: HACK) , which owns a basket of popular cybersecurity stocks.

"Shares of  (NASDAQ: CHKP) fell 11.4% in November, according to data from  , after the cybersecurity specialist posted  , but followed with disappointing forward sales guidance.Nearly all of CheckPoint Software's decline last month came on Nov. 1 alone -- the first trading day after the company announced third-quarter 2017 results. More specifically, Check Point's quarterly revenue climbed 6% year over year to $455 million -- near the high end of the company's projections -- which translated to better-than-expected 15% growth in adjusted earnings per share, to $1.30.IMAGE SOURCE: CHECK POINT SOFTWARE.Check Point founder and CEO Gil Shwed credited continued strength in adoption of the company's advanced threat protections for its growth. He also noted that Check Point extended the capabilities of its Infinity platform with enhanced anti-ransomware security, cloud security for Azure, and the integration of  Intune mobile management with Check Point's SandBlast mobile security product.Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, however, management told investors to expect revenue in the range of $485 million to $525 million, and adjusted earnings per share of $1.45 to $1.55. Analysts, on average, were looking for earnings of $1.48 per share, but on revenue around $5 million above the midpoint of Check Point's guidance range.During the subsequent conference call, Shwed explained that third-quarter revenue was high in part because of the ""Yom Kippur end-of-quarter effect."" That is, the holiday fell in the last two days of the quarter, which caused higher-than-normal bookings as some orders were pushed forward from the fourth quarter.In short, Check Point's third-quarter beat and fourth-quarter guidance shortfall were mostly matters of timing, and the latter isn't necessarily indicative of underlying business troubles.It probably didn't help that Check Point stock was also up nearly 45% over the past year leading up to last month's report. So it's not terribly surprising that some skittish investors might want to take profits off the table. But as the dust settles, I think last month's post-earnings plunge will probably end up being a buying opportunity for patient, long-term shareholders.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past.

s the eventful 2017 comes to a close, we believe this is the right time to make your investment plans for the upcoming year. Among the various industries, we prefer cybersecurity stocks due to their remarkable run on the bourse, so far this year. The ETFMG Prime Cyber Security ETF  is up 18.7% in the year-to-date period.A series of cyber attacks kept cybersecurity stocks hot throughout the year. Earlier in the year, there were two back-to-back ransomware attacks - WannaCry or WannaCrypt in May and Petya in June - followed by the massive data breach at Equifax  in September. In addition to these, the disclosed data theft and ransom paid by Uber last month has further fueled the momentum.Notably, these data breaches were a reality check, showing how cyber attacks can escalate companies' market and operational risks as well as tarnish the brand image. Hence, the firms now understand the immediate need for stricter security measures, which, we believe, will compel companies to further increase spending on cyber security.Per a recently-released report by Gartner, global enterprise security spending will reach $96.3 billion in 2018 - marking 8% growth from the 2017 expected level of $89 billion. Another market research firm, Markets and Markets in its July 2017 report stated that worldwide cybersecurity spending will likely reach $137.85 billion in 2017 and $231.94 billion by 2022.Encouragingly, cybersecurity companies will be the ultimate gainers due to this elevated spending. Here, we have picked three stocks which have the potentials to make the most of this opportunity and retain their impressive share price momentum in 2018 as well. is a specialized provider of security platform against cyber-attacks to enterprises and governments. The company's continued efforts toward bringing in new and advanced products have been attracting a wide range of customers.Additionally, last year's acquisition of iSIGHT Partners has strengthened the company's capabilities by offering an intelligence-led security model for enterprises of any size that other security providers find difficult to match. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has also taken over Invotas - a firm specializing in improving response times following a cyber-attack. Its product - Security Orchestrator - is designed to compile information from a range of security products and automate responses when an incident occurs. has evolved into a well-known provider of information technology (IT) security solutions across the world. The heightening security threats and potential hacking attacks led the company to turn to Software Blade architecture in 2009 from an appliance-led model. The company's blade architecture is becoming increasingly popular as it enables customers to choose from an archive of software blades and customize the solution to suit users' requirements.Rapid adoption of Check Point's data-center appliances and consistent enhancements in data-center product lines are anticipated to provide ample top-line support. The company's focus on boosting mobile capabilities will enable it to tap brighter prospects. The stock carries a Zacks Rank of 3. You can see  . enables firms, service providers and government bodies to impose tighter security measures through its network security platform. The company has been growing rapidly on the back of its innovative next-generation security platforms. Its security platforms have innovative traffic classification engines that help the company identify network traffic through application, user and content.Palo Alto's security platforms simplify security infrastructure for organizations by eliminating the need for multiple, stand-alone security appliances, and software products. This reduces the total cost of ownership, thereby giving the organization a competitive edge.Also, we believe the company's strategic acquisitions of LightCyber, Morta Security and Cyvera will continue to bolster revenues. These acquisitions helped this Zacks Rank #3 company expand the functionality of its enterprise security platform, in turn bringing in more and more customers.In addition to the above, Palo Alto has made strategic partnerships with the likes of VMware and Aruba Networks to expedite growth. These strategic partnerships bring in customers for Palo Alto, thus boosting its top line.Considering the above discussed factors, it makes sense to invest in this hot industry group as cybersecurity players are likely to witness sturdy growth in the near term.It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it.

"nvestors in Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd. (Symbol: CHKP) saw new options begin trading this week, for the February 2018 expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CHKP options chain for the new February 2018 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $100.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.45. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $100.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $97.55 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CHKP, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $103.84/share today.Because the $100.00 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

If an investor was to purchase shares of CHKP stock at the current price level of $103.84/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $105.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 4.68% if the stock gets called away at the February 2018 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CHKP shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd. , as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing CHKP's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $105.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $105.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

"s solid as the year's been -- its stock is up 14% in 2017 --  (NASDAQ: FEYE) shareholders got hit hard following its recently announced third-quarter earnings.FireEye beat both revenue and earnings expectations, as it has all year, but its forecast for the current quarter didn't impress. The result was an immediate 15% nosedive. However, big movements either up or down based on analyst estimates are rarely a reliable indicator of a company's potential.In FireEye's case, the knee-jerk reaction to its guidance is  the best is yet to come.Image source: Getty Images.Last quarter's $189.6 million in revenue was a 2% improvement compared to a year ago and slightly better than FireEye's guidance. While still in the red, FireEye's loss of $0.41 a share was a significant step in the right direction. FireEye lost $0.75 a year ago, shortly after CEO Kevin Mandia took the reins.Excluding one-time items, per-share earnings were negative $0.04, a dramatic improvement from last year's loss of $0.18 a share. FireEye's balance sheet is sound with $879 million in cash and equivalents, though it does carry $770 million in senior convertible debt on the books.FireEye's top and bottom lines and its $190 million to $196 million in expected revenue this quarter may not impress. However, when the progress Mandia has made in such a short period of time is taken into account, it explains why the best is yet to come for FireEye.Image source: FireEye.A year ago, FireEye generated $186.4 million in revenue -- not bad for a company with a market capitalization of around $2.13 billion at the time. Total operating expenses were $228.7 million, led by an eye-popping $110.76 million in sales and marketing overhead. Over 59% of FireEye's total revenue went to its sales efforts.Mandia had three core objectives when he took over the top job. One, get a handle on costs, particularly sales-related expenses. Two, shift FireEye's sales efforts toward cloud-based software subscriptions including its new-ish Helix solution, as opposed to individual, one-time product sales. If the first two objectives were completed successfully, FireEye would reach its third objective: profitability.Cleaning up the mess that was FireEye was never going to be quick or easy. But the strides made the past year make it clear Mandia has already made his mark. Last quarter's $183 million in operating expenses was a 20% drop, including paring 20% in sales-related costs. FireEye now spends 47% of its revenue on sales and marketing expenses.Cutting costs while growing revenue is no easy feat, but FireEye can look to its peer,  (NASDAQ: CHKP) , for inspiration. In the third quarter, Check Point's revenue grew 6% to $454.63 million. Operating expenses rose just 3.9% and cost of revenue was essentially flat, with a relatively small 23% of revenue directed toward its sales efforts.Beyond monitoring overhead  by emphasizing sales of its recurring revenue software subscriptions, as FireEye is now doing. Product revenue dropped 31% in the third quarter to $30.5 million. But with its Helix cloud subscription offering in full swing, FireEye's on-going service sales soared.The 12% jump in subscription and service sales -- most on one to three year contracts -- to $159.1 million more than made up for the product results. As of last quarter, 84% of FireEye's revenue is derived from subscriptions and servicing existing customers.This quarter's guidance may have disappointed, but it could prove to be a watershed moment for FireEye. According to Mandia, FireEye's on-going transformation has it ""well positioned to achieve non-GAAP operating profitability in the fourth quarter.""The level of success accomplished in just over a year bodes well for the future, which is why FireEye's best days are ahead of it.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"hough  (NASDAQ: CHKP) stock is up 23% year to date, shareholders took it on the chin after third-quarter earnings were released. The ""problem"" certainly wasn't last quarter, which was nothing short of stellar.The 12% dip in stock price following its latest earnings has only made Check Point an even better value. Of course, what really matters is how it's positioned for the long run, and that looks awfully rosy.Image source: Getty Images.Last quarter's $455 million revenue was good for a 6% increase over last year, and was on the high end of Check Point's and analyst expectations. If you're not that familiar with Check Point, 6% may not seem like much to get excited about. However, there's more to the story than wowing Wall Street with eye-popping sales growth at all costs.It was  for this quarter that sent its shares reeling. Its updated guidance calls for earnings per share excluding one-time items of $1.45 to $1.55. Consensus estimates are for EPS of $1.49 a share, so no worries there.The midpoint of Check Point's revenue expectations of $485 million to $525 million would equal a 4% improvement over 2016's fourth-quarter sales of $486.71 million. If this year ends up on the high side of Check Point's forecast, which it generally does, it would be a 7% to 8% increase.The problem is pundits were expecting $529.4 million in sales this quarter, which was all it took for short-term investors to kick-start the sell-off.For some perspective, Check Point competitor  (NYSE: PANW) stock is up 6% over the past week since sharing last quarter's results, which included a 27% jump in sales to a record $505.5 million. Thing is, despite growing its top line and enjoying a bump in share price, Palo Alto lost $0.70 a share, 11% worse than 2016's negative $0.63 a share. The culprit for Palo Alto's  is spending.The difference between Check Point and Palo Alto, and others in its peer group, is that CEO Gil Shwed is tightfisted when it comes to spending. The upside to Check Point's focus on efficiency was seen again last quarter. The $1.16 in EPS it reported in the third quarter was a 17% rise from a year ago.Check Point's bottom line is even more impressive when you consider that single-digit revenue growth consistently leads to double-digit EPS seemingly every quarter. And that's another reason -- along with its near-term share price decline -- the best is yet to come for Check Point.Image source: Check Point.Beyond controlling spending, Shwed has Check Point focused on building a reliable base of recurring revenue from its cloud software subscriptions. Toward that end, Check Point's $120.33 million in subscriptions was a 22% increase over a year ago, which has become another ongoing theme.When the $205.6 million generated from software updates and maintenance is added to the recurring revenue mix, 72% of Check Point's total sales is a foundation shareholders can rely on. Considering that its deferred revenue climbed 17% to $1.04 billion, it's safe to say investors can expect more recurring revenue growth in the future.Another feather in Check Point's cap was expanding its relationship with  (NASDAQ: MSFT) last quarter. The data housed on Azure, the platform from which Microsoft's $20.4 billion annual cloud revenue run rate is derived, is secured by Check Point's vSEC solution.Check Point also teamed with Korea-based  (NYSE: LPL) to provide data protection for its smart home appliances. The Internet of Things (IoT) market represents an almost-limitless opportunity and Check Point continues to make progress where it counts.At just 22 times earnings and 18 times forward expectations, Check Point is significantly undervalued compared to its peers. And with recurring revenue soaring every quarter, along with EPS, Check Point's future couldn't be brighter.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

 started fiscal 2018 on a solid note with better-than-expected results in the first quarter. The company's earnings and revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and also improved year over year.Strong quarterly results were mainly driven by healthy demand environment, new product launches and increasing adoption of the company's next-generation security platforms. Buoyed by marvellous first-quarter performance, the company provided impressive guidance for the forthcoming quarter and also raised fiscal 2018 outlook.Consequently, investors' were optimistic about the stock's growth prospect as reflected from the share price movement during the yesterdays' after-hours trading. The company's shares gained approximately 7% in late trading session.So far this year, Palo Alto has outperformed the  it belongs to. While the stock has been up 14%, the industry gained 20.7%.Let's discuss the quarter in detail.Palo Alto's revenues of $505.5 million surged 27% year over year and outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $489 million. In fact, the top line came above the guided range of $482-$492 million.The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by customer additions along with new product launches. Additionally, the company stated that the successful execution of its 'land and expand' go-to-market model has helped it in acquiring new clients. Palo Alto also managed to increase its existing customers' expenditures, which contributed to the overall growth. In the reported quarter, the company added over 2,500 new customers.Product revenues increased approximately 14% to $186.5 million and surpassed its projected range of $170-$173 million. The company witnessed a 36% surge in subscription and support revenues ($319 million). SaaS-based subscription revenues also climbed 40% from the year-ago period. Support revenues increased 32% year over year.Billings improved 15% year over year to $596.5 million and came ahead the mid-point of the company's guidance range of $580-$600 million (mid-point $590 million).Geographically, revenues from the Americas increased 25% on a year-over-year basis. The figures from Europe, the Middle East and Africa were up 35% while the same from Asia-Pacific rose 25%.Palo Alto' gross margin decreased 260 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 76.8%, mainly due to ongoing traction with the new products that it had introduced in the year-ago quarter.Adjusted operating expenses in the fiscal first quarter were $292.4 million, or 57.8% of revenues. This marks a year-over-year improvement of 360 bps backed by ongoing increasing leverage in sales and marketing.Operating margin improved 100 bps to 19% as benefit from lower operating expenses (as a percentage of revenues) were more than offset by loss from reduced gross margin.The company's adjusted net income was $69.8 million or 13.8% of revenues compared with $51.2 million or 12.9% last year. On a per share basis, the company reported non-GAAP earnings of 74 cents marking a year-over-year growth of 34.5%. Quarterly earnings also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 68 cents as well as the company's projected range of 67-69 cents. | Palo Alto exited the quarter under review with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $2.3 billion compared with $1.4 billion at the end of fourth-quarter fiscal 2017.Receivables were $350.8 million compared with $432.1 million in the previous quarter. Furthermore, the company's balance sheet does not have any long-term debt. It reported cash flow from operations of $274.1 million in the quarter. Free cash flow came in at $241.9 million. In addition, the company repurchased 861,000 shares worth $134.10 million. At quarter-end, the company had approximately $455 million available under its ongoing share repurchase authorization.Palo Alto raised its outlook for fiscal 2018. The company now expects revenues to be in the range of $2.145-$2.185 billion, an improvement of 22-24% year over year compared with $2.125-$2.165 billion, projected earlier. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $2.15 billion.Product revenues are anticipated to come in the range of $755-$770 million, reflecting a year-over-year growth of 6-9% and higher than the previous guidance range of $735-$750 million. Billings are now expected to lie between $2.65 billion and $5.71 billion, which represent a growth of 16-18% from year-ago quarter. The new guidance range is projected higher than the earlier guidance of $2.64-$2.7 billion.Non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be in the $3.35-$3.41 band (mid-point $3.38 per share), up from $3.24-$3.34, anticipated earlier. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $3.31 per share.For the fiscal second quarter, Palo Alto anticipates revenues in a range of $518-$528 million, up 23-25% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $520 million. Product revenues are forecasted to in the $185-$188 million range, up 10-11%. Billings are projected to be between $640 million and $655 million, an increase of 14-17%. Non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be in the range of 78-80 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 77 cents.Revenue growth seems to be steady aided by strength across all its geographical regions and business segments. Customer wins along with expansion of the company's existing customer base are added positives. We believe that its product refreshes and acquisition synergies might boost top-line growth.Going forward, Palo Alto is keen on expanding cloud exposure. To this end, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company recently expanded ties with VMware, Inc.  . You can see  .Through the new collaboration, Palo Alto Networks will combine its security platform with VMware's software platform, which provides private cloud-based service to make the cloud-computing environment more secure, simple, flexible, and efficient.This deal is expected to better equip organizations to handle private cloud technology and control business applications securely. As VMware remains one of the leading companies in the virtualization and cloud computing space, we believe Palo Alto might gain significantly from this collaboration.Nonetheless, a volatile spending environment and competition from Cisco Systems, Inc.  and Check Point Software Technologies Ltd.  remain concerns.While we share many recommendations and ideas with the public, certain moves are hidden from everyone but selected members of our portfolio services.

"s investors know, risk can't be avoided entirely. However, there are a number of stocks that offer growth potential without the wild fluctuations. Two that immediately come to mind are design software king  (NASDAQ: ADBE) and cybersecurity leader  (NASDAQ: CHKP) .Though Adobe and Check Point play in entirely different sandboxes, they share a number of key attributes. Both are focused on slowly building an ongoing revenue base investors can rely on from one quarter to the next. Adobe and Check Point may not wow investors each quarter, but for those seeking conservative growth alternatives, these two are hard to beat.Image source: Adobe.When CEO Shantanu Narayen first shifted Adobe's sales efforts away from individual products to a monthly subscription model, customers were not amused. Blogs were started for the sole purpose of giving design folks a forum to bemoan the change. Fast-forward a few years and not only are Adobe's customers fine with the change, but shareholders are reaping the rewards.Last quarter's $1.84 billion in revenue was yet another record and a whopping 26% increase compared to last year. Just as important is that thanks to Adobe's focus on recurring revenue -- it costs less to service existing customers than rely solely on finding new ones -- the bottom line soared.Adobe reported $0.84 in per-share earnings last quarter, equal to a mind-boggling 56% year-over-year improvement. But the reason you won't lose sleep by adding Adobe to your portfolio is its annual recurring revenue. Its ARR jumped $308 million last quarter to $4.87 billion. In other words, if Adobe didn't sell another subscription all year, it would still generate nearly $5 billion in revenue. , Adobe is exploring a number of cutting-edge technologies that are ideal for its software design customers. Forays into the cloud, virtual reality, voice recognition, and augmented reality, are naturals given Adobe's products and customers.Adobe's push to expand its offerings are the reason its operating expenses were up 16% last quarter, much of which went to its research and development costs. Of course, when the top line balloons 26% largely due to building a reliable foundation of revenue, a bump in spending is more than acceptable.Image source: Getty Images.If you're losing sleep over your portfolio, stocks that mimic the slow-but-steady tortoise over the easily distracted hare are ideal. In that regard, it's hard not to like Check Point. Similar to Adobe, Check Point shifted away from its reliance on one-time sales to grow its  .Naturally, impatient investors shied away from Check Point as it made its transition to focus on high-flying stocks including peers  and  , to name but a couple. Thing is, while Palo Alto and Fortinet were consistently reporting revenue gains of 30%, 40%, and even 50%, their losses mounted.Last quarter was a microcosm of what investors can expect from Check Point. Total revenue climbed ""just"" 6% to $455 million, which didn't compare to its rivals. However, subscription revenue jumped 22% to $120 million. When subscription sales are added to the $205.6 million Check Point generated in updates and maintenance last quarter, 72%, or $325.9 million in revenue, is ongoing.Again, similar to Adobe, it simply costs Check Point less to service its recurring customers than rely on big sales each quarter. Check Point's conservative approach to its business meant that operating expenses inched up a mere 3.9% to $229.7 million. The end result was $1.16 in per-share earnings, a stellar 17% increase from a year ago.Check Point isn't likely to report massive top-line gains, but that was never CEO Gil Shwed's plan. Slowly building a base of revenue that shareholders can rely on is Check Point's modus operandi, and that's why the company is ideal for investors seeking growth who also like to sleep comfortably at night.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

But Palo Alto's  is warranted.When Palo Alto announces its fiscal 2018 first-quarter results Nov. 20, investors will likely note the same two reasons why its troubles will continue. And therein lies the problem for CEO Mark McLaughlin and team.Image source: Getty Images.Palo Alto had been the darling of its peer group for years following multiple quarters of 50%-plus total revenue growth. In fact, Palo Alto's top line had been so impressive for so long, investors had no problem ignoring its ongoing lack of profits.The argument for the Street's love affair is that Palo Alto is in all-out growth mode, and that requires spending. However, there are two problems with that argument that are manifesting themselves more and more each passing quarter. The first concern is that McLaughlin vowed to pare expenses, particularly sales and marketing costs, but it simply isn't happening.Last quarter's revenue of $509.1 million was a record and a28% jump year over year. So why, after a spike in share price following Palo Alto's earnings news has its stock retreated? Because McLaughlin not only hasn't cut overhead, it continues to soar.Total operating expenses in Palo Alto's fiscal fourth quarter rose 27% compared to $397.9 million -- and it gets worse. McLaughlin's focus on sales and marketing costs is still blurry. Palo Alto spent a mind-boggling $245.4 million on sales expenses, up 19% from a year ago and equal to nearly half its total revenue.For some perspective, new-ish FireEye CEO Kevin Mandia made much the same promise as McLaughlin when he took over in June 2016. Last quarter, FireEye shaved another 20% off its operating expenses, including 20% in sales overhead. FireEye's cost-cutting initiative has been on display every quarter since Mandia became CEO -- in other words, a promise kept.Check Point offers another example of  . Last quarter's $106 million in sales-related spending was essentially flat year over year and equaled a mere 23% of its $454.6 million in revenue. A year ago, Check Point spent 24% of total revenue on its sales efforts. FireEye and Check Point have proven it can be done, but McLaughlin can't seem to manage it.Image source: Palo Alto Networks.The second problem for Palo Alto is that sky-high revenue gains are a thing of the past. Even as its growth rate slows, Palo Alto continues to adhere to its open checkbook policy. Though Palo Alto's 27% jump in revenue sounds great, it wasn't enough to overcome the rise in operating expenses. The end result was last quarter's loss of $0.42 a share, 20% worse than a year ago.Based on McLaughlin's midrange revenue guidance for the first quarter of $487 million, Palo Alto's growth rate will slow to 22.5%. Sure, McLaughlin is likely underselling Palo Alto's actual revenue for a quarterly ""beat,"" the usual CEO-speak. But the declines in growth rate are an ongoing theme, as are Palo Alto's mounting losses. Worse still, investors can expect more of the same in the quarters ahead.Check Point is an ideal example of an efficiently run organization with its priorities in order. The aforementioned $454.6 million in revenue Check Point reported was ""just"" a 6% bump year over year. However, Check Point's earnings per share (EPS) skyrocketed 18% to $1.16 a share. Call me old-fashioned, but I like consistently rising profits.It's been over six years since McLaughlin joined Palo Alto as CEO, and it remains far from profitable. The culprit is obvious and has been for years, but nothing's changed. Essentially ""buying"" revenue by overspending on sales and marketing needs to end if Palo Alto shareholders want to see even the slightest of profits. And that's clearly not going to happen with McLaughlin in charge.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Palo Alto Networks wasn't one of them!

Shutterstock photo (  ) helped boost the Nasdaq composite to new all-time highs and a mild gain. Merger fever in the semiconductor sector also helped lift the Nasdaq.[ibd-display-video id=2382612 width=50 float=left autostart=true]Apple, up 1.1% to 174.36 and new all-time highs, has now jumped more than 11% past an Aug. 2 breakout from a flat base with a 156.75 entry. The iPhone and iMac giant is also steadily gaining ground from its newest buy point, a nearly eight-week  at 160.97.At 4pm ET, the Nasdaq composite held on to most of its moderate gains, rising 0.3%, while the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 notched gains of around 0.1%. But the latter two indexes closed nearly at session highs, a bullish sign.Strong rallies by certain computer and internet-oriented tech stocks offset sharp declines by stocks in the supermarket, medical services, medical supplies, drugstore, automaker, gaming software, meat and other defensive food industry groups.The S&P SmallCap 600 rose 0.2% and the Russell 2000 gained 0.3%. Volume fell slightly on both exchanges. The Dow transports fell 0.2%; the Dow Jones utility average dropped more than 0.5% after a huge gain in crude  following political turmoil in the highest levels of government in Saudi Arabia.WTI futures jumped 3% to $57.36 a barrel on the NYMEX.Back to Apple, it's important to remember that the best time to buy Apple over the past 12 months actually came in January, when the megacap name burst out of an  .That top-notch pattern, repeated time and time again by many of the greatest stock market winners in history, featured a 118.12 buy point. (Find the proper entry in a cup with handle by adding 10 cents to the highest price within the handle portion.) Since shares have already gained more than 45% from that proper entry, it obviously will be more challenging for Apple to rise another 20% from its latest proper entry points.However, Apple has shown it can maintain conservative guidance, and over-deliver. Fiscal Q4 earnings jumped 24% to $2.07 a share, the best gain in eight quarters, on a 12% pickup in revenue to $52.58 billion. And the Street thinks Apple can grow its earnings in the double digits for at least a fourth straight quarter (up 12% to $3.76 a share).Three more reasons why the market bears shouldn't knock Apple:One, the up/down volume ratio in Apple's  (a proprietary tool available only at Investors.com) is now back at 1.1, above the neutral 1.0 level. Prefer those companies that show a ratio of greater than 1.0, which means that volume is heavier on the stock's up days in price vs. down days over the past 50 sessions.Two, the RS line is hitting new high ground (see it in blue in IBD's  , and in MarketSmith).Three, the Relative Price Strength Rating (different from the relative strength line, which graphs a stock's performance against the daily action of the S&P 500) is approaching a nine-week high of 89.The Philadelphia semiconductor index, known as the SOX, rallied 1.3% and is now up 45% year to date. The possibility of  (  ) acquiring wireless chip technology expert  (  ) has fueled speculation of further consolidation in the massive industry.Among IBD's 33 sector rankings (see them in IBD's  , part of IBD's Data Tables), the Chips sector is ranked No. 1 in terms of mid- and long-term relative performance. Broadcom, which has thrived since its merger with Singapore-based Avago Technologies in 2016, rallied more than 1% to 277.53 and is out of buy range after clearing a 259.46 flat-base buy point on Oct. 30.In  ,  (  ) is trying to recover after a summary sell-off in the security software industry. Palo Alto fell after peer Check Point Software (  ) plunged more than 12% despite Q3 results that beat on the earnings side (EPS up 15% to $1.30 a share, 6 cents above the Thomson Reuters consensus view).Palo Alto, which is growing its earnings and revenue at a faster pace, gained 1% to 147.77 in quiet trading and is now back above an aggressive entry near 144. (On select stocks, the  offer annotations pointing to exact buy points and sell signals.)The Street sees fiscal Q1 earnings rising 25% to 69 cents a share following EPS gains of 126%, 100%, 136%, 62%, 47%, 33% and 39% vs. year-ago levels in the prior seven quarters.Palo Alto gets the highest EPS Rating within IBD's  at 99 on a scale to 1 to 99.  (QLYS) has the second best EPS Rating, which covers long- and short-term profit growth and is compared with all other companies in IBD's database, at 96.However, Palo Alto, a mid-cap software play, is still trying to reach 52-week highs as it exits a  . This helps explain why Palo Alto, with a so-so Composite Rating of 83, is what Apple was at the end of last year: a potential turnaround play.Qualys is having a terrific time since clearing a 10-week flat base with a 44.45 buy point on Aug. 3. Shares have since risen more than 28%, justifying the move to take at least some gains based on one of IBD's top sell rules:  .Software is ranked No. 15 out of 33 sectors. Palo Alto's security software group is ranked a so-so 83rd among 197 IBD industry groups and subgroups over the past six months, trailing sector counterparts gaming software (No. 14, please see  (ATVI) and  (EA)); desktop software (No. 17, topped by  (MSFT)); and specialty enterprise software (No. 28, headed by  (TEAM) and  (ALRM)).The large enterprise software industry group is No. 41.Elsewhere, REIT stock  (AMT) blasted more than 5% higher to 150.16 in turnover racing 88% above its 50-day average and took out a new 148.81 buy point in a nine-week cup. Average daily volume is 2.08 million shares, and as of 3 p.m. ET turnover has already exceeded 2.9 million shares.Please go to IBD's  to read more about American Tower and other highly rated stocks rushing out of new bases and into new high ground. :The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Stocks Close Near Highs; 4 Reasons To Expect Strong Apple Gains@2017-11-06@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/stocks-close-near-highs-4-reasons-expect-strong-apple-gains-2017-11-06
hares of  , a provider of network security solutions to enterprises, service providers and government entities worldwide, have been performing well of late.If you haven't taken advantage of the share price appreciation yet, its time you hold the stock in your portfolio as it looks promising and is poised to carry the momentum ahead. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has an estimated long-term earnings growth rate of 24.6%.Estimates for Palo Alto Networks have moved up in the last 30 days, reflecting the optimistic outlook of analysts. The earnings estimates for fiscal 2018 and 2019 have gone up in the last 30 days.For fiscal 2018, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has risen by 7 cents in the last 30 days and is pegged at $3.39. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2019 also moved north by 3 cents to $4.18.Palo Alto Networks outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, recording an encouraging positive average earnings surprise of 9.5%.Palo Alto Networks stock has gained 27.6% in the past six months, outperforming 4.3% rally of the  it belongs to.Palo Alto Networks started fiscal 2018 on a solid note with better-than-expected results in the first quarter. The company's earnings and revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and also improved year over year.Strong quarterly results were mainly driven by healthy demand environment, new product launches and increasing adoption of the company's next-generation security platforms.The company's revenues of $505.5 million surged 27% year over year and outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $489 million. In fact, the top line came above the guided range of $482-$492 million.The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by customer additions along with new product launches. Additionally, the company stated that the successful execution of its 'land and expand' go-to-market model has helped it in acquiring new clients. It also managed to increase existing customers' expenditures, which contributed to overall growth. In the reported quarter, the company added over 2,500 new customers.On a per share basis, the company reported non-GAAP earnings of 74 cents marking year-over-year growth of 34.5%. Quarterly earnings also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 68 cents as well as the company's projected range of 67-69 cents.Buoyed by marvelous first-quarter performance, the company provided impressive guidance for the forthcoming quarter and also raised fiscal 2018 outlook.Palo Alto Networks raised outlook for fiscal 2018. The company now expects revenues to be in the range of $2.145-$2.185 billion, an improvement of 22-24% year over year compared with $2.125-$2.165 billion, projected earlier. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at $2.15 billion.Non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be in the $3.35-$3.41 band (mid-point $3.38 per share), up from $3.24-$3.34, anticipated earlier. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at $3.31 per share.For the fiscal second quarter, Palo Alto anticipates revenues in a range of $518-$528 million, up 23-25% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at $520 million. Non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be in the range of 78-80 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at 77 cents.Revenue growth seems to be steadily aided by strength across all its geographical regions and business segments. Customer wins along with expansion of the company's existing customer base are added positives. We believe that its product refreshes and acquisition synergies might boost top-line growth.Going forward, Palo Alto Networks is keen on expanding cloud exposure. To this end, the company recently expanded ties with VMware, Inc. Through the new collaboration, the company will combine its security platform with VMware's software platform, which provides private cloud-based service to make the cloud-computing environment more secure, simple, flexible and efficient.This deal is expected to better equip organizations to handle private cloud technology and control business applications securely. As VMware remains one of the leading companies in the virtualization and cloud computing space, we believe Palo Alto Networks might gain significantly from this collaboration.Nonetheless, a volatile spending environment and competition from Cisco Systems, Inc.  and Check Point Software Technologies Ltd.  remain concerns.A better-ranked stock in the broader technology sector is NVIDIA Corporation  , which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see  .NVIDIA has a long-term earnings per share growth rate of 11.2%.Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"n Nov 15,  was downgraded to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).The downgrade can primarily be attributed to the unimpressive third-quarter 2017 results of the company.In the last quarter, Juniper reported non-GAAP earnings of 55 cents per share that decreased 5.2% year over year primarily due to lower revenues, which fell 2.1% to $1.26 billion. Both Cloud and Telecom/Cable verticals did not perform well, resulting in a decline in the top and bottom-line figures.Juniper stock has lost 6.5% year to date, underpeforming the 3.5% gain of the  it belongs to.In the just reported quarter Juniper's Cloud revenues declined 4% year over year and more than 9% sequentially to almost $345 million. Management cited spending delay by cloud and hyper-scale customers to be the major cause of decline. This is also anticipated to drag the top line down in the current quarter as well.Juniper stated that the ongoing transition of cloud customers from 10-gigabit to 40-gigabit and 100-gigabit was the primary reason behind low revenues. Moreover, an architectural shift from scale-up architectures to scale-out architectures (lean core architectures, per Juniper) also hurt growth.The company's Telecom/Cable revenues declined for the second consecutive quarter, when compared on a year-over-year basis. Revenues declined 3.8% year over year to roughly $577 million in the third quarter. | Further, the company's expansion into low-margin markets like Asia-Pacific has negatively impacted customer mix. Additionally, the growing proportion of low-margin switch business in the product mix compared with the high-margin router business acts as a headwind for gross margin expansion.Unfavorable customer mix, higher costs of certain memory components and lower revenues resulted in 110 basis points (bps) decline in product gross margin.Costs incurred by spare parts in support of expansion of the company's installed base and higher delivery costs related to growth in emerging markets dragged down services gross margin by 30 bps during the quarter.Notably, Juniper faces strong competition from peers like Arista Networks  , Cisco Systems  and Check Point Software Technologies  , which will continue to be a headwind for the company.You can see Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@IEFA, NXPI, CHKP, TEVA: Large Inflows Detected at ETF@2017-11-08@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/iefa-nxpi-chkp-teva-large-inflows-detected-etf-2017-11-08

 yesterday delivered splendid third-quarter results. The cyber security solution provider's third-quarter results not only fared better than our estimates, but also marked significant year-over-year improvement.Despite this, shares of FireEye plunged nearly 14% during yesterdays' after-hour trade as the company's fourth-quarter guidance fell short of analyst expectations. Notably, the company, during its second-quarter conference call, had predicted to report its first ever positive non-GAAP operating income in 2017, which was expected to be reported in the fourth quarter. However, FireEye's recent outlook projects another quarter of loss.The company stated that its conservative fourth-quarter outlook reflects shorter contract lengths which have resulted in lower billions. FireEye noted that more customers are opting for one- or two-year contracts rather than going for three-year contracts.Nonetheless, shares of FireEye have made remarkable gain so far this year. The stock has returned 37.6%, significantly outperforming the  's gain of just 20.1%.Now let's discuss quarterly results first.The company's third-quarter revenues of $189.6 million increased 1.7% year over year and came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $186 million as well as its guidance of $183-$189 million.The company noted that its quarterly revenues mainly benefited from shift in the business model from product based to subscription based. Apart from this, improved sales execution, enhanced relationship with channel partners and product launches, including Helix and HX, were other main reasons behind this growth.Further, though billings dipped 6% to $201.7 million, but the figure was toward the higher-end of management's guidance range of $190-$205 million, mainly attributed to all the factors mentioned above.Segment wise, Product revenues plunged 30.5% year over year to $30.5 million. FireEye's strategy of transitioning its business to subscription and cloud-based offerings from hardware offerings was the main reason for the decline in product revenues. Subscription and Services revenues, on the other hand, rose 11.6% to approximately $159.1 million.Furthermore, FireEye continues to secure large deals. Notably, the company closed 43 transactions, with an individual value of over $1 million. The company also added 234 customers in the quarter.Non-GAAP gross profit increased approximately 2% from the year-ago quarter to $139.9 million. Gross margin expanded 20 basis points (bps) to 73.8% as the company has been able to deliver its subscriptions or services more efficiently.Non-GAAP operating expenses dropped 11.8% to $144.6 million. FireEye mentioned that it managed to bring down its non-GAAP operating expenses on a year-over-year and sequential basis, supported by the company's consistent focus on cost optimization and productivity.The company posted non-GAAP operating loss of $4.7 million, 82.4% narrower than the year-ago loss of $26.6 million. In addition, FireEye noted that its non-GAAP operating margin was -2.5% compared with -14.3% recorded in third-quarter 2016. The company stated that on a year-to-date basis, it has been able to reduce operating loss by $100 million on the back of increased operational efficiency and sales productivity.Non-GAAP net loss for the third quarter was approximately $6.5 million compared with the year-ago net loss of $29.4 million.Although, FireEye continued to report loss by posting non-GAAP loss of 4 cents per share in the third quarter, the figure was significantly narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 7 cents and the year-ago quarter's loss of 18 cents. The quarter's non-GAAP loss per share was also significantly narrower than management's loss guidance of 6-9 cents. Notably, this is the eighth consecutive quarter of better-than-expected results for the bottom line and year-over-year improvement. | FireEye exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments of approximately $878.8 million, marginally up from $875 million at the end of the previous quarter. Accounts receivable were $120.2 million compared with $110 million at the end of second-quarter 2017. During the first three quarters of 2017, the company used nearly $15.9 million of cash for operating activities.As the latest quarterly results have now provided more insight about its future prospects, the company revised its revenues and earnings outlook for 2017. FireEye now estimates revenues in the range of $739-$745 million (mid-point: $742 million) compared with the earlier guidance range of $734-$746 million (mid-point: $740 million). The guidance at the mid-point is slightly higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $740.8 million. Projections for billings have been lowered to $736-$756 million from earlier forecast of $745-$775 million.FireEye also lowered its non-GAAP loss per share projection for the full year. The company now anticipates posting non-GAAP loss of 16-19 cents per share, down from the earlier projection of 19-24 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the year is pegged at a loss of 21 cents.However, all other guidance for 2017 has been reiterated. As projected earlier, the company is expecting to generate operating cash flow for the first time ever in 2017 in the range of $1-$10 million. Capital expenditure is projected to be within $40 million and $45 million.Coming to the fourth quarter, the company anticipates revenues in the range of $190-$196 million (mid-point: $193 million), lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $195 million at the mid-point. Billings are projected in the range of $210-$230 million. Non-GAAP gross margin is estimated to be approximately 75%, while non-GAAP operating margin is projected to remain in the band of -1% to +1%. Operating cash flow is likely to be in the range of $16-$25 million.The company projects to report loss per share of 3 cents to breakeven. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at a loss of a penny.Notably, for the past several quarters, the company has been losing business to its rivals. FireEye faces stiff competition from other well-established players such as Check Point Software  and Fortinet  in the cyber security space. Furthermore, a shorter contract length is likely to adversely impact the company's near-term top-line performance.Nonetheless, there is an advantage to the shorter-length contracts as they generally generate higher margins compared with three-year contracts.Also, FireEye's management has been striving to turn around the business through a string of initiatives, which includes product launches, acquisition and cost optimization. We consider that FireEye's turnaround strategies are paying off as reflected from its back-to-back three quarters of splendid results.Additionally, although a shift from product-based to subscription-based business model will have a negative impact on FireEye's near-term results, we believe it will lead to more stable revenues over the long run.Currently, FireEye carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the same industry space is Imperva, Inc.  , sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

"rom a headline perspective, there wasn't a lot wrong with third-quarter earnings from network security company  (NASDAQ: CHKP) , but management's commentary and guidance may well have disappointed some corners of the market. Let's take a closer look at a mixed quarter.Image source: Getty Images.Starting with the headline numbers from the quarter:In a nutshell, revenue came in above the midpoint of guidance, and earnings were ahead.As you can see below, the revenue increase marks a reduction in the growth rate from the previous two quarters' growth:Data source: Check Point Software investor presentations. Growth is year over year.The reason why revenue growth slowed: As outlined on a call  , the Yom Kippur holiday fell on the last day of the Israeli company's third quarter. As such, it was difficult to predict the exact impact on the sales figures for the third quarter. However, if the weak-looking revenue in Q3 was merely due to a timing issue, presumably the Q4 numbers should look stronger. Unfortunately, this isn't the case.Before looking closer at what's going on, here is the fourth-quarter guidance:It's easy to see the midpoint of fourth-quarter guidance implies growth of just 4.2% -- a disappointing result. Moreover, the Q4 guidance is an implicit reduction of the company's previously stated full-year revenue guidance.For example, going back to the  , management forecast full-year revenue of $1.85 billion to 1.9 billion, but if you add the fourth-quarter guidance to the $1.349 billion in revenue for the first nine months, you get a range of $1.83 billion to $1.87 billion.On a more positive note, the fourth-quarter EPS guidance suggests full-year non-GAAP EPS in the range of $5.21 to $5.31, and this is ahead of the original full-year guidance of $5.05 to $5.25. However, J.P. Morgan analyst Sterling Auty asked a question relating to the fourth-quarter EPS guidance and CFO Tal Payne replied ""it's mainly in the taxes,"" so it's not really down to any kind of operational improvement.In a nutshell, the improvement in revenue in the fourth quarter meant to come from a shift in revenues from Yom Kippur wasn't enough to avoid lower implied full-year guidance.The problem in the quarter appears to have been mainly from what CEO Gil Shwed called ""execution challenges"" in the U.S. He declared himself ""cautious on our near-term execution,"" and referenced the expansion of the company's U.S. sales force and how it resulted in ""many new people in key positions.""Shwed went on to argue that the U.S. sales force would take time to reach its full potential and that this consideration was baked into the fourth-quarter guidance, and said that ""with all the new people in key positions in the U.S., our execution risk becomes higher.""Analysts quizzed Check Point's management as to whether the guidance reflected weakening end demand, but Shwed asserted it was down to execution.Most investors don't like uncertainty, and Check Point's immediate target should be to remove it with regard to execution in the U.S. The market will be looking for Check Point to make its numbers in the fourth quarter, and then give guidance that can imply that the execution challenges in the U.S. are coming to an end.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

On the conference call, Schwed said revenue in the fourth quarter is expected in the range of $485 million to $525 million, with non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.45 to $1.55.

ontinuing with its upbeat performance for the sixth straight quarter,  yesterday reported strong results for third-quarter 2017. Quarterly revenues came in at the higher-end of the company's expectations, while earnings came above the guidance range. Moreover, the top and bottom lines both surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate.Check Point's non-GAAP earnings per share (excluding stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets) of $1.30 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.24 and came in higher than the mid-point of its guidance range of $1.18-$1.28 (mid-point $1.23). Non-GAAP earnings also climbed approximately 15% on a year-over-year basis, driven mainly by elevated revenues, efficient cost management and a lower share count.Third-quarter revenues came in at $454.6 million, up 6.3% year over year, and also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $449 million. The figure also came close to the upper-end of the company's guidance range of $430-$465 million (mid-point $447.5 million). Quarterly revenues were mainly driven by strong adoption of its products particularly its Infinity platform which was launched in the third quarter.Furthermore, it should be noted that for the last few quarters Check Point has been witnessing sturdy performance of its small and midsize-enterprise product lines as the company has been able to penetrate through the midmarket and acquire new customers successfully. We believe this factor would also have positively influenced third-quarter results.Segment wise, the company witnessed sales growth of 5.7% in Products & Software Blades, and 7% in Software Updates and Maintenance. The company also reported a 22% surge in subscription revenues at Software Blades.Geographically, the Americas contributed 45% to revenues and Europe accounted for 37%, while the Asia-Pacific, Japan, and the Middle East and Africa added the remaining 18%.Talking about deal size, the number of new customers - who signed deals worth $1 million or more -totaled 60, down from year-ago quarter tally of 65. Also, customers, who signed deals worth $50,000 and more, contributed 74% to the total order value, which is equal to the third-quarter 2016 tally.On a year-over-year basis, non-GAAP gross profit climbed 6.8% to $404.1 million. However, as a percentage of revenues, gross profit contracted 40 basis points (bps) to 88.9%.Non-GAAP operating expenses flared up 4% year over year to $153.2 million. However, as a percentage of revenues, operating expenses contracted 80 bps mainly due to efficient cost management.Non-GAAP operating income came in at $250.8 million, up nearly 8.5% year over year. In addition, margins advanced 110 bps to 55.2% primarily due to higher gross margin and lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues.Non-GAAP net income was $215.3 million or $1.30 per share, up from $194.1 million or $1.13 reported in the year-ago quarter. | Check Point exited the third quarter with cash balances of approximately $3.865 billion, slightly up from $3.806 billion recorded at the end of the second quarter. During the first three quarters of 2017, the company generated operating cash flow of $841.5 million.In addition to this, during the third quarter, the company generated cash worth $259.8 million from operational activities, marking a 21% year-over-year improvement. The robust growth in operating cash flow is primarily attributable to strong collections from customers and a reduction in the tax advances paid to the authorities in Israel.Additionally, Check Point repurchased about 7.2 million shares for a total cost of $745.6 million in the first nine months of 2017.Despite reporting robust quarterly results, shares of Check Point dipped 8% during yesterday's trade as the company hinted that its fourth-quarter revenues might be hit slightly due to significant changes made in the U.S. sales force which may take some time to reach its full potential. The company noted that its key sales position has now been occupied by recently joined people making the execution risk higher. Therefore, the company is in a doubt if it can match the year-ago quarter's growth rate.Apart from this, the company also stated that it has been able to absorb some of the Yom Kippur effect in the third quarter which was earlier expected to be absorbed in the fourth quarter. Check Point incorporated this impact in its fourth-quarter revenue outlook.However, despite of all this, the company has maintained the outlook on full-year revenues, which signifies that it is optimistic about its long-term prospects.Notably, shares of Check Point have gained 39.4% year to date, outperforming the  's 26.7% rally.Taking into account the aforementioned factors, the company provided outlook for the fourth quarter. It expects to generate revenues between $485 million and $425 million (mid-point $505 million). The mid-point of the guidance is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $526.9 million. Non-GAAP earnings are projected in the range of $1.45-$1.55 per share. GAAP earnings per share are anticipated to be 15 cents lesser than the non-GAAP figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.48.For 2017, Check Point continues to anticipate generating revenues between $1.85 billion and $1.90 billion (mid-point $1.875 billion). The mid-point of the guided range is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.87 billion. Non-GAAP earnings are projected in the band of $5.05-$5.25 per share. GAAP earnings per share are anticipated to be 70 cents lesser than the non-GAAP figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $5.17.Check Point continues to report splendid quarterly results for the sixth consecutive quarter. The company's top and bottom lines not only came ahead of the respective guidance ranges at the mid-points, but also marked solid year-over-year improvement. Although the fourth-quarter outlook is slightly disappointing, we believe the company is well capable of mitigating the fourth-quarter revenue losses in the following quarter.Rapid adoption of Check Point's data-center appliances and continued enhancements in data-center product lines are expected to provide ample top-line support. The company's focus on enhancing mobile capabilities will enable it to tap greater larger opportunities. Furthermore, Check Point's strategy of growing through acquisitions is praiseworthy.Additionally, we believe Check Point Software will continue to benefit from strong demand for cybersecurity solutions. It should be noted that the financial well-being, brand image and reputation of enterprises, and governments are always exposed to the risk of cyber threats. Consequently, cybersecurity has become a mission-critical, high-profile requirement.Nonetheless, changing customer spending behavior, intensifying competition, an uncertain economic environment and currency fluctuations remain headwinds.Check Point currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the same industry are Imperva Inc.  , Fortinet  and Varonis Systems, Inc.  . While Imperva sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Fortinet and Varonis carries Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

"ranted, ""never"" is a very long time, but  (NYSE: PANW) is so far away from meeting, let alone exceeding, the  such as myself I can't imagine plunking down the $147 a share or so it's trading for today, let alone the $165.69 a share high it reached over the past 52 weeks.Palo Alto bulls will likely point to its 20%-plus revenue gains in the last couple of quarters and its nearly two-year string of 50%-plus improvements not long ago as positives. Its market capitalization of $13.6 billion, and the growth potential that represents in the fast-growing data security market, could also be viewed as bullish.Despite what some investors and pundits view as upsides, for me, the case against buying Palo Alto stock boils down to one glaring reason.Image source: Getty Images.Palo Alto's fiscal fourth-quarter revenue jumped 27% year over year to $509.1 million, beating analysts' expectations as well as the company's guidance. Of course, beating your own forecast is fairly common since CEOs tend to under-promise so they can subsequently over-deliver, but still, Palo Alto's total revenue was a positive.For the year, Palo Alto's $1.8 billion in sales was good for a 28% increase, and deferred revenue climbed 43%, also to $1.8 billion. Deferred sales are a good indication that Palo Alto's better-late-than-never push to boost its recurring revenue via subscriptions is getting results.Another positive note was, as per CEO Mark McLaughlin, that Palo Alto inked ""the highest number of new customer additions"" in its history last quarter. Unfortunately, the fact that Palo Alto's revenue gains are so dependent on it making new sales is also one of its fundamental weaknesses, particularly compared to rivals such as  (NASDAQ: CHKP) . More on that shortly.Guidance for the current quarter of revenue in the $482 million to $492 million range would equate to growth of 21% to 24%, which by most standards would reflect a nice start to Palo Alto's fiscal year -- except for a few matters that still need to be addressed.A glance at Palo Alto's statement of operations speaks volumes as to why I'd never buy its stock. Despite a 27% rise in revenue, its earnings sank 20% to a loss of $0.42 a share compared to last year's $0.35 a share. The culprit? Continued spending that's bordering on out of control.To his credit, McLaughlin has promised to curb expenses, particularly on the sales and marketing fronts. To say ""it's about time"" for that would be an extreme understatement, considering Palo Alto's costs have been sky high for years.Last quarter's $245.4 million in sales-related costs equaled an astounding 48% of total revenue, and believe it or not, that too was an improvement compared to quarters gone by.For some perspective, Check Point -- which is well along its way to its objective of  of sustainable, recurring revenue -- generated $458.57 million in sales last quarter. Check Point's top-line growth of 8% was nowhere near Palo Alto's, but the $114.68 million it spent on sales and marketing equaled just 25% of total sales -- nearly half Palo Alto's 48% -- which is why its EPS climbed 18% to $1.12 a share.I understand the bullishness surrounding Palo Alto; many investors like seeing revenue growth. But investors like myself are not impressed until growth trickles down to the bottom line. Unfortunately, Palo Alto is a long, long way from making that happen.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Shutterstock photoLegendary investor Warren Buffett advises to be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful. One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.In trading on Wednesday, shares of Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd. (Symbol: CHKP) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 27.3, after changing hands as low as $105.25 per share. By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) is 69.1. A bullish investor could look at CHKP's 27.3 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. The chart below shows the one year performance of CHKP shares:    Looking at the chart above, CHKP's low point in its 52 week range is $80.78 per share, with $119.20 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $105.10.According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, CHKP makes up 10.83% of the iShares MSCI Israel Capped ETF (Symbol: EIS) which is trading lower by about 1% on the day Wednesday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@RSI Alert: Check Point Software Technologies Now Oversold@2017-11-01@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/rsi-alert-check-point-software-technologies-now-oversold-2017-11-01
ontinuing with its upbeat performance for the fifth straight quarter,  , yesterday, reported better-than-expected results for third-quarter 2017, wherein revenues and earnings came ahead of the company's expectations, and also surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate.Fortinet reported third-quarter revenues of $374.2 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $371 million and up 18.2% year over year. Segment wise, Product revenues increased 7% year over year to $137.1 million, while Services revenues jumped 26% to $237.1 million.The year-over-year improvement was primarily aided by growth in sales productivity and success in selling multiple product deployments. A large number of deal wins and customer additions during the reported quarter also proved conducive to top-line growth.During the third quarter, the company witnessed 18% year-over-year growth in the number of deals worth over $100,000, while the number of deals worth more than $250,000 and $500,000 climbed 26% and 50%, respectively.Billings were up 24% on a year-over-year basis to $431.7 million.Non-GAAP (excluding stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets) gross profit jumped 20.8% from the year-ago quarter to $283.4 million. Moreover, gross margin expanded 170 basis points (bps) to 75.7%, primarily backed by sales of higher-value subscription bundles. It also came ahead of management's expectation of 75%.Furthermore, the company efficiently managed its operating expenses this quarter. As a percentage of revenues, non-GAAP operating expenses contracted 250 bps year over year to 57%. In dollar terms, however, the figure advanced 13.1% to $213.2 million.Non-GAAP operating profit surged 52.5% to $70 million from approximately $45.9 million in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating profit margin expanded 420 bps to 18.7%, mainly attributed to improved gross margin and efficient cost management. Operating margin also surpassed the company's guidance range of 16-17%.Fortinet's non-GAAP earnings per share of 28 cents beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 23 cents. Also, earnings came in higher than management's guidance range of 22-23 cents and marked a solid improvement over the year-ago quarter's earnings of 18 cents, driven mainly by higher revenues and efficient cost management.Fortinet exited the reported quarter with cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments of approximately $1.28 billion, up from $1.21 billion recorded at the end of the second quarter. Accounts receivable were $258 million compared with $271.1 million recorded at the end of the previous quarter.During the first three quarters of 2017, the company generated operating cash flow of $436.9 million. Free cash flow for the first nine months of the year came in at $315.2 million. Fortinet bought back 3.25 million shares for $124 million during the first three quarters of 2017.This month management also announced an increase of $400 million in share repurchase authorization, bringing the total authorization amount to $1 billion.Despite reporting impressive third-quarter results, Fortinet lowered its revenue and billings guidance for the full year, and provided a disappointing outlook for the current quarter.For 2017, management now projects revenues in the range of $1.482-$1.490 billion (mid-point: $1.486 billion), down from the earlier guidance of $1.487-$1.495 billion (mid-point: $1.491 billion). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $1.49 billion. Billings forecast has also been trimmed to $1.772-$1.787 billion from $1.775-$1.795 billion.Nevertheless, the company anticipates that its cost-management initiatives to drive its margins and earnings per share. Therefore, it raised its non-GAAP gross and operating margin projections to 75% and 17%, respectively. Earlier guidance ranges for gross and operating margin were 74.5-75% and 16.2%, respectively.Similarly, non-GAAP earnings per share are now estimated to come between $1.00 and $1.02 (mid-point $1.01), up from the range of 94-96 cents (mid point: 95 cents) predicted earlier.The company's forecasts for the fourth quarter are slightly lackluster. Management expects revenues in the range of $404-$412 million (mid point: $408 million), which is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $416.59 million at mid-point. Billings are estimated in the range of $510-$525 million.Non-GAAP earnings per share are anticipated to come in the band of 28-30 cents (mid point: 29 cents). Although, it is a penny higher than the Consensus Estimate, but represents a year-over-year decline of 3.3%. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be in the range of 75-76%, whereas non-GAAP operating margin is anticipated to be between 18% and 19%.Fortinet's network security solutions include firewall, VPN, application control, antivirus, intrusion prevention, web filtering, anti-spam and WAN acceleration. The company reported better-than-expected third-quarter results. Despite persistent macro uncertainties, management seems to be optimistic on the back of a healthy network security market, solid product line-up and investment plans.Despite all these, shares of Fortinet dropped approximately 8% during yesterday's after-hour trade, as investors seemed concerned over the company's slowing revenue growth rate. Notably, over the last five quarters, the company's revenue growth rate has been around 20%, significantly lower than its previous rates of over 30%. Additionally, Fortinet's third-quarter revenue guidance marks an even lower growth rate of 11.3-13.6%.In addition to this, competition from key network security players such as Cisco Systems Inc.  , Check Point  , Juniper Networks  and Palo Alto Networks, remains a concern.Nonetheless, we believe Fortinet's initiative to change its business model to subscription-based service provider will continue to drive the company's bottom-line results. Subscription-based service is a high gross margin business (approximately 80%) compared with the hardware-centric model.Notably, the company generates over 50% of the total revenues from these services, which helped it generate a 170 bps gross-margin expansion in the third quarter. We anticipated this strategy will continue to improve the company's bottom-line performances as well.Fortinet has outperformed the  to which it belongs to in the year-to-date period. The stock has returned 33.1%, while the industry registered growth of 26.3% during the same time frame.Currently, Fortinet has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

hether you are a retiree or simply an investor who doesn't want to toss and turn all night worrying about your portfolio, you have plenty of investment options that offer growth, and possibly some income, but won't keep you up at night.Two technology companies that come to mind for similar reasons are data security provider  (NASDAQ: CHKP) and the undisputed king of design software,  (NASDAQ: ADBE) . The third company on my list today,  (NYSE: IBM) , is another option for risk-averse investors, but for a different reason. Let's start with Check Point.Image source: Check Point.With a market capitalization of $19.6 billion, referring to Check Point as an industry leader may not seem appropriate. However, CEO Gil Shwed's decision over two years ago to focus on cloud software subscription sales has not only set a new standard among the company's peers, it's also  while limiting risk.Last quarter's $459 million in revenue was an 8% increase over the corresponding period a year ago. That may not sound impressive, but Check Point's subscription sales and the recurring revenue they generate soared 27% to $118 million. Combined with the $202.4 million in servicing and updates revenue, the two stable, recurring revenue drivers accounted for 70% of Check Point's second-quarter top line.Check Point's business model also reduces sales-related overhead. Last quarter's $114.7 million in sales expenses were just 25% of total revenue. Many of Check Point's peers spend nearly half their revenue on their respective sales efforts. The result of Check Point's lean overhead is continually skyrocketing per-share earnings, including last quarter's 18% rise to $1.12 a share. Growing, reliable revenue and a consistently improving bottom line make Check Point a risk-averse investor's dream stock.Image source: Adobe.Adobe posted yet another record-breaking quarter last month, with $1.84 billion in revenue. Like Check Point, Adobe's top line takes a backseat to its outstanding subscription sales. It's been several years since CEO Shantanu Narayen did away with product sales of its popular Creative Cloud suite and began offering it only as a monthly subscription. After the initial pushback from customers, the model has now become the foundation of Adobe's stellar growth.Last quarter's 27% increase in total sales  , but better still was the 34% rise in Adobe subscription revenue to $1.57 billion. In other words, 85% of Adobe's third-quarter top-line results were generated from its stable, recurring revenue efforts.And it gets better.Exiting the quarter, Adobe's deferred revenue climbed to a staggering annual run rate of $4.87 billion. Thus, the company is ideally positioned to continue posting strong results for years to come. Again like Check Point, Adobe's recurring revenue business is driving outstanding bottom-line growth. Last quarter's $0.84 a share was an eye-popping 56% improvement over 2016.Image source: IBM.The recent 9% jump in share price the day after IBM announced better-than-expected revenue and earnings per share (EPS) excluding one-time items, as well as strong growth in its key strategic imperatives, may leave some conservative investors concerned about downside risk.The good news, beyond IBM's strong third quarter, is that it remains one of the least expensive stocks in its sector. At just 13.4 times trailing-12-month earnings, IBM stock is valued at less than half its peer group average of 28.7, and its stock boasts a meager valuation of 11.5 times forward earnings.It took IBM longer than expected to get its transition off the ground, which is why it's so inexpensive, but  . Its $8.8 billion in strategic-imperative sales -- cloud, data analytics, cognitive computing, and mobile -- made up 46% of the company's $19.2 billion in revenue. IBM's 3.75% dividend yield and bargain-basement valuation make it ideal for risk-averse growth-and-income investors.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and IBM wasn't one of them!

"f course the definition of a ""no-brainer"" stock will vary depending on individual likes and dislikes, but we asked a few Foolish investors to pick three with a solid track record that don't require babysitting.With that in mind, three no-brainer stocks worth consideration are cybersecurity provider  (NASDAQ: CHKP) , e-commerce behemoth  (NASDAQ: AMZN) and shares of the happiest place on earth,  (NYSE: DIS) . :  For me the first thing a no-brainer stock needs is consistency. In other words, a stock that not only has a strong track record but has also positioned itself to maintain its historically strong performance. Check Point Software hits all the right consistency buttons.It's unlikely there will be anything scary about Check Point's third-quarter earnings scheduled for Oct. 31. Investors can expect high single-digit revenue growth, and double-digit gains in both earnings per share (EPS) and all-important software subscriptions sales, just as it did last quarter.Check Point's 8% spike in revenue last quarter to $459 million is only part of the story. Subscription sales and the reliable foundation of recurring revenue they represent jumped 27% to $118 million, and combined with the $202.34 million from software updates and service, 70% of Check Point's total revenue is ongoing. Thanks to its focus on  via its software subscriptions, Check Point's sales and marketing costs are well below that of its peers.Expense management helped boost Check Point's EPS 18% to $1.12 last quarter, and Check Point shareholders can rest easy knowing it has $1.06 billion in deferred revenue on the books, a 19% jump year over year. Deferred revenue is a pretty good indication the future will bring more consistent growth.Don't expect blowout quarters of 25% plus top-line increases; that's not how Check Point has positioned itself for the long term. What investors can expect is more of the same positive, reliable results, which is why it's an ideal no-brainer stock.Image source: Getty Images. Sure, you probably think you know everything there is to know about Amazon. But if you're still thinking that the company is primarily focused on online retail, then it's time to revisit Amazon.It's true that Amazon's North American retail business is a huge revenue generator, bringing in $79.7 billion in 2016. But it's the company's cloud service, Amazon Web Services (AWS), that's bringing in most of Amazon's profits. AWS generated $3.1 billion in operating income for the company in 2016, more than the company's $2.3 billion in North American retail sales over the same time.The company reported its second-quarter results back in August, and AWS revenue grew by 42% year over year, an impressive feat considering that Amazon is a leader in the cloud computing market right now with 40% market share.Additionally, Amazon is currently investing in a plethora of new businesses that could pay off years down the road. For example, the company's recent $13.7 billion  puts it squarely in the U.S. grocery market. That opens up not just a massive opportunity for food sales, but the potential to dominate  , grocery pickup services, and Amazon's own food delivery service.If all that weren't enough, Amazon has increasing potential with its voice-enabled Echo devices, which already hold 70.6% of the voice-enabled speaker market.  RBC Capital Markets estimates this subsegment of Amazon's business could bring in $10 billion in sales by 2020.Amazon is, of course, a pricey stock. The company currently trades at about 140 times its forward earnings. But Amazon's dominance in cloud services and e-commerce is already strong and has more room to grow. And the company's other bets on connected devices, grocery stores, drone delivery,  , etc. mean that Amazon is investing in new markets now that could have big payoffs for years to come. (Disney): With shares down roughly 6% year to date, Disney might not seem like the """"no-brainer"""" stock that it has been in the past. The company's lagging performance is understandable in the face of challenges facing its media networks and other near-term uncertainties, but I think the House of Mouse still has what it takes to be a great performer.Disney's strengths are pretty well documented at this point. It owns the world's most valuable collection of entertainment properties and enjoys strong synergies between its theatrical, theme parks, media networks, and consumer products segments. With that in mind, let's take a look at some of the recently visible threats in order to get a better picture of the company's outlook.As my colleague Leo Sun recently pointed out, foot traffic at the company's  fell last year while attendance at Comcast's Universal resorts actually increased. That's hardly encouraging, but Disney still has avenues to growth in the segment thanks to price increases and international expansion.Turning to the movies, overall box office performance has come in below expectations this year. But, while the overall movie industry is slumping compared to 2016, Disney's last quarter saw its film segment record a 21% increase in operating income despite a 1% increase in sales.

"n addition to their stellar returns in 2017, with  (NASDAQ: ADBE) stock up 45% and  (NASDAQ: CHKP) shareholders enjoying a 35% gain year to date, the two tech mainstays also share another attribute ideal for investors that hate risk: low volatility.If the notion of wild share price swings keeps you up at night, Adobe's and Check Point's similar business models limit the chances of a roller-coaster ride some investors are subjected to. How have they accomplished their stable, but steady performance? They had an eye toward the future and the patience necessary to make it a reality.Image source: Getty Images.It's been several years since CEO Shantanu Narayen made the critical decision to no longer offer Adobe's industry-leading design software on a one-off purchase basis. Instead, Narayen ""forced"" Adobe customers -- thousands of whom voiced their angst bemoaning the move -- to pay around $50 a month and up, depending on which solutions were needed, on a recurring basis.Fast forward to today, and Adobe is not only  , it's doing so by successfully implementing Narayen's vision. Last quarter's $1.84 billion in revenue was an impressive 26% jump over a year ago. Adobe CFO Mark Garrett attributed the record-breaking quarter to ""revenue driven by our cloud based subscription offerings."" He sure got that right.Annual recurring revenue (ARR) climbed over $300 million last quarter to a jaw-dropping $4.87 billion. In other words, even without inking any new software subscriptions, as it stands today Adobe would still bring in nearly $5 billion in revenue over the next 12 months. It's not likely subscription sales will slow anytime soon. While total sales increased 26%, Adobe's subscription revenue climbed 34% to $1.57 billion.Another benefit to Adobe's transition to an ARR business model is expense management. Yes, Adobe's operating expenses rose last quarter, but only by 16%, which was minimal considering its sales growth. The result was a whopping 56% increase in per-share earnings to $0.84 compared to last year's $0.54 a share. No one's complaining about Narayen's ""bold"" business realignment now.Like Adobe, Check Point founder and CEO Gil Shwed has also implemented a cloud-based software subscription model, for several years. Initially, impatient investors tended to focus on Check Point's peers, who were posting 50%-plus revenue gains quarter in, quarter out, while Shwed and team were reporting around 8% and 9% sales jumps. It simply takes longer to build a revenue foundation of ongoing sales than hoping for a large number of new customers.But if imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, Shwed is probably blushing as virtually every  of Check Point's is now laser-focused on building its own base of recurring revenue. Check Point's last quarter was a good indication of why subscription sales are now the industry norm.In the second quarter, Check Point's revenue climbed 8% to $459 million, a pleasant surprise given Wall Street's expectations. The better news was the 27% jump in recurring subscription revenue to $118 million. Toss in the $202.34 million generated from its subscription updates and maintenance unit, and $320.3 million of Check Point's total revenue, equal to 70%, is now reliable and ongoing. And the percentage of stable revenue relative to total sales is growing with each successive quarter.As is the case with Adobe, Check Point's relatively meager increase in operating expenses to $236.9 million, up about 7%, helped boost its bottom line from last year's $0.95 per-share earnings to an impressive $1.12 per share last quarter.Consistently growing where it counts -- specifically recurring revenue and bottom-line profitability -- on a relatively slow but steady basis is what Adobe and Check Point bring to the table.The result of delivering on their initiatives? Two steady businesses for investors who hate risk.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"ith its stock up 38% this year and share price bumping up against 52-week highs,  (NASDAQ: CHKP) may not be one of the first investments a conservative investor would look at closely.It isn't Check Point's staggering top-line growth that makes the company stand out. Competitors like  (NYSE: PANW) and  have better growth rates. What makes Check Point a potential gold mine for conservative investors is how it's successfully transformed its business.Image source: Getty Images.In the age-old fable, it's the hare that sports the flash but the tortoise ultimately wins the race. A similar situation applies to Check Point. A couple of years ago, CEO Gil Shwed began aggressively moving Check Point away from the traditional sales business model of relying on (hopefully) big sales to new customers to drive growth.Instead, because of his conservative leadership, Shwed opted to focus on driving Check Point's software subscription sales, seeking to build a stable and reliable stream of ongoing revenue. Though short-term investors weren't entirely happy with the shift, Check Point had its eyes focused on the future -- and today's  .Last quarter's $459 million in total revenue was a solid, if not spectacular, 8% improvement year over year. Of its total sales, Check Point's recurring revenue subscriptions climbed 27% to $118 million. The 26% of Check Point's total sales that recurring revenue represents may not impress. Not only is that figure growing with each successive quarter, but there's also a bit more to the story.When you add in the $202.34 million Check Point generated from servicing its software customers and providing updates, subscriptions -- either on the front end or the back --was $320.34 million, equal to 70% of total revenue. Not surprisingly, that is another metric that is steadily increasing.Another benefit to Check Point's adherence to an ongoing revenue approach is that it simply costs less to service and provide software updates to existing customers than the expenses associated with an overreliance on new sales. Check Point peer and competitor Palo Alto Networks is an ideal example that showcases the differences between the two methodologies.Palo Alto reported an impressive 27% rise in revenue last quarter to $509.1 million. Sounds good, right? However, Palo Alto also reported  of $245.4 million. It cost Palo Alto what amounted to 48% of its revenue to drive its top-line results. When it was all said and done, Palo Alto's per-share loss was $0.42, 20% worse than last year's $0.35 a share loss.The polar opposite was true in Check Point's quarter, despite ""only"" growing its top line 8%. For the quarter, Check Point's sales and marketing expenses totaled $114.68 million, equal to just 25% of its total revenue. That just over half the proportion of total revenue that Palo Alto spent on sales and marketing costs.The differences are also evident on Check Point's bottom line, which is not only profitable but becoming more so on a consistent basis. Last quarter's $1.12 per-share earnings was an 18% increase over 2016's $0.95 a share. Check Point's per-share profits are steadily growing at a phenomenal rate given its quarterly revenue gains are generally in the high single digits.If there was ever a buy-and-hold stock that won't keep investors up at night, Check Point is it. Strict expense management, steady revenue growth, and an outstanding bottom line that keeps increasing its profitability are why Check Point could be a gold mine for conservative investors.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

" is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 31. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 3.3%. Notably, Check Point Software has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, generating an average positive earnings surprise of 6.6%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.We believe Check Point Software will continue to benefit from strong demand for cybersecurity solutions. It should be noted that the financial well-being, brand image, and reputation of enterprises and governments are always exposed to the risk of cyber threats. Consequently, cybersecurity has become a mission-critical, high-profile requirement.With rapid technological advancement, organizations are increasingly adopting the ""bring your own device"" (BYOD) policy to enhance employee productivity with anytime/anywhere access. This trend, in turn, calls for stricter data security measures.Moreover, various independent research firms had forecast strong demand in 2017. Gartner had predicted that worldwide Information Security Spending would reach $90 billion in 2017, marking 7.6% growth from the 2016 level of approximately $83.6 billion.We anticipated that Check Point Software must have capitalized on this opportunity and believe this might be well reflected in the company's results in the quarter to be reported.Furthermore, the rapid adoption of Check Point's data-center appliances and the continued enhancements in the data-center product lines are estimated to provide adequate support to revenue growth. Additionally, the company's continuous share buybacks bode well for investors.However, competition from Cisco, Juniper Networks and Fortinet  , an uncertain economic environment and currency headwinds remain concerns.Notably, shares of Check Point have gained 37.2% year to date, outperforming the  's 26.3% rally.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Check Point Software will likely beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Earnings ESP for the third quarter is pegged at -1.72%. This is so because the Most Accurate estimate of $1.22 is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.24. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . Check Point Software carries a Zacks Rank #3. Though Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 increases the predictive power of ESP, the company's negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are a couple of stocks, which you may consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases:NVIDIA Corporation  with an Earnings ESP of +0.53% and a Zacks Rank of 1. You can see  .Extreme Networks, Inc.  with an Earnings ESP of +9.75% and a Zacks Rank of 3.Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

"ybersecurity specialists  (NASDAQ: CHKP) and  (NASDAQ: FEYE) have enjoyed divergent fortunes on the stock market after their latest set of results. While Check Point's light forward guidance issued in July took a toll on investor confidence, FireEye has gone from strength to strength on the basis of robust growth in its subscription business that helped it post a sunny outlook. data by  .But does FireEye's momentum make it a better bet than Check Point, or does the latter offer more value after its latest dip? Let's take a look.Image source: Getty Images.FireEye has executed a terrific turnaround after  to the year, thanks mainly to accelerated growth in the subscription business, which has brought  within its reach. As it stands, the cybersecurity player now gets 83% of its revenue from the subscription side of the business, up from 77% in the year-ago quarter.The company has vastly reduced its reliance on product revenue (which fell 23% year over year last quarter) as it shifts gears to bring in more subscription revenue. The strategy has worked wonders for FireEye's margins, helping it cut down the loss per share from $0.33 to just $0.04 year over year.This isn't surprising: Higher subscription revenue means the company has to spend less money on customer acquisition, as it gets repeat purchases and recurring revenue from its existing client base. As a result, it cut its operating expenses by almost a fourth on a year-over-year basis last quarter, driven by a steep decline of 26% in sales and marketing outlay.In the quarters ahead, FireEye's push toward profitability will probably be helped by the Helix security platform, which now offers comprehensive cybersecurity features to customers after the addition of new modules. This  allows it to be deployed by small and big clients alike, paving the way for FireEye to tap the security-as-a-service space that is estimated to grow at an annual rate of 19% until 2021.In fact, FireEye is already reaping the benefits of the comprehensive Helix platform in the form of an increase in cross-selling of other services. CTO Grady Summers has pointed out that FireEye saw ""more than $2 of additional product and subscription pull-through for every $1 that a customer spent on Helix"" over the second quarter.So FireEye should be able to sustain its impressive momentum, provided it keeps executing its subscription strategy flawlessly.Check Point Software's recent troubles are a result of Yom Kippur, a holiday in Israel (where the company is based), falling on the last day of the quarter this year. The company has taken  and issued low guidance since it gets a substantial amount of business during the closing days of the quarter.So investors shouldn't be hitting the panic button as the company's long-term growth story is still intact. Like FireEye, Check Point is now relying more on subscription sales to boost profitability.The company saw a 27% spike in sales of subscription blades (security applications and modules) last quarter, pushing its subscription business to 25% of overall revenue. As a result, Check Point's operating expense growth slowed down to less than 8% last quarter as compared to the double-digit growth seen over the past couple of years.Check Point can afford to spend more money to push its subscription business as it is spending less than 25% of its revenue on sales and marketing. By comparison, FireEye spends around 48% of its revenue on selling and marketing.Furthermore, Check Point is looking to capitalize on the recent spate of cyberattacks through its recently launched consolidated security platform -- Check Point Infinity. This architecture can provide security across different platforms, including the cloud, enterprise networks, and mobile.This integrated security platform puts Check Point at par with other cybersecurity providers such as FireEye, allowing it to provide multiple threat-prevention and detection modules to organizations of varying sizes. More importantly, Check Point is financially well-placed to push this platform to more customers, which could be a key differentiator when considered as an investment alongside FireEye.Check Point has a solid cash position of $1.6 billion and no debt. This compares favorably to FireEye's cash position of $870 million and debt of $760 million. Check Point, therefore, can afford to either take on debt or spend its cash to attract more customers by way of product development or by pouring more money into sales and marketing.Furthermore, Check Point has already attained profitability and it can keep getting better as subscription sales increase. On the other hand, FireEye needs to rapidly bring down its expenses to get where Check Point is, and it will be prone to volatility if it fails to live up to Wall Street's expectations. As a result, Check Point Software seems to be the safer cybersecurity play right now, given its track record and robust balance sheet.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

 (NASDAQ: CHKP) has been on a roll this year, winning over investors with its  on enhancing earnings by boosting its subscription business. But fellow cybersecurity provider  (NYSE: PANW) has remained out of favor so far in 2017, underperforming the broader market thanks to a  earlier in the year. data by However, Check Point's rally came to an  in July due to light third-quarter guidance, while Palo Alto seems to be moving in the right direction as its  indicated improvements in the company's sales performance.But does this make Palo Alto the better buy over Check Point? The answer to this question is far from settled despite the performance discrepancy, as both stocks could appeal to investors with different risk appetites.Image Source: Getty ImagesPalo Alto Networks' sales reorganization has worked wonders in recent quarters. The company's top-line growth has hit a higher gear as customers are purchasing more subscription services. The average customer lifetime of Palo Alto's top 25 customers increased 56% from the prior-year quarter to $21.9 million.So, Palo Alto's relationship with its top customers has become more valuable thanks to regular product updates that are driving subscription sales. In fact, the subscription business now supplies close to 60% of the company's revenue, having shot up 54% during the recently concluded fiscal year.Palo Alto has managed to achieve such stupendous subscription growth thanks to its strategy of capitalizing on hot cybersecurity trends. The company equipped its security platform with  in the previous quarter in a bid to protect customers against the WannaCry cyber attack that affected several computers across the world.Not surprisingly, Palo Alto added 3,000 clients in the previous quarter. Additionally, ransomware protection is going to open up a huge opportunity as this market is estimated to hit $17 billion in the next four years.The company's focus on increasing subscription revenue will help it keep a tab on costs as repeat purchases by existing customers will lower customer acquisition costs.Palo Alto now must focus on reducing costs and increasing margins on the back of a stronger subscription business to strengthen its long-term investment case.Check Point Software Technologies has been an investor favorite this year, as its 30%-plus gains suggest. The stock recovered remarkably since its July 20 report as investors sensed that the post-earnings drop could be an opportunity to buy since its weak third-quarter guidance was a result of a calendar event.Check Point Software's sales will be affected by the Yom Kippur holiday in Israel, which will fall on the last day of the third quarter. The company pulled in $30 million worth of business toward the end of the second quarter, so the one-off guidance miss seems justified. Not surprisingly, investors jumped at the opportunity to buy more shares, since Check Point's subscription business growth and strong balance sheet could be long-term catalysts.The company now gets a quarter of its revenue from subscriptions. This is positively impacting its margin profile as the cost of selling subscriptions is just 4.5% of the segment's revenue, much lower than the 19% outlay in the products and licensing business. Additionally, Check Point management is conservative when it comes to spending money on marketing.The company spent less than 25% of its revenue on sales and marketing last quarter, which is almost half of Palo Alto's spending. Not surprisingly, Check Point has delivered steady earnings growth in recent quarters, as shown below: data by What's more, Check Point management's focus on keeping costs low and improving the bottom line on the back of steady top-line growth has helped the company maintain a debt-free balance sheet. It also has a substantial cash pile of $1.6 billion, which can be put to good use to attract more customers through research and development, marketing spend, or even acquisitions.Therefore, Check Point Software could be a good long-term bet if it continues to execute well on growing its subscription business.Investors looking for a value play in the cybersecurity space will definitely be more inclined toward Check Point. The company's  of 25 is slightly lower than the industry median of 26.The profitable Check Point could be a good choice for investors seeking a safe bet in the industry. But those having a higher risk appetite and looking for aggressive growth will be inclined toward Palo Alto. Its revenue grew almost 28% last fiscal year, but at the same time, the generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net loss had also jumped over 35% to $216.6 million.However, Palo Alto is trying to chart a path toward profitability. It has started getting a lid on costs by building a recurring revenue stream, which should lead to improved margins in the long run.

 glance at  's (NASDAQ: FEYE) second-quarter earnings may raise more questions than answers that explain why its stock has soared 50% this year. But digging a bit deeper shines a bright light on a number of areas CEO Kevin Mandia has delivered on in the past year.Mandia made his objectives clear when he took the CEO reins in June 2016, and the strides he and the FireEye team have already made in a relatively short period of time demonstrates why its  is warranted. FireEye is hardly out of the woods, but the light at the end of the tunnel is why its stock could be a goldmine for growth investors.Image source: Getty Images.One of FireEye's core objectives is shifting its focus from a reliance on generating new product sales. The goal is to transition to a cloud-based software subscription model to build a stable foundation of recurring revenue, much like FireEye's peers including  (NASDAQ: CHKP) .FireEye's $185.5 million in revenue was a surprisingly strong 6% increase year over year. Though FireEye's sales beat expectations and resulted in another stock price boost, it was the revenue mix that growth investors should focus on.Product sales in the quarter sank 23% to $31.2 million, and are down 26% to $54.95 million in the first half of the year. That may not seem like a win, but it's in line with Mandia's focus on building a steady stream of revenue.The decline in product sales was more than made up for by the $154.27 million in cloud software subscription revenue, good for a 15% jump compared to a year ago. A primary reason FireEye could be a gold mine for growth investors is that it will likely report similar growth where it counts -- subscriptions -- for the current quarter on Nov. 1.There is an additional benefit to building a foundation of on-going revenue, and FireEye nailed it again last quarter: lower operating expenses, particularly sales overhead.FireEye was able to shave an impressive 24% off its total operating expenses last quarter, down to $178.21 million. There's still a long road ahead, but to cut overhead that dramatically in just a year is not only a significant step in the right direction, it bodes well for the future.A particular area of focus of FireEye, and its industry peers, is cutting sales costs which will be made easier by its recurring revenue efforts. FireEye can look to Check Point as the poster child for managing sales expenses. Last quarter Check Point spent $114.68 million on sales-related overhead, equal to a meager -- relative to its competitors -- 25% of its $458.73 million in total revenue.Though FireEye is making headway, sales expenses still command a hefty piece of its revenue. The good news was last quarter's $89.63 million in sales and marketing costs was a 26% decline. The not-so-good news is FireEye's sales costs still equal 48% of total revenue.However, like Check Point -- which to be fair is much  to lower-cost recurring software subscription sales -- FireEye should be able to continue paring expenses.Sure, there's more work to be done, but FireEye's expense management efforts are already paying off. Excluding one-time items, last quarter's operating margin of -3% was a fraction of the prior year's -28%. FireEye's bottom line also benefited from paring overhead.Though still in the black, FireEye reported an adjusted loss-per-share of $0.04, a quantum leap in the right direction compared to 2016's disastrous loss of $0.33 a share.If FireEye can string together more strong quarterly results, there's little doubt it could be an absolute gold mine for growth investors, as current shareholders know first-hand.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The cybersecurity industry has been on a bullish trend, of late, thanks to the series of cyber attacks over the last few months. Among these, the recently reported cyber attack at  (NYSE:  ) is believed to be the most malicious, in which very sensitive personal data of approximately 143 million consumers was stolen from the company's database. Source: ShutterstockReportedly, nearly two-third of the adult U.S. population has been adversely affected due to this cyber attack. The data breach at the company is likely to have a lasting impact as criminals can use the stolen resources for opening new accounts, applying for credit cards or loans, buying insurance, renting an apartment or even make tax frauds.While the world was still recuperating from this shocking attack, another massive cyber crime hit headlines last Monday (Sep 18), when Avast reported that its CCleaner security software has been infected with a malware, exposing over 2 million users. The sensitivity of this attack can be understood with the fact that the criminals tried to infect machines of technology and telecoms companies, including biggies like  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ), per a report by Cisco Systems.Based on the aforementioned back-to-back cyber crimes, cybersecurity stocks are on a roll now.  (NYSEARCA:  ) has gained 2.3% in a month's time. In 2017, so far, the ETF has returned 12.8%, outperforming the S&P 500 (GSPC) gain of 11.4%.Apart from the above discussed attacks, the bullish momentum is well supported by the two back-to-back ransomware attacks - WannaCry or WannaCrypt in May and Petya in June - which created global havoc. In both cases, the malicious software reportedly seized control of computers and encrypted files with a password which only hackers have access to. After this, victims were asked to pay ransom in order to regain control of the systems. The hackers demanded ransom in bitcoin.Though billions of dollars and data are lost due to cyber crime, there is a positive side to it. Cybersecurity companies stand to gain from data breaches as the chances of security-related purchase shoot up.Furthermore, with rapid technological advancement, organizations are increasingly adopting the bring your own device (BYOD) policy to enhance employee productivity, with anytime/anywhere access. This trend, in turn, calls for stricter data security measures.We believe the urgency for stricter security measures will compel enterprises, as well as governments to increase spending on cyber security software. According to a Markets and Markets July 2017 report, worldwide cybersecurity spending will likely reach $137.85 billion this year and $231.94 billion by 2022.Here we focus on three stocks that are anticipated to benefit from this elevated spending. (NASDAQ:  ) is a specialized provider of a security platform against cyber-attacks to enterprises and governments. The company's consistent efforts toward bringing in new and advanced products have been attracting a wide range of customers. Notably, FireEye's Essentials product, which is a lower-cost and simpler version of the FireEye Global Threat Management platform, targets smaller and mid-market companies. This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company's Cloud MVX and MVX Smart Grid offerings, a lower-cost intelligent threat detection solution, targets large enterprises as well as mid-market businesses. You can see  .Furthermore, the company's move of shifting its business model to subscription-based cloud services from selling software is praiseworthy. Though shifting the business model to subscription-based services will generate lower revenues initially, but the same will be stable over the long run, as organizations usually renew subscriptions with the existing products or even with higher versions. Moreover, subscription-based services generate higher gross margins.Additionally, last year's acquisition of iSIGHT Partners strengthened the company's capabilities by offering an intelligence-led security model for enterprises of any size that other security providers finds difficult to match. FireEye has also taken over Invotas, a firm specializing in improving response times following a cyber-attack. Its product, Security Orchestrator, is designed to compile information from a range of security products and automate responses when an incident occurs. (NYSE:  ) allows firms, service providers and government bodies to impose tighter security measures through its network security platform. The company is growing rapidly on the back of its innovative next-generation security platforms. Its security platforms have innovative traffic classification engine that helps it identify network traffic by application, user and content. Palo Alto's security platforms simplify security infrastructure for organizations by eliminating the need for multiple, stand-alone security appliances, and software products. This reduces the total cost of ownership, thereby giving the organization a competitive edge.Also, we believe its strategic acquisitions with the likes of LightCyber, Morta Security and Cyvera will continue to bolster revenues. These acquisitions helped this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company expand the functionality of its enterprise security platform, in turn bringing in more and more customers.Additionally, Palo Alto has made strategic partnerships with the likes of VMware and Aruba Networks to expedite growth.

 recently unveiled its management and automation platform, Cisco Intersight. The platform is designed to be compatible with the company's Unified Computing System (UCS) and HyperFlex Systems so that adoption related complexity can be avoided.Cisco Intersight is aimed to simplify data center operations with its systems management as-a-service offerings and reduce the requirement of on-premise management system. The platform also provides system lifecycle management via its machine learning, analytics and automation technologies.With the advancement of cloud infrastructure, hybrid cloud and multicloud technologies are gaining higher adoption rate. The need for scalable, multi-site deployment based on cloud containers and other micro-services has increased the need for management and policy regulations.Cisco Intersight, which will be available in the fourth quarter of 2017, is well-equipped to address all these issues. The platform will have two versions, The Cisco Intersight Base Edition and The Cisco Intersight Essentials Edition.We anticipate this platform, with its upgraded features, to gain widespread acceptance. This will impact the company's top line positively. Shares of Cisco have gained 11.1% year to date, outperforming the  rally of 10%.Per a recent article by Accenture Research, artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to increase productivity by almost 40% by 2035. Information and Communication, Manufacturing and Financial Services industries will be the top gainers from AI growth.In one of its recent reports, MarketsandMarkets stated that the data center solutions market is expected to grow from $18.56 billion in 2015 to $32.30 billion by 2020 at a CAGR of 11.7% during the mentioned time frame. | We believe Cisco with its enhanced product portfolio is poised to gain from the growth of the industries. Notably, the completion of the acquisition of hyperconvergence software provider  that was announced in August 2017 will strengthen its solutions suite, thereby improving the top line for Cisco.Nevertheless, stiff competition from industry peers like Amazon's  Web Services, Arista Networks  , Check Point Software Technologies  , F5 Networks and FireEye remains a concern for the company.Cisco currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

"ith its stock up 26% year to date, some investors may think it's a bit late to board the  (NASDAQ: FTNT) train. The good news is Fortinet, like many of its peers, is still in the process of transitioning to a recurring revenue model via its cloud-based security software subscriptions, and there's a way to go before it hits the finish line.That said, as investors saw again last quarter, Fortinet is making significant progress, and it's evident on both its top and bottom lines. It wasn't long ago the notion of generating a profit, let alone significant bottom-line growth, seemed little more than a pipe dream. But for a host of reasons, those days are gone, which is why it's time to get greedy with Fortinet stock.Image source: Getty Images.The $363.5 million in revenue Fortinet generated in the second quarter of 2017, a pleasantly surprising 17% jump year over year, got much of the press, and rightfully so. Fortinet's revenue ""beat"" resulted in a stock price pop, and its increased guidance for the current quarter and the balance of 2017 added to the good tidings.But Fortinet's strong sales took a back seat to a few other key areas that demonstrated dramatic improvement and, assuming it can continue to perform -- which there seems little doubt it can and will -- are the real reasons it's time for some greediness.A primary initiative of founder and CEO Ken Xie is to boost Fortinet's steady and reliable recurring revenue foundation, and in that regard last quarter was an unmitigated success. Product sales inched up a mere 4.4% in the second quarter to $142.5 million, which was right in line with Fortinet's relatively new revenue goals.The so-so product sales gain was more than offset by Fortinet's whopping 26% increase in service revenue to $220.8 million. And with $1.16 billion in deferred revenue on the books, up 28% over a year ago, it's safe to say Fortinet's ongoing service-related revenue improvements will continue in the quarters and years ahead.One of the benefits of Fortinet's focus on recurring revenue is that it costs less to service existing customers than rely solely on new sales. Though Fortinet still has some work to do, particularly as it relates to spending on sales and marketing, last quarter was another example its efforts in controlling costs are taking hold.Operating expenses inched up a mere 3.6% to $239.3 million compared to a year ago. Considering Fortinet's 17% jump in revenue, the minor increase in spending is more than acceptable. However, an area to monitor is Fortinet's sales costs, which at $166.34 million last quarter equaled 46% of total revenue, a bit high but improving with each successive quarter.For some perspective, Fortinet's peer and competitor  (NASDAQ: CHKP) spent $114.7 million on sales and marketing last quarter, equal to just 25% of its $458.6 million in sales. Granted, Check Point is further along in its transformation to a subscription-based, recurring revenue model, but it serves as an example of what Fortinet investors can look forward to in the future.Ultimately, for fundamental investors at least, top-line growth is fine, but are revenue gains translating to increased profits? In Fortinet's case, its continued sales improvement combined with its expense management efforts is showing where it counts.Last quarter, Fortinet generated earnings per share (EPS) of $0.13, which blew the doors off last year's loss of $0.01 a share. Adjusted EPS, a metric often cited to account for one-time costs, also surpassed expectations, nearly doubling to $0.27 compared to 2016's second quarter of $0.14 a share.Growing revenue where it counts, getting a handle on expenses, and ballooning profits are why it's time for investors to get greedy with Fortinet stock.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"t times, it is prudent to hold on to certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed down by tough market conditions.  seems to be one such stock, which investors should hold on to if they are looking to reap long-term benefits. Though the stock is facing a few headwinds at the moment, these are transitory in nature. There is enough scope for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company to rebound in the long run.In fact, Check Pointstock has gained 46.3% in the last one year, outperforming the  's rally of 14.9%.We believe that Check Point Software will continue to benefit from strong demand for cybersecurity solutions. Notably, the financial well-being, brand image and reputation of enterprises and governments are always exposed to the risk of cyber threats. Consequently, cybersecurity has become a mission-critical, high-profile requirement.With rapid technological advancement, organizations are increasingly adopting the ""bring your own device"" (BYOD) policy to enhance employee productivity with anytime/anywhere access. This trend, in turn, calls for stricter data security measures.Per IDC's new report, corporate spending on threat intelligence security services will reach $1.4 billion in 2018 from an estimated $905.5 million in 2014. Another research firm, MarketsandMarkets, projected that the global threat intelligence security market will touch approximately $5.86 billion by 2020 from $3.0 billion in 2015, representing a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 14.3%. These predictions bode well for Check Point.Furthermore, the rapid adoption of Check Point's data center appliances and the continuous enhancements in data center product lines are expected to provide adequate support to revenue growth. The company's focus on enhancing mobile capabilities will enable it to tap greater larger opportunities. Moreover, the company's strategy of growing through acquisitions is praiseworthy.Additionally, its continuous share buybacks bode well for investors. The company has an expected EPS growth rate of 9.8%. Notably, the stock has delivered positive earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 6.6%.Check Point faces competition from numerous big and small companies in the security application market. As Internet threats and attacks increase, stiff competition will follow suit. Moreover, we believe that its dominance could be challenged by new entrants.Further, changing customer spending behavior, an uncertain economic environment and currency fluctuations add to the woes.We expect the aforementioned factors to help the company sustain strong momentum and stay afloat amid difficult times. Consequently, we suggest that investors hold on to the stock for the time being.Currently, Check Point carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks worth considering are Applied Materials, Inc.  , Micron Technology, Inc.  and NVIDIA Corporation  , all sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see  .Applied Materials, Micron and NVIDIA have a long-term expected EPS growth rate of 17.1%, 10% and 10.3%, respectively.Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"he good news for both  (NYSE: PANW) and  (NASDAQ: CHKP) is that the long-awaited rise of the cybersecurity market appears to be taking hold. Virtually all of Palo Alto's and Check Point's peers have enjoyed a banner 2017, and there are no signs of slowing.Check Point stock has climbed an impressive 34% in 2017, while Palo Alto shares have climbed a more modest 15%. But it's not what's happened in the recent past that separates the two -- it's the manner in which each has conducted its respective business that makes one the better buy, by a wide margin.Image source: Getty Images.The $509.1 million in sales for the fiscal fourth quarter 2017 was a pleasantly surprising 27% jump year over year, which put the icing on a solid fiscal year of $1.8 billion in revenue, equal to a 28% improvement. This quarter's guidance, which was slightly disappointing but not unexpected, was for a modest 21% to 24% rise to $482 million to $492 million.The days of Palo Alto's  each quarter are a thing of the past, though spending remains sky-high. Palo Alto added more customers last quarter than ever before and spent heavily to do it.Last quarter's operating expenses jumped 24% to $397.9 million, 62% of which -- equal to $245.4 million -- were sales and marketing-related costs. CEO Mark McLaughlin has vowed to manage overhead more diligently, beginning with curbing sales spending. However, Palo Alto's sales and marketing costs still equaled a mind-boggling 48% of total revenue last quarter.The result of Palo Alto's overhead was a 20% decline in per-share earnings to negative $0.42 compared to last year's loss of $0.35 a share, despite its 27% revenue gain. The primary reason Palo Alto posted a non-GAAP per-share gain of 39% to $0.92 a share, was because the figure does not account for the $120.9 million the company forked out in share-based compensation. An acceptable accounting practice but one that many people -- myself included -- believe skews the numbers a bit.Last quarter's results for CEO Gil Shwed and team couldn't have been more different compared to Palo Alto. Check Point's $459 million in revenue was also a pleasant surprise, just as with Palo Alto's, but that was an 8% increase year over year. Unlike Palo Alto, Shwed has always been stingy about spending, which has sometimes pressured Check Point's stock price.However,  the wisdom of Shwed's adherence to minimizing overhead -- one reason Check Point consistently grows the bottom line, as it did again last quarter. For some perspective, in contrast to Palo Alto spending nearly half its total revenue to drive sales, Check Point's $114.7 million in sales-related costs represented only 25% of total revenue.Yes, Check Point's revenue climbed just 8%, but its earnings per share (EPS) jumped 18% to $1.12 a share. The more manageable expenses associated with Check Point's longtime adherence to its software subscription model -- which drives stable, recurring revenue -- is a big reason it reports EPS growth quarter in, quarter out.Last quarter, Check Point's subscription revenue soared 27% to $118 million. And when you toss in the $202.34 million in subscription updates and service, approximately 70% of Check Point's total revenue is ongoing.Given time, Palo Alto's expense management efforts combined with its top-line growth could prove to be a boon for patient investors in search of growth. However, Check Point's much further along in controlling overhead, which helps drive increased profits with each successive quarter.Check Point's total revenue growth may not have the ""wow"" factor that Palo Alto's does, but it's hitting on all cylinders where it counts, which is why Check Point is, hands-down, the better buy.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"isk is unavoidable -- however, several stocks have positioned themselves in a way that still offers growth potential while mitigating risk, unlike high-growth stocks that are years away from profitability but consistently ""wow"" investors with stunning top-line growth.Software design king  (NASDAQ: ADBE) , cloud infrastructure provider  (NASDAQ: CSCO) , and data security leader  (NASDAQ: CHKP) , have opted for a different approach to growing their respective businesses. For investors who appreciate reliable, relatively predictable profitability, you'll love these three stocks.Image source: Getty Images.When Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen made the decision over four years ago to switch from a software sales to a cloud-based, subscription-only business model, designers were outraged. How dare Narayen pull the rug out from underneath Adobe's loyal design customers and make them pay an average of about $50 a month for its solutions.Investors weren't necessarily happy, either, given that at $50 a month, give or take, Adobe's top line was going to take a near-term hit. Fast-forward to today, and it's apparent  in spades. Adobe's $1.77 billion in sales last quarter was an impressive 27% jump from a year ago and helped boost its stock to what has become a 52% gain in 2017. But Adobe's top line wasn't the best part of its stellar quarter.A jaw-dropping $1.48 billion of Adobe's revenue was from its stable software subscriptions, a 37% improvement over a year ago. Adobe's operating expenses only increased 20%, much of which was funding new, cutting-edge technologies including artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual reality (VR) features. Servicing clients costs less than relying on product sales, and Adobe shareholders are reaping the rewards.Unlike Adobe,  is up just 7% this year, due largely to declining total revenue which investors witnessed again last quarter. Cisco reported $12.1 billion in sales in its fiscal fourth quarter, a 4% drop year over year. Excluding one-time items, earnings per share (EPS) dropped 3% to $0.61 from last year's $0.63 a share. Not much to get excited about, right?Thing is, CEO Chuck Robbins is in the early stages of implementing his own recurring revenue model, and that takes time. Already, $3.75 billion of Cisco's sales are recurring, equal to 31% of total revenue, which was a nice improvement from last year's 27%. In what has become a recurring theme, adjusted operating expenses, another Cisco initiative, dropped 7% last quarter.A couple more  were the 12% jump in deferred revenue to $18.5 billion, which bodes well for its recurring revenue push, along with continuing to pay one of the tech industry's best dividends of 3.6%. It's early, but Cisco is on the right path and offers investors little risk and a ton of potential reward.Last year's somewhat disappointing data security market is gone, which is just one reason Check Point Software's stock is up 32% in 2017. Second-quarter sales of $459 million marked a surprising 8% increase, which for Check Point is bordering on stellar. Why? Because like Adobe and Cisco's early stage shift to reliable recurring revenue, Check Point founder and CEO Gil Shwed is all about subscriptions.Check Point's product revenue inched up 1% to $138.3 million in the second quarter, but that was more than made up by its whopping 27% rise in subscription sales to $118 million. Toss in Check Point's software servicing revenue of $202.34 million, and a full 70% of total sales are now subscription-related.Shwed's  is also falling directly to Check Point's bottom line. Last quarter's EPS climbed 18% to $1.21 a share, something Check Point shareholders are becoming accustomed to. Check Point, like Adobe and Cisco, may not have the flash of some of its competitors, but if you hate risk you'll love all three of these stocks.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

You'll Love These 3 Stocks@2017-09-14@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/hate-risk-youll-love-these-3-stocks-2017-09-14
Last week, analysts at Morgan Stanley posted some encouraging words regarding cybersecurity outfit  (NASDAQ:  ), ultimately setting the stage for its upgrade of FEYE stock. Specifically, the bank upped its opinion of FireEye stock from equal weight to overweight, the highest rating Morgan Stanley's ever had of FireEye, suggesting even it is finally coming around to the company's recent reconfiguration of its business model into a subscription-based business. Still, this is a name that's not getting a whole lot of love from Wall Street; the consensus target price of $16.68 is only about 4% better than the stock's current value of around $16.50 per share, and most analysts still deem it a mere hold despite clear sales growth and a continued march to profitability.It begs the question: What does Morgan Stanley see in FEYE that few others see? A close second question: Is Morgan Stanley right?The timing of the upgrade couldn't have been more fortuitous. Morgan Stanley upgraded FireEye stock during Thursday's trading session, and, after that day's closing bell rang,  (NYSE:  ) announced a  sending a clear message that companies still aren't doing enough to protect themselves from hackers. All told, 143 million consumers may have had at least some of their financial information exposed to people who would nefariously use it.The news lit a bullish fire under FEYE stock, not to mention its cybsersecurity rivals like  (NYSE:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ); a major data breach usually does manage to put these names in the spotlight.Whatever the case, Morgan Stanley's upgrade was limited to FireEye, irrespective of the Equifax debacle.  :In other words, investors don't think FireEye is doing as well as it actually is, setting the stage for at least one pleasant surprise with a future earnings report.The irony? While the analyst community is essentially lukewarm on FireEye, those very same analysts have still collectively called for appreciable revenue growth and continued progress toward profitability. The graphic of its top and bottom lines - past and projected - tells the story clearly enough.Click to EnlargeNot only are investors not adequately pricing in the growth Morgan Stanley sees on the cards, analysts aren't quite as bullish on the stock despite their own optimism regarding the company's results. Perhaps Franchi is on to something.The proverbial hang-up for analysts, most likely, is the lack of clear profits thus far. It's coming though, thanks to FireEye's relatively new flagship product Helix.Helix was created shortly after Kevin Mandia  , replacing Dave DeWalt.He was certainly no stranger to the business. Mandia was the founder of the cybersecurity company called Mandiant, which FireEye acquired in 2014; it more or less became the organization we know as FireEye today. By November, Mandia had directed the development of a comprehensive cybersecurity solution that was cloud-based and  , rather than offered via a one-time purchase.Such a model is a trade-off. Rather than big but inconsistent revenue wins with high margins, the model lays the groundwork for a lower-margin but more reliable revenue stream. It's a business plan that affords a company to know how much money is coming in and going out in any given month, allowing that organization to get a grip on its finances - one of the frustrations with FireEye before Mandia took the helm.The key upside for FireEye? Once a customer is in the fold and has perpetual access to an always-updated cybersecurity suite, they tend to stick around. Each new customer FireEye's sales team adds translates into more recurring revenue without (necessarily) more expenses. The trick is just achieving enough scale to turn a profit, which most think will start to happen late next year.While the notion of investing in a stock before that company has proven it can turn a profit may seem outlandish to some, that's not exactly how the modern market works. It's the trajectory of a company's results that largely determines the trajectory of its stock. To that end, Melissa Franchi's upgrade makes a lot of sense, even if few others see which direction FireEye is headed.There may be less speculative and more stable names out there, but if you were looking for one last good reason to own FEYE, you just got it.The post ) Stock! appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Forget the Bears – Buy FireEye (FEYE) Stock!@2017-09-19@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/forget-the-bears-buy-fireeye-feye-stock-2017-09-19

hares of  (NASDAQ: CHKP) rallied about 30% this year and easily outperformed the NASDAQ's 20% rally. Those gains were fueled by robust demand for its enterprise security solutions -- which include next-gen firewalls, threat prevention, data protection, and secure gateway services.Check Point offers these services in application bundles called software blades, which are installed into a company's IT framework. After booking initial product and license fees, Check Point generates consistent revenue from those customers with subscriptions. For mainstream consumers, Check Point offers ZoneAlarm, an antivirus and firewall suite with free and premium tiers.Source: Getty Images.Looking ahead, I think Check Point still has room to extend its year-long rally. Let's examine the four major catalysts that could propel the stock to fresh highs.The global cost of cybercrime damage -- which includes a wide range of data breaches, ransomware, and other hacks -- could double from $3 trillion in 2015 to $6 trillion in 2021, according to Herjavec Group's 2016 Cybercrime Report.Cybersecurity Ventures predicts that damage from ransomware attacks alone could surge from $325 million in 2015 to $5 billion this year. The firm also estimates that cybersecurity spending will reach $1 trillion between 2017 and 2021.This makes 24-year-old Check Point, widely regarded as a pioneer of the cybersecurity industry, a go-to company for securing enterprise networks. The company already provides services to over 100,000 small to medium-sized businesses worldwide.Unlike many younger cybersecurity companies, which post volatile double-digit sales growth, Check Point usually generates slow but steady single-digit growth. Its revenue rose 9% annually to $459 million last quarter, beating estimates by $4 million.Its products and licenses revenue rose just 1%, but its software blades subscription revenues surged 27% and accounted for 26% of its top line -- versus 22% in the prior year quarter. The growing weight of Check Point's subscription revenues stabilizes its sales growth and reduces the need to constantly chase new customers -- which can cause its marketing costs to spike.Deferred revenues, a key indicator of future demand, rose 19% annually to $1.1 billion. Wall Street expects the company's annual revenue to rise 8% to $1.87 billion this year.Check Point is based in Israel, a market which generally doesn't pay the exorbitant stock bonus packages of its Silicon Valley peers. Last quarter, Check Point spent just 5% of its total revenues on stock-based compensation (SBC) expenses.Source: Getty Images.By contrast,  (NYSE: PANW) , which  by a former Check Point employee, is based in Silicon Valley. That's why Palo Alto spent 24% of its revenue on SBC expenses last quarter.Palo Alto and many of its Bay Area peers exclude SBC expenses from their non-GAAP earnings, but remain  on a GAAP basis, which includes those expenses.Check Point is profitable by both non-GAAP and GAAP measures. Its non-GAAP earnings rose 16% annually to $1.26 per share last quarter, while its GAAP EPS rose 18% to $1.12. Analysts expect its non-GAAP earnings to improve another 10% this year.Check Point trades at just 25 times earnings, which is significantly lower than the industry average P/E of 118 for application software makers. Its forward P/E of 16 looks even cheaper, assuming that the company hits the Street's modest growth targets.Check Point generated $972 million in free cash flow over the past 12 months. That growth gives it plenty of room to pursue additional acquisitions.Source: Check Point previously bought smaller companies -- like stealth-mode security start-up Hyperwise and mobile security firm Lacoon -- and it was  privileged accounts management solution provider  (NASDAQ: CYBR) last year. Shrewd acquisitions across the security market could widen Check Point's moat against any potential challengers.If you're looking for a conservative cybersecurity play with stable top line growth, consistent profitability, and low valuations, Check Point fits the bill. It's one of the only cybersecurity companies I'd consider owning in this frothy market, and its core business has plenty of room to grow as cybersecurity spending accelerates worldwide.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

" ' (NASDAQ: CHKP) stock market rally was brought to an  last month after the company released its second-quarter results. Though the cybersecurity specialist beat Wall Street estimates for revenue and earnings, investors were disappointed by guidance that turned out to be worse than expected.But the dip in the company's share price could be an opportunity for those looking for a solid long-term play on cybersecurity. Here's why.Image Source: Getty ImagesCheck Point Software expects its third-quarter revenue to fall between $430 million and $465 million, the midpoint of which is lower than the consensus expectation before earnings of $463 million. Additionally, the company expects earnings in the range of $1.18 to $1.28 per share ($1.23 at the midpoint), while the Wall Street estimate was $1.27 per share.The Israel-based company's management is putting the blame for the weak guidance on Yom Kippur, which happens to fall on the last day of the quarter. ""During Yom Kippur, the entire country is at a complete shutdown, and we won't be able to operate any business activities,"" said CEO Gil Shwed during the latest conference call. ""Given that and the fact that usually a substantial amount of business arrives in the last day, that may result in a significant shift in revenues despite our effort to manage the process.""Check Point generated over $30 million in revenue during the closing days of the second quarter. So it isn't surprising to see why it expects a slowdown during the third quarter.But the good news is that Check Point hasn't changed its full-year guidance, which means that the company expects business to just shift from one quarter to the next.Check Point Software's software blades subscription business jumped an impressive 27% year over year to $112 million during the second quarter, leading to overall revenue growth of 8%. The company's spending on software blades subscriptions was about 3.6% of revenue from the segment, much better than the 19% in the products and licenses segment. So Check Point Software's subscription business will boost the company's margin profile as its contribution to overall revenue grows. The subscription business now accounts for just over a quarter of the company's revenue as compared to less than 22% in the prior-year period.More importantly, further growth in the subscription business will also boost Check Point's software updates and maintenance business. This will lead to recurring revenue in the long run without any additional spending on customer acquisition. In fact, the growing contribution from the company's subscription business helped keep the increase in its operating expenses last quarter to just 7.7% after two years of double-digit growth.Check Point Software Technologies' recent dip has made the stock cheap when compared to the overall industry. Its trailing price to earnings (P/E) ratio of 23 is lower than the industry's median P/E ratio of 26.6. Furthermore, the stock's forward P/E ratio of 18.6 indicates that its bottom line is expected to get stronger in the future.What's more, this cybersecurity play doesn't have any debt, while it has a strong cash position of $1.6 billion. By comparison, peers such as  and  have substantial debt . Therefore, Check Point has the option of tapping the debt markets in a bid to boost its spending on marketing or research and development, which will eventually enhance its earnings in the long run.Investors, therefore, shouldn't get carried away with just one bad outlook as Check Point Software is pulling the right strings.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Check Point Software Technologies wasn't one of them!

In line with this view, the company recently expanded ties with VMware, Inc.  . Through the new collaboration, Palo Alto Networks will combine its security platform with VMware's software platform, which provides private cloud-based service to make the cloud-computing environment more secure, simple, flexible, and efficient.This deal will better equip organizations to handle private cloud technology and control business applications securely. As VMware remains one of the leading companies in the virtualization and cloud computing space, we believe Palo Alto Networks will gain significantly from this collaboration.Nonetheless, a volatile spending environment and competition from Cisco Systems, Inc.  and Check Point Software Technologies Ltd.  remain concerns.Currently, Palo Alto Networks carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see  .It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

"etworking giant  (NASDAQ: CSCO) is best known as one of the world's top manufacturers of routers and switches. Since both are slow-growth businesses in commoditized markets, Cisco is generally considered a ""mature"" tech stock with limited growth potential.However, some investors overlook the fact that Cisco's  business is actually cybersecurity. Let's discuss how big Cisco's cybersecurity business is, and why it represents a major threat to its smaller industry rivals.Image source: Cisco.Cisco's cybersecurity revenue rose 13% annually, to $1.97 billion in fiscal 2016. Its revenue rose 12%, to $1.6 billion the first nine months of 2017, and it should easily cross the $2 billion mark when it reports its year-end earnings after the close on Aug. 16.Two-billion dollars represents just 4% of Cisco's projected revenues of $48 billion for 2017, but its double-digit growth crushes the low single-digit gains or dips that the routing and switching businesses typically report.Two-billion dollars is also a massive figure compared to other comparable players in the cybersecurity sector. Next-gen firewall vendor  (NYSE: PANW) is expected to generate just $1.7 billion in revenues this year. Its rival  (NASDAQ: CHKP) is expected to generate about $1.9 billion in revenue.Meanwhile, Wall Street expects threat-detection company  (NASDAQ: FEYE) to generate about $740 million in sales this year.  (NASDAQ: CYBR) , the market leader in privileged account-management solutions, is expected to generate just $255 million in sales.Cisco's cybersecurity business generates more revenue than all those companies, but it's still smaller than  (NASDAQ: SYMC) -- the 800-pound gorilla in the cybersecurity market, which is expected to generate $5.2 billion in revenues this year.Cisco mainly grew its cybersecurity business through acquisitions. It bought Cognitive Security, Sourcefire, and ThreatGRID to beef up its firewalls and threat-detection systems. Acquiring companies like CloudLock, Lancope, Portcullis, and OpenDNS further enhanced its security capabilities in both on-premise and cloud-based networks.Image source: Getty Images.Since 2000, Cisco acquired about two dozen security-related companies. That streak won't likely end anytime soon, since Cisco generated $12.7 billion in free cash flow over the past 12 months. Moreover, 96% of its $68 billion in cash and equivalents remains overseas, and lower corporate tax rates would enable it to repatriate that cash for domestic acquisitions.Cisco has a long history of crushing competitors by bundling its routers, switches, and software together in cost-competitive packages for big enterprise customers. Cisco already offers a wide range of next-gen firewalls to compete against Palo Alto and CheckPoint, and its suite of threat-detection solutions targets FireEye's similar services.These smaller competitors have dedicated customer bases, but Cisco's ability to bundle security services with other hardware products or software services (like collaboration solutions) could steal away bigger customers.Therefore, it isn't surprising that Palo Alto, FireEye, and other high-growth security companies have recently posted decelerating sales growth. There's also the belief that Cisco will eventually  smaller ""best in breed"" players, like FireEye, to inherit their customers.The growth of Cisco's cybersecurity business won't offset the sluggish sales of its routers and switches anytime soon. Nor will it address the  of generic ""white box"" hardware and open-source software.Nonetheless, investors should know that Cisco is one of the biggest cybersecurity companies in the world. That position perfectly complements its position as a top networking hardware and software maker, and represents a major threat to stand-alone security players like Palo Alto and FireEye.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

t seems that  's  turnaround efforts such as product refreshes, acquisitions and cost optimization are paying off, as reflected from the company's splendid second-quarter results, along with the overwhelming third-quarter and 2017 outlook, which were released yesterday. The cyber security solution provider's second-quarter results not only fared better than our estimates, but also marked a significant year-over-year improvement.Although, FireEye continued to report loss by posting adjusted loss (excluding one-time items but including stock-based compensation) of 26 cents per share in the second quarter, the figure was significantly narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 39 cents and the year-ago quarter's loss of 68 cents.On a GAAP and non-GAAP basis as well, the year-over-year comparisons were favorable. On a GAAP basis, the company reported loss of 40 cents per share, while it had reported a loss of 86 cents in the year-ago period.On a non-GAAP basis, FireEye posted loss per share of 4 cents compared with a loss of 33 cents in second-quarter 2016. The quarter's non-GAAP loss per share was also significantly narrower than management's loss guidance of 10-14 cents (mid-point: 12 cents). Notably, this is the fourth consecutive quarter of better-than-expected results for the bottom line and year-over-year improvement.A better-than-expected quarterly result, along with a solid outlook, boosted the confidence of investors, thereby sending the company's shares up over 6% in yesterday's after-hour trade.Notably, shares of FireEye have made remarkable gain since its first-quarter 2017 results were reported on May 2. The stock has returned 20.3% since then, significantly outperforming the  's gain of just 4.9%.FireEye's top-line performance was encouraging too. The company's second-quarter revenues of $185.5 million not only registered a year-over-year increase of 6%, but also came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $176 million as well as its guidance of $173-$179 million (mid-point: $176 million).The company noted that quarterly revenues mainly benefited from shift in business model from product based to subscription based. Apart from this, improved sales execution, enhanced relationship with channel partners and product launches, including Helix and HX, were other main reasons behind this splendid top-line performance.Further, though billings decreased 12% to $172 million, but the figure was toward the higher-end of management's guidance range of $155-$175 million, mainly attributed to all the factors mentioned above.Segment wise, Product revenues plunged 23.5% year over year to $31.2 million. FireEye's strategy of transitioning its business to subscription and cloud-based offerings from hardware offerings was the main reason for the decline in product revenues. Subscription and Services revenues, on the other hand, rose 14.9% to approximately $185.5 million.Furthermore, FireEye continues to win large deals. Notably, the company closed 27 transactions, with an individual value of over $1 million. The company also added 221 customers in the quarter, bringing in total customer counts to over 6,000.Non-GAAP gross profit increased approximately 7% from the year-ago quarter to $136.4 million. Gross margin expanded 100 basis points (bps) to 74% as the company has been able to deliver its subscriptions or services more efficiently.Non-GAAP operating expenses decreased 19.7% to $141.7 million. FireEye mentioned that it managed to bring down its non-GAAP operating expenses on a year-over-year and sequential basis, supported by its consistent focus on cost optimization and productivity.The company posted non-GAAP operating loss of $5.3 million, 89.2% narrower than the year-ago loss of $49 million. Moreover, FireEye noted that its non-GAAP operating margin was -3% compared with -28% recorded in second-quarter 2016. The company stated that on a year-to-date basis, it has been able to reduce operating loss by $100 million on the back of increased operational efficiency and sales productivity.Non-GAAP net loss for the second quarter was approximately $7.3 million compared with the year-ago net loss of $52.7 million. | FireEye exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments of approximately $870.8 million, slightly down from $875 million at the end of the previous quarter. Accounts receivable were $110 million compared with $105.1 million at the end of first-quarter 2017. During the first half of 2017, the company used nearly $28.4 million of cash for operating activities.Buoyed by impressive first-quarter results, improved operational efficiency and sales productivity, as well as healthy demand for intelligence-led security products, FireEye issued a strong outlook for the third quarter and raised guidance for the full year.As the latest quarterly results have now provided more insight about its future prospects, the company raised revenues and earnings outlook for 2017. FireEye now estimates revenues in the range of $734-$746 million (mid-point: $740 million), up from the earlier guidance range of $724-$736 million (mid-point: $730 million). The upbeat guidance at the mid-point is significantly higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $731.93 million.FireEye also lowered its non-GAAP loss per share projection for the full year. The company now anticipates posting non-GAAP loss of 19-24 cents per share, down from the earlier projection of 26-36 cents.However, all other guidance for 2017 has been reiterated. Billings are still expected to be in the range of $745-$775 million. Additionally, the company continues to forecast to report its first ever positive non-GAAP operating income in 2017, which it expects to be the fourth quarter.As projected earlier, the company is expecting to generate operating cash flow for the first time ever in 2017 in the range of $1-$10 million. Capital expenditure is projected to be within $40 million and $50 million.Coming to the third quarter, the company anticipates revenues in the range of $183-$189 million (mid-point: $186 million), almost in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $186.62 million. Billings are expected in the range of $190-$205 million. Non-GAAP gross margin is estimated to be approximately 73%, while non-GAAP operating margin is projected to remain in the band of -4% to -6% of revenues. The company projects non-GAAP loss per share of 6-9 cents. Operating cash flow is likely to be in the range of $1-$10 million.Notably, for the past several quarters, the company has been losing business to its rivals. FireEye faces stiff competition from other well-established players such as Check Point Software  and Fortinet  in the cyber security space.Nonetheless, FireEye's management has been striving to turn around the business through a string of initiatives, which includes product launches, acquisition and cost optimization. We consider that FireEye's turnaround strategies are paying off as reflected from its back-to-back two quarters of splendid results, and solid outlook for the third quarter and full year.Additionally, although a shift from product-based to subscription-based business model will have a negative impact on FireEye's near-term results, we believe that it will lead to more stable revenues over the long run.Currently, FireEye carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the same industry space is Imperva, Inc.  , sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see  .The stock has an expected long-term EPS growth rate of 25%.From driverless cars to artificial intelligence, we've seen an unsurpassed growth of high-tech products in recent months. Yesterday's science-fiction is becoming today's reality. Despite all the innovation, there is a single component no tech company can survive without. Demand for this critical device will reach $387 billion this year alone, and it's likely to grow even faster in the future.Zacks has released a brand-new Special Report to help you take advantage of this exciting investment opportunity.

he hype surrounding the cyber security industry has heated up this year given a surging stock market and increased cyberattacks. In fact, many stocks rallied to multi-year highs, suggesting that the industry is thriving. The latest quarterly earnings results bear testimony to this as most of the cyber security firms beat our earnings and revenue estimates, and raised their guidance for the full year (read:  ).However, robust earnings failed to drive cybersecurity stocks and ETFs over the past month as the space has been hit by geopolitics lately. Let's dig into the earnings results of some of the cyber security firms that have the largest allocation to the ETFs in this industry:Juniper Networks Inc.  reported Q2 earnings per share of 49 cents and revenues of $1.31 billion, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 42 cents and $1.28 billion, respectively. For the third quarter, the company expects earnings per share in the range of 55-61 cents and revenues in the range of $1.02-$1.62 billion. Despite robust results, shares of JNPR are down 8.4% since its earnings announcement on July 25 after the closing bell.Symantec Corporation  beat our earnings estimate but missed on revenues when it reported fiscal first-quarter results on August 2, after the closing bell. Earnings per share came in at 15 cents, above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 12 cents but revenues of $1.17 billion fell shy of our estimated $1.2 billion. Symantec guided for the fiscal second quarter with revenues of $1.26-$1.29 billion and earnings per share in the range of 40-44 cents. The company raised its projections for the fiscal year. It now expects revenues of $5.16-$5.26 billion and earnings of $1.79-$1.89, up from the previous forecast of $5.10-$5.20 billion and $1.75-$1.85, respectively. However, shares of SYMC have tumbled 9.9% to date following its earnings announcement.Check Point Software Technologies  topped our estimates for both the top and the bottom lines by $4 million and 3 cents, respectively. It expects earnings per share of $1.18-$1.28 on revenues of $430-$465 million for the third quarter. For the full year, revenues and earnings are expected in the range of $1.85-$1.90 billion and $5.05-$5.25, respectively. The stock has plummeted 9.3% since its earnings announcement on July 20, before the opening bell (see:  ).Second-quarter earnings per share at Qualys  came in at 18 cents, 8 cents ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate while revenues of $55 million matched our expectations. For the third quarter, Qualys expects revenues of $58.2-$58.9 million and earnings per share of 21-23 cents. For this year, it raised the revenue guidance to $226.8-$228.3 million from $225-$228 million and the earnings per share outlook to 87-91 cents from 81-86 cents. Shares of QLYS are up 6.7% to date following its earnings announcement on August 2, after the closing bell.Proofpoint  has shed 3.7% to date following the earnings announcement on July 27, after the closing bell. The company reported a loss per share of 39 cents, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 26 cents but revenues outpaced our estimate by a marginal $2 million. For the third quarter, the company expects revenues in the range of $130-$132 million and earnings per share in the range of 16-18 cents. For the full year, Proofpoint increased the revenue guidance to $503-$506 million from $496-$500 million and earnings per share outlook to 62-64 cents from $56-59 cents.The string of earnings beat and solid outlook have put this niche area of the technology sector in focus for the days ahead. Currently, there are a couple of cyber security ETFs on investors' radar:The fund provides global exposure to the cybersecurity industry comprising companies that offer hardware, software, consulting and services to defend against cybercrime. It tracks the Prime Cyber Defense Index, holding 40 securities in its basket. It is well spread out across components with the in-focus five firms accounting for the top 10 holdings with over 3.5% share each. From an industrial look, software and programming accounts for nearly 58% of the portfolio while communication equipment and internet & mobile applications round off the top three.In terms of country exposure, U.S. firms take the top spot at 75%, followed by Israel (9%), United Kingdom (7%), Japan (4%), South Korea (2%), and the Netherlands (2%). The fund has amassed $1.1 billion in AUM and charges 60 bps in fees per year. Volume is solid as it exchanges 378,000 shares in hand per day. HACK has lost 5.9% over the past month (read:  ).This ETF has accumulated nearly $275.7 million in its asset base and charges 60 bps in annual fees. It trades in moderate average daily volume of around 95,000 shares. The fund follows the Nasdaq CTA Cybersecurity Index, which measures the performance of companies engaged in the cyber security segment of the technology and industrials sectors. In total, the product holds 30 stocks in its basket with the in-focus five firms accounting for 21.2% allocation.Further, it is skewed toward the software industry at 48.3% while communications equipment round off the next spot with a 23.5% allocation. Like HACK, American firms account for 76% of CIBR while Israel, United Kingdom, Ireland and many others make up for a single-digit allocation. The ETF has shed 5.1% in the same period.Zacks' free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"Chicago, IL - July 28, 2017 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog includeCisco (NASDAQ:  -  ), Symantec (NASDAQ:  -  ), Check Point (NASDAQ:  -  ) and F5 Networks (NASDAQ:  -  ).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations. Mobile devices, the chunky things that allowed us to take a call without getting up, were such a big deal just a few years ago. But as the days go by, they seem to be getting more and more capable, all the while becoming slimmer and cooler as well! No wonder then that today, they are being snapped up by kids, oldies and pretty much everyone in between.Considering their broad adoption and usefulness, one would have thought that there'd be a ton of companies out there, taking care of security as we browse the net, shop, play, socialize, read, watch video, listen to music, or work (or any of the other stuff I forgot to mention!). But that isn't the way we function it seems because most individuals are comfortable enough even without security and have limited knowledge of the consequences. So mobile security hasn't really gained momentum, even in places like the U.S., where 70%+ of the population has a device.The first and biggest reason is the  of smart devices. Because these devices are always connected, they are more accessible to viruses, unsafe sites, etc. Moreover, people increasingly use them for shopping, entertainment, to consume media, or make payments, and tend to save passwords on the device itself. This also increases the danger of identity theft. The fact that they are moveable items that can easily be stolen or misplaced makes them all the more susceptible.So as the  , with smartphones, tablets, phablets, chromebooks, surfaces, smart watches, AR/VR devices, connected dashboards, smart home products and other IoT devices, more information gets online with greater scope for infection or attacks. IDC expects smartphone shipments to grow 4.2% in 2017 and 4.4% in 2018 with a 3.8% CAGR over the 2016-2021 time period.Shipments are forecast to reach 1.53 billion units in 2017 and grow to 1.77 billion in 2021. Gartner expects global mobile phone shipments to grow less than a point this year and 1.6% in 2018 with the ongoing migration from feature phones to basic smartphones, especially from Chinese players, continuing.As the personal stuff on them continues to increase, they start moving some of it to Alphabet's or Apple's, Microsoft's (MSFT) or Amazon's cloud, meaning that increasingly,  , from where it might be tampered with. According to the Cisco (NASDAQ:  -  ) Visual Networking Index, global mobile data traffic grew 63% in 2016, of which video traffic accounted for 60%. The Middle East grew 96%, Asia/Pacific 71%, Latin America 66%, Central and Eastern Europe 64%, Western Europe 52% and North America 44%.It forecasts global mobile data traffic increase of 7x between 2016 and 2021, representing a 47% CAGR with nearly three-quarters of all devices on the network being smart by the end of the period. The Middle East will grow strongest at a 65% CAGR, followed by Asia/Pac at 49% and Latin America at 45%. China traffic will outpace the U.S. this year.The  and  are two megatrends that also increase the risk of information loss. In fact, these two segments deal with critical information and are therefore under greater pressure from both regulators and customers to maintain a high level of security and privacy.The  and bring your own device (  ) megatrend will completely change security as we know it. That's because hackers (ransomware) and other Internet crooks can't make as much money from individuals as they can from companies, governments and government bodies.Moreover, organizations have more to lose than individuals in case of data breaches (i.e. data, reputation, business loss from incapacitation), so they are more concerned about protection. In fact, companies like Microsoft and Google have regular hackathons to identify weaknesses in the programs they develop. So hacking has become good money.Mobile security companies are still in their startup phase and it is the established players like Cisco, Symantec (NASDAQ:  -  ), VMware, Microsoft, McAfee, Infineon and Dell that are gradually increasing investment in the area. Security pure-plays like Check Point (NASDAQ:  -  ) , Fortinet, F5 Networks (NASDAQ:  -  ), FireEye and Palo Alto are other stocks to watch. See how the industry did versus the S&P 500 year to date-Symantec is the only to buy right now since it has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has been buying up mobile security companies of late. You can see  .From driverless cars to artificial intelligence, we've seen an unsurpassed growth of high-tech products in recent months. Yesterday's science-fiction is becoming today's reality. Despite all the innovation, there is a single component no tech company can survive without. Demand for this critical device will reach $387 billion this year alone, and it's likely to grow even faster in the future.Zacks has released a brand-new Special Report to help you take advantage of this exciting investment opportunity.

ontinuing with its upbeat performance for the fourth straight quarter,  yesterday reported strong results for second-quarter 2017. Quarterly revenues came in at the higher-end of the company's expectations, while earnings were above the guidance range. Moreover, the top and bottom lines, both, surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate.Check Point's adjusted earnings per share (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets) of $1.14 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.11. Adjusted earnings also climbed approximately 18% on a year-over-year basis, driven mainly by higher revenues, efficient cost management and a lower share count.On a non-GAAP (excluding stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets) basis, the cybersecurity company posted earnings of $1.26, higher than its guidance range of $1.17-$1.25, and marked a 15.6% year-over-year improvement. | Second-quarter revenues came in at $458.6 million, up 8.5% year over year, and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $455 million. The figure was also close to the upper end of the company's guidance range of $440-$465 million (mid-point $452.5 million). Quarterly revenues were mainly driven by strong performance of its small and midsize-enterprise product lines as the company has been successfully able to penetrate through the midmarket and acquire new customers.Segment wise, the company witnessed sales growth of 11.9% in Products & Software Blades, and 4.4% in Software Updates and Maintenance. The company also reported a 27% surge in subscription revenues at Software Blades.Geographically, the Americas contributed 49% to revenues and Europe accounted for 34%, while Asia-Pacific, Japan, and the Middle East and Africa added the remaining 17%.Talking about deal size, the number of new customers who signed deals worth $1 million or more totaled 63, flat year over year. Moreover, customers, who signed deals worth $50,000 and more, contributed 71% to the total order value, which is equal to the second-quarter 2016 tally.On a year-over-year basis, adjusted gross profit (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets) increased 8.1% to $405.7 million. However, as a percentage of revenues, gross profit contracted 30 basis points (bps) to 88.5%.Adjusted operating expenses (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets) rose 6.5% year over year to $180.8 million. However, as a percentage of revenues, operating expenses contracted 80 basis points (bps) mainly due to efficient cost management.Adjusted operating income (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets) came in at $224.9 million, up nearly 9.5% year over year. In addition, margins expanded 40 bps to 49% primarily due to lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues.Adjusted net income (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets and other one-time items calculated on a proportionate tax basis) was $191.3 million or $1.14 per share, up from $169 million or 97 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.Check Point exited the quarter with cash balances of approximately $3.806 billion, slightly down from $3.797 billion at the end of the first quarter. During the first half of 2017, the company generated operating cash flow of $581.7 million. Additionally, Check Point repurchased about 4.9 million shares for a total cost of $496 million in the first two quarters of 2017.Despite reporting robust quarterly results, shares of Check Point dipped 7% during yesterday's trade as the company hinted that its third-quarter revenues might be hit slightly due to the very special Israeli holiday - Yom Kippur - coinciding with the last day of third quarter.Israel-based Check Point announced that the entire country will be completely shut down during Yom Kippur and so it won't be able to operate any business activities. Notably, the company normally derives almost $30 million of revenues in the last few days of any quarter.However, Check Point expects to mitigate some of the impact during the quarter. Also, despite of all this, the company has maintained the outlook on full-year revenues, which signifies that it is optimistic about its long-term prospects.Notably, shares of Check Point have gained 27.2% year to date, outperforming the  's 21.2% rally.Taking into account the aforementioned factors, the company provided outlook for the third quarter. The company expects to generate revenues between $430 million and $465 million (mid-point $447.5 million). The mid-point of the guidance is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $462.8 million. Non-GAAP earnings are projected in the range of $1.18-$1.28 per share. GAAP earnings per share are anticipated to be 15 cents lesser than the non-GAAP figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.14 per share.For 2017, Check Point continues to anticipate generating revenues between $1.85 billion and $1.90 billion (mid-point $1.875 billion). The mid-point of the guided range is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.87 billion. Non-GAAP earnings are projected in the band of $5.05-$5.25 per share. GAAP earnings per share are anticipated to be 70 cents lesser than the non-GAAP figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $4.69.Check Point continues to report splendid quarterly results for the fourth consecutive quarter. The company's top and bottom lines not only came ahead of the respective guidance ranges at mid-points, but also marked solid year-over-year improvement. Although, the third-quarter outlook is slightly disappointing, we believe that the company is well capable of mitigating the third-quarter revenue losses in the fourth quarter.Rapid adoption of Check Point's data center appliances and continuous enhancements in data center product lines are expected to provide ample top-line support. The company's focus on enhancing mobile capabilities will enable it to tap greater larger opportunities. Furthermore, Check Point's strategy of growing through acquisitions is praiseworthy.Additionally, we believe that Check Point Software will continue to benefit from strong demand for cybersecurity solutions. It should be noted that the financial well-being, brand image and reputation of enterprises, and governments are always exposed to the risk of cyber threats. Consequently, cybersecurity has become a mission-critical, high-profile requirement.Nonetheless, changing customer spending behavior, intensifying competition, an uncertain economic environment and currency fluctuations remain headwinds.Check Point currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see  .Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology space are Applied Optoelectronics Inc.  , Broadcom Limited  and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.  . While Applied Optoelectronics and Broadcom sport a Zacks Rank #1, Advanced Micro carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Applied Optoelectronics, Broadcom and Advanced Micro Devices have expected long-term EPS growth rate of 18.8%, 13.6% and 6.3%, respectively.Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

" is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 1. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 40.3%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.FireEye's management has been striving to turn the business around through a string of initiatives, which includes product launches, acquisition and cost optimization. We are of the opinion that the company's turnaround strategies are paying off as reflected from its sterling first-quarter results, and solid outlook for the second quarter and full year.Going ahead, despite persistent macro uncertainty, the company appears optimistic due to a healthy security market, strong product line-up, deal wins and investment plans, which are likely to boost results in the long run.Furthermore, FireEye's strategy of growing through acquisitions is encouraging, the latest being the buyout of iSIGHT Partners during the first quarter. The deal has reinforced FireEye's cyber security suite and enhanced its competitive dynamics.However, the company has been losing business to its rivals in the past several quarters. FireEye faces stiff competition from other well-established players such as Check Point Software  and Fortinet in the cyber security space. | Our proven model does not conclusively show that FireEyeis likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of 39 cents per share. Hence, the difference is 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . FireEyecarries a Zacks Rank #3. Though Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 increases the predictive power of ESP, the company's ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Here are a couple of companies which, as per our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Fiserv, Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +1.63% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see  .Pandora Media, Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +17.95% and a Zacks Rank #3.Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce """"the world's first trillionaries,"""" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The technology sector is a favorite of mine in the current environment, but just because I like the space as a whole doesn't mean that every single stock within it has the potential to be a winner. Source: ShutterstockIn fact, I recently took a closer look at the NASDAQ 100 Index and after testing the following names against my strict  criteria (fundamentals, technicals and intangibles) I came across three large-cap tech stocks that I'm staying away from.Let's talk about each.First up is  (NASDAQ:  ), a mature player in the tech industry, having survived for decades through some of the harshest and most difficult periods ever to befall technology stocks. CSCO stock is currently up a mere 4.3% for the year, putting Cisco's market cap just below $158 billion.Fundamentals: The growth here is gone. How do I know this? Well, earnings are expected to increase by $0.02 this year to $2.38 a share and just $0.07 in 2018. Enough said. Technicals: Looking at the chart, it's clear that CSCO has struggled recently. And it's lagged the technology sector as a whole with a mere 4.5% gain so far in 2017. After gapping lower in May (circled), the stock has been unable to gain any momentum, and resistance up around $32.50 (the black line) looks to be an impenetrable ceiling.The overall trend is bearish, volume is negative and the relative strength index (RSI) recently gave us a sell signal. I think that speaks for itself. Intangibles: Cisco was at the forefront of innovation 20 years ago, but its products are simply not  . This is still a large tech company, but without new cutting-edge technology on the horizon the stock will continue to be a laggard. Next up is  (NASDAQ:  ), a comparatively smaller tech player involved in the business of selling cloud storage products and services. Currently, AKAM stock is in negative territory, down nearly 30% for the year.Fundamentals: Full-year earnings are expected to fall to $2.52 from $2.70 a share last year and then eke back up to $2.73 a share in 2018. If that weren't bad enough, that 2018 estimate may be too high considering expectations decline even further in the following years. Technicals: AKAM has been trendless for years now, and since topping out in February it has lost more than one-third of its total value. This week saw another huge move lower, with soft guidance from management pushing the shares to a fresh 52-week low. Intangibles: The cloud services that this company sells are in demand in the current environment where world data and video continue to grow. But with management struggling to profit from this  trend, it's clear the intangibles are not here for AKAM. Finally, there's  (NASDAQ:  ), involved in the business of selling IT security and related products and software to enterprises. Currently, CHKP stock is up nearly 26% for the year.Fundamentals: Check Point has experienced single-digit earnings growth recently, but that is expected to slow in the next few years. That, combined with a PE ratio in the low 20s, makes this stock expensive when compared to its peers and the market as a whole. Technicals: The chart was looking good until CHKP ran into a double top around $118. The failure to break out above that 2000 high combined with a big-volume breakdown has the chart set up for even lower prices. Intangibles: This is another company that's in the heart of the  technology revolution, but the current valuation model and breaking-down chart while the market continues to hit new highs are red flags for the long term.  .The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@3 Technology Stocks That Just Don’t Make the Grade@2017-07-28@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-technology-stocks-that-just-dont-make-the-grade-2017-07-28

"Cybersecurity stocks like  (NASDAQ:  ), which has risen 33% year to date, have been on fire this year thanks to the numerous hack attempts on corporate firewalls, where cyber thieves have stolen sensitive information and, in some cases, held corporate data hostage. Source: But, how safe is FEYE stock? With such  already on the table, investors have begun to question how much more runway FEYE has left, especially on the heels of downbeat guidance by rival  (NASDAQ:  ), which caused an 8.5% plunge in CHKP stock.While Check Point guided for Q3 adjusted EPS in the range of $1.18-$1.28 per share, compared with the consensus of $1.28, its revenue range of $430 million-$465 million at the midpoint fell short of Street consensus of $463 million.At that point, it didn't matter that Check Point topped the Street's second-quarter earnings expectations and maintained its full-year forecast of adjusted earnings of $5.05-$5.25 per share on revenue in the range of $1.85 billion-$1.9 billion. The way I see it, however, the weakness implied in Check Point's outlook is its own to deal with.Given the ever-connected world in which we live, cybersecurity will remain an increasingly important part of peoples' lives and the health of businesses, fueling growth in companies like FEYE, which uses malware sandboxing technology, used for detecting advanced security threats before they find their way into a network. In the next three years, these organizations are expected to spend  on cybersecurity software, services, and hardware, according to research by the International Data Corporation (IDC).That level of spending amounts to a 38% rise from the $73.7 billion that IDC projects organizations will spend on cybersecurity in 2016. ""Security has become heavily scrutinized by boards of directors demanding that security budgets are used wisely and solutions operate at peak efficiency,"" said Sean Pike, IDC's vice president of security products.This bodes well for FireEye, which has arguably best-of-breed security offerings that can help secure market share from larger rivals such as  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ).Despite  , FEYE still faces tons of pressure from short sellers. As it stands, there are still some 30 million FEYE shares sold short, which is about six times the stock's average daily volume. This has, nonetheless, been a painful short position, given that FEYE stock has skyrocketed as much as 52% from its 52-week low of $10.35.FireEye's cost-cutting efforts, combined with new product launches to grow the top line, have had a significant effect on its recent uptrend. The company is expected to report second-quarter earnings on August 1. Assuming FEYE delivers a top- and bottom-line beat, combined with upbeat guidance, the short sellers could get burned even more, creating increased buying pressure for FEYE stock.Despite the strong year-to-date returns and the 52% surge from its 52-week low, it would be a mistake to part with FEYE now, especially after the company has already endured a difficult two years in 2015 and 2016, during which it lost some 80% from its highest level in that time frame.As such, investors who are looking for a small-cap growth tech stock operating in two vibrant markets - namely data security and cloud computing - should want to own FEYE stock, which I expect to rise an additional 15%, reaching $18 per share by the end of the year.The post ) Stockholders Have More Reasons to Feel Secure appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Why FireEye Inc (FEYE) Stockholders Have More Reasons to Feel Secure@2017-07-27@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-fireeye-inc-feye-stockholders-have-more-reasons-to-feel-secure-2017-07-27
"hursday was quiet on the stock market, leaving most major benchmarks close to where they started the day. Favorable economic data pointed to the prospect for further growth in the U.S. economy, but a large set of earnings releases revealed both winners and losers in the business environment over the past few months. Even though the overall market didn't move much, some individual companies reported unfortunate news, sending their shares downward.  (NYSE: HZO) ,  (NASDAQ: INO) , and  (NASDAQ: CHKP) were among the worst performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so poorly.Shares of MarineMax plunged 24.5% after the recreational boat and yacht maker reported its fiscal third-quarter results. The company said that revenue fell almost 5% on a 10% drop in same-store sales, reversing course after a strong 2016. Net income inched higher from the year-ago quarter, but CEO William McGill, Jr. said that unseasonal weather in the Northeast hurt overall sales and earnings performance. Even though the CEO said that he remains ""confident in our ability to deliver industry leading results"" and that ""demand for the boating lifestyle remains strong,"" MarineMax cut its earnings guidance for the year by roughly 16% to a new range of $0.97 to $1.02 per share. Even though  , MarineMax's performance confirms the difficulties that many high-end retailers have seen lately.Image source: MarineMax.Inovio Pharmaceuticals stock dropped 11%, extending losses after  . The development-stage biotech company had said earlier in the week that it would sell $75 million in stock in a secondary offering, raising concerns among existing shareholders that their interest in the company would be diluted as a result. Late last night, Inovio announced the pricing for the offering, saying that it would sell 12.5 million at $6 per share. Today's subsequent drop in the stock took the share price down almost to that $6 mark, wiping out gains from the spring. Without success from its pipeline soon, Inovio could have to do even more dilutive capital raises in the future.Finally, shares of Check Point Software Technologies declined 7%. The cybersecurity specialist said that revenue climbed 8% from the year-ago period, sending adjusted earnings per share up an even stronger 16%. Strength in subscription revenue was particularly encouraging, because it shows that  that can build long-term customer loyalty and more stable cash flow. What disheartened investors, though, was a cut in the company's quarterly sales projections due to the shift in the calendar of the Yom Kippur holiday in late September. In the long run, though, Check Point CEO Gil Shwed believes that ""the major attacks that occurred during the last few months have demonstrated the need for a different approach to cybersecurity,"" and he hopes that his company can provide a path forward to improve prevention and protect network architectures from further attack.

ontinuing with its upbeat performance for the fourth straight quarter,  , yesterday, reported better-than-expected results for second-quarter 2017, wherein revenues and earnings came ahead of the company's expectations, and also surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate.Fortinet's adjusted earnings per share (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets) of 14 cents beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 8 cents. Adjusted earnings also marked a solid improvement over the year-ago quarter's earnings of 3 cents, driven mainly by higher revenues and efficient cost management, which were partially offset by higher share counts.On a non-GAAP (excluding stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets) basis, the network security solution providing company posted earnings of 27 cents, which was higher than management's guidance range of 19-20 cents and marked a 41.7% year-over-year improvement. | Fortinet reported second-quarter revenues of $363.5 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $361 million and up 16.7% year over year. Segment wise, Product revenues increased 4% year over year to $142.7 million, while Services revenues jumped 26% to $220.8 million.The year-over-year improvement was primarily aided by growth in sales productivity and success in selling multiple product deployments. A large number of deal wins and customer additions during the quarter also proved conducive to top-line growth.During the quarter, Fortinet added over 10,000 customers, bringing the total count to over 320,000.The company witnessed 21% year-over-year growth in the number of deals worth over $100,000, while the number of deals worth over $250,000 and $500,000 increased 5% and 10%, respectively.Billings were up 14% on a year-over-year basis to $426.9 million.Gross profit increased 18% from the year-ago quarter to $267.8 million. Moreover, gross margin expanded 80 basis points (bps) to 73.7%, primarily backed by sales of higher-value subscription bundles.Furthermore, the company efficiently managed its operating expenses this quarter. As a percentage of revenues, non-GAAP operating expenses contracted 570 bps year over year to 55.6%. In dollar terms, however, the figure advanced 5.9% to $202.1 million.Non-GAAP operating profit jumped 82.7% to $65.7 million from approximately $36 million in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating profit margin expanded 650 bps to 18.1%, mainly attributed to improved gross margin and efficient cost management.Fortinet exited the reported quarter with cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments of approximately $1.21 billion, almost flat with $1.20 billion recorded at the end of the first quarter. Accounts receivable were $271.1million compared with $271.1 million recorded at the end of the previous quarter.During the first half of 2017, the company generated operating cash flow of $274.5 million. Free cash flow for the first two quarters came in at $174.6 million. Fortinet bought back 849,000 shares for $33.2 million during the first half of 2017.Buoyed by a better-than-expected second-quarter performance, Fortinet raised its outlook for full-year 2017. For 2017, management now expects revenues in the range of $1.487-$1.495 billion (mid-point: $1.491 billion), up from the earlier guidance of $1.485-$1.495 billion (mid-point: $1.490 billion). Billings forecast has also been raised to $1.775-$1.795 billion from $1.770-$1.792 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $1.49 billion.Similarly, non-GAAP earnings per share are now projected to come between 94 cents and 96 cents (mid-point 95 cents), up from of 89-91 cents (mid point: 90 cents) predicted earlier.Non-GAAP gross margin is now anticipated to come between 74.5% and 75% compared with the earlier forecasted range of 74%-75%. Non-GAAP operating margin is projected to come at 16.2%.However, the company's revenue forecast for the third quarter is slightly disappointing. Management expects revenues in the range of $367-$373 million (mid point: $370 million), which is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $371.45 million at mid-point. Billings are estimated in the range of $417-$427 million.Non-GAAP earnings per share are anticipated to come in the band of 22-23 cents (mid point: 22.5 cents). Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be 75%, whereas non-GAAP operating margin is anticipated to be between 16% and 17%.Fortinet's network security solutions include firewall, VPN, application control, antivirus, intrusion prevention, web filtering, anti-spam and WAN acceleration. The company reported better-than-expected second-quarter results. Despite persistent macro uncertainties, management seems to be optimistic on the back of a healthy network security market, solid product line-up and investment plans. Furthermore, the company's upbeat guidance for full-year 2017 is encouraging.Despite all these, shares of Fortinet dropped over 4% in yesterday's after-hour trade, as investors seemed concerned over the company's slowing revenue growth rate. Notably, over the last four quarters, the company's revenue growth rates have been around 20%, significantly lower than its previous rates of over 30%. Additionally, Fortinet's second-quarter revenue guidance marks an even lower growth rate of 15.9-17.8%.Moreover, competition from key network security players such as Cisco Systems Inc.  , Check Point  , Juniper Networks  and Palo Alto Networks, remains a concern.Nonetheless, we opine that Fortinet's initiative to change its business model to subscription-based service provider will continue to drive the company's bottom-line results. Subscription-based service is a high gross margin business (approximately 80%) compared with the hardware-centric model.Notably, the company generates over 50% of the total revenue from these services, which helped it generate a 80 basis points gross margin expansion in the second quarter. We believe that this strategy will continue to improve the company's bottom-line performances as well.Notably, the stock has returned 34.7% in the year-to-date period compared with the  's gain of 20.6% in the same time frame.Currently, Fortinet has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

"fter an uncertain outlook for the industry at the start of the year, it's turned out to be a pretty good year for network cybersecurity companies, and the latest results from Israeli company  (NASDAQ: CHKP) this week confirmed an industry in good shape. That said, there were a couple of points that might have left investors concerned. Let's take a look at them in the context of a broadly positive set of second-quarter earnings.Image source: Getty ImagesStarting with the headline numbers from the quarter:As usual, management gave guidance for the next quarter and the full year. It estimates:It's worth noting that the midpoint of third-quarter revenue guidance implies a growth rate of just 4.6%, a significant decline on the 8% reported in the second quarter. CEO Gil Shwed took time to explain why this was likely and why the guidance range was so wide.Shwed said during a conference call with analysts that the third quarter contains a ""high level of uncertainty, given the summer vacation around the world and the fact that large projects tend to shift to year-end."" In addition, this year Yom Kippur will happen on the last day of the third quarter. ""During Yom Kippur, the entire country is at a complete shutdown and we won't be able to operate any business activities. Given that and the fact that usually a substantial amount of business arrives in the last day, that may result in a significant shift in revenues despite our effort to manage the process,"" Shwed said.On a more positive note, the full-year guidance was left unchanged, suggesting any revenue lost in the third quarter would fall into the fourth quarter. In addition, Shwed went on to insist that the weak-looking guidance was ""purely based on Yom Kippur.""Of course, whenever near-term guidance looks weak, analysts and investors look for signs of potential weakness, and analysts immediately seized on CFO Tal Payne's comment that ""high end was softer due to lower activity in the financial verticals relating to few large deals that had a tough compare, compared to last year.""Given that Check Point is known as the industry leader in more expensive high-end solutions and financials is a key industry vertical, it's not surprising that analysts were concerned. Shwed said regarding financials, ""I think the pipeline is quite strong and we do have some large deals that are waiting to be closed right now."" Furthermore, Check Point is coming up against ""some unusually large deals"" in the same quarter of last year.It's also worth noting the quarter marked the first quarter since the start of 2015 in which non-GAAP operating income growth outpaced revenue growth. The reason? Following eight consecutive quarters where non-GAAP operating expenses increased by double digits, they increased just 7.7% in the second-quarter.Data source: Check Point Software Technologies Ltd.

he second-quarter earnings season has just started with 30 S&P 500 members, representing 9.3% of the index's total market capitalization, having already reported their results.Per the latest  , total earnings of these companies are up 13.8% on a year-over-year basis (83.3% of the companies beat EPS estimates) while total revenue is up 6% on a year-over-year basis (almost 83.3% of the companies also beat top-line estimates).Of these 30 S&P 500 companies, only four belonged to the finance sector. However, they accounted for 22% of the sector's total market capitalization in the index. Improved results from these companies have boosted the aggregate growth picture. Total earnings of these four companies are up 6.2% from the same period last year on 2.5% higher revenues.More than 200 companies are set to report results this week (Jul 17-20), including 68 S&P 500 members. Total second-quarter earnings are now expected to increase 6.6% (up from the previous expectation of 5.6%) from the year-ago quarter on revenue growth of 4.5%.Technology is one of the five sectors projected to report the strongest growth in the second-quarter. The other four are Energy, Aerospace, Construction and Industrial Products.We note that the technology sector has been a prolific performer on a year-to-date basis. The sector is benefiting from increasing demand for cloud-based platforms, growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions, Augmented/Virtual reality devices, autonomous cars, advanced driver assisted systems (ADAS) and Internet of Things (IoT) related software.Moreover, growing incidents of cyber attack have also increased the demand for cybersecurity software providers.Software companies form a significant part of the technology sector. We note that one of the most-tracked software ETFs- iShares North American Tech-Software ETF (IGV) -has gained 30.5% on a year-to-date basis, which is significantly better than the S&P 500's gain of 10.1% and Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF's (XLK) return of 18.1%.Here we take a look at three software companies that are set to report their quarterly earnings on Jul 20: is unlikely to beat fiscal fourth-quarter 2017 expectations as it has an unfavorable combination of a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an  of 0.00%.

hares of  (NASDAQ: CHKP) have been on a tear this year, rising more than 33% thanks to  and the growing demand for cybersecurity solutions stoked in part by recent hacking attacks. The cybersecurity specialist will look to extend its momentum when it releases its fiscal 2017 second-quarter results on July 20. Here's what investors can expect from the company.Wall Street expects Check Point Software's revenue to have grown 7.5% year over year, to $454.5 million, during the second quarter, while its earnings per share (EPS) are expected to have gone from $1.09 per share to $1.22 per share. Bottom-line growth outpacing top-line growth would not be surprising as Check Point focuses on keeping costs low to enhance earnings and cash flow.Image source: Getty Images.Wall Street's average second-quarter estimates sit withing Check Point's own guidance. The company had forecast that it would pull in $440 million to $465 million in revenue during the second quarter and earn between $1.17 and $1.25 per share. Analyst believe that the cybersecurity specialist is capable of outperforming the midpoint of these estimates by a whisker, and it won't be surprising if the company delivers on this count.In my opinion, recent hacker attacks should give cybersecurity companies more business. Some estimates say the WannaCry ransomware attack a couple of months ago may have led to at least $4 billion in losses as it affected computers in around 150 countries, which would be up from estimates of $1.5 billion in financial losses last year. Corporate and government entities can be expected to ramp up their spending on cybersecurity solutions.This could have a positive impact on Check Point's outlook, which is going to play a crucial role in sustaining its rally on the stock market.The number of high-value deals being made by Check Point is increasing. The company saw a 16% year-over-year jump in the number of $1 million-plus deals during the first quarter of 2017 -- putting the number at 50 compared to 43 in the year-ago quarter -- by selling more subscriptions of its advanced threat-protection packages that carry a higher selling price.Check Point could land more high-value deals during the second quarter since it's been  that none of its clients were compromised by the WannaCry attack.This could help Check Point Software gain some customers over other cybersecurity specialists in the ransomware protection market, which could be worth $17.3 billion by 2021 as compared to just over $8 billion in 2016, as per estimates from MarketsandMarkets.Another advantage that Check Point enjoys is that its selling and marketing expenses are very low when compared to other cybersecurity companies. The company's selling and marketing outlay jumped 16% year over year during the first quarter, but it still accounts for just 24% of its total revenue. By comparison,  and others companies like it spend more than half of their revenue on customer acquisition.Check Point also has the ability to bump its marketing expenses to steal market share from its rivals given its cash hoard of almost $1.5 billion and no debt. Not surprisingly, analysts expect the company's top-line growth to be higher in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter's projected growth at 8.3% year over year.Investors can expect a strong quarterly performance and upbeat guidance from Check Point Software Technologies given the growing traction of its subscription services and its ability to spend more marketing dollars.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

" is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Jul 20. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 20.7%. In all the trailing four quarters, the company has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. This represents an average positive earnings surprise of 10.9%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.NCR has been the global leader in self-service ATMs for several years in terms of market share. The company remains the largest supplier of ATM machines in the Asia-Pacific and North America while maintaining its leadership in the Asian and European markets.The company reported encouraging first-quarter 2017 results. Also, revenues and earnings increased on a year-over-year basis, primarily on strong growth in its software business.NCR recently announced that its APTRA OptiCash software will be deployed by Banca Comerciala Româna (""BCR""), a financial group in Romania and a member of Erste Group, across its network. We believe that the installation will help year-over-year cost savings on cash management services.The company recently won a deal from Japanese Restaurant and Jazz venue, Yoshi, for its restaurant operations transformation. Per the deal, the restaurant will implement NCR's point-of-sale (POS) platform which will not only help it modernize its outlets but also enhance customers' experience by reducing transaction time.According to Don Zimmerman, general manager at NCR Hospitality, ""As the leader in hospitality technology, we want to make everyday easier for restaurant operators with the best possible software solutions for their business to help increase revenues and bottom line results.""By 2020, RBR Research expects India to install base similar to the size of the U.S., trailing only China. Currently, India is the world's fourth largest ATM market, with China, the U.S. and Japan holding the first three spots. This creates huge opportunities for companies like NCR.Continuous product launches, growing popularity of its self-service offerings and synergies from acquisitions are key catalysts. Continuous deal wins also drive growth.However, similar offerings from the likes of Diebold Corp. and International Business Machines Corp.  remain concerns.Our proven model does not conclusively show that NCR will beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.

We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are a couple of companies which, as per our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Moody's Corporation  has an Earnings ESP of +4.51% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see Check Point Software Technologies Ltd.  has an Earnings ESP of +0.90% and a Zacks Rank #3.It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

"e expect cybersecurity company,  , to beat expectations when it reports second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 20.Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 2.8%. Notably, Check Point Software outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate over the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 5.6%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Our proven model shows that Check Point Software is likely to beat on earnings because it has the right combination of the two key components. Check Point Software currently has an  of +0.90%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $1.12, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate comes a penny lower at $1.11. A favorable Earnings ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . Check Point Software currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). It should be noted that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. Conversely, stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Check Point Software's Zacks Rank #3 and a positive ESP make us reasonably confident of a positive earnings beat. | Check Point Software has been clocking solid returns and in the year-to-date period it has gained approximately 35.1%, outperforming 22.8% growth recorded by the Zacks categorized  industry.We believe that Check Point Software will continue to benefit from strong demand for cybersecurity solutions. It should be noted that the financial well-being, brand image, and reputation of enterprises and governments are always exposed to the risk of cyber threats. Consequently, cybersecurity has become a mission-critical, high-profile requirement.With rapid technological advancement, organizations are increasingly adopting the ""bring your own device"" (BYOD) policy to enhance employee productivity, with anytime/anywhere access. This trend, in turn, calls for stricter data security measures.Moreover, various independent research firms had forecast strong demand in 2017. Gartner had predicted that worldwide Information Security spending would reach $90 billion in 2017, indicating 7.6% growth from the 2016 level of approximately $83.6 billion.We believe that Check Point Software must have capitalized on this opportunity. We anticipate that this might be well reflected in the company's results in the quarter to be reported.Furthermore, the rapid adoption of Check Point Software's data center appliances and the consistent enhancements in data center product lines are likely to provide adequate support to revenue growth. Additionally, the company's continuous share buybacks bode well for investors.Here are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Cypress Semiconductor Corporation  , slated to release earnings on Jul 27, currently has an Earnings ESP of +11.11% and a Zacks Rank #1.You can see  .MSCI Inc.  , scheduled to release earnings on Jul 27, currently has an Earnings ESP of +2.22% and a Zacks Rank #1.Apple Inc.  , slated to release earnings on Aug 1, currently has an Earnings ESP of +5.13% and a Zacks Rank #3.It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

"hares of  (NASDAQ: CYBR) plunged 16% on July 14, after the cybersecurity firm reported preliminary second-quarter figures that missed its own guidance. CyberArk expects its revenue to rise just 13%-14% annually for the quarter, compared to its previous forecast for 21%-23% growth.It expects flat to 5% growth in non-GAAP operating income, which also misses its forecast for 28%-38% growth. CyberArk mainly attributes those declines to a slowdown in the EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) region, where certain deals couldn't be closed on time.Image source: Getty Images.This represents CyberArk's slowest sales growth since its public debut in 2014, and marks its first-ever earnings miss. I  CyberArk as a cybersecurity stock I'd consider buying, but the severity of its earnings miss raises red flags. Let's take a closer look at CyberArk's troubles, and see if its stock will sink or swim over the next few months.CyberArk dominates the niche market of privileged account management (PAM) solutions, which protect companies from internal threats like disgruntled employees or corporate spies. However, CyberArk's top-line slowdown indicates that its addressable market might be getting saturated, since it already serves over half of the Fortune 100.It also indicates that bundled PAM solutions, like  's (NASDAQ: CSCO) Identity Services engine, are reducing demand for CyberArk's stand-alone solutions. Cisco is serious  its cybersecurity business, and CyberArk may struggle to match its scale and pricing power.Image source: Getty Images. , which is  in its cybersecurity business annually, also offers numerous PAM tools across its ecosystem of cloud services and operating systems. But that's not all --  's Identity Manager,  's Identity Manager, and  's Tivoli Access Engine also pose similar ""bundled"" threats.To widen its moat, CyberArk acquired PAM company Viewfinity in 2015, and DevOps security company Conjur earlier this year. But those purchases also throttled its cash flow and boosted its operating expenses (up 28% annually last quarter) -- which weighed down its earnings growth.That's all bad news when we consider that CyberArk trades at 59 times earnings and eight times sales -- which is well above the industry average P/E of 30 and P/S of 6 for infrastructure software providers. If CyberArk's slowdown continues, its stock could easily be cut in half.On the bright side, CyberArk remains one of the few cybersecurity players that are profitable by both non-GAAP and GAAP measures. That's mainly because the Israeli company spent just 9% of its revenue on stock-based compensation (SBC) expenses last quarter.Many of its Silicon Valley peers -- like  (NASDAQ: FEYE) and  (NYSE: PANW) -- can't generate GAAP profits due to high SBC expenses, which consume double-digit percentages of their revenues. To the bulls, that discipline makes CyberArk a responsible player in a market filled with spendthrifts.However, CyberArk can still follow FireEye and Palo Alto's lead by developing a bigger ""platform"" of additional security services to lock in and generate more revenues per customer. That move could widen its moat against bigger tech companies. CyberArk also noted that its growth in the Americas and Asia remained robust, which could offset its declines in the EMEA region.With a market cap of $1.5 billion and no debt, CyberArk is still a lucrative takeover target for any company that aspires to lead the PAM market.  (NASDAQ: CHKP) , which is also based in Israel  on a GAAP basis, was reportedly interested in buying CyberArk last January, when the stock was still in the high $40s. Those talks eventually fizzled out, but CyberArk's recent problems could make a buyout look more appealing.CyberArk remains the best-in-breed player in the PAM market, but growing competition and lofty valuations make it a risky play for a frothy market. As a result, this stock could fall much further before it can be considered a worthy buy.I recommended CyberArk in the past, but its stunning earnings miss puts it in the penalty box for now. The company will report its full second-quarter earnings on Aug. 8.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

nvestors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and  may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Check Point Software Technologiesis seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings-with the most up-to-date information possible-is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for CHKP in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.12 per share for CHKP, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.11 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for CHKP, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.90% heading into earnings season. | A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more  ).Given that CHKP has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Check Point Software Technologies, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana. Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

he second-quarter 2017 earnings season is in its initial stage with just 23 S&P 500 members or 4.6% of the index's total membership reporting their quarterly results as of Jul 7, according to the latest  report.Per the Preview article, the trend this earnings season indicates that we may finally see back-to-back four quarters of earnings growth in the Technology sector, after several quarters of decline. The report projects that earnings for the sector will improve 10.1% from the year-ago period on 6% higher revenues.The strong growth projections may be mainly attributed to the growing adoption of cloud computing, cloud infrastructure build-out, Big Data, flash storage, networking, security, 3D printing, wearable devices and Internet of Things (IoT) at home, office and car. Apart from this, modestly improving PC shipments also raise expectations.Additionally, anticipation of a recovery in IT spending in 2017, after two consecutive years of decline, according to a research report of Gartner Inc. (IT), bodes well for the technology sector. Gartner projects IT spending to increase 1.4% year over year to $3.41 trillion in 2017. Notably, in 2015 and 2016, worldwide spending declined 5.5% and 0.6%, respectively.The optimism surrounding the technology sector is well reflected in its year-to-date performance. The sector has outperformed the S&P 500 in the aforesaid period. Notably, the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK) returned 14.7% in the year-to-date period compared with the S&P 500's gain of 8.3%.The technology space continues to be investors' favorite due to its dynamic nature. It is predicted to grow faster than ever before as evident from Gartner's latest forecasts, as well as the improving U.S. economic data.The sector is poised to witness tremendous growth this earnings season and there is a high probability that various tech stocks will report better-than-expected results. It commonly happens that an earnings beat boosts investors' confidence in the stock, which is reflected in its rapid price appreciation.Therefore, now it is wise to invest in such stocks, in order to catch the post-earnings rally. However, this is easier said than done. Striking the right chord needs a fair amount of luck.With the existence of a number of companies in the tech sector, finding the right stocks that have the potential to beat on earnings could be a daunting task.

" (NYSE: PANW) was once a great growth stock. The pioneer of next-gen firewalls went public at $42 in 2012 and hit nearly $200 in 2015, but eventually stumbled back to the $130s.The stock rose just 6% this year, compared to the S&P 500's 8% growth and a 12% gain for the  (NYSEMKT: HACK) , which holds a basket of the top players in the industry. The optimists might believe that Palo Alto can regain its mojo, but these five red flags indicate that it's smarter to sell the stock than to buy it.Source: Getty.Palo Alto's year-over-year sales growth has decelerated for seven straight quarters. Its revenue rose 49% to $1.4 billion in 2016, but analysts anticipate just 26% growth this year and 22% growth next year.Much of that slowdown is due to its maturing business. Palo Alto already serves 39,500 customers worldwide -- including 86 of the Fortune 100 and about 1,200 of the Global 2000 -- so a slowdown isn't surprising. But Palo Alto also blamed some of the slowdown on inefficient sales and marketing teams, which it reorganized during the third quarter.Nonetheless, it might be wise to ignore Palo Alto until its growth either stabilizes or rises again. After all, its industry peer  's (NASDAQ: FEYE) revenue growth dropped from the high double-digits to the low single-digits within a  .Palo Alto's revenue slowdown could be forgivable if it were profitable. But it's only profitable on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes the hefty stock-based compensation (SBC) expenses that gobbled up 28% of its revenues last quarter. By that metric, its net income rose 35% to $57.1 million.But on a GAAP basis, which includes the SBC charges and other expenses, Palo Alto's net loss narrowed only slightly from $64.1 million to $60.9 million during the quarter. Considering that its top line growth is decelerating  its core market is getting saturated, it's hard to see how Palo Alto can ever achieve profitability.Since Palo Alto isn't profitable, investors usually look at its price-to-sales ratio to gauge how ""expensive"" the stock is. Palo Alto currently trades at 7.2 times sales, which is higher than the industry average of 5.6 for application software makers. FireEye trades at just 3.4 times sales.Palo Alto's P/S ratio isn't that historically expensive, since it traded at nearly 19 times sales at the peak of is heyday in 2015. But it still doesn't seem like a safe stock to own with the market hovering near historic highs with frothy valuations.I believe that a  would be  (NASDAQ: CHKP) , the  of Palo Alto founder Nir Zuk. Check Point is profitable by both non-GAAP and GAAP measures, and it trades at just 26 times earnings compared to the industry average P/E of 103.Palo Alto is the ""best in breed"" player in next-gen firewalls, but bigger tech companies like  (NASDAQ: CSCO) and  (NASDAQ: MSFT) are gaining ground. Cisco bought companies like ThreatGRID and SourceFire to counter smaller companies like Palo Alto, and it now offers a wide range of next-gen firewalls.Source: Getty.Microsoft's new Windows Defender ATP (Advanced Threat Protection) system for Windows 10 pulls data from over a billion Windows devices worldwide into a cloud-based security graph to counter perimeter threats. Microsoft also pledged to invest over  in cybersecurity R&D earlier this year.This is troubling for Palo Alto, because Cisco and Microsoft can respectively bundle their security solutions with their market-leading networking products and operating systems. To stay competitive, Palo Alto might need to slash prices or pile on new features -- which would cause its bottom line to sink deeper into the red.Lastly, Palo Alto's insiders don't seem confident in the company's growth prospects. Over the past three months, insiders sold nearly 67,000 shares without buying a single share on the open market. Over the past 12 months, they dumped over 699,000 shares while only purchasing about 213,000 shares.Insiders have plenty of reasons to sell their stock, but those ratios strongly suggest that it isn't the best time to buy Palo Alto.With cyberattacks on the rise, investors should have some exposure to the cybersecurity industry, which could grow from $122.5 billion to $202.4 billion between 2016 and 2021, according to research firm Markets and Markets.But they also should be choosy with those stocks, since many cybersecurity companies -- like Palo Alto -- have decelerating sales growth, non-existent profits, and lofty valuations. For now, investors should skip Palo Alto and stick with companies like Check Point, which are profitable and trade at more reasonable valuations.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

 mix of robust quarterly results along with increased awareness of online vulnerability has helped shares of cybersecurity specialists  (NASDAQ: CHKP) and  (NASDAQ: FEYE) do extremely well in the first half of 2017.Even shares of struggling network and enterprise security company  (NYSE: PANW)  after its fiscal third-quarter report in late May. The company has been working on revamping a a  , and customer additions and terrific guidance have helped it turn around. data by More importantly, these cybersecurity companies still have a lot of room for growth. Let's take a closer look at why they can do better.Image Source: Getty ImagesFireEye reported an impressive  in early May as its subscription business jumped 12% year-over-year. Subscription services now supply 86% of the company's revenue, and could grow as the company's subscription-related billings increased 20%.What's more, the improving subscription business is pushing up FireEye's deferred revenue, which increased 12% year over year during the first quarter to $632 million, of which $400 million is short-term. Therefore, over half of FireEye's top-line guidance is already covered for the year as the short-term deferred revenue will be recognized on the income statement within the next 12 months.Additionally, FireEye's improving subscription business is positively impacting its margins on account of lower customer acquisition costs. Its non-GAAP (adjusted) gross margin was up 3 percentage points in the first quarter thanks to a 4.6% drop in cost of revenue related to subscriptions. More importantly, FireEye's outlay to acquire more customers has dropped as it now spends 54.6% of revenue on sales and marketing as compared to 73.2% in the first quarter of 2016.Therefore, the company is making an impressive push toward profitability as its GAAP (unadjusted) loss fell to just $83 million in the first quarter of 2017 as compared to $156 million in the year-ago quarter. Moreover, FireEye's subscription growth likely isn't going to slow down anytime soon as it has updated its cybersecurity platform to stay at par with peers.The company is trying to attract more subscribers through its updated and scalable Helix cybersecurity platform by offering it for a low initial price, setting up FireEye to tap into a fast-growing security-as-a-service market that could clock $8.5 billion in revenue by the end of the decade.Palo Alto Networks' rough start to the year is now a thing of the past as the company's fiscal third-quarter results blew past expectations. It is clear that the company's new sales strategy of focusing on larger customer accounts that will lead to stronger business in the long run is bearing fruit, with the lifetime value of its top 25 customers jumping 61% year over year last quarter.Just like FireEye, Palo Alto is also looking to drive the growth of its subscription and support business, which now accounts for 60% of its business as against 51% in the year-ago quarter. Not surprisingly, the improving subscription business has lowered the company's customer acquisition expenses, as Palo Alto's sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue dropped 120 basis points year-over-year last quarter.More importantly, Palo Alto is adding customers at a fast clip. It added 8,500 new clients last quarter, which was the second-most in its history, and has taken a smart step to sustain its impressive client acquisition rate by updating its product line.Palo Alto's endpoint security platform, TRAPS, has been updated with modules that can detect and prevent ransomware attacks like the one that happened in May and  of computers across the globe. Analysts put the potential loss from the WannaCry ransomware attack at potentially $4 billion, so it won't be surprising if Palo Alto's customer base spikes once again.Finally, Palo Alto Networks is operating in a fast-growing end-market that could be  by 2020, so it isn't surprising to see analysts expect its bottom line to grow at almost 26% a year for the next five years.Check Point Software has taken a slow-and-steady approach toward growing its cybersecurity business, focusing mostly on bottom-line growth. The company spent just 24% of its revenue on sales and marketing last quarter.The best part about Check Point is that it is already profitable. Its GAAP net income jumped almost 10% year-over-year last quarter to $183 million, outpacing the 7.7% growth in its top line thanks to impressive cost control. More importantly, Check Point's bottom line should continue getting better given the company's growing subscription business, which should provide a steady revenue stream without requiring additional expenses to acquire more customers.In fact, the company's subscription business was up 27% year over year during the first quarter, which led to a 20% jump in its deferred revenue to $1.06 billion. The faster rate of growth in the deferred revenue as compared to the recognized revenue indicates that Check Point's products and solutions are in strong demand. Therefore, the company's top-line growth should get better once its deferred revenue is recognized on the income statement.The fast growth in the deferred revenue isn't surprising as Check Point is signing higher value deals with more of its clients, closing more than 50 deals with a value of $1 million or more last quarter, an increase of 16% from the year-ago quarter.Finally, Check Point is still good value despite rising over 30% on the stock market this year. Its trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 25.5 makes it cheaper than the industry median of 27, while a forward P/E ratio of less than 20 indicates more bottom-line growth is expected.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"he cybersecurity industry can be a tough one to invest in since many companies have high valuations with non-existent profits. But investors should still have some exposure to the cybersecurity market, which could grow from $122.5 billion to $202.4 billion between 2016 and 2021, according to research firm Markets and Markets.So today I'll discuss a balanced cybersecurity company that might appeal to conservative investors:  (NASDAQ: CHKP) . The Israeli company is known for upgrading traditional enterprise firewalls with ""stateful inspection"" features that track the operating state of all network connections as they pass through. It also sells ZoneAlarm, a popular firewall for mainstream users. Let's examine the four clear signs that Check Point's best days are still ahead.Source: Getty.The outbreak of cyberattacks over the past few years reveals that many government agencies, businesses, and individuals remain poorly protected. Last year, data breaches exposed 4.2 billion records, and roughly 4,000  occurred daily -- compared to 1,000 daily attacks in 2015. Business email compromise (BEC) scams hit over 400 businesses daily, draining $3 billion from businesses over the past three years.That's why many companies are investing heavily in firewalls. In FireMon's 2016 State of the Firewall report, which surveyed 600 IT security professionals, 91% of respondents stated that firewalls were ""as critical as ever"" in securing their networks. The same percentage didn't see that fact changing over the next five years. This ensures that Check Point -- which serves over 100,000 businesses and millions of users with its firewalls -- will continue growing.Check Point's revenue rose 7% to $1.7 billion last year, and analysts anticipate 8% growth this year. It attributes that slow and steady growth to higher sales of its appliances and management gateways, as well as higher subscription revenues for software. Customers are also transitioning toward higher value packages with advanced threat protection solutions, and the company has been inking more deals with bigger customers which have an aggregate transaction value exceeding $1 million.Source: Getty.Check Point's growth admittedly isn't as impressive as that of  (NYSE: PANW) , the next-gen firewall vendor  former Check Point engineer Nir Zuk. Palo Alto's revenue surged 49% to $1.4 billion last year, and analysts anticipate 26% growth this year.However, Check Point crushes Palo Alto (and many other cybersecurity companies) in terms of profitability. Check Point is profitable by both non-GAAP and GAAP measures. Its non-GAAP earnings rose 13% last year, while its GAAP earnings grew 12%. Wall Street expects its non-GAAP earnings to improve 10% this year.Palo Alto is only profitable on a non-GAAP basis, since that metric excludes hefty stock-based compensation (SBC) expenses, which consumed 29% of its revenues last year. On a GAAP basis, which includes those expenses, it remains deeply unprofitable. Check Point stays consistently profitable because it spent just 5% of its revenues on SBC expenses last year.Check Point's consistent profitability generates steady cash flow for the company -- which enables it to acquire smaller companies like stealth-mode security start-up Hyperwise and mobile security firm Lacoon.Source: Check Point was  in acquiring another profitable Israeli cybersecurity company,  (NASDAQ: CYBR) , but those talks eventually fizzled out. However, it's likely that Check Point will make additional purchases in the near future to expand its security solutions beyond firewalls.Check Point rallied nearly 40% over the past 12 months, but it still trades at just 26 times earnings -- which is much lower than the industry average of 103 for application software makers. CyberArk, which is also considered one of the  cybersecurity plays, trades at 57 times earnings.I don't own any shares of Check Point, but I've been keeping an eye on the stock. I believe it's  long-term plays in the volatile cybersecurity market, and that demand for its products will continue growing among both enterprise and mainstream consumers. Its consistent profitability, conservative use of stock bonuses, and low valuation all make it a compelling buy at current prices.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"Chicago, IL - July 11, 2017 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include  (NYSE:  ),  (NYSE:  ),  (NYSE:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations. The second-quarter 2017 earnings season is in its initial stage with just 23 S&P 500 members or 4.6% of the index's total membership reporting their quarterly results as of Jul 7, according to the latest  report.Per the Preview article, the trend this earnings season indicates that we may finally see back-to-back four quarters of earnings growth in the Technology sector, after several quarters of decline. The report projects that earnings for the sector will improve 10.1% from the year-ago period on 6% higher revenues.The strong growth projections may be mainly attributed to the growing adoption of cloud computing, cloud infrastructure build-out, Big Data, flash storage, networking, security, 3D printing, wearable devices and Internet of Things (IoT) at home, office and car. Apart from this, modestly improving PC shipments also raise expectations.Additionally, anticipation of a recovery in IT spending in 2017, after two consecutive years of decline, according to a research report of Gartner Inc. (IT), bodes well for the technology sector. Gartner projects IT spending to increase 1.4% year over year to $3.41 trillion in 2017. Notably, in 2015 and 2016, worldwide spending declined 5.5% and 0.6%, respectively.The optimism surrounding the technology sector is well reflected in its year-to-date performance. The sector has outperformed the S&P 500 in the aforesaid period. Notably, the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK) returned 14.7% in the year-to-date period compared with the S&P 500's gain of 8.3%.The technology space continues to be investors' favorite due to its dynamic nature. It is predicted to grow faster than ever before as evident from Gartner's latest forecasts, as well as the improving U.S. economic data.The sector is poised to witness tremendous growth this earnings season and there is a high probability that various tech stocks will report better-than-expected results. It commonly happens that an earnings beat boosts investors' confidence in the stock, which is reflected in its rapid price appreciation.Therefore, now it is wise to invest in such stocks, in order to catch the post-earnings rally. However, this is easier said than done. Striking the right chord needs a fair amount of luck.With the existence of a number of companies in the tech sector, finding the right stocks that have the potential to beat on earnings could be a daunting task. Our proprietary methodology, however, makes it fairly simple for you. You could narrow down the list of choices by looking at stocks that have the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold), and a positive  . You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  .Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for determining stocks which have the best chances to surprise with their next earnings announcement. It provides the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Our research shows that for stocks with this combination, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%.Here, we would like to highlight some stocks in the technology sector which are likely to beat estimates this earnings season. (NYSE:  ) is a solid bet which carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has an Earnings ESP of +1.12%. The company delivered an outstanding average positive earnings surprise of approximately 6.3%, over the trailing four quarters and has long-term earnings growth expectation of 12.5%.One can also invest in  (NYSE:  ), which carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has an Earnings ESP of +2.56%. The company registered an average positive earnings surprise of 8.94% over the trailing four quarters and has long-term earnings growth rate of 9%. You can see Another stock that you may consider is  (NYSE:  ), with a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of +1.02%. The stock has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice while has missed the same on one occasion in the trailing four quarters. It has an average positive earnings surprise of 1.86% and has long-term earnings growth expectation of 11.7%.We also suggest investing in  (NASDAQ:  ). The company has an Earnings ESP of +0.90% and carries a Zacks Rank #3. The stock has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice and matched on one occasion, over the trailing four quarters. It has an average positive earnings surprise of 5.64% and has long-term earnings growth expectation of 9.6%.Investors can also count on  (NASDAQ:  ), with a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +1.30%. The stock has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice and missed on one occasion, over the trailing four quarters. It has an average positive earnings surprise of 12.49% and has long-term earnings growth expectation of 10.5%.These stocks have managed to grab the spotlight with notable performances. These factors make us more or less sure that investing in these stocks will yield strong returns for your portfolio in the short term.Many are little publicized and fly under the Wall Street radar. They're virtually unknown to the general public. Yet today's 220 Zacks Rank #1 ""Strong Buys"" were generated by the stock-picking system that has nearly tripled the market from 1988 through 2015.

"Comparing  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ) side by side, an investor might wonder which is the better buy: FEYE stock or CHKP stock? Source: It's not a trick question.Relatively speaking, Check Point  is clearly a better IT security stock than FireEye. A t least that's the case if we're talking about profits and losses. But these are t wo companies at different stages.In the trailing 12 months, Check Point made $861 million in operating income from $1.8 billion in revenue while FireEye had $360 million in operating losses from $720 million in revenue.Check Point's completed its transformation to a recurring-revenue model that began in earnest a couple of years ago; FireEye's is just getting going, a point InvestorPlace.com's  on July 3:""As underestimated as FireEye's new model may be, it will be years before it actually bears enough fruit to pay all of the company's bills. FEYE stock will surely rise and fall between now and then. If you can stomach the volatility though - and remain well aware that FireEye is still only a trade that is morphing into an investment - you can afford to lean bullishly.""It's taken a while for me to come to appreciate the positive aspects of FireEye's business. As recently as January, I  a ""value trap"", suggesting investors take a look at  (NASDAQ:  ), a smaller, Israeli IT security business with solid profits and growing revenues. Since then, CYBR is down more than 16% in the last six months while FEYE is up 17.9% over the same period.As cyber-security stocks go, I still like CYBR, but that's a discussion for another day. Right now, I'm trying to help you determine which is the better buy between the large cap (Check Point) and the mid cap (FireEye).As  , I believe FEYE stock has a good chance of hitting $20 by June 2018. However, to get to $20, it's got to keep working on cutting expenses while growing the top line at a reasonable pace. To wit: ""Candidly, if it wants to make money, that number [overall gross margin] has to jump to 80%; it's got to boost subscription and services' quarterly revenue by 20% or more year over year and cut another 10% from its operating expenses,"" I wrote. ""Then it will start making money.""In Q1 2017, FireEye's overall gross margin (GAAP) was 63%; its subscription and services revenue grew by almost 12%, and operating expenses dropped 28.5%.In that first quarter announcement, FireEye said its non-GAAP operating margin in the second quarter would be between -9% and -10%; in Q2 2016 it was -28%, almost 32% lower than in the same quarter in Q2 2015.So, it's operating margin's gone from negative 42% to negative 9% in the course of eight quarters. Extrapolate that over the next eight quarters, and it's hard to imagine it won't be making money.Over the past two fiscal years, Check Point's revenues have risen by 16.4% while operating income's increased by just 6.3%.Meanwhile, FireEye's revenues have increased by 67.8% while operating margins have gotten much better, albeit still in the red.My inclination would be to buy both FEYE stock and CHKP. One for growth and one for stability. However, I might wait until after FireEye reports its Q2 2017 results on August 1. Investors will be watching to see how subscription and services revenues are growing. If it's not by double digits, all bets are off when it comes to FireEye.The post ) Stock the Best IT Security Play? appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Is FireEye Inc (FEYE) Stock the Best IT Security Play?@2017-07-18@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-fireeye-inc-feye-stock-the-best-it-security-play-2017-07-18
Is  (NASDAQ:  ) really on the verge of a turnaround? The FEYE stock chart certainly says so. After peaking near $55 a share in mid-2015 and then sliding back to a low of less than $11 in mid-March, FireEye has since gained 42%. That's tops among all the major cybersecurity stocks for the three-month stretch, which includes formidable competitors like  (NYSE:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ). Source: The question is, can FEYE stock continue to move forward at its current pace? Perhaps the more important question right now is, can FireEye shares do so without peeling back first?That's the conundrum for anyone still on the sidelines, surprised to see this stock perk up so much, so quickly.There's shortage of opinions about FireEye, the stock or the company (which aren't necessarily one and the same). As our very own  on Wednesday, cybersecurity spending is expected to swell to more than $100 billion over the next three years, and the Milpitas, Calif. company is well positioned to capture its share of that growth.On the flipside, Tom Taulli was right when he  that turnarounds can take a long time to materialize, and FireEye is facing some tough rivals in the aforementioned Check Point and Palo Alto Networks.Both writers make valid points, underscoring the headache FEYE stock is causing most investors right now. Weighing all the pros and cons, though, the scales tip in a broadly bullish direction.Still, that's not a decision free of caveats though.Just to frame the discussion correctly, FireEye isn't an investment, at least not yet. It's a trade, morphing into an investment. FEYE does have the most important ingredient in the investment mix: Trailing and projected results indicate it's (finally) on a positive trajectory.The chart below tells the tale. Revenue growth (shown in blue columns) is slowing down as the company has pared back its aggressive acquisition spree. But, late last year, FireEye moved into the black.Click to EnlargeThat was a swing to an  profit, to be clear. On a GAAP basis, the organization has been  lose money at least through 2019. That's okay, though. CEO Kevin Mandia has proven the new business model works. Now he just needs to enhance the numbers. Investors are less concerned about the lack of actual profits, however, as they're impressed by the progress.And what is the new model that drives less growth but more profits? Last year, Mandia directed the company to focus less on sales of products - which only occur once - and  that generate consistent revenue month in and month out.That shift isn't exactly news to most anyone who's kept close tabs in FEYE stock and the underlying story. Recurring revenue is a heck of a lot less complicated (and less costly) to produce than revenue generated by one-off products. That's not the only upside of maintaining a software-as-a-service platform though.To be sure, the need for cybersecurity isn't ever going away. Historically, enterprises might go back to a previous supplier when it's time to upgrade its digital defense. Loyalty in the business is minimal though, and it's just as easy for one of FireEye's previous customers to choose a competitor when it comes time to update their digital defense systems.Not so with a platform. When providing access to a platform, the provider can easily update that service, and add new features to the menu with just a few keystrokes. With upgrades and updates at a user's fingertips versus the hassle of implementing an entirely new system, it's easy for FireEye to remain an organization's preferred cybersecurity provider.Don't misread the idea. As underestimated as FireEye's new model may be, it will be years before it actually bears enough fruit to pay all of the company's bills. FEYE stock will surely rise and fall between now and then. Indeed, one of those moves may materialize quite soon, as shares have left behind three gaps since March's reversal; traders don't like to leave gaps unfilled.If you can stomach the volatility though - and remain well aware that FireEye is still only a trade that is morphing into an investment - you can afford to lean bullishly.Just pick and choose your battles carefully.The post ) Stock is a Cybersecurity Play That's Worth It appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@If You Can Stomach the Ride, FireEye Inc (FEYE) Stock is a Cybersecurity Play That’s Worth It@2017-07-03@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/if-you-can-stomach-the-ride-fireeye-inc-feye-stock-is-a-cybersecurity-play-thats-worth-it

Stocks recently featured in the blog include  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NYSEARCA:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.  .The international cyberattack that hit Ukraine yesterday outsmarted the whole world, especially the technologically advanced Europe and United States, yet again. Tens of thousands of machines were crippled in dozens of countries. It mainly infected computer systems of banks and major companies in Ukraine, Russia and Britain.The ransomware called ""Petya"" locks an infected computer and asks the computer's administrator to pay $300 worth of the bitcoin to regain control of them. Per the Moscow-based cybersecurity firm Group IB, the virus affected about 80 companies in Russia and Ukraine.It came a month after the WannaCry hack that locked up more than 200,000 computers paralyzing factories, hospitals, shops and schools in over 150 countries (read:  ).Among the worst impacted by the latest attack were Russia's top oil producer Rosneft, Ukrainian international airport, the world's biggest advertising company WPP based in Britain, Danish shipping giant A.P. Moller-Maersk, Russian metals giant Evraz, German postal and logistics company Deutsche Post, French construction materials company Saint Gobain, U.S. drug giant Merck and food and beverage company Mondelez International.Given that the malaise is spreading all over the world, cybersecurity stocks and ETFs are set to rally in the coming days. Investors should tap this opportune moment with the following two solid stocks and ETFs: (NASDAQ:  ) Based in Oklahoma, Check Point is a leading provider of policy-based enterprise security and traffic management solutions.

(NYSEARCA:  )The fund offers exposure to those companies that ensure the safety of computer hardware, software, networks and fight against any sort of cyber malpractices. It tracks the ISE Cyber Security Index, holding 40 securities in its basket with none accounting for more than 4.27% share. In terms of country exposure, U.S. firms take the top spot at 74%, followed by Israel (11%), the United Kingdom (6%), Japan (5%), South Korea (2%), the Netherlands (2%), and others (1%). The fund charges 60 bps in annual fees and sees volume of 430,000 shares a day on average. It has amassed about $1.1 billion in its asset base (read:  ). (NASDAQ:  )This ETF has accumulated nearly $265.9 million in its asset base and charges 60 bps in annual fees. It trades in a moderate average daily volume of around 92,000 shares. The fund follows the Nasdaq CTA Cybersecurity Index, which measures the performance of companies engaged in the cyber security segment of the technology and industrials sectors. In total, the product holds 30 stocks in its basket with each accounting for less than 7% of assets.

onsidering that  (NASDAQ: FEYE) stock is up 27% this year, investors clearly like what they're seeing from the cybersecurity company. However, for those less familiar with the FireEye story, last quarter's meager 3% increase in revenue to $173.7 million and it ongoing losses might not, at first glance, inspire a great deal of confidence.Investors who have been following FireEye know that last quarter actually constituted a major step in the right direction, on several fronts. But the company is in the midst of a significant transition, with a CEO who has been at the helm for little more than a year, and suffers from waning top-line growth, all of which puts FireEye's stock in a precarious position. The slightest hiccup  could send its share price reeling.Image source. FireEye.It was last June that FireEye made the tough, but necessary, decision to promote now-CEO Kevin Mandia. From the get-go, he began shaking things up -- cutting jobs, vowing to pare overhead, and transforming FireEye's business model. A year in, and Mandia is delivering as promised.Any fresh change in FireEye's chain of command would be a major blow. It may sound far-fetched, but the results Mandia has achieved in a relatively short time can't have gone unnoticed by FireEye's peers, both large and small. Even a rumor of a management change would be enough to cause FireEye's stock to fall.One of Mandia's first orders of business was to shift the company away from a product-sales model and toward cloud software subscriptions to drive recurring revenue. The objective is to establish a long-term, reliable source of growth. It's working: Though total sales grew just 3% last quarter, subscription and services revenue jumped 12% to $150 million.FireEye hopes to follow the lead of the largest pure-play cybersecurity firm on the market --  (NASDAQ: CHKP) -- and build a  foundation in the cloud. Check Point's sales grew 8% last quarter, but its software subscriptions soared 27% to $112 million. Toss in software updates and maintenance, and a jaw-dropping $309.1 million of Check Point's $435.5 million in sales were recurring. FireEye isn't Check Point yet, but it's making significant progress down that path that needs to continue, or things could take a turn for the worse.One of the most impressive numbers from FireEye's first quarter was the drop in operating expenses. Management didn't just talk a good game when it said cutting overhead was a priority: They delivered. Operating expenses of $180.8 million in the first quarter were 29% lower than in Q1 2016, which was a primary reason investors overlooked FireEye's relatively flat top line.The fear is that rampant cost-cutting will negatively impact growth, which would almost certainly cause FireEye's stock to fall. Why? Because to an extent, continued improvements of efficiency are already factored into FireEye's valuation, especially given its tepid revenue growth.FireEye shareholders have been enjoying positive momentum -- and they continue to -- but momentum can be an ephemeral thing for any stock. In this case, the optimism is warranted, but the market's feelings about a stock can change in a heartbeat, sometimes for no logical-seeming reason.And stock price shifts driven by momentum -- positive or negative -- tend to be short-lived. Eventually, FireEye will need to show investors the money, and it's making strides with each passing quarter to do just that.In addition to the strides FireEye took last quarter, another factor propelling its stock price run was that it beat analysts' estimates, and its own forecasts.FireEye's guidance is for between $173 million to $179 million in revenue this quarter. The low end of that range would be amount to a 1% decline from Q2 2016's $175 million. Double-digit revenue growth isn't necessary nor expected, but delivering revenue that is flat year over year, or even a slightly higher -- as FireEye did last quarter -- should keep the ball rolling.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Stock Could Fall@2017-06-21@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/5-reasons-fireeye-inc-stock-could-fall-2017-06-21
"hares of  (NASDAQ: FEYE) rallied nearly 30% this year, fueled by a big  in May and indications that its newer cloud services are growing fast enough to offset softer sales of its on-site appliances. However, FireEye still remains well below its IPO price of $20, its sales growth is tepid (analysts expect just 2% growth this year), and it remains unprofitable by both GAAP and non-GAAP measures.I'm not saying that FireEye can't turn things around, but I believe that there are better cybersecurity plays on the market today. Let's check out three stocks that fit the bill:  (NASDAQ: CYBR) ,  (NASDAQ: CHKP) and  (NASDAQ: PFPT) .Source: Getty.One of FireEye's biggest flaws is its lack of GAAP profitability. Like many other cybersecurity companies, FireEye excludes stock-based compensation (SBC) expenses (which gobbled up 25% of its revenue last quarter) from its non-GAAP earnings.Investors looking for a cybersecurity company that has lower SBC expenses and posts steady GAAP earnings growth should check out CyberArk. The Israeli company, which protects  for nearly half of the Fortune 100 companies, posted 26% year-over-year sales growth and 75% GAAP earnings growth last quarter. SBC expenses accounted for just 9% of its revenue.CyberArk's non-GAAP earnings, which exclude those expenses  gains from its recent acquisition of DevOps security software maker Conjur, rose 22%. Analysts expect CyberArk's revenue to rise 24% this year, but its non-GAAP earnings are expected to drop 4% on higher R&D and marketing expenses. But in my opinion, CyberArk still looks like a more compelling (and profitable) growth play than FireEye.CyberArk's Israeli peer Check Point -- which provides firewalls for over 100,000 businesses and millions of customers -- also posts stable GAAP profits and doesn't rely heavily on stock bonuses. Its revenue rose 8% annually last quarter, and its GAAP earnings grew 15%.Its non-GAAP earnings improved 13%, and just 4% of its revenue was spent on SBC expenses. Like FireEye, Check Point is gradually pivoting away from on-site appliances toward software subscriptions. Revenue from those subscriptions, supported by its popular Sandblast platform, rose 27% annually and accounted for 26% of its top line last quarter.Analysts expect Check Point's revenue and non-GAAP earnings to respectively grow 8% and 10% this year. Back in 2015, Check Point acquired fellow Israeli companies Hyperwise and Lacoon Mobile Security to widen its moat. It was also reportedly interested in  , but those talks fizzled out last year.Proofpoint provides a cloud-based security platform that detects and blocks threats from emails, mobile apps, and social media accounts. The company serves over half of the Fortune 100 and analyzes over 100 million email boxes, 200 million social media accounts, and seven million apps on a daily basis.Source: Getty.Many of its services overlap with FireEye's offerings, but Proofpoint is growing at a much faster rate. Its revenue rose 43% annually last quarter, and it posted a non-GAAP profit of $0.12 -- compared to a net loss of $0.09 in the prior year quarter. Proofpoint remains unprofitable on a GAAP basis (partly due to SBC expenses consuming 20% of its revenue last quarter), but its losses have been narrowing. Wall Street expects Proofpoint's revenue to rise 33% this year, and for its non-GAAP earnings to surge 59%.During last quarter's conference call, CEO Gary Steele attributed that growth to ""ongoing demand for advanced threat solutions, continued high competitive win rates, robust new and add-on activity, excellent traction with our emerging products, and a world-class renewal rate that continues to exceed 90%.""CyberArk, Check Point, and Proofpoint all have certain advantages against FireEye. But none of these stocks is cheap relative to its revenue growth. CyberArk trades at 8 times sales, Check Point trades at 11 times sales, and Proofpoint has a P/S ratio of 9.Those ratios are much higher than FireEye's P/S of 3.5 and the industry average P/S of 6 for application software makers.

"ny doubts of how the investing community feels about  (NYSE: PANW) were laid to rest following last quarter's earnings results. With its stock mired in a slump this year, Palo Alto reported a better-than-expected quarter, which included beating revenue expectations and sharing guidance for the current period that also pleasantly surprised.The reaction to Palo Alto's earnings news was swift and positive, as its stock price skyrocketed 17% overnight, driving shares into the black 11% year to date. But has Palo Alto really turned a corner, or did ""expansion within our existing customer base and new customer acquisitions in the quarter"" simply make for a blowout quarter?Only time will tell, but there are a few things Palo Alto can do to keep fanning the flames. If it succeeds, shareholders are sure to enjoy a strong 2017.Image source: Palo Alto Networks.Though Palo Alto's top line and forecast for the current quarter got much of the attention, CEO Mark McLaughlin's progress, albeit minimal, shouldn't be overlooked in reining in overhead in relation to sales costs.The 25% sales jump to $431.8 million was nice, but the slowing rate of increased sales and marketing-related costs was a sign that McLaughlin is delivering on his promise to lower spending. Though sales expenses hit $226.9 million last quarter, for a 16% year-over-year increase, the growth rate was considerably slower than in past quarters.That Palo Alto still spends over half its revenue on sales and marketing, however, remains troublesome. Competitor  (NASDAQ: CHKP)  largely because of its stringent spending: Last quarter, its $106.2 million in sales costs represented just 24% of its $435.45 million in sales. If Palo Alto can emulate Check Point in this all-important area, its stock is sure to rise.One of the key drivers of Check Point's relatively nominal sales expenses is its all-out push to grow recurring revenue through subscription software and services. Palo Alto, like Check Point and others in the data-security space, is hoping for much the same thing -- and it's happening.Of last quarter's total revenue, 62% came from Palo Alto's subscription and support unit. The $267.6 million the division reported for the quarter was good for an impressive 46% year-over-year jump, more than making up for the meager 1.3% gain in product sales to $164.2 million.The recurring-revenue effort will also make Palo Alto's cost-cutting initiative more effective. It simply costs less to service existing customers than rely on product sales -- and the marketing expenses associated with them -- to drive revenue growth. If Palo Alto can keep the recurring-revenue ball rolling, shareholders will be the better for it.Continuing to beat revenue expectations, let alone provide better-than-expected guidance, will give Palo Alto stock a boost. Of course, over the long haul, improved fundamentals are needed to give legs to  , but as investors saw last quarter, there's no denying the positive impact of quarterly surprises.For this quarter, Palo Alto's fourth of fiscal 2017, expectations are for revenue between $481 million and $491 million, equal to a 20% to 23% improvement from a year ago. Excluding one-time items, Palo Alto expects per-share earnings of $0.78 to $0.80, well above last year's $0.50 a share.Another bright spot for investors is that Palo Alto stock, even after its post-earnings jump, hasn't performed even close to the stock of some of its competitors. Check Point is up 35% year to date. So if Palo Alto can continue making strides where it counts, and beating near-term expectations, the gap in share-price growth with its peers could narrow with each passing quarter.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

hortly after Kevin Mandia replaced took the helm of  (NASDAQ: FEYE) last year, tough decisions had to be made, and he wasted no time in making them. The much-needed change in direction he instituted included as many as 400 job cuts -- FireEye's headcount at the time was 3,400 -- to jump start its cost-cutting initiatives.As big a step as laying off more than 10% of its workforce was, FireEye's shift away from a reliance on product sales to subscription-based cloud software solutions promised to change everything -- for good or bad, depending on execution.Image source: FireEye.When FireEye announced its layoff plan in August, it also cut revenue guidance; subsequently, its stock nosedived 16% to $14.02 a share, a plunge it's has only recently fully recovered from. In addition to shifting to a more efficient business model, FireEye hoped to shave $80 million in costs. Turns out FireEye underpromised and overdelivered on virtually  .The $173.7 million in revenue it brought in during Q1 was only a 3% year-over-year increase, but that was to be expected as while the company focuses on growing the aforementioned recurring revenue base. This type of transition is a slow one, as FireEye peer  (NASDAQ: CHKP) knows all too well. But patience has paid off in a big way for Check Point, and FireEye is in the early stages of achieving similar objectives.Despite the mere 3% sales increase, FireEye cut its per-share losses by more than half to $0.48 compared to 2016's $0.98 a share loss. As for overhead, last quarter FireEye shaved $72.1 million from its operating expenses, including $28 million from sales and marketing. That's delivering the goods, which is why improved efficiency is one of FireEye's best accomplishments of 2017.Another sign that FireEye is making good on its promises was that it trimmed $20.5 million in stock-based compensation. When a company is in FireEye's situation, the necessary belt-tightening should happen across the board; that figure is an indication that this is what's happening.As Check Point CEO Gil Shwed can attest, its takes time to initiate, let alone complete, a business transformation. Shwed instituted a software- subscription sales/  at his company a couple of years ago, and shareholders are now reaping the benefits.Thanks to its slow-but-steady subscription focus, Check Point reported an 8% increase in revenue of $435 million in the first quarter. But the lower costs associated with servicing existing clients rather than relying solely on new product sales helped push Check Point's earnings per share up an impressive 15% to $1.08. That's the model FireEye is working to emulate, which brings us to another of its best moves in 2017.FireEye may have only increased sales by 3%, but it's  it did lifted them that bodes well for the future. Product sales decreased a whopping 30% in Q1 to $23.74 million, yet FireEye was still able to post an incremental gain in total revenue by delivering on its subscription emphasis.The subscription and services unit reported a 12% jump in sales to $150 million for the quarter, more than making up for the precipitous drop in product sales; that unit now accounts for 86% of total revenue. For some perspective, including software updates and subscription revenue, the two key areas combined accounted for 71% of Check Point's total revenue.Cutting overhead while significantly improving sales of its cloud software offerings is a winning combination, and FireEye's delivering on both which is why they're two of its best moves so far this year.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

he year got off to a bumpy start for  (NYSE: PANW) shareholders after the sky-high quarterly revenue gains investors had come to expect began spiraling downward. But that all changed following Palo Alto's first-quarter earnings announcement.The $431.8 million in sales, up 25%, Palo Alto reported last quarter was higher than the company's own guidance and pundit's estimates, driving its stock price up 17% overnight. But with ongoing losses and rampant spending the norm, it could be argued that  after its run-up. The good news is there are several alternatives, each in unique positions, that offer less risk than Palo Alto with a world of upside.Image source: Getty Images.Similar to Palo Alto,  (NASDAQ: FTNT) was another big-spending high-flyer relying more on top-line growth to push up its stock price instead of focusing on growing profits -- until recently. Last quarter was a watershed moment for Fortinet following a better-than-expected 20% jump in revenue to $340.6 million.The sales growth was actually down from previous quarters, when 30%-plus improvements were the norm. The difference with Fortinet's most recent period is spending. While still a work in progress, the company's expenses aren't increasing as rapidly as in the past.The result was a six-fold improvement in Fortinet's per-share profit to $0.06 compared with $0.01 a share last year. But the real arrow in Fortinet's quiver was its 28% gain in service revenue to $205.3 million. Building a reliable, and relatively predictable, source of revenue will help keep Fortinet's positive momentum going for years to come.The security stock with better prospects than Palo Alto going forward may come as a surprise to some:  (NASDAQ: FEYE) . After reporting a meager 3% year-over-year increase in revenue of $173.7 million, FireEye's stock has risen 24%, making us ask, why? The answer is the  is a better long-term option than Palo Alto.When Kevin Mandia took over the CEO chair duties last year, FireEye was in disarray. Losses were mounting, and serious changes were needed. Last quarter, investors saw the result of those changes. Paring costs -- including workforce reductions -- improving efficiencies, and shifting to a cloud software subscription focus topped Mandia's to-do list.Operating expenses decreased by an impressive 29% in the first quarter, which helped cut FireEye's per-share losses by more than half, to $0.48 from last year's $0.98 a share. Excluding one-time items, earnings-per-share (EPS) losses went from $0.47 a year ago to just $0.09 a share. Mandia's subscription emphasis is also paying off, jumping 12% to $150 million, equal to an eye-catching 86% of total revenue.A common theme among all of the stocks above, including the last stock that's better than Palo Alto,  (NASDAQ: CHKP) , is the transition to software subscription sales in the cloud and the recurring revenue it brings. The difference with Check Point is that CEO Gil  well ahead of the others, and it shows.Last quarter, revenue grew 8% to $435.5 million, above consensus expectations. But the reason Check Point stock is up 30% year to date, and is generally less volatile than Palo Alto, is the steady rise in subscription revenue. Total sales may not have impressed some investors, but the stellar 27% gain from the subscription unit to $112 million sure did. And it gets better.Toss in Check Point's $197 million in software updates and servicing sales, and an astonishing 71% of total revenue is recurring. The lower costs associated with subscriptions and servicing were again on display last quarter. Earnings climbed 14% to $1.08 a share compared to $0.97 a year ago, which has been an on-going theme for Check Point. Slow but steady revenue growth, combined with nearly twice the bottom-line EPS improvements, make Check Point the better buy.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"he year has been good for many data security providers, including  (NYSE: PANW) and  (NASDAQ: CHKP) . After Palo Alto reported third-quarter results on May 31, its shares surged 17% on over six times its average trading volume the following day. After the run, Palo Alto stock is now up 13% this year.Check Point has also enjoyed 2017, rising 36% so far, though the competitors continue to manage their businesses differently. Palo Alto's expenses didn't increase as much as in past quarters, but it still aggressively spends to fuel its top line. Check Point takes a more conservative approach to its business.Image source: Palo Alto Networks.Excluding one-time items, the $0.61 a share Palo Alto reported last quarter beat pundits' estimates of $0.55, and its $431.8 in revenue was also above the $412.1 million expected and a 25% increase. But the  didn't stop there for Palo Alto shareholders. The $481 million to $491 million expected this quarter was a pleasant surprise, as was per-share guidance of $0.78 to $0.80. Spending continues to outpace revenue growth, but the difference was less dramatic.Cost of revenue rose 29% to 123.7 million, but operating expenses ""only"" increased 18% to $357.2 million. Palo Alto's spending has hampered its stock price for much of the past year as revenue growth waned, so reigning that in is a step in the right direction. That said, Palo Alto can't seem to remedy one problem area in particular: sales and marketing expenses.The good news is the $226.9 million spent on sales and marketing last quarter was just 16% higher than a year ago. The not-so-good news is that Palo Alto is still spending over half of its total revenue in sales costs. But with top-line growth surprisingly strong, investors have clearly turned a blind eye.Image source: Check Point Software.Like other data security providers, Check Point is laser-focused on growing its software subscription sales, which in turn boosts recurring revenue. Last quarter's 8% jump in sales to $435 million beat expectations, as did Check Point's $1.08 per-share earnings, a 15% improvement year over year. The growth Check Point enjoyed last quarter was driven by a 27% jump in software subscription revenue to $112 million.The recurring revenue foundation Check Point has been building for well over a year continues to make up a larger portion of sales with each passing quarter, and the benefits of its successful transition can be measured by its rising profitability.Though Check Point's selling-related costs rose to $106.2 million, it still represents less than a quarter of total revenue. Compared to Palo Alto forking out 53% of its revenue to the sales and marketing folks, Check Point's overhead in that department is hardly a blip on the radar. Why? Because it's  to provide service and updates to existing customers than it is to over-rely on generating new business.As Palo Alto stock recently demonstrated (again), it remains a darling of pundits and investors alike. Last quarter was a good one, to be sure, but it appears it will be next year or beyond before Palo Alto can boast even the slightest of profits. That said, for those who don't mind a higher degree of risk and won't panic with wild price swings, Palo Alto offers a lot of upside.For the more fundamental investor who appreciates the notion of a relatively stable and reliable source of revenue quarter in and quarter out, Check Point software is the hands-down better buy. Because of Check Point's stable growth, its stock is not likely to jump 17% in a day, but rather consistently increase over time. Personally, I prefer fundamentally sound alternatives with predictable increases in profits, so Check Point gets the nod from me.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"he data security market was disappointing last year, and shareholders in both  (NASDAQ: FEYE) and its peer  (NASDAQ: CHKP) paid the price as the stocks delivered lackluster performances. But so far, 2017 has been far more pleasant: FireEye and Check Point shares are soaring, up 33% and 35%, respectively.But other than sharing a market that some pundits expect will generate as much as $1 trillion in revenue between now and 2022, their impressive share price runs have been propelled by decidedly different stories.FireEye reported anemic top-line growth and another per-share loss for its first quarter, but its stock has rallied 8% since it shared its results. Check Point, by contrast, has consistently overachieved on the top and bottom lines, and its subscription-based, recurring-revenue model is hitting on all cylinders. So answering the question of which is the better buy, FireEye or Check Point, should be a snap right? Not so fast.Image source: FireEye.After FireEye posted a 3% increase in revenue of $173.7 million to kick off the year, its stock soared 13% to end the May 2 trading day. The reasons for such giddiness were twofold: One, FireEye's sales beat analysts' estimates. Secondly, guidance for Q2 revenue in the $173 million to $179 million range also surpassed expectations.Of course, large gains in share price based solely on performance relative to pundits' estimates rarely last. But in FireEye's case, the  . After CEO Kevin Mandia took the helm, big changes followed, including layoffs and a restructuring. The biggest maneuver involved cutting overhead while instituting a shift away from hardware to cloud-based security software. Now, investors are beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel for FireEye isn't a train after all.Mandia asserted that FireEye made ""continued progress on our path to profitability in the first quarter, improving operational efficiency while managing transitions on multiple fronts,"" and he was right. FireEye's operating expenses nosedived 28% to $180.85 million last quarter, and cost of revenue sank nearly 10%, even as revenue rose. The company lost $0.48 a share, but that was half the magnitude of 2016's Q1 loss. Excluding one-time items, FireEye's EPS loss of $0.09 was a fraction of 2016's $0.47 a share adjusted loss.Image source: Check Point Software.Check Point Software's first quarter revenue increased 8% year over year to $435 million, and its EPS of $1.08 was an impressive 15% improvement. Check Point's deferred revenue, a sign of what to expect going forward, shot up 20% to $1.06 billion. But the icing on the cake was its software subscription sales.Subscription sales and the recurring revenue they generate jumped 27% to $112 million, and they continue to make up a larger fraction of total revenue each quarter. What makes Check Point's recurring revenue so appealing from an investor standpoint is that it's a relatively predictable foundation to build upon with each successive quarter.Another positive, and a critical reason CEO Gil Shwed implemented the change to a subscription software model, is that it  to steadily grow ongoing revenue than to rely on a few big sales each quarter. In Q1, Check Point's revenue rose by more than $31 million compared to a year ago, but its operational expenses increased by just $22.6 million.FireEye demonstrated again last quarter that its own shift to cloud-based software is working, and its efforts to increase operational efficiency are humming along at a fantastic clip. A lot of CEOs talk about streamlining costs, but FireEye is walking the walk, and that speaks volumes about Mandia and the leadership team.The biggest difference between Check Point Software and FireEye is that Shwed started heading in the right direction earlier, so it's further along that path, which is obviously working like a charm. That, combined with FireEye's share price may be a bit ahead of itself, means that between these two, Check Point -- by an ever-so-slight margin -- gets the nod.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"n recent trading, shares of Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd. (Symbol: CHKP) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $111.00, changing hands for $111.06/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 18 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd. , but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $95.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $126.00. The standard deviation is $8.408.But the whole reason to look at the  CHKP price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with CHKP crossing above that average target price of $111.00/share, investors in CHKP have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $111.00 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd. :

nvestors assume some measure of risk with the purchase of any stock. However, some stocks are more risky than others. For example, aggressive growth stocks often face wild swings in share price based on a single quarter's results or market challenges, among others. Additionally, fundamental valuation methods such as price-earnings (P/E) and price-to-sales ratios go out the window.Others, including  (NASDAQ: FEYE) , face another type of risk: buying on the assumption that its restructuring efforts will continue in the coming months and years. Pundits and investors seem to think CEO  and team can keep the ball rolling: FireEye's stock price is up 34% in 2017, despite anemic top-line growth.Image source: FireEye.Much of this year's stock run-up came after FireEye's better-than-expected first-quarter results on May 2. FireEye started the year with revenue of $173.7 million and billings of $152.4 million, both beat guidance but were only a 3% gain and an 18% decline year over year, respectively. Based on FireEye's 30% jump in share price since early May, it appears investors liked what they saw.As last quarter demonstrated, Mandia's promises of a more streamlined FireEye with an eye toward cloud software subscription sales was more than just CEO-speak. FireEye shaved 29% off its operating expenses compared to a year-ago, which boosted margins and cut its per-share losses by more than half, to $0.48 compared to 2016's $0.98 a share.Product sales sunk 30% for the quarter, but FireEye was still able to eke out its total revenue gain by increasing subscription and service results 12% to $150 million. The recurring revenue derived from focusing on lower cost software subscriptions and servicing existing customers will slow top-line growth in the near term, as it did last quarter, but it also builds a reliable foundation over the long run.Unlike FireEye, which is in the early stages of its cost-cutting and software subscription initiatives,  (NASDAQ: CHKP) has already been there, done that. One risk FireEye faces is whether or not it can continue its efficiency push and still grow revenue even slightly. Any slip-up and investors can bet much, if not all, of its 35% increase in share price this year will be gone in a heartbeat.Check Point, on the other hand, has negated much of the aforementioned risk, as a glance at last quarter makes clear. Though Check Point's total sales rose  8% in the first quarter, its recurring subscription revenue soared 27% to $112 million.Combined with Check Point's software updates and maintenance revenue of $197 million, subscriptions accounted for 71% of its $435.45 million in total sales.The end result of Check Point's  to all things software was a 15% jump in per-share earnings to $1.08, or nearly twice the growth of total revenue. Can FireEye deliver as Check Point does? Shareholders certainly hope so, or its stock price will come under enormous pressure. Virtually everything hinges on Mandia and team continuing the momentum it gained last quarter.With any hiccup along the way, be it revenue nosedives due to cost-cutting or competitive forces, FireEye's share price already assumes a successful transformation, ala Check Point. That in turn begs the question: Has FireEye gotten ahead of itself because of its positive momentum?The slightest disappointment in the data security market, as happened last year, would also hit FireEye harder than most given its somewhat precarious, high-flying share price. All that being said, FireEye is an aggressive, but eventually sound investment alternative: just not yet. Existing shareholders shouldn't run for the hills, but for investors still on the fence, waiting for another quarter or two similar to the start of 2017 could change FireEye's risk level: Time will tell.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"esearch firm Markets and Markets estimates that the global cybersecurity market will grow from $122.5 billion in 2016 to $202.4 billion in 2021, making it one of the hottest growth industries in the tech sector. That industry has been getting plenty of attention lately due to the  and new data breaches at  , OneLogin, K-Mart, and other companies.However, cybersecurity stocks can also be hard to invest in, since many companies have confusing business models, flaky fundamentals, and high valuations. Today, I'll discuss two popular cybersecurity stocks I would avoid, and one which I would consider buying.Image source: Getty Images. (NYSE: PANW) provides next-gen firewalls, which strengthen traditional firewalls with network device filtering tools, to enterprise customers. On the surface, Palo Alto's growth looks robust -- its revenue rose 55% in 2015 and 49% in 2016, and is expected to grow another 26% this year. Wall Street expects its non-GAAP earnings to rise 55% this year.However, Palo Alto still  on a GAAP basis, due to hefty stock-based compensation (SBC) expenses. Those expenses rose 7% annually to $120.6 million, or 28% of its revenues, last quarter -- resulting in a GAAP loss of $0.67 per share. That was only a marginal improvement from its loss of $0.73 a year earlier, and indicates that Palo Alto isn't making a real profit despite growing its revenue at a torrid pace -- and that top line growth is decelerating. Moreover, Palo Alto trades at 7.7 times sales, which is higher than the industry average of 5.8 for application software makers.That's why I won't touch Palo Alto -- it's an unprofitable company with decelerating growth and undisciplined spending which trades at an unjustified premium to the market. (NASDAQ: FEYE) provides threat detection solutions, which attempt to intercept attacks before they breach a network's perimeter. Its revenue rose 46% in 2015, 15% in 2016, and is expected to grow just 2%  year.That slowdown is attributed to the company  from slower-growth on-site appliances to subscription-based cloud services like Helix, which bundle together multiple services in a ""platform""; and HX, a next-gen product which protects network endpoints from malware.Image source: FireEye.FireEye has never posted a GAAP or non-GAAP profit before, but its losses are narrowing by both metrics. Like Palo Alto, FireEye is also dragged down by heavy SBC expenses, which claimed 25% of its revenue last quarter. But unlike Palo Alto, FireEye is reducing those expenses with layoffs -- that's why its SBC expenses dropped 32% annually during that quarter. That move  its GAAP loss.FireEye also trades at a discount to the industry with a P/S ratio of 3.6, so its downside potential seems limited at current prices. Nonetheless, I would still avoid FireEye -- its sales growth is tepid and it remains unprofitable.Investors who dislike Palo Alto's high SBC expenses and FireEye's weak sales growth should consider buying  (NASDAQ: CHKP) , the  of Palo Alto founder Nir Zuk.Check Point's flagship product, Firewall-1, upgraded traditional firewalls with ""stateful inspection"" features which track the operating state of network connections. It also sells ZoneAlarm, a popular firewall for mainstream consumers.On the surface, Check Point's growth figures look dull. Its revenue rose 7% last year, and analysts anticipate 8% growth this year. However, the company is profitable by both non-GAAP and GAAP measures. Its non-GAAP EPS rose 13% to $4.72 per share last year, while its GAAP EPS rose 12% to $4.18. Check Point generates steady bottom line growth with disciplined spending and low SBC expenses, which used up less than 5% of its revenues during the year. Analysts expect its non-GAAP earnings to rise 9.5% this year.Check Point's main weakness is its valuation. The stock trades at 11.3 times sales, which is well above the industry average of 5.8. However, its P/E of 27 remains much lower than the industry average of 111 for software companies.The cybersecurity industry is a hot one, but many top players have undisciplined spending habits like Palo Alto, sluggish sales growth like FireEye, high valuations, or non-existent profits.Palo Alto and FireEye might be good plays for speculative investors, but I personally prefer companies with stable top line growth and growing profitability. That's why I'd avoid the first two stocks but consider buying shares of Check Point Software.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Among the largest underlying components of IEFA, in trading today Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (Symbol: TEVA) is up about 0.5%, Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd. (Symbol: CHKP) is up about 1%, and Mobileye NV Amsterdam (Symbol: MBLY) is higher by about 0.1%.  The chart below shows the one year price performance of IEFA, versus its 200 day moving average:Looking at the chart above, IEFA's low point in its 52 week range is $48.33 per share, with $62.76 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $60.66. Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@IEFA, TEVA, CHKP, MBLY: Large Inflows Detected at ETF@2017-06-21@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/iefa-teva-chkp-mbly-large-inflows-detected-etf-2017-06-21
 successful portfolio manager understands the importance of adding well-performing stocks at the right time. Indicators of a stock's bullish run includes a rise in its share price and strong fundamentals.One such stock that investors need to hold on to right now is  . There are a few short-lived concerns regarding the stock but it has the potential to perform well over the long haul.The stock has returned approximately 20.4% in the last three months, outperforming the Zacks categorized IT security industry's gain of 14.7%.Let's look at the reasons behind Palo Alto Networks' solid momentum.Palo Alto Networks allows firms, service providers and government bodies to impose tighter security measures through its network security platform. The company reported wider-than-expected loss in the third-quarter fiscal 2017. Revenues, however, surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company provided encouraging revenue guidance for the fourth quarter.For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, Palo Alto Networks expects revenues in the range of $481 million to $491 million, up 20% to 23% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $484.4 million. The company expects non-GAAP earnings per share within 78 cents to 80 cents.Palo Alto Networks is gaining customer accounts and increasing penetration of existing customers, thereby driving revenue growth. During the third quarter, the company added over 2,000 customers, bringing the total to approximately 39,500 worldwide, including over 86 of the Fortune 100 and more than 60% of the Global 2,000. It is to be noted that in each of the last 21 quarters, Palo Alto has added at least 1,000 customers. The vast customer base presents the company an opportunity to upsell products within its installed user base. Any product revamp brings in additional dollars as enterprises attempt to keep their threat-management infrastructure updated. These factors, in turn, support the company's top line.Revenue growth seems to be steady, aided by strength across all its geographical regions and business segments. Customer wins coupled with expansion of the company's existing customer base are other positives. We believe that the company's product refreshes and acquisition synergies will boost revenues, going forward.Given that the company's long-term earnings per share growth rate is 27.9% and has a Growth Style Score of 'A', we believe that the stock still has much upside potential.Although the company is keen on expanding its cloud exposure, a volatile spending environment and competition from Cisco Systems, Inc.  and Check Point Software Technologies Ltd.  remain concerns.Keeping these positives in mind, we feel Palo Alto Networks is one such technology stock that deserves a place in investors' portfolio. We can essentially filter the negatives and focus on the positives which drive price.Palo Alto Networks carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock worth considering is NV5 Global Inc.  , sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see  .The long-term expected earnings per share growth rate for NV5 Global is 20%.Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

"lenty of fortunes have been made or lost in the network security sector. As the concept of networked data digs deeper and deeper into our everyday lives, the need to keep those crucial data flows intact and safe rises exponentially.So how can investors strike gold in the network security market? Here are three of the industry's best buys right now. Read on to see what sets  (NASDAQ: EXTR) ,  (NYSE: PANW) , and  (NASDAQ: CHKP) at the head of the table.Image source: Getty Images.Check Point's is focusing its business on three types of network security: Mobility,  , and proactive threat prevention. Taken together, the company's management envisions a complete one-stop security solution for modern enterprises. Many companies supply one or two of these network security components, but the full trifecta is a big selling point.Good things are happening on the strictly financial side of Check Point's business, too. The company is in the process of moving over from traditional software license sales to multi-year subscription contracts, paving the way for stronger customer loyalty and more predictable revenue growth.The stock trades at a somewhat inflated 25 times trailing earnings and 19 times free cash flows, but Check Point investors can also look back at at several years of steady growth on both the top and bottom lines.""It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price,""  . Check Point looks like a winner in that light. data by If Check Point is a safe bet in a hot market, Palo Alto Networks is kind of a turnaround story in a slightly smaller security niche.Palo Alto was built from the ground up to provide data security in the cloud.  , the company always aimed to give its clients control of their security firewalls in a very detailed security model.Investors enjoyed market-crushing returns in 2014 and 2015. Sales doubled and share prices tripled over that span, while cash flows nearly quadrupled. data by But the stock has been pummeled since the start of 2016, as the raucous rate of top-line growth started showing signs of a slowdown. The resulting stock chart is not exactly pretty: data by Palo Alto is still growing sales and earnings at a hefty clip, often replacing far larger rivals at the negotiating table with enterprise clients. Even after these drastic cuts, the stock still trades at lofty multiples to any fundamental metric you pick. Investing here requires a strong dose of risk tolerance. That being said, Palo Alto shares could skyrocket again as soon as the company gets back on the old hyper-growth path.And the thing is, Palo Alto really hasn't  its disproportionate growth in the first place. This turnaround sure is starting from a shallow trough.Extreme Networks takes a different view of the networking market, doubling down on high-speed connections over long geographical distances. Though Extreme's solutions include switching hardware, each product is a high-powered software package wrapped in the necessary bits of networking hardware.The company's software-driven networking tools are a perfect match for cloud computing environments, and the software focus also allows Extreme and its clients to update and retool their network switches as new threats and challenges emerge. That's why Extreme Network is seen as a leader in the network security space, ready to revamp its networking tools as the threat picture evolves.The  of data-center operations from  (NASDAQ: AVGO) division Brocade Communications Systems won't change Extreme's software focus, but it will increase the company's market reach.At this point, Extreme Networks shares have soared 160% higher in 52 weeks -- and still trade at a very affordable 16 times forward earnings. It's hard to beat this combination of value, momentum, and operating history.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

wo IT giants,  and International Business Machines Corporation  recently announced a collaboration to fight against growing instances of cybercrime.As part of the agreement, Cisco will create applications for IBM's QRadar security analytics platform. Dov Yoran, senior director of strategy and business development at Cisco's Security Business Group, stated that the deal is divided into three main segments; security products integration, threat information sharing and inclusion of Cisco's security products in IBM's product portfolio.We believe that the partnership comes at an appropriate time as the world just witnessed the impact of ransom ware - WannaCry. Notably, the cyber security market has experienced rapid growth in recent times driven by higher spending from enterprises that are focused on eliminating vulnerabilities in their systems.Per Cybersecurity Ventures, cybersecurity spending will exceed $1 trillion in the period from 2017 through 2021. According to market research firm Gartner, worldwide spending on information security is expected to reach $90 billion in 2017, an increase of 7.6% over 2016, and to top $113 billion by 2020.Increasing spending on cybersecurity solutions presents significant growth opportunity for both the companies.Cisco, a prominent player in the Internet Security market will have access to IBM's huge customer base. On the other hand, IBM can access diverse security products that Cisco has to offer. Thus, the alliance is expected to benefit both the companies.We believe that this will eventually boost their stock prices, which have underperformed the S&P 500 index on a year-to-date basis. While IBM has lost 6.4%, Cisco has gained 6.1%. However, S&P 500 gained 8.1% over the same time frame.We note that IBM's Security segment revenues grew around 10% year over year to $500 million in the first-quarter 2017. Cisco, in its recently released third-quarter 2017 results, stated that security revenues saw year-on-year growth of 9% to $527 million. The latest collaboration is expected to boost the numbers further. | The two companies have already worked together during the WannaCry attack and it has been a fruitful effort as they battled misinformation and identified probable solutions to meet the crisis. Notably, security products of the two companies complement each other. Marc van Zadelhoff, the general manager of IBM's security division, in an interview to the Street, stated that IBM's AI-based Watson cybersecurity offerings will benefit from Cisco's cloud-based products.The collaboration will also provide a competitive edge to both companies against other key players in the industry like Symantec  and Check Point Software  .Cisco and IBM both carry a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

The company expects non-GAAP earnings per share within 78 cents to 80 cents.Palo Alto Networks allows firms, service providers and government bodies to impose tighter security measures through its network security platform. The company reported wider-than-expected loss in the third quarter. Revenues, however, surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company also provided an encouraging revenue guidance for the forthcoming quarter.Revenue growth seems to be steady, aided by strength across all its geographical regions and business segments. Customer wins coupled with expansion of the company's existing customer base are other positives. We believe that the company's product refreshes and acquisition synergies will boost revenues, going forward.The company is keen on expanding its cloud exposure. A volatile spending environment and competition from Cisco Systems, Inc.  and Check Point Software Technologies Ltd.  remain concerns.Currently, Palo Alto Networks has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

"ith  (NASDAQ: CHKP) bumping up against its 52-week high following a strong earnings release, some investors may wonder if it's too late to enjoy the run. But for long-term investors, it looks like there's plenty of growth ahead of the company, particularly because of CEO Gil Shwed's leadership and how management has gone about building the business over the past couple of years.As one of Check Point's competitors,  (NYSE: PANW) , has demonstrated Check Point's slow but steady approach to its business model isn't as easy to deliver on as one may think.A data security interface. Image source: Check Point.Unlike many of its peers, Check Point Software doesn't post ridiculously high year-over-year revenue gains. While Palo Alto was reporting 50%-plus sales gains for nearly two years running due in part to its rampant spending on sales and marketing, which at $226.7 million last quarter, accounted for more than half its total revenue.For some perspective, Check Point's sales-related costs totaled just $106.2 million, less than a quarter of its total revenue. Shwed made a committed effort to build Check Point's business methodically by focusing on its recurring revenue foundation via its subscription-based model and managing overhead, and he's delivering.Though Palo Alto has performed admirably in building its own subscription revenue and became  , Check Point was delivering what many others weren't: steadily increasing profits. One reason is last quarter Check Point's sales and marketing costs rose 15.7% year-over-year, while Palo Alto Networks sales-related costs jumped 24.4%. Recurring sales should result in minimal increases in sales costs and steady bottomline growth, as is the case with Check Point. But Palo Alto continues to spend, negatively impacting its own increasing subscription sales.Check Point reported $435 million in revenue last quarter, an 8% jump compared to a year ago, about par for the course. Thanks to the combination of its sound expense management and the growth of Check Point's recurring revenue subscription sales, earnings per share increased 15% to $1.08. Palo Alto? It's per-share loss increased to $0.67 from last year's $0.66 a share. Check Point's enjoying the benefit of its low-cost, recurring revenue model while the Palo Alto's of the world continue struggling to overcome costs, minimizing the benefits of an on-going revenue model..Check Point's subscription revenue still doesn't equal that of its product and license sales, but the gap is narrowing with each passing quarter. Product and license sales equaled $126.3 million last quarter, up 3% over last year. Software subscription revenue contributed $112 million to Check Point's sales, a stellar 27% improvement.The balance of Check Point's revenue, $197 million, was derived from software updates and maintenance, which should also continue climbing given its software subscription emphasis. The result of Shwed's recurring-revenue focus is it helps keep expenses to a minimum assuming its executing, which Check Point is, because over time it costs less to service existing customers than to continually drum up more product sales.The systematic approach to growth Check Point has opted for doesn't warrant a lot of hoopla. It's just a reliable, steady process that investors can rely on for years to come. While Palo Alto is enduring the inevitable slowing of top-line growth yet is still spending indiscriminately, Check Point keeps chugging along.The more conservative path Check Point has chosen is proving worthwhile. As more pundits and investors take notice of what Shwed and team are doing, shareholders are reaping the rewards, to the tune of a 30% jump in value this year.At the other end of the spectrum are providers such as Palo Alto. Now that Palo Alto is no longer an analyst darling because of its continually slowing sales growth, its shares are down 3.5% this year.Yes, Check Point stock is flying high, but the manner in which it's finally won over investors is highly sustainable, so there's no reason to think it will change anytime soon. In fact, at the mid-range of Check Point's revenue guidance of $440 million to $465 million for this quarter, investors can expect its ""usual"" 7% year-over-year improvement. Check Point has forecast per-share earnings excluding one-time items of $1.17 to $1.25 a share, which would be a 32% increase over last year's $0.95.Considering its increasing quarterly profits and expectations for more, its conservative expense management, and a position in an industry that's expected to  for years to come, Check Point remains a buy, even at the high.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"Macquarie analyst Gus Papageorgiou recently predicted that  (NADSAQ:  ) stock could reach $45 by 2020. However, the analyst may have underestimated the potential of BBRY stock. My analysis, which is partly based on assumptions derived from Papageorgiou's note, indicates that BlackBerry stock can reach $65 by fiscal 2020.that Papageorgiou based his 2020 EPS estimate of $1.82 for BBRY primarily on incremental revenue that he believes the company can obtain from its QNX auto operating system and its RADAR truck tracing device. The analyst, however, seems to have left out a crucial potential revenue and profit driver for BlackBerry: cybersecurity.  the company is working closely with Giuliani Partners, whose CEO, Rudy Giuliani, was tapped to advise the administration on cybersecurity. Moreover, as I also noted, BBRY CEO John Chen said that certifications the company had received would enable it to sell security to ""a lot of other governments.""And of course, the recent WannaCry attack has made many enterprises, including governments, significantly more worried about cybersecurity.Assuming that Papageorgiou did not include a significant amount of incremental cybersecurity revenue in his model, it would not be unreasonable to add another $300 million in revenue to his 2020 estimates (  so an additional $300 million for BlackBerry from the U.S. and other governments by 2020 doesn't seem unreasonable.) carries the same 60% gross profit margin that BBRY reported last quarter, about $180 million of the $300 million will flow to the company's bottom line. And based on its share count of 531.48 million as identified by Google Finance, the incremental cybersecurity revenue will increase its earnings per share by about 34 cents.After adding the 34 cents per share to Papageorgiou's fiscal 2020 EPS estimate of $1.82, we get total EPS of $2.16. If a 30X multiple is applied (that's just a little above  (NASDAQ:  ) current multiple of about 26 and way below the multiples of many other cybersecurity names), BlackBerry stock would be worth around $65 by fiscal 2020, nearly six times above today's share price.Of course, Papageorgiou's estimates assume that QNX will retain a commanding market share in automobiles. Recently, that assumption has been questioned by a number of pundits who have noted that  (NASDAQ:  , NASDAQ:  )  , Android Auto.  that QNX has three advantages over Android Auto: it's a known quantity, it's already been used to power autonomous mobile devices such as robots, and it's much more secure.""Android is perpetually in beta, whereas QNX actually works,"" Strategy Analytics analyst Roger Lanctot was quoted by the article as saying.To be fair, the article was published in November 2015, so it's entirely possible that many of the kinks in Android Auto have been worked out by now. But security is a much bigger issue to fix, and  remains subpar.Since hacking of automobiles could theoretically lead to fatalities in the age of autonomous driving, security of cars' operating systems is a pretty big deal. Maybe that's one reason  (NYSE:  ) chose to partner with QNX instead of Google.And that is why Papageorgiou's belief that BBRY could charge $7.50 per user per month for its automobile security service sounds pretty realistic. After all, $7.50 per month isn't much to pay when your life could literally be at stake.BBRY stock could reach $65 by 2020 based mainly on the growth of its Radar, QNX, and IT security businesses alone. And that probably doesn't give the company much if any credit for its licensed hardware business,  , increased revenue from its patents, any acquisitions it will make with the cash it obtained from  (NASDAQ:  ), and share buybacks. With its many strong potential positive catalysts, BBRY stock could easily generate very impressive.returns over the couple of years.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@This Bullish BlackBerry Ltd (BBRY) Stock Note May Have Underestimated It@2017-06-08@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/this-bullish-blackberry-ltd-bbry-stock-note-may-have-underestimated-it-2017-06-08
"nvestors in Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd. (Symbol: CHKP) saw new options become available this week, for the June 16th expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CHKP options chain for the new June 16th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $110.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.25. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $110.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $108.75 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CHKP, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $110.84/share today.Because the $110.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

If an investor was to purchase shares of CHKP stock at the current price level of $110.84/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $115.00.

Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CHKP shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd. , as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.

he WannaCry ransomware (a type of malicious software) has affected hundreds of thousands of computers and bank ATMs across 150 countries. The malware encrypts the files on a user's system and then displays a message demanding ransom to decrypt the infected files.Not surprisingly, the ransomware attack has pushed cybersecurity stocks higher. For instance, shares of  (NASDAQ: FEYE) have jumped close to 10% since reports of the cyber attack surfaced on May 13, with  putting out a note that it could be one of the prime beneficiaries of the hacking.But is it a good idea to buy FireEye based on this one incident, despite its huge losses, or should investors look at  (NASDAQ: CHKP) , given its focus on growing its bottom line? Let's find out.Image source: Getty Images.Goldman Sachs analyst Gabriela Borges believes that FireEye's incident response business will receive a boost, thanks to its robust reputation and product development in this space. As it turns out, the cybersecurity specialist recently launched an integrated platform called Helix to provide users with an end-to-end solution that acts intelligently to detect and prevent threats.More specifically, FireEye's latest solution is aimed at separating false alarms from the real threats, allowing organizations to detect, prevent, or fix malware attacks in a short time by combining artificial intelligence with other techniques. This could be a key selling point for this product, as the global median time taken to detect a threat is a long 99 days at present, which FireEye claims to reduce to just minutes.As it turns out, Helix had already been adopted by four customers, including two new ones, on the day it was made commercially available. This helped the company add a total of 237 new customers during the first quarter. Therefore, it won't be surprising if FireEye is able to use the latest malware attack to its advantage and  by adding more customers.Check Point Software could be another potential beneficiary of the cyber attack, as it is already working to thwart the threats posed by new variants of the ransomware. In fact, the company claims that its services, such as Sandblast Agent, come pre-built with anti-ransomware technology, which users can't disable even if they want to. This allows Check Point to protect its customers' machines and even recover their data in case of an attack.Furthermore, Check Point claims that none of its clients were affected by the WannaCry hacking attack, per the company's last assessment as of this writing.Check Point's customers are already spending more money on its services to better protect themselves against cyber attacks. For instance, the company closed 50 deals valued at $1 million-plus during the last reported quarter, up 16% from the prior-year period, thanks to the adoption of its advanced threat protection packages. It won't be surprising if the dollar value of its deals continues to climb going forward, as its products seem to have performed well during the hacking.Evidently, both FireEye and Check Point can take advantage of the WannaCry cyber attack, but there are major fundamental differences between them from an investing perspective. For instance, Check Point Software is already profitable, recording  to $182.5 million during the last reported quarter. FireEye, on the other hand, reported a net loss of $83 million last quarter, though this did amount to a 47% year-over-year reduction.FireEye's net loss dropped so drastically because of a 23% decline in the company's sales and marketing expenses and a 32% drop in research and development expenses. Still, sales and marketing currently accounts for a massive 54% of the company's total revenue, which might indicate that it is buying customers instead of focusing on product development.On the other hand, Check Point Software's selling and marketing expenses are a relatively lower 24% of its revenue. That means it can afford to spend more money on marketing, which was the case last quarter, as this line item increased 16% year over year. What's more, Check Point hasn't lost sight of its product development moves either, as its research and development expenses increased almost 9% last quarter.Therefore, Check Point Software looks like a better bet given its profitability, which places it in a stronger position to improve investments in sales and product development in order to attract more customers. FireEye could be turning around, as its latest results indicate, but investors shouldn't ignore the fact that it is taking its foot off the gas as far as product development is concerned, putting it at a potential disadvantage in the rapidly evolving cybersecurity industry.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

hares of  (NASDAQ: CYBR) recently plunged to a two-month low after the cybersecurity firm followed up a solid first quarter earnings beat with soft guidance. Does this dip represent a buying opportunity, or is it a warning that darker days could be ahead? Let's examine the bullish and bearish cases for the company to decide.CyberArk is the market leader in PAM (privileged access management) solutions. Unlike many other cybersecurity players, which shield companies from external attacks, PAM solutions detect internal threats -- like careless or disgruntled employees -- and quarantine affected computers.Image source: Getty Images.Research firm Markets and Markets estimates that the size of the PAM market will grow from $922 million to $3.79 billion between 2016 and 2021, due to the ongoing escalation of cyberattacks and data breaches worldwide.That's why CyberArk's revenue rose 26% annually to $59.03 million last quarter, which beat estimates by $1.2 million. License revenue rose 20%, and its Maintenance and Professional Services revenue climbed 34%. CyberArk has also been expanding its security portfolio with acquisitions. It recently acquired Conjur, a provider of DevOps software.On the bottom line, CyberArk's non-GAAP net income rose 23% to $10.2 million, or $0.28 per share, topping expectations by five cents. Unlike many other cybersecurity companies, CyberArk is also profitable on a GAAP basis -- partly because stock-based compensation expenses (a major expense for younger tech companies) used up just 9% of its first quarter revenues. During the quarter, its GAAP net income rose 74% to $7.5 million, or $0.12 per share.Unfortunately, CyberArk's second quarter and full-year guidance fell short of analyst expectations. The company expects about 22% sales growth (at the midpoint) for the second quarter, compared to analyst forecasts for 24% growth. It expects its non-GAAP net earnings to slip about 17%, compared to expectations for a milder 7% decline. CyberArk attributes that bottom line decline to its increased headcount and additional expenses related to the purchase of Conjur.For the full year, CyberArk expects 24%-25% sales growth, which matches analyst estimates. However, its forecast for a 2%-6% decline in non-GAAP earnings looked weak compared to the consensus forecast for a 2% dip. Those numbers aren't bad, but they indicate that CyberArk plans to spend more heavily to boost its top line growth and widen its moat against potential rivals.That probably wouldn't be a huge issue if CyberArk's valuations were lower. Its P/E ratio of 61 is much higher than the industry average of 29, and its P/S ratio of 8 is also much higher than the industry average of 5 -- which doesn't leave much room for earnings disappointments.CyberArk's stock looks richly valued, but its enterprise value of $1.4 billion is basically pocket change for bigger tech companies. That low price tag has made CyberArk a likely takeover target for any company that wants to become a leader of the growing PAM market. (NASDAQ: CHKP) was  in buying out its smaller Israeli peer in early 2016. That purchase would have complemented Check Point's prior purchases of cybersecurity start-up Hyperwise and smartphone security company Lacoon Mobile Security. However, those rumors gradually faded away, and it's unclear if Check Point will approach CyberArk again.Other potential suitors could include  (NYSE: IBM) and  (NASDAQ: CSCO) , which have both been bolstering their security businesses to offset slowdowns in older business units. IBM was reportedly eyeing next-gen firewall maker  earlier this year, and Cisco has repeatedly been named as a potential suitor for threat detection service provider  .I like CyberArk's business model, and I think that the company still has great long-term growth potential in the PAM niche. I also think that the stock's post-earnings sell-off was an overreaction, since bottom line pressures from expanding the business were expected. I think investors could consider starting new positions in CyberArk at current prices, but they should do so in small increments since the stock remains richly valued and highly volatile.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Global network attacks last weekend turned cybersecurity into a must-grab theme, boosting stocks like  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ) straight past Wall Street's full-year targets overnight. Source: ShutterstockMonday's surge taught us that when traders have security on their minds, they'll pay about four times current revenue, practically across the board. That's well above what the analysts collectively think stocks like FEYE, SYMC and CHKP are worth!So either the analysts need to step up, or these stocks have gotten ahead of themselves. I'm thinking the former better reflects reality. I've been saying as much for years! Corporations and governments need to tighten up about data security, and it looks like that day is finally here.In that scenario, we'll see a lot of money flowing into those companies as management teams shift toward deep enterprise applications and away from consumer-level virus protection.Every chief technology officer who woke up scared Saturday morning feeds dollars to the top line, which Wall Street proved Monday can yield a four-fold multiple on market cap.Play out all the math and it looks like the most bullish voices around this industry were also the best connected to reality. The world is increasingly engaged in a secret cyber war on all fronts as hackers - affiliated with governments, terror organizations, you name it - think they can act with impunity while conventional law enforcement lags.If we see private enterprise step up to fill the gap, the bull scenarios could have FEYE back at $23, CHKP above $125 and SYMC at $40. That's where I think the rally goes from here.Beyond that, budgets open up for emerging vendors. A company like  (NYSE:  ) may ultimately trade up to $47 if the contracts go the right way.  (NASDAQ:  ) could actually justify its record pricing and even deliver added upside. But when the entire industry is on the move, start with the giants and work your way down. If you grab these stocks for appreciably less than 4X revenue, you're likely in the right place.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@These Cybersecurity Stocks Are Finally Getting Some Respect@2017-05-19@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/these-cybersecurity-stocks-are-finally-getting-some-respect-2017-05-19
"espite playing in the same sandbox,  (NYSE: PANW) and  (NASDAQ: CHKP) have taken distinctly different approaches to how they run their respective businesses. In the case of Palo Alto, everything revolves around top-line growth, which had worked wonders for shareholders until recently.As for Check Point, CEO Gil Shwed has, in some respects, sacrificed high-double-digit quarterly revenue gains and instead opted to grow the business in a slower, more practical manner. The distinctions between the two data security providers make the question of which is the better buy an intriguing one.Palo Alto's all-encompassing data security reach. Image source: Palo Alto Networks.About this time last year, Palo Alto was in the midst of a nearly two-year stretch of generating 50% or better gains in quarterly revenue. The result of Palo Alto's impressive run was a stock price that was flirting with $150 or more per share and quickly became a darling among analysts.The problem with Palo Alto's skyrocketing growth was twofold. One, it was inevitable that Palo Alto's quarterly sales gains would slow eventually, which leads to the second problem shareholders are facing today. CEO Mark McLaughlin was spending indiscriminately to drive all that growth, which investors didn't seem to mind as long as it kept reporting those incredible revenue gains.As investors saw last quarter, and are likely to see again when it reports fiscal third-quarter earnings on May 31, Palo Alto is still growing its top line but nowhere near the pace of a year ago. However, spending continues to soar. Last quarter, Palo Alto generated $422.6 million in sales, good for a 26% improvement year over year.Last quarter was disappointing given its history, but what really hurt Palo Alto's stock was guidance for the current period of 17% to 20% revenue growth. The problem is that as sales are slowing, spending continues to grow. Cost of revenue climbed 20% in the second quarter to $113.2 million, and operating expenses shot up 25% to $363.8 million. Not surprisingly, per-share losses rose to negative $0.67 from last year's $0.66 a share.Check Point security interface. Image source: Check Point.About the same time that Palo Alto stock was flying high and had become an analyst favorite, Check Point was somewhat of an afterthought. With single-digit revenue growth the norm, Check Point stock was meandering. Thing is, what Check Point lacked on the top line it more than made up for where it counts: increasing profits. Investors and analysts, however, didn't seem too interested at the time.Last quarter was a microcosm of how Shwed has decided to run Check Point's business. Total revenue grew ""just"" 8% in the first quarter, less than most of its peers. However, earnings per share climbed 15% to $1.06, or 13% after excluding one-time items to $1.20 a share. Check Point's quarter was impressive in and of itself, but it's how it got there that bodes well for the future.Shwed implemented a subscription-based, recurring-revenue model over a year ago that resulted in its relatively anemic sales growth. However, the slower but more reliable recurring-revenue model is paying off handsomely now. Subscription revenue increased 27% last quarter to $112 million, and continues to make up a larger portion of total sales with each passing quarter.So which is the better buy, Palo Alto or Check Point? For short-term, risk-tolerant day traders who don't mind wild swings in share price, Palo Alto fits the bill nicely. However, for investors in search of steady, long-term growth, Check Point's expense management and focus on building low-cost recurring revenue as the foundation for the future put it head and shoulders above Palo Alto, not to mention most of its other competitors.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"ech investors might know that  (NYSE: PANW) provides  and serves over 37,500 customers in over 150 countries -- including over 85 of Fortune 100 companies and half of the Global 2000. They might know that its revenue growth is slowing, and that analysts are concerned about the ongoing disparity between its GAAP losses and non-GAAP profits.But today, I won't discuss the side of Palo Alto Networks that is widely covered by the tech and financial media. Instead, I'll take a look at five lesser-known facts about Palo Alto Networks that might give you a deeper insight into this 12-year-old company.Image source: Getty Images.Palo Alto Networks founder Nir Zuk once worked at Unit 2800, the elite electronic intelligence arm of the Israel Defense Forces. While he was there, Zuk worked with Gil Shwed, who would eventually co-found  (NASDAQ: CHKP) in 1993.After leaving the IDF in 1994, Zuk was recruited by Check Point to help build its flagship Firewall-1 product. He moved to California in 1997 to lead the Israeli company's American team, but eventually left the company in 1999 after conflicts with the management . Zuk subsequently founded OneSecure, an intrusion-detection company, but the tech bubble burst and the company was acquired by Netscreen for $40 million in 2002.  (NYSE: JNPR) subsequently bought Netscreen in 2004.After Juniper ignored his requests to upgrade its firewalls, Zuk left the company and relinquished 300,000 unvested shares which were worth about $6 million in 2005. This led to a decline in Zuk's personal life, as his 10-year marriage ended, his bank accounts dried up, and he moved from his house into a small apartment in Mountain View at the age of 35.That was when former Check Point VP Asheem Chandna, who had become a partner at venture capital firm Greylock, reached out to Zuk. Together, the two developed a ""next-generation firewall"" which strengthened traditional firewalls with network device filtering tools. This product became the core of Palo Alto Networks, which attracted additional rounds of funding and went public in 2012.When Palo Alto Networks went public, Zuk surprised the company's investors when he diluted his own share to 5% so that early hires could own a meaningful stake of the company. This was highly unusual because tech founders often kept a standard 25% stake in their companies.It was also a costly decision. Zuk's stake is worth roughly $520 million today, but he would be a multi-billionaire if he had kept 25%. Speaking to  in 2013, Zuk simply stated that ""there's no justification for a founder getting to an IPO with 25% of the company.""Palo Alto Networks was ranked as the ""best place to work"" in the Bay Area by the  last year. However, Palo Alto's dependence on pricey Bay Area talent is frequently cited as the cause of its high stock-based compensation (SBC) expenses.Image source: Getty Images.Palo Alto paid out 31% of its revenues as SBC last quarter, which caused its GAAP net loss to widen from $57.3 million to $60.6 million. During that period, its non-GAAP net income (which excludes SBC expenses) rose 51% to $59.6 million.Many analysts have speculated that smaller stand-alone cybersecurity players like Palo Alto will be acquired as the fragmented market consolidates under several large tech companies. However, Palo Alto's frothy valuation -- an enterprise value of nearly $10 billion for a company with expected revenues of $1.4 billion this year -- has likely kept suitors at bay.However, rumors in March suggested that  (NYSE: IBM) could make a bid for the next-gen firewall maker in the near future. Investors should take that rumor with a grain of salt, but it sounds sensible. Big Blue needs to boost the growth of its five strategic imperatives (cloud, analytics, social, security, and mobile) with some big purchases, and adding Palo Alto's ""best in breed"" firewall to that bundle would give it an edge against its rivals.These five facts don't address Palo Alto Networks' core problems of slowing sales growth, rising competition, and widening losses. But they offer interesting perspectives on founder Nir Zuk's values and the company's past struggles -- and might help you better understand its  .When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

" (NASDAQ:  )  appears to have been revitalized, fueled partly by the apparent enthusiasm for its enhanced FireEye-as-a-service offering. The company appears to be moving toward profitability, and the valuation of FireEye stock is at bargain levels.

The company added 237 new customers last quarter, including 18 of the largest 2000 companies in the world, and it indicated that its current initiatives It's clear from FireEye's results, especially the increase in its subscription and services revenue, that the  announced a little over a year ago, is being well-received by enterprises.Meanwhile, there are signs that its new products, Helix and NX, are attractive to enterprises. Helix centralizes all of the company's ""network and endpoint protection technologies"" into a single console that ""centralizes alerts from FireEye solutions, and from all third-party products or nearly all third-party security products."" HX is ""an advanced malware detection system.""FireEye said that it closed four deals in four different vertical markets for Helix on the last day of last quarter, which was the first day that the product was available. Two of the four customers had not previously used any of the company's products or services before. Furthermore, the Helix transactions directly led to multiple, additional product sales. And most importantly, the company said that Helix and NX would significantly boost its growth in the second half of the year.Meanwhile, FEYE stock should be helped by the continued high prevalence of hacking and the significant damage it can inflict.  , CNN,  (NYSE:  ), hundreds of  (NYSE:  ) accounts, and the Democratic National Committee were hacked.

"espite playing in the same sandbox,  (NYSE: PANW) and  (NASDAQ: CHKP) have taken distinctly different approaches to how they run their respective businesses. In the case of Palo Alto, everything revolves around top-line growth, which had worked wonders for shareholders until recently.As for Check Point, CEO Gil Shwed has, in some respects, sacrificed high-double-digit quarterly revenue gains and instead opted to grow the business in a slower, more practical manner. The distinctions between the two data security providers make the question of which is the better buy an intriguing one.Palo Alto's all-encompassing data security reach. Image source: Palo Alto Networks.About this time last year, Palo Alto was in the midst of a nearly two-year stretch of generating 50% or better gains in quarterly revenue. The result of Palo Alto's impressive run was a stock price that was flirting with $150 or more per share and quickly became a darling among analysts.The problem with Palo Alto's skyrocketing growth was twofold. One, it was inevitable that Palo Alto's quarterly sales gains would slow eventually, which leads to the second problem shareholders are facing today. CEO Mark McLaughlin was spending indiscriminately to drive all that growth, which investors didn't seem to mind as long as it kept reporting those incredible revenue gains.As investors saw last quarter, and are likely to see again when it reports fiscal third-quarter earnings on May 31, Palo Alto is still growing its top line but nowhere near the pace of a year ago. However, spending continues to soar. Last quarter, Palo Alto generated $422.6 million in sales, good for a 26% improvement year over year.Last quarter was disappointing given its history, but what really hurt Palo Alto's stock was guidance for the current period of 17% to 20% revenue growth. The problem is that as sales are slowing, spending continues to grow. Cost of revenue climbed 20% in the second quarter to $113.2 million, and operating expenses shot up 25% to $363.8 million. Not surprisingly, per-share losses rose to negative $0.67 from last year's $0.66 a share.Check Point security interface. Image source: Check Point.About the same time that Palo Alto stock was flying high and had become an analyst favorite, Check Point was somewhat of an afterthought. With single-digit revenue growth the norm, Check Point stock was meandering. Thing is, what Check Point lacked on the top line it more than made up for where it counts: increasing profits. Investors and analysts, however, didn't seem too interested at the time.Last quarter was a microcosm of how Shwed has decided to run Check Point's business. Total revenue grew ""just"" 8% in the first quarter, less than most of its peers. However, earnings per share climbed 15% to $1.06, or 13% after excluding one-time items to $1.20 a share.

"hares of the world's largest cybersecurity companies-including FireEye  , Palo Alto Networks  , and Symantec  -are soaring on Monday morning thanks to a massive cyberattack that affected at least 150 countries over the weekend.Today's gains were exacerbated by the fear that the ""WannaCry"" malware attack would worsen this week after people returned to their computers on Monday. Cybersecurity stocks tend to gain in response to largescale hacks because companies are more likely to bolster their protection.Palo Alto Networks gained as much as 4.8% in morning trading hours, while fellow industry leaders FireEye and Symantec were up 8.8% and 5.3%, respectively. Barracuda Networks  was up as high as 6%, Fortinet  gained 5.6%, and Check Point Software  moved about 2.7% higher.Overall, the PureFunds ISE Cyber Security ETF  opened with a 4.2% gain, hitting a new 52-week high in the process.This latest attack, which started last Friday, compromised an estimated 200,000 computers around the world. The malware operates like a worm, scanning other machines within the same system for a Microsoft (MSFT) defect that it can take advantage of.The defect is particularly present in older Microsoft software like Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. Microsoft has discontinued support for these outdated programs, but the company did say it was working on special patches to block the attack.The attack commenced just one day after the Trump administration announced a new executive order aimed at beefing up the nation's cybersecurity. While the order is short on actionable details, it does push for new deadlines for recommendations from experts. In fact, the plan is similar to the Obama administration's approach and is rooted in a push to the cloud.Interested in exclusive Zacks podcast content?

 (NASDAQ: CHKP) stock has enjoyed a terrific run this year, rising over 20%, sparked by a solid  report in January. The cybersecurity specialist's guidance indicates that its consistent growth will continue in 2017 as the subscription business gathers more momentum.Check Point Software is a long-term play on the cybersecurity opportunity, as the industry could be worth $120 billion this year and continue growing at an impressive pace in the long run.The need for cybersecurity will get bigger as corporations and governments try to stop data breaches and losses.A Check Point study found out that all consulting companies, 86% of government organizations, and 81% of retailers and wholesalers had seen a data loss event. A Mozy Enterprises study puts the cost of a typical data-loss event at over $400,000, and this is just one of the ways a cybersecurity slip can cost a company.Not surprisingly, Markets and Markets expects cybersecurity spending to double during the 2015-2021 period, up from a compound annual growth rate of 5% from 2011 to 2015.Data from Markets & Markets and Wired, Chart by authorCheck Point Software's top line has risen substantially in the past four years thanks to end-market expansion. Therefore, it won't be surprising if its revenue growth accelerates, as cybersecurity spending increases at a faster pace in the coming years. data by Check Point Software's subscription business has been growing at an impressive rate, accounting for 23% of its total revenue.Data from Check Point's SEC Filings, Chart by author. Figures in millions.Growing subscriptions have substantially boosted Check Point's revenue and helped it to maintain its gross margin at an impressive 88% over the past three years despite a 15% bump in the cost of revenue, ensuring a steady revenue stream without any additional customer-acquisition costs.More importantly, the booming subscription business boosted the company's deferred revenue to $1.06 billion at the end of last year, up 36% from 2014 levels.Deferred revenue, which has yet to be recognized on the income statement, though the company has already collected it, should continue to grow as the company struck $1 million-plus deals with 99 customers in the fourth quarter, up 15% from the prior-year period. In addition, the company's average ticket size is getting bigger, with a 4-percentage-point increase in $50,000-plus transactions, which accounted for 76% of its total orders.Moreover, Check Point has started providing security solutions to  's Google Cloud Platform, whose customers can use the cybersecurity specialist's vSEC cloud security product on a pay-as-you-grow basis or buy the license from the Google marketplace.More importantly, Check Point's security solutions will help it take advantage of GCP's planned expansion into 10 new regions. A lot of GCP customers are interested in using the cloud for artificial intelligence and machine learning applications, and the scalable nature of Check Point's vSEC platform for high-performance applications makes it a good fit.Check Point Software is growing where it counts by driving stronger subscription sales through key partnerships, which should fuel strong long-term growth.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"Chicago, IL - May 04, 2017 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations. Security spending is expected to grow in leaps and bounds over the next few years.IDC estimates that cyber-security related services, software and hardware will see around 8.3% CAGR through 2020. This will come off a strong 2016 wherein security services was the strongest category (45% estimates growth), followed by security software (user behavior analytics software being one of the fastest growing sub-segments). The U.S. is currently the largest market for cyber-security, followed by Western Europe.Gartner says spending on information security will be up 7.6% this year to touch $90 billion and continue growing thereafter to touch $113 billion by 2020. The research firm thinks that spending focus will gradually away from prevention-only approaches to detection and response through the forecast period.Asia/Pac is the fastest-growing region according to IDC, with Asia/Pac excluding Japan seeing 21% growth in 2016 and Japan 16.9%. In comparison, the U.S. grew just 5.8% and EMEA 6.8%. The security appliance market grew 9.7% in 2016 to $11.5 billion.The top five vendors account for about half the market with others accounting for the rest. Cisco is the largest vendor according to IDC with a 15.3% share in 2016 but Checkpoint isn't far behind at 12.8%. Palo Alto with 11.8%, Fortinet with 9.6% and Huawei with 3.2% round out the top five. Cisco and smaller players ceded share while Checkpoint managed to hold its own.There are some very strong secular drivers of this market that should lead to continued increase in demand for years to come.Given the increase in incidences of hacking, ID theft, the increased sophistication of cybercrime and growing privacy concerns, governments across the world are tightening security regulations for companies and banks leading to a security compliance market. Additionally, government procurement of security solutions is also on the rise as technology is closely linked to national security as well.The second major driver is the ongoing shift of corporate workloads to the cloud termed cloud computing. The shift, which includes public, private and hybrid environments, is becoming highly complex and leading to many different security situations, some of which may be unique to a given circumstance. This is leading to a cross-platform approach to security and the evolution of security-as-a-service.The shift to cloud computing hasn't reduced the demand for end-point security because there are still a large number of organizations and individuals with computing devices, many of which are mobile. Some of these also access the information stored in the cloud, thereby representing points of vulnerability. With the advent of IoT and driverless cars, these end points may be expected to rise dramatically, increasing chances of security threats.Cost is the only major deterrent to security deployment, since organizations need space, personnel and software, which suck up significant resources. But this is actually opening people up to cloud-based software solutions.Here are earnings summaries from Checkpoint, Fortinet, FireEye, F5 Networks and Proofpoint: (NASDAQ:  )Check offers policy-based enterprise security and traffic management solutions. Through its patented Stateful Inspection technology, it protects information assets and enhances the performance of enterprise networks.Checkpoint's first-quarter results were encouraging, since the company reported revenue and earnings that were both better than the Zacks Consensus Estimates. Two factors drove the strong results: the first was a stronger mix of new products that resulted from customer upgrades and the company's own bundling policy while the second was the increase in high-value deals (customers with aggregated transaction value over $1 million increased by 16% to 50 customers).Management said that the company saw triple digit growth across the key focus areas of cloud, mobility and threat prevention. Another encouraging factor was deferred revenue, which grew 20% from the year-ago quarter to around $1.1 billion.

Its solutions integrate firewall, VPN, antivirus, intrusion prevention, Web filtering, antispam and WAN acceleration and incorporate both hardware and software elements. Its flagship UTM solution consists of FortiGate appliance product line and FortiGuard security subscription services.Fortinet also reported strong first-quarter results, with revenue and earnings surpassing both management expectations and Zacks Consensus Estimates. Both products and services drove the 19.7% increase in revenue and solid earnings growth. The strength was mostly at enterprise customers in North America.The company is also seeing growth in deal sizes with the number of deals over $100,000 growing 20%, deals over $250,000 growing 15% and deals over $500,000 growing 31%. Also encouraging was the deferred revenue, which grew 31% to $1.10 billion.The company also announced that leading tech companies like Cisco, Hewlett Packard, Nuage Networks from Nokia joined its Fortinet Security Fabric-Ready ecosystem.

It sells both products and services through distributors, resellers and strategic partners primarily in the United States, the Asia Pacific, Japan, Europe, the Middle East and Africa.FireEye's second-quarter results were better than the Zacks Consensus Estimates. The company's turnaround efforts such as product refreshes, acquisitions and cost optimization appear to be paying off because the quarterly loss is significantly lower on slightly higher revenue. The company revealed that a more strengthened leadership team, improved sales execution, enhanced relationship with channel partners and product launches, including Helix and HX drove its performance.

The company's products monitor and manage local and geographically dispersed servers and intelligently direct traffic to the server best able to handle a user's request. The products therefore help prevent system failure and provide timely responses to user requests and data flow.The company's revenue and earnings grew from the year-ago quarter but were below the respective Zacks Consensus Estimates. Asia/Pac was the strongest geography, growing 16%. Enterprise, Service providers and Government (including 4% from the U.S. federal) accounted for 65%, 22% and 13% of total revenue, respectively.

Organizations around the world depend on Proofpoint's expertise, patented technologies, and on-demand delivery system to protect against phishing, malware and spam, safeguard privacy, encrypt sensitive information, and archive and govern messages and critical enterprise information.Proofpoint saw revenues and earnings grow from the year-ago quarter, but while revenue was ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate, earnings fell short. Management attributed the results to continued demand for advanced threat solutions, win rates, new and add-on activity, traction in the emerging products category and a renewal rate that continues to exceed 90%.The shift to Microsoft's Office 365 is proving beneficial for the company as is its partnership with Intel McAfee on the one hand and Palo Alto Networks, CyberArk, Imperva and Splunk on the other. The McAfee deal will help the company sell its email security solution into the McAfee user base and management thinks further product upsell opportunity will also be significant.Growth Score: A, Momentum Score: A, VGM Score: B (mainly for investors looking for growth stocks)Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.  .Zacks Equity Research provides the best of quantitative and qualitative analysis to help investors know what stocks to buy and which to sell for the long-term.Continuous coverage is provided for a universe of 1,150 publicly traded stocks.

ooking today at week-over-week shares outstanding changes among the universe of ETFs covered at  , one standout is the iShares Core MSCI EAFE ETF (Symbol: IEFA) where we have detected an approximate $83.2 million dollar inflow -- that's a 0.3% increase week over week in outstanding units (from 402,400,000 to 403,800,000). Among the largest underlying components of IEFA, in trading today NXP Semiconductors NV (Symbol: NXPI) is up about 0.1%, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (Symbol: TEVA) is trading flat, and Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd. (Symbol: CHKP) is higher by about 0.8%.  The chart below shows the one year price performance of IEFA, versus its 200 day moving average:Looking at the chart above, IEFA's low point in its 52 week range is $48.33 per share, with $60.035 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $59.95. Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Noteworthy ETF Inflows: IEFA, NXPI, TEVA, CHKP@2017-05-02@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/noteworthy-etf-inflows-iefa-nxpi-teva-chkp-2017-05-02
"etwork security company  (NASDAQ: CHKP) delivered another solid set of earnings recently, and served notice that its long-term strategic efforts in cloud, mobility, and threat prevention are starting to pay off. As a relatively mature market leader in its industry, Check Point isn't going to match the growth rates of rivals like  . or  but management has taken steps to increase growth. Meanwhile, underlying growth and cash flow generation remains excellent.Image source: Check Point Software Technologies Ltd.The increased profitability stand out, but don't get too excited; it's largely due to more favorable tax rates. The following chart of revenue and operating income growth gives a better picture of underlying conditions. As you can see, operating expenses rose in 2015 as management increased spending on R&D and sales & marketing with the goal of driving future growth.Data source: Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. presentations. Chart by author.The improvements brought about by those increased expenditures can be seen in the revenue increases in recent quarters, and also in management's commentary on underlying growth conditions. In this context, it's worth noting that Check Point is aggressively increasing the number of software blade subscriptions it sells, which is holding back reported revenue growth.This is because the price of the software blade is separate from the product sale, and goes on the balance sheet as deferred revenue -- over time, it will be recognized as revenue. Therefore, it's important to look at deferred revenue growth and software blade subscription growth to get the full picture. As you can see below, overall deferred revenue grew 14% in the quarter, and software blade subscriptions increased 27%.Data source: Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. presentations. Chart by author.On the , management asserted that its strategic investments are bearing fruit. For example, CFO Tal Payne noted that ""Customers continued transitioning to higher value packages which include our advance threat protection solutions. In addition, some of the acceleration growth came from the shift of revenues from the product to subscription as a result of the bundling of the new appliances.""CEO Gil Shwed talked of ""great customer uptake"" with Check Point's cloud, mobility and threat prevention solutions -- key areas of investment -- and cited triple-digit percentage growth among these products.The company is quietly building the foundation for long-term growth by investing in key areas and developing its software blade subscription sales. In time, the deferred revenues associated with subscription sales will turn into recognized revenue for the company.In short, it was a good set of results, but the company made no changes to full-year guidance.

"Despite the national attention toward cybercrime, not all cybersecurity stocks have harnessed the momentum favorably. Of the laggards,  (NASDAQ:  ) perhaps frustrated investors the most. In 2015, for example, FEYE stock jumped to a near-58% lead at the halfway mark. However, by the end of December, FireEye shares had shed 33%. Source: The following year was mostly a series of failed promises. FEYE stock gyrated from extreme highs to devastating lows within short periods of time.This volatility is ideal for day traders - they love skimming profits from speculative bursts in either direction. But for the rest of us, FireEye was a slap in the face. FEYE stock eventually lost 46% in 2016.Today, investors are hesitant, and for good reason. FEYE stock is up 3% year-to-date, and has gained about 15% since the middle of March. The implied upside is, at minimum, a double-digit annual return, and possibly much, much more. But implications don't mean anything for the FireEye faithful at this point.Still, I don't want to ignore FEYE stock simply based on past misgivings. Stopping and preventing cybercrime is big business. In the U.S. alone, the market is estimated to be worth $18 billion this year, according to InvestorPlace feature writer James Brumley.That's a major tailwind for cybersecurity stocks like  . (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NYSE:  ). Both of these leaders have experienced successes and failures, yet optimism remains high due to the industry's potential.So what's on tap for FEYE stock?The biggest fundamental change may not be product-related, but cultural. The acquisitive nature of FireEye was a source of recurring criticism. However, as  :""… once the company pared back on its buying spree and started thinking seriously about turning a profit, a glimmer of hope started to shine. Specifically, last quarter's loss was the first one anyone could recall that got smaller on a year-over-year basis.""The evidence is plain to see on the FireEye financials. For the fourth quarter, FEYE stock registered an earnings per share loss of 35 cents. This represents a 60% paring of losses from the year-ago level. The improvement came most substantially from a  in business expenses against the prior year. This shift in strategy caused analysts to bump up their ratings for FireEye.Of course, the bullishness is not just attributed to changing internal policies. The company recently released a  called Helix. According to Mr. Brumley:""Helix is an all-encompassing platform that allows customers to interface with everything FireEye offers. It melds threat detection, threat intelligence and automation, and operates as on-premises software or can be run virtually in the cloud.""Not only is Helix a potential game-changer, it could incentivize FEYE stock as a buyout target. Clearly, rival cybersecurity stocks are on notice.As wonderful as these bullish drivers are, I am most convinced by industry demand. According to the  , costs related to  .Click to Enlarge  The U.S. is the most impacted, with average costs per annum for individual companies rising from $11.56 million in 2013 to $17.36 million in 2016.But on a growth scale, other countries are witnessing a rapid rise in network vulnerability. In the U.K., average cybercrime costs jumped to $7.21 million from $4.72 million in 2013. That's a jump of nearly 53%. Japan also has a serious problem, with cyber incidents costing $8.39 million, a near-25% increase from three years prior.Naturally, this pool of demand is a boost for all cybersecurity stocks, particularly for industry leaders. That said, FireEye doesn't need to perform a miracle. They must first induce fiscal discipline, which they are already doing. Then, they must stay relevant, which is the whole point of Helix.Admittedly, the proposition is risky. FEYE stock has hurt plenty of investors. Technically, though, negative momentum appears to have subsided. That could be the markets signaling their broad approval for the changes occurring at FireEye.I won't lie - among cybersecurity stocks, FEYE is one of the most speculative. But it also has the greatest upside potential.The post ) Stock appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@It’s Time to Forgive FireEye Inc (FEYE) Stock@2017-05-02@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/its-time-to-forgive-fireeye-inc-feye-stock-2017-05-02
"n recent trading, shares of Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd. (Symbol: CHKP) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $105.00, changing hands for $105.36/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 17 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd. , but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $84.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $120.00. The standard deviation is $11.236.But the whole reason to look at the  CHKP price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with CHKP crossing above that average target price of $105.00/share, investors in CHKP have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $105.00 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd. :

" massive ransomware attack shocked the world last Friday which halted daily work at several companies, government offices and even hospitals across the globe. According to a report from cybersecurity firm, FireEye Inc.  , the attack which persisted throughout the whole weekend, infected over 200,000 computers in at least 150 countries across the Americas, Europe, Russia and Asia over the weekend.Known as WannaCrypt or WannaCry, the malicious software reportedly seizes the control of computers and encrypted files with a password which only hackers have access to. After that, victims were asked to pay ransom in order to regain control of their systems. The hackers demanded ransom in bitcoin.Citing a report of Avast Software BV, Bloomberg revealed that heavy concentration of infections has been seen in Russia and Ukraine. Apart from this, about 16 National Health Service (NHS) organizations in the UK, some of Renault factories and Nissan's car plant in Sunderland were hit by this attack.Operations of various other companies, like in the U.S. FedEx Corp.  , in Germany Deutsche Bahn, China's China National Petroleum Corp., in Japan Hitachi Ltd., and many others across the globe were adversely affected by this ransomware attack.The most notable thing in this whole attack was that the hackers were able to infect only those computers which have older versions of Microsoft's  operating systems (OS) - Windows XP, Windows 8 and Windows Server 2003. Notably, Microsoft stopped providing support to its older OS in the latter half of 2016, due to which these systems were not upgraded with Microsoft's new security patches.This made the older OS more vulnerable and hackers took the advantage of the same. However, Microsoft, taking a serious action on this issue, stated it will be releasing a security patch for its older OS.According to Bloomberg, Aleks Gostev - chief cybersecurity expert for Kaspersky Labs - is suspecting some Russian language cybercriminals behind this attack. Notably, Russian hackers were in the limelight throughout last year, either for their supposed involvement in the  (DNC) leak or  (WADA) data breach.The latest cyber attack proved that government or private - most organizations across the whole world lack proper security measures.But believe it or not, there does appear to be a positive side to this episode. A cyber attack is good news for cyber security companies, because it increases the chances of security-related purchases by both companies and governments. Hence, investors flock to these shares, sending up share prices.This time was no different - Barracuda Networks  and FireEye were the top gainers - witnessing 3% and 2.3% rise, respectively. This was followed by Check Point Software  and Palo Alto Networks Inc.  gaining a respective 1.7% and 1.1%. Another cybersecurity company, Fortinet Inc.  , also marginally gained last Friday.We expect to see this upswing in share prices of the Cybersecurity stocks to continue during today's trading session as well.The silver lining to this whole episode will be rise in demand for security-related products among companies and governments, in our opinion. We believe that it could bring cybersecurity stocks back into the limelight, which witnessed a dismal run in 2015. Though the cybersecurity stocks seem to be recovering since April last year, most stocks are still trading very low to their all-time highs.It should be noted that the financial well-being, brand image and reputation of enterprises, and governments are always exposed to the risk of cyber threats. Consequently, cybersecurity has become a mission-critical, high-profile requirement.Clearly, cases of such attacks drive the need to beef up cyber safety measures, in turn increasing demand for the services offered by cybersecurity companies.Furthermore, with rapid technological advancement, organizations are increasingly adopting the ""bring your own device"" (BYOD) policy to enhance employee productivity with anytime/anywhere access. This trend, in turn, calls for stricter data security measures.Moreover, various independent research firms forecast strong demand ahead. According to a Markets and Markets report, worldwide cybersecurity spending will reach $101 billion in 2018 and $170 billion by 2020. Gartner had earlier mentioned that IT security spending peaked to $75 billion in 2015.Considering the aforementioned factors, it makes sense to invest in this hot industry group as cybersecurity players are likely to witness sturdy growth, moving ahead. Some better-ranked stocks in the cybersecurity space are Fortinet, VeriSign (VRSN) and VASCO Data Security, all of which carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see  .Apart from this, we believe that the recent attack will also benefit Microsoft as it may see a huge demand from organizations and individuals for its Windows 10 OS. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).If the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.

Average volume of shares traded in the last three months was more than 2.16M.Palo Alto Networks enables firms, service providers and government bodies to impose tighter security measures through its network security platform. The company reported wider-than-expected loss in the second quarter. Revenues also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and fell short of the guidance range, primarily due to weak go-to-market execution. The company also provided a tepid revenue guidance for the forthcoming quarter.Moreover, the decelerating revenue growth trend makes investors slightly cautious about Palo Alto's near-term performance. Notably, the company witnessed over 50% growth in quarterly revenues for nearly two years but the past two quarters. During first and second-quarter fiscal 2017, the year-over-year growth rates were 34% and 26.3%, respectively.Also, Palo Alto's revenue growth guidance range of 17-20% for third-quarter fiscal 2017 has increased concerns about its growth prospects. Additionally, the company's billings growth rate of 22% during the fiscal second quarter was a lot lower than the previous two quarters' growth rates of 33% and 45%.In the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter and fiscal 2017 witnessed downward revisions. Four of the six analysts covering the stock revised their estimates downward for the fiscal third quarter, while five of the seven analysts made downward estimates revision for fiscal 2017.For fiscal third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of 42 cents per share, wider than the loss of 29 cents projected 60 days ago.

ontinuing with its upbeat performance for the third straight quarter,  yesterday reported strong results for first-quarter 2017, wherein revenues and earnings came at the higher-end of the company's expectations and surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate.Check Point's adjusted earnings per share (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets) of $1.10 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.07. Adjusted earnings also climbed approximately 13.4% on a year-over-year basis, driven mainly by higher revenues and a lower share count, which were partially offset by higher operating expenses.On a non-GAAP (excluding stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets) basis, the cybersecurity company posted earnings of $1.20, which matches the higher end of its own guidance range of $1.15-$1.20 and marked a 13.2% year-over-year improvement. | First-quarter revenues came in at $435.5 million, up 7.7% year over year, and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $432 million. The figure was also close to the upper end of the company's guidance range of $420-$440 million (mid-point $430 million). Transition of customers to the company's higher valued packages and shift of revenues from products to subscriptions as a result of bundling of new appliances mainly contributed to Check Point's overall revenue growth.Another factor contributing to overall growth was the increased number of large deal signings. The number of new customers who signed deals worth $1 million or more was 50, a 16% increase from the year-ago quarter's tally of 43. Moreover, customers, who signed deals worth $50,000 and more, contributed 70% to the total order value, up from 69% registered in first-quarter 2016.Segment wise, the company witnessed sales growth of 13.1% in Products & Software Blades and 1.9% in Software Updates and Maintenance. The company also reported a 27.2% surge in subscription revenues at Software Blades.Geographically, the Americas contributed 48% to revenues and Europe accounted for 35%, while Asia-Pacific, Japan, and the Middle East and Africa added the remaining 17%.On a year-over-year basis, adjusted gross profit (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets) increased 7.5% to $386.7 million. However, as a percentage of revenues, gross profit contracted 20 basis points (bps) to 88.8%.Adjusted operating expenses (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets) rose 11.9% year over year to $214.1 million as the company continued to make investments. The increase may also be attributed to higher research and development, and selling and marketing expenses, as well as to acquisitions made over the past year. As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses escalated 140 basis points (bps).Adjusted operating income (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets) came in at $214.1 million, up nearly 4.2% year over year. However, margins contracted 160 bps as a percentage of revenues primarily due to higher operating expenses.Adjusted net income (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets and other one-time items calculated on a proportionate tax basis) was $185.3 million or $1.10 per share, up from $170.4 million or 97 cents reported last year.Check Point exited the quarter with cash balances of approximately $3.797 billion. During the quarter, the company generated operating cash flow of $355 million. In addition, Check Point repurchased about 2.6 million shares for a total cost of $248 million in the first quarter.Taking into account the back-to-back quarters of favorable business trends, Check Point provided a strong revenue and earnings guidance for the second quarter and reaffirmed outlook for full-year 2017.The company expects to generate revenues between $440 million and $465 million (mid-point $452.5 million). The mid-point of the guidance is slightly lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $453.6 million. Non-GAAP earnings are projected in a range of $1.17-$1.25 per share. GAAP earnings per share are anticipated to be 17 cents lesser than the non-GAAP figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.11 per share.For 2017, Check Point continues to anticipate generating revenues between $1.85 billion and $1.90 billion (mid-point $1.875 billion). The mid-point of the guided range is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.87 billion. Non-GAAP earnings are projected in a range of $5.05-$5.25 per share. GAAP earnings per share are anticipated to be 70 cents lesser than the non-GAAP figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $4.71 per share.Check Point started 2017 on a strong note, reporting better-than-expected results for the first quarter. The robust year-over-year upside in the top and bottom lines was encouraging. Buoyed by a robust quarterly performance, the company provided a solid outlook for the second quarter.Moving ahead, rapid adoption of Check Point's data center appliances and continuous enhancements in data center product lines are expected to provide ample top-line support. The company's focus on enhancing mobile capabilities will aid it to tap greater larger opportunities. Furthermore, Check Point's strategy of growing through acquisitions is praiseworthy.Additionally, we believe that Check Point Software will continue to benefit from strong demand for cybersecurity solutions. Note that the financial well-being, brand image and reputation of enterprises, and governments are always exposed to the risk of cyber threats. Consequently, cybersecurity has become a mission-critical, high-profile requirement.Nonetheless, changing customer spending behavior, intensifying competition, an uncertain economic environment and currency fluctuations remain headwinds.Notably, Check Point has been clocking solid returns over the last six months and gained approximately 23.5%, outperforming 14.5% growth recorded by the Zacks categorized  industry.Check Point currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see .Check Point currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

"he total number of data breaches in the U.S. rose 40% in 2016 to hit a record high according to the Identity Theft Resource Center. That's why research firm Markets and Markets believes that the global cybersecurity market will grow from $122.5 billion to $202.4 billion between 2016 and 2021.Within that market, next-gen firewalls -- which integrate traditional firewalls with network device filtering tools -- have been widely adopted by enterprise customers. Let's take a closer look at three of the biggest names in that market --  (NASDAQ: CHKP) ,  (NYSE: PANW) , and  (NASDAQ: FTNT) .Image source: Getty Images.Check Point mainly sells firewalls and other security products to small and medium-sized businesses as well as individual consumers. It serves over 100,000 businesses and millions of users worldwide. Check Point's core technology is based on FireWall-1, a technology for monitoring active connections which it patented in 1997. It also acquired ZoneAlarm, a maker of consumer firewall and antivirus products, in 2004.Check Point's revenue rose 7% to $1.74 billion last year, and analysts expect 7% growth this year. Unlike many smaller cybersecurity players, Check Point is profitable by both non-GAAP and GAAP measures, which both grew 21% last year. Analysts expect its non-GAAP earnings to grow 10% this year.Check Point could achieve consistent GAAP profitability because the Israeli company relies much less on stock-based compensation (SBC) than its Bay Area counterparts. SBC expenses accounted for less than 5% of its revenues in 2016. Check Point trades at 25 times earnings, which is slightly higher than the industry average of 23 for security software companies.Palo Alto Networks, which was founded by former Check Point engineer Nir Zuk, provides firewalls and other security solutions to over 37,500 customers in over 150 countries worldwide. It primarily serves larger companies, including 85 of the Fortune 100 and half of the Global 2000 companies.Image source: Getty Images.Whereas Check Point delivers predictable top line results with decent earnings growth, Palo Alto posts double-digit revenue growth and widening GAAP losses.Palo Alto's revenue rose 49% to $1.4 billion last year, and analysts expect another 25% growth this year. Non-GAAP earnings nearly doubled last year, and are expected to rise 49% this year. Unfortunately, its GAAP loss widened from $165 million to $226 million, mainly due to SBC expenses at the Bay Area company gobbling up 30% of its revenues.Palo Alto's top line slowdown, widening losses, and growing competition from bigger tech companies like  all caused the stock to slide nearly 30% over the past 12 months. However, some of those concerns are overblown, since Palo Alto's longtime customers probably won't abruptly abandon its ""best in breed"" services for untested rivals. The stock still isn't cheap at 6.6 times sales, but that represents its cheapest valuation in several years.Fortinet is the fourth largest network security appliance vendor in the world after Cisco, Check Point, and Palo Alto Networks, in that order. Its customer base includes over 300,000 customers worldwide, as well as the ""majority"" of the Fortune 500. Its core product is a next-gen firewall called Fortigate, which includes security appliances connected to its Fortinet Security Fabric. That ""fabric"" offers end-to-end protection for on-premise, cloud-based, and Internet of Things devices.Image source: Getty Images.Fortinet is also based in the Bay Area, and is weighed down by similar concerns about slowing sales growth as Palo Alto Networks. Fortinet's sales rose 26% to $1.28 billion in 2016, and analysts anticipate 16% growth this year. Non-GAAP earnings grew 43% during the year, and Wall Street expects 22% growth this year. But unlike Palo Alto, Fortinet is profitable on a GAAP basis -- it posted a GAAP profit of $0.18 per share in 2016, compared to just $0.05 in 2015. That's because its SBC expenses only ate up 10% of its revenues.Fortinet's trailing P/E of 202 looks very high, but its forward P/E of 34 looks far more reasonable. Its P/S ratio of 5 makes it a cheaper growth play than Palo Alto, and its fairly low enterprise value of $5.3 billion (compared to Palo Alto's $9.4 billion) might attract potential suitors.Check Point, Palo Alto, and Fortinet will all give investors exposure to the firewall market, but investors should recognize the key differences before buying these stocks. Check Point is the oldest ""pure play"" on the market with steady growth and reasonable valuations. Palo Alto is the fastest growing of the three, but it desperately needs to rein in its SBC expenses. Fortinet offers a better balance of growth and profitability than Palo Alto, but it's often overlooked due to its smaller market share.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

" is scheduled to report first-quarter 2017 results on Apr 27. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 15.65%. Notably, Check Point Software outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice, while matching the same once, over the trailing four quarters. It has an average positive earnings surprise of 6.02%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.We believe that Check Point Software will continue to benefit from strong demand for cybersecurity solutions. It should be noted that the financial well-being, brand image, and reputation of enterprises and governments are always exposed to the risk of cyber threats. Consequently, cybersecurity has become a mission-critical, high-profile requirement.With rapid technological advancement, organizations are increasingly adopting the ""bring your own device"" (BYOD) policy to enhance employee productivity with anytime/anywhere access. This trend, in turn, calls for stricter data security measures.Moreover, various independent research firms had forecast strong demand in 2017. Gartner had predicted that worldwide Information Security Spending would reach $90 billion in 2017, marking 7.6% growth from the 2016 level of approximately $83.6 billion.We believe that Check Point Software must have capitalized on this opportunity and anticipate that this might be well reflected in the company's results in the quarter to be reported.Furthermore, the rapid adoption of Check Point's data center appliances and the consistent enhancements in data center product lines are anticipated to provide adequate support to revenue growth. Additionally, the company's continuous share buybacks bode well for investors.However, competition from Cisco, Juniper Networks and Fortinet  , an uncertain economic environment and currency headwinds remain concerns. | Our proven model does not conclusively show that Check Point Software will beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.07. Hence, the difference is 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . Check Point Software carries a Zacks Rank #3. Though Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 increases the predictive power of ESP, the company's ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are a couple of stocks, which you may consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases:Seagate Technology plc  , with an Earnings ESP of +3.77%, and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see  .Fiserv Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +0.85% and a Zacks Rank #2.While we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

 rolled out a number of products and capabilities that aid in accelerating additive manufacturing, a day after it announced the shipping of its first speedy 3D-printing production platform, Figure 4, to a Fortune 50 industrial customer.The new portfolio of products caters to the growing investment casting, jewelry and dental markets, and also broadens the company's footprint in precision metal production for aerospace and healthcare markets.The company expanded its industry-leading MultiJet Wax family with the new ProJet MJP 2500W and VisiJet M2 CAST RealWax material. These products have applications in jewelry and industrial casting. 3D Systems also rolled out VisiJet materials for the MJP 2500 platform. The platform now comes with rigid properties for applications like snap-fit assemblies.Another breakthrough product launched is a dental model material in rigid tan (VisiJet M2R-TN). This is reportedly the most optimal color for dental models, and delivers superior visual contrast and precision. Other materials introduced are rigid black (VisiJet M2R-BK), rigid white (VisiJet M2R-WT) and rigid clear (VisiJet M2R-CL). The company also extended its 3D Sprint software across the MultiJet printer family.These developments will enhance the client's capabilities across key verticals and dramatically boost their digital workflow, according to 3D Systems.Earlier this week, 3D Systemsdeclared the shipping of its first speedy 3D-printing production platform - Figure 4 - to a buyer. In addition, the company unveiled a Figure 4 platform based on the Figure 4 technology, and NextDent material, which was designed for dental applications.The machine is designed to revolutionize the use of 3D printing, right from prototyping to large-scale production. In fact, the Figure 4 platform is particularly relevant for the dental industry.The company plans to ramp up customer-specific shipments in the second half of 2017. This news and the recently introduced solutions for additive manufacturing will likely be welcomed by investors, as the company has struggled to achieve revenue growth over the past couple of years, which has considerably affected its bottom line.The company's share price has also followed a similar trend, as 3D Systems has had a bearish run on the bourse over the past two years. Its shares plunged 48.8%, significantly underperforming the Zacks categorized  industry's average positive return of 5.9%, over the past couple of years.3D Systems intends to leverage on its technology for production-quality 3D printing in an extensive range of applications. The company is also striving to expand in the key healthcare vertical.3D Systems already has a strong foothold in the dental market, and the Figure 4 system and the latest product introductions will likely expand its footprint significantly in the industry.It seems that these developments have attracted favorable analyst attention, as 3D Systems' estimates have witnessed solid bullish activity lately. Over the past month, the company's 2017 estimate witnessed six upward revisions versus none downward. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 has increased a whopping 143.8% to 39 cents. | Thanks to these bullish indicators, 3D Systems holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Other favorably placed stocks in the broader computer & technology sector include Dassault Systemes SA  , Check Point Software Technologies Ltd.  and Aspen Technology, Inc.  .

Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''.

Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@EFA, TEVA, NXPI, CHKP: Large Inflows Detected at ETF@2017-03-21@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/efa-teva-nxpi-chkp-large-inflows-detected-etf-2017-03-21
"hen revenue in  's(NYSE: PANW) latest quarter fell short of Wall Street's expectations a few weeks ago, shares of the next-gen security specialist  in a single day. To blame, according to Palo Alto, were execution challenges that the company insists it's ""moving quickly to address.""With shares now more than 30% below their 52-week high set this past December, that raises the question: Are Palo Alto's best days ahead?For investors who don't mind some potential volatility along the way, I think so.IMAGE SOURCE: PALO ALTO NETWORKSThat's not to say Palo Alto's results  bad on the surface. For its fiscal second quarter of 2017, revenue climbed 26.3% year over year, to $422.6 million, while adjusted net income per share increased 46.5%, to $0.63. But by contrast, while earnings came in near the high end of expectations, Palo Alto's guidance called for higher revenue of $426 million to $432 million.Speaking to those execution issues during the subsequent conference call, Palo Alto CEO Mark McLaughlin elaborated that the company has seen great success in the past by splitting its sales territories each year, continually segmenting the market both vertically and by customer size, and investing accordingly in future sales and marketing resources. Over the past two quarters, however, McLaughlin states that the company has ""overcomplicated [its] go-to-market motion with a lot more territory splits and segmentation than [it has] done in the past.""What's more, similar to its deceivingly strong results  , Palo Alto is increasingly winning larger deals, which has meant weathering some longer sales cycles as these bigger customers take more time to solidify their purchase orders.And though competition is always looming in the fast-changing world of network security, McLaughlin noted that Palo Alto continued to ""capture market share at high rates"" last quarter, securing several major competitive wins against the likes of  , McAfee, and  both at large North American and multi-national businesses. In fact, Palo Alto saw repeat purchases last quarter from each of its top 25 lifetime customers -- a list those customers would have had to spend a minimum of $16.6 million (up 46% year over year) in lifetime value to make. All told, Palo Alto added roughly 2,000 new customers last quarter to bring its total to over 37,500 worldwide.Palo Alto also swiftly put a plan in place to address its execution missteps, including implementing a reorganization of its account coverage model ""to drive more accountability and clarity."" Next, it's reallocating its sales and marketing resources to match its new structure.In the meantime, however, Palo Alto Networks knows all too well that the reorganization will probably disrupt its near-term growth. For the current quarter, the company anticipates that revenue will grow ""just"" 17% to 20% year over year. And looking further out, it expects full fiscal-year 2017 revenue growth of roughly 25%, which is below guidance of 30% annualized revenue growth provided by the company in previous investor presentations.That said, there's a chance those predictions could prove too conservative. Also during the call, Palo Alto CFO Steffan Tomlinson suggested, ""We're purposefully being prudent and cautious around the guide because we understand that the execution issues will take a while to get through.""So if Palo Alto's sales restructuring efforts prove fruitful in increasing productivity, and as the company grows accustomed to more accurately forecasting those longer sales cycles for its bigger deals, Palo Alto believes it should be able to reaccelerate growth down the road. For investors willing to buy now and patiently track Palo Alto's progress as that happens, I think the rewards should be more than worth any volatility you endure between now and then.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Palo Alto Networks wasn't one of them!

The stronger dollar is a feature of both central bank action and non-action, in other words.A wider gap between relative rates is sure to play out in a still-stronger U.S. dollar.Consensus is more concerned about the effects on the riskier and more volatile emerging market currents, than it is on advanced country currency pairs like the Euro and U.K. pound.All week, there are a number of Fed speeches.

"n recent trading, shares of Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd. (Symbol: CHKP) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $102.94, changing hands for $103.40/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 17 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd. , but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $84.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $118.00. The standard deviation is $10.773.But the whole reason to look at the  CHKP price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with CHKP crossing above that average target price of $102.94/share, investors in CHKP have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $102.94 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd. :

"As the old saying goes, expect it when you least expect it.What a difference a week makes. FireEye stock was upgraded not by one but by two different analysts in the meantime, and FEYE shares are up more than 20% from their mid-March lows. A little over a week ago, you could barely give your  (NASDAQ:  ) shares away. FEYE stock was knocking on the door of new multiyear lows - again - and questions of whether or not  .Does the new-found zeal and a pair of raised opinions make FEYE stock a buy? It certainly doesn't hurt the bullish case, but…On the off chance you're reading this but aren't aware, FireEye is a peer and rival of cybersecurity names like  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NYSE:  ). It's considerably smaller than both, though a known name all the same.What has been missing from the picture more than anything else for FireEye is profits - there aren't any. But, once the company pared back on its buying spree and started thinking seriously about turning a profit, a glimmer of hope started to shine. Specifically,  was the first one anyone could recall that got smaller on a year-over-year basis.Analysts have noticed in the meantime, and taken action.Case in point: Last week, Goldman Sachs  simultaneously upping its price target on FireEye shares to $15. Goldman Analyst Gabriela Borges is particularly excited about the possibility of a buyout, and the  called Helix in April.Helix is an all-encompassing platform that allows customers to interface with everything FireEye offers. It melds threat detection, threat intelligence and automation, and operates as on-premises software or can be run virtually in the cloud.Borges went on to say ""Based on our bottom-up segment model, we expect estimates to be revised higher post a material reset over the last year.""In other words, the market is underestimating FireEye.It wasn't just Goldman Sachs though. Bank of America Merrill Lynch  just a couple of days prior, from ""neutral"" to ""buy."" BofA says FEYE stock is worth $18 per share … the  . The analyst's note explained:""FireEye's core value proposition is centered around having some of the most advanced threat intelligence that lends its value to three areas of innovation: dealing with network threats, strong position in endpoint protection and above all is the value of analytics and threat management.""The new bullish calls sound an awful lot like the themes Mandia laid out in August of last year, when the company retooled its product and revenue model. ""We believe that by broadening our threat coverage and offering competitively priced cloud-based solutions that our products become better suited to distribution through our reseller channel. Our channel partners can play an important role in introducing our new solutions and expanding our customer base.""The new business model wasn't particularly well received, largely because it was accompanied by a contracted revenue outlook. As it turns out though, he was right.Him being right hasn't prevented some FEYE shareholders from questioning Mandia as the company's top executive, however.Up 20% since mid-March, FireEye stock is tough to step into now, even with a couple of key upgrades in tow.Don't let that recent runup distract you from the fact that the company is verifiably on the right track though. While it's still a trade more than an investment, any decent lull is also a decent buying opportunity now that profitability is in sight and an acquisition may be in the cards.The U.S. cybersecurity market,  - and worth $135 billion on a global basis - certainly isn't going to stop growing anytime soon.The post ) Stock Is for Real appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Yes, FireEye Inc (FEYE) Stock Is for Real@2017-03-31@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/yes-fireeye-inc-feye-stock-is-for-real-2017-03-31
"lobal technology company,  will launch the ""Commerce Complete for Retail"" platform at the upcoming ShopTalk 2017, one of the most noteworthy commerce events to be held in Las Vegas. Commerce Complete for Retail is part of Pitney Bowes' Commerce Cloud, an innovative platform acting as the foundation for most of the company's newly-launched products and solutions.Touted as the most ""capable and scalable platform"", Commerce Complete for Retail will provide a comprehensive set of technology, tools and services for retailers to ensure sustainable growth and profitability. Pitney Bowes believes that it will create a unified commerce platform, offering a host of features including intelligent and optimized shipping capabilities. The platform will further unlock retailer's access to a broad range of cross-border customers and marketplaces.Commerce Complete for Retail takes care of multiple services, including marketing, payments, delivery, tracking location, shipping and so on. These added benefits will allow retailers to slash their operational costs and boost customer satisfaction. As an increasing number of shoppers are switching to online shopping, retailers have been facing challenges of keeping up with the desired quality of service. This, in turn, puts significant pressure on their margins.Further, Pitney Bowes' 2016 Global Online Shopping Study reveals that 66% of shoppers made cross-border purchases and this figure is expected to climb over the next few years. The changing times require retailers to have ""must-have capabilities"" that can fortify their global footprint at reasonable costs. The company is confident that Commerce Complete for Retail will help retailers turn their shops into distribution points and optimize margin performance.Pitney Bowes has been constantly introducing products on the back of its Commerce Cloud platform. Encouragingly, this is proving conducive to the company's top-line performance. Overall, Pitney Bowes believes that the platform will enhance its digital capabilities and web-based solutions, and act as a growth catalyst, going forward.Despite strategic product launch, Pitney Bowes has been facing formidable execution issues that have severely maligned its performance. Over the last six months, the stock has had a disappointing run on the bourse, having plunged 23.5%, in sharp contrast to the Zacks categorized  industry's average positive return of 4.0%. The company has a dismal earnings surprise history, with an average negative surprise of 10.3%, missing estimates each time in the trailing four quarters.Further, the company's earnings estimates also moved south over the past couple of months, which indicates bearish analyst sentiment for the stock. It has seen three downward estimate revisions compared to none upward, over the past 60 days. This has led the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 to move up from $1.91 to $1.76. Pitney Bowes continues to witness precipitous decline in sales and margins on account of sluggish end markets.Amid deteriorating market conditions, escalating operating expenses and major shareholders exiting the stock, we believe this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company is unlikely to stage a comeback anytime soon.Better-ranked stocks in the broader computer & technology sector include Dassault Systemes SA  , Check Point Software Technologies Ltd.  and Aspen Technology, Inc.  . While Dassault sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Check Point Software and Aspen Technology carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Analysts have revised the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 earnings downward over the past 60 days, from $3.79 to $3.66, which is a bearish sign.

" open this Global Week Ahead with a quote from the Washington D.C.-based FP Group (FP is short for Foreign Policy). They count 1.2 million daily newsletter deliveries.It is a very respected establishment tied to the more than 40-year-old Foreign Policy magazine, founded by Harvard Professor Samuel Huntington.The purpose and mission: to question commonplace views and groupthink and to give a voice to alternative views about American foreign policy.Here it is--In light of that scintillating U.S. foreign policy backdrop, on Sunday, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe arrived in Hanover, Germany. He is at the start of a four-day trip to Europe. Abe's trip takes him to Germany, France, Belgium (where the EU is based) and Italy.Abe hopes to discuss security issues -- related to a bellicose North Korea shooting missiles at Japan -- and make progress on a Japan-EU free trade deal.In Japan Today, Abe said that Japan ""wants to be the champion upholding open systems alongside Germany."" He further said to the publication that it was through connectedness that economies would grow.He then publicly called for a swift conclusion to the EU-Japan trade deal.On Monday, the Global Week Ahead started off with a new five-week low in the U.S. dollar.In 2017, U.S. dollar strength is all about the rising rates in the USA and the fact that NO OTHER major central bank is moving rates up outside the USA. The stronger dollar is a feature of both central bank action and non-action, in other words.A wider gap between relative rates is sure to play out in a still-stronger U.S. dollar.Consensus is more concerned about the effects on the riskier and more volatile emerging market currents, than it is on advanced country currency pairs like the Euro and U.K. pound.All week, there are a number of Fed speeches. These will provide us color on the U.S. dollar and the outlook for U.S. rates. Some are being given outside the country, in London and in Asia.Also on Monday, Hong Kong's benchmark large cap share index rose to its highest intraday level in more than a year and a half. This is the large French-based automaker. The stock is also has a long-term Zacks VGM score of A, based on a Zacks Value score of A.French stocks have been beaten up for a long time now. This is a large Japan-based maker of electronics components. The stock holds a Zacks VGM score of B too, based on a Zacks Value score of A.You have to love value stocks outside the USA, given the S&P 500 trades at over 18 times forward earnings now. This is an Israeli company. It is the largest capitalization info tech stock ($17.8 billion) hailing from that country.Given Intel's recent purchase of Israel's beloved autonomous vehicle facilitator Mobileye, you need to be aware of this better-known stock and this company. However, the Zacks VGM score is F. In other words, this share story has been bought long, long ago.Fast-moving global FX and share markets may be the most important this week.Look for clarification on the addition of 'symmetric' in the latest FOMC press statement. Chair Yellen speaks on Thursday in Washington DC.David Cameron's speech on the EU on Monday looks interesting.PMIs for the Eurozone are out late in the week, on Friday. , EU finance ministers start a 2-day meeting in Brussels.Chancellor Merkel and Prime Minister Abe hold talks on trade.The unemployment rate in Russia is 5.6%, real wages are growing +3.3% y/y, and retail sales are down -2.3% y/y. That's a mixed picture, with worrisome consumer attitudes.David Cameron gives a speech on the EU.The Fed's Evans speaks in NYC. , the EU's Juncker and Tusk meet Abe in Brussels.The unemployment rate in Finland is 9.2%, much higher than in Russia.The Fed's Rosengren speaks at the Asia-Pacific meeting, and the Fed's Dudley speaks in London.

It's a reason so many Polish people have moved to the U.K.: work.U.K. retail sales (ex-auto and fuel) should be up +3.5% y/y from +2.6% y/y.U.S. initial claims were 241K, and we will get new data on this day. That's super-low.U.S. new home sales should get to 600K from 555K in an earlier print. It has been a mild winter, and stocks are up. Mortgage rates are going up too, so buyers are starting to move.Mexico's bi-weekly CPI looks to get to +5.2% y/y from %5.0%.The Fed's Yellen and Kashkari speak in Washington. , the French manufacturing PMI should be around the prior 52.2. The German manufacturing PMI should be around 56.8. The Eurozone manufacturing PMI should be 55.5.The composite Eurozone manufacturing and services PMI should be 56.2, better than the prior 56.0.U.S. durable goods orders come out.

Over the past couple of months, the company's Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 declined 7.9% to $1.76, thanks to three downward revisions versus none upward.Amid deteriorating market conditions, escalating operating expenses and major shareholders exiting the stock, we believe this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company is unlikely to stage a comeback anytime soon. | Better-ranked stocks in the broader computer & technology sector include Dassault Systemes SA  , Check Point Software Technologies Ltd.  and Aspen Technology, Inc.  .

re you looking for a hot stock that has high chances of outperforming in 2017?  should then find a place in your portfolio.Shares of the company have been escalating since it reported impressive fourth-quarter 2016 results. The indicators of a stock's bullish run include a rise in its share price and continued uptrend in estimates.Check Point registered solid returns of approximately 32.7% in the last six months, outperforming the Zacks categorized  industry's gain of 13.1%.In the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Check Point's current quarter and fiscal 2017 witnessed upward revisions. For the current quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.07 per share, down from earnings of $1.03 per share earlier. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2017 is now pegged at $4.71 per share compared with $4.39 projected 60 days ago.Check Point's adjusted earnings per share (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets) of $1.33 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.15. Adjusted earnings also increased approximately 21% on a year-over-year basis, primarily driven by higher revenues and a lower share count, which were partially offset by higher operating expenses.Fourth-quarter revenues came in at $486.7 million, up 6.3% year over year, and ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $477 million. The figure was also close to the upper end of the company's guidance range of $460 million to $490 million (mid-point $475 million).Check Point witnessed higher demand for data center and high-end appliances. Another factor contributing to overall growth was the increased number of large deal signings.Considering the back-to-back quarters of favorable business trends, Check Point provided a strong revenue and earnings guidance for first-quarter and full-year 2017.For the first quarter, the company expects revenues between $420 million and $440 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $432 million. Non-GAAP earnings are projected in the range of $1.15 to $1.20 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.07 per share.For 2017, Check Point expects revenues between $1.85 billion and $1.90 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.870 billion. Non-GAAP earnings are projected in the range of $5.05 to $5.25 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $4.71 per share.Encouraging top and bottom-line guidance for the fourth quarter also helped in boosting investors' confidence in the company.Check Point's data center appliances and continuous enhancements in data center product lines are expected to provide ample top-line support.Moreover, we believe that Check Point Software will continue to benefit from strong demand for cybersecurity solutions. Note that the financial well-being, brand image and reputation of enterprises and governments are always exposed to cyber threats. Hence, cybersecurity has become a mission-critical, high-profile requirement.Per IDC's report, corporate spending on threat intelligence security services will reach $1.4 billion in 2018 from an estimated $905.5 million in 2014. Another research firm, MarketsandMarkets, projects that the global threat intelligence security market will reach approximately $5.86 billion by 2020 from $3 billion in 2015, representing compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.3%.Check Point is capitalizing on this opportunity and this may well get reflected in the company's forthcoming quarterly results. Additionally, the company's efforts toward continuous share buybacks bode well for investors.Considering these positives, we believe that Check Point is one such technology stock that deserves a place in investors' portfolio.Check Point also delivered positive earnings surprises in three out of the last four quarters with an average beat of 6.02%.Moreover, from a valuation perspective, the stock looks attractive as it currently trades significantly lower than the industry average based on a forward earnings estimate. This signifies huge upward potential. Check Point currently trades at a forward P/E of 21.32x compared with the industry group average of 67.80x.Hence, there is still a lot of momentum left in this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, which is evident from its long-term earnings growth rate of 10%.The stock is in the spotlight with striking performances on the back of solid earnings results and robust growth projections. Keeping this in mind, we perceive that investing in this stock will yield strong returns in the short term.Other stocks worth considering in the broader technology sector are Seagate Technology plc  , Western Digital Corporation  and Micron Technology, Inc.  , all sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see Seagate, Western Digital and Micron have a long-tern expected earnings growth rate of 8.17%, 12.11% and 10%, respectively.Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Noteworthy ETF Inflows: EFA, NXPI, TEVA, CHKP@2017-03-13@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/noteworthy-etf-inflows-efa-nxpi-teva-chkp-2017-03-13
"Chicago, IL - Technology investors have long been focused on Silicon Valley, but there is a different spot on the globe that could be even hotter for start-ups and soaring companies. In this  we explore the surging Israeli market and what sets it apart from the competition, potentially making it a compelling investment in the process. To listen to the podcast, click here: (  )Silicon Valley has long been regarded as a leader in the world of technology, but should investors be looking elsewhere for the leaders of tomorrow? One increasingly important spot for high-tech companies is Israel, a nation that actually has more Nasdaq-listed companies than any other country, besides the United States. This is despite the fact that Israel has under 10 million people and isn't exactly in the world's best neighborhood either. So, how has Israel been able to thrive despite overwhelming odds and become a tech powerhouse in the process?To get to the bottom of this question, I spoke with Steven Schoenfeld, the founder and CIO at BlueStar Indexes for the latest edition of  . Steven is an expert in the Israeli market, and his company provides the index for the Israel Technology ETF  so he has a great deal of knowledge about the Israeli tech world and what makes the country so different.In the interview, we discuss a couple key points about what sets Israel apart from its peers, including how the Israeli defense industry and compulsory military service might be helping to promote an entrepreneurial culture with a focus on key industries to today's modern tech world (such as cyber security or software), and the advent of the venture capital market in Israel too.We also dive into a popular theory regarding how Israel's history may have helped the country become such a prominent player in the tech world, even with its relatively small size. Basically, Steven explains that Israel is more-or-less a 'start-up' itself, and this sort-of mentality has been ingrained in its citizens too.And while many investors might not be able to name any Israeli companies off of the top of their heads, there are actually several prominent ones that are pretty involved in a number of key global markets. This includes Amdocs  , Checkpoint Software  , and Mobileye  just to name a few. We also talk about what kind of industries are growing quickly in the Israeli market, and how the nation might stay at the forefront of the tech space thanks to its strengths in industries such as cyber security and autonomous vehicles.But what sets this fund apart from its peers, both in Israel and the broader tech world? We discuss what the key differences are between this ETF and the broad Israel ETFs such as  or  , but also the tech world too. In particular, Steven goes over how ITEQ's holdings are rarely found in big tech ETFs such as  or  , and why these Israeli companies are often excluded from traditional U.S. indexes.Israeli technology is crucial to many of the key areas of our high-tech world today, while it is also well-positioned to lead us in the hot markets of tomorrow too. And with limited representation in traditional benchmarks, ITEQ and Israeli technology stocks in general could be worth a closer look from investors.So, make sure to listen to this edition of  for a closer look at this 'Start-Up Nation' and how Israeli technology stocks may fit into a portfolio.

Image source: Getty ImagesCybersecurity specialist  '(NYSE: PANW) stock has taken a massive beating in the wake of its  fiscal second-quarter results. The stock was carrying strong momentum going into earnings, outperforming rival  '(NASDAQ: CHKP) 17% gains in 2017. Not surprisingly, Palo Alto's significantly weak outlook for the third quarter threw water over its rally. data by  .Check Point shares, meanwhile, have remained unaffected after Palo Alto's debacle, thanks to the company's solid  earnings. But does this make Check Point a better buy, or is Palo Alto's drop an opportunity in disguise?Palo Alto suffered a major setback when its third-quarter revenue growth guidance of 17%-20% fell way behind Wall Street's 31.5% expectation, thanks to the execution challenges in its go-to market strategies. The company has so far relied on splitting its business into more territories each year, and then pouring money to accelerate sales.This strategy indicates that Palo Alto is looking to buy its way into customer accounts as it spends over 54% of its revenue on sales and marketing. By comparison, the outlay on research and development was way lower at 21% of sales. This model of spending aggressively on sales and marketing and keeping R&D costs down won't work forever in a competitive cybersecurity landscape.As it turns out, Palo Alto's marketing-focused playbook hasn't been entirely favorable as the company's sales and marketing expenses are growing at almost the same rate as its revenue. data by  .It is likely that Palo Alto will struggle with a revenue slowdown in the short run as bigger players such as  (NASDAQ: CSCO) are making a stronger push into cybersecurity. Cisco's security revenue grew 14% year-over-year in the fiscal second-quarter to $528 million. What's more, Cisco could achieve over $2 billion in revenue from this business this fiscal year at its current run rate, which is well ahead of Palo Alto's projected revenue of $1.73 billion.Additionally, Cisco has stepped up its game in the cybersecurity space by launching an improved firewall product family last month. Palo Alto, therefore, might find it difficult to compete and to continue to grow its product revenue -- which remained flat in the previous quarter -- and that will impact its subscription business.Check Point Software's growth isn't  as Palo Alto, but there's one major difference between the two of them. While the latter has been spending a boatload of money on sales and marketing to acquire revenue, the Israeli cybersecurity specialist is more margin-focused. data by  .Evidently, Check Point has way better margins compared to Palo Alto as it spent less than 25% of its revenue on sales and marketing last quarter. What's more, its margins could get even better as the subscription model starts gaining momentum.Check Point's subscription sales jumped 26% last quarter, accounting for around 23% of its revenue compared to less than 20% in the year-ago quarter. Additionally, it entered into $1 million-plus deals with 99 customers last quarter, up from 86 in the prior-year period. The growing subscription business should ensure a steady stream of revenue for the future, while more big ticket deals point toward improving product traction.Palo Alto is a high-growth, high-risk cybersecurity play, so any weakness in its performance will be met with negative reactions on the market. Moreover, the company is yet to achieve profitability (on a GAAP basis) as it has been spending aggressively to enhance its market share.Analysts expect Palo Alto to become profitable in the next fiscal year -- forecasting a forward price to earnings ratio of 35 -- though the road is going to be tough. Check Point Software, meanwhile, is profitable and is better valued than Palo Alto at 17 times forward earnings.Therefore, investors with a lower risk tolerance would be more interested in Check Point as it promises stability. Palo Alto's weakness, meanwhile, looks like an opportunity given the potential of cybersecurity but it will be prudent to wait and watch how it manages the revenue slowdown.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The biggest name in sports entertainment, World Wrestling Entertainment  , is a publicly traded company.The pair also take a look at Tracey's other passion: the movies. Investors can get a piece of the big studios and movie theater chains, but is an interest in film enough to justify adding one of these stocks to your portfolio?Tracey and Jim discuss this question and highlight movie stocks like Cinemark  , Regal Entertainment  , AMC Entertainment  , and Lionsgate  along the way.On  of the Zacks Friday Finish Line Podcast, Content Writer Ryan McQueeney and Editor Maddy Johnson take on this week's biggest stories, including what will go down as one of the biggest market events in years: the massive Snap Inc. IPO.Before that, the hosts covered the latest earnings report from Target  , which underscored some serious problems with the company; the president's first official speech to Congress, which mentioned several huge companies; and Alphabet's  surprise announcement of YouTube TV.Finally, Maddy and Ryan took a look at the historic market debut of Snap Inc.  , the parent company of picture messaging app Snapchat. After pricing its IPO at $17 per share, Snap saw its new stock open over 40% higher, bringing its market cap well above $30 billion. Maddy and Ryan chatted a bit about the future of the company and what it might do to justify that valuation.On  of the The Dutram Report Podcast, Eric Dutram is joined by Steven Schoenfeld, the founder and CIO of BlueStar Indexes, to discuss the state of the Israeli technology industry.Steven is an Israel expert, and his company provides the index for the Israel Technology ETF  . Together, Eric and Steven chatted about how Israel stands out from other tech markets, including why its ""start-up"" culture may have cultivated an entrepreneurial spirit throughout the country.The two also discussed what other industries are growing quickly in Israel and highlighted companies like Amdocs  , Checkpoint Software  , and Mobileye  .On  of the Value Investor Podcast, Tracey Ryniec discussed the investing habits of Warren Buffett and explained how value investors should learn to have a ""strong stomach.""As Tracey highlights, Warren Buffett has made his fortune by being patient and not panicking when stocks slide. In fact, Buffett often buys more when other investors are fleeing. With this in mind, Tracey explains how listeners can learn to buy stocks after it has already been sold off.Using this strategy, Tracey ran a screen of stocks that were down 10% or more year-to-date, had forward P/Es under 15 and had Zacks Ranks of #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy), #3 (Hold). This screen revealed that Aceto Corporation  , BG Staffing  , and Hawaiian Holdings  may be good picks for value-minded investors right now.On  of the Tech Talk Tuesday Podcast, Ryan McQueeney explores Facebook  and its attempts to clone the Snapchat user experience.With Snapchat's massive IPO this week, the focus is firmly planted on the company's innovative social media platform, which allows users to share disappearing messages and post to personal feeds that delete after 24 hours.However, Facebook is the leader in the social media world, and Mark Zuckerberg and friends seem motivated to copy some of Snapchat's best ideas. Ryan discusses why Instagram Stories and WhatsApp Status may actually be better than Snapchat.Check back every week for several new episodes of these shows and many more from Zacks .

"Silicon Valley has long been regarded as a leader in the world of technology, but should investors be looking elsewhere for the leaders of tomorrow? One increasingly important spot for high-tech companies is Israel, a nation that actually has more Nasdaq-listed companies than any other country, besides the United States. This is despite the fact that Israel has under 10 million people and isn't exactly in the world's best neighborhood either. So, how has Israel been able to thrive despite overwhelming odds and become a tech powerhouse in the process?To get to the bottom of this question, I spoke with Steven Schoenfeld, the founder and CIO at BlueStar Indexes, for the latest edition of  . Steven is an expert in the Israeli market, and his company provides the index for the Israel Technology ETF (ITEQ) so he has a great deal of knowledge about the Israeli tech world and what makes the country so different.In the interview, we discuss a couple key points about what sets Israel apart from its peers, including how the Israeli defense industry and compulsory military service might be helping to promote an entrepreneurial culture with a focus on key industries to today's modern tech world (such as cyber security or software), and the advent of the venture capital market in Israel too.We also dive into a popular theory regarding how Israel's history may have helped the country become such a prominent player in the tech world, even with its relatively small size. Basically, Steven explains that Israel is more-or-less a 'start-up' itself, and this sort-of mentality has been ingrained in its citizens too.And while many investors might not be able to name any Israeli companies off of the top of their heads, there are actually several prominent ones that are pretty involved in a number of key global markets. This includes Amdocs (  ), Checkpoint Software (  ), and Mobileye (  ) just to name a few. We also talk about what kind of industries are growing quickly in the Israeli market, and how the nation might stay at the forefront of the tech space thanks to its strengths in industries such as cyber security and autonomous vehicles.But what sets this fund apart from its peers, both in Israel and the broader tech world? We discuss what the key differences are between this ETF and the broad Israel ETFs such as  or  , but also the tech world too. In particular, Steven goes over how ITEQ's holdings are rarely found in big tech ETFs such as  or  , and why these Israeli companies are often excluded from traditional U.S. indexes.Israeli technology is crucial to many of the key areas of our high-tech world today, while it is also well-positioned to lead us in the hot markets of tomorrow too. And with limited representation in traditional benchmarks, ITEQ and Israeli technology stocks in general could be worth a closer look from investors.So, make sure to listen to this edition of  for a closer look at this 'Start-Up Nation' and how Israeli technology stocks may fit into a portfolio.

Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Notable ETF Outflow Detected - EFG, NXPI, CHKP, TEVA@2017-03-02@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/notable-etf-outflow-detected-efg-nxpi-chkp-teva-2017-03-02

" (NYSE: CHK) ,  (NASDAQ: CHKP) , and  (NASDAQ: EXAS) are very different companies, but one thing that they do share in common is market-beating returns. Here's why these stocks have produced envy-inspiring gains that caught many investors off guard. (  ): Once a market darling, then an absolute outcast, Chesapeake Energy  stock has turned the corner and become popular again.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Ten years ago, Chesapeake Energy was riding high on the natural gas boom  fueled by the mammoth gas reserves it had accumulated and the expected high prices that energy markets would pay for that gas. The story soon turned darker, however, as  plummeted, leaving Chesapeake Energy stock -- and investors who had bought it -- holding the bag. The company's famed founder,  , was first let go, then died in a fiery car crash last year.Meanwhile, behind the scenes and unnoticed by investors who had perhaps written it off, Chesapeake Energy stock was turning itself around. How?Over the past three years, Chesapeake Energy has unloaded assets and curtailed capital spending, cutting its debt load by 24% to about $9 billion. Cash production is way down, too, unfortunately, due to lower prices on natural gas. But Chesapeake is dealing with the downturn rationally, first cutting capital expenditures by nearly half between 2012 and 2013 (when McClendon was ousted), then continuing to cut in subsequent years. Today, an energy company that was spending more than $14.7 billion in cash annually as recently as five years ago spent ""only"" $2.1 billion in 2016 -- and Chesapeake offset half of that spending with asset sales.The result is that while still unprofitable and still burning cash, Chesapeake has demonstrated new discipline in how it spends investors' capital, and it's positioned itself to profit when energy markets turn back around. The stock has doubled over the past year -- and no one ever saw it coming. (  ):  For investors following the data-security sector, Check Point Software may not be the first name that comes to mind. CEO Gil Shwed, unlike his peers, doesn't have a spend-at-all-costs mindset to help push revenue growth at the expense of profitability.The result of Shwed's more conservative management approach is that Check Point is often overlooked for high-flying providers including  and  , to name a couple. Until recently, both Palo Alto and Fortinet were posting 30%, 40%, and even 50%-plus top-line growth. Of course, spending continued to climb for both Check Point competitors, including mounting losses for Palo Alto and a small earnings-per-share profit in the case of Fortinet.Check Point's 6% revenue increase last quarter to $487 million and its 7% annual jump in sales to $1.74 billion didn't wow the Street. But thanks in part to Check Point's focus on developing less costly, recurring revenue via its subscription sales -- which climbed 22% last year to $390 million -- annual profit soared 12% to $4.18 per share. Excluding one-time items, 2016 earnings were up 13% to $4.72 per share.Check Point may lack the pizazz of some of its competitors, but for investors who appreciate steady growth on both the top and bottom lines and the relative stability that comes along with that business model, it still tops the list of winning stocks that may have slipped under the radar. (  ): Exact Sciences' investors scrambled for the exits in October 2015 when a key task force failed to recommend the company's novel colon cancer screening test. Since then, final guidelines did include Cologuard after all, causing test volume to soar and Exact Sciences shares to triple.Colon cancer is the second most deadly form of cancer, but if it's caught early, it can be successfully treated. The problem is that too few people follow through with colon cancer screening. According to the American Cancer Society, just 58% of the millions of people between 50 and 75 who should get screened end up doing so.Cologuard may be changing that statistic. Although a colonoscopy remains the gold standard, many people avoid it because of its cost and invasive nature. Cologuard is far cheaper than a colonoscopy, and it only requires patients to send a stool sample to a lab for evaluation. Those advantages appear to be resonating with patients. Last year, Exact Sciences completed 244,000 tests and reported nearly $100 million in sales. That's a big step up from 2015 when it completed only 104,000 tests and reported just $39.4 million in sales.Undeniably, Cologuard's growth is impressive, and the company may only be scratching the surface of this $4 billion market, but it could be a bit before Exact Sciences grows into its current valuation. After all, the company lost $169 million last year, and that suggests losses are on tap this year, too. Yet based on this stock's performance last year, losses this year might not matter.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

an Palo Alto Networks () win back investors’ trust? That’s the company’s main objective when the cyber security and anti-hacking specialist reports second quarter fiscal 2017 earnings results after the closing bell Tuesday.Once a Wall Street darling, the company has suffered growing pains over the past couple of years, thanks to increased competition from the likes of Cisco () and Fortinet (), whose products have enhanced their offerings due to R&D and — in some cases — acquisitions. These moves have pressured Palo Alto’s best-of-breed status. The California-based company has posted only in-line results in two of its previous three reporting periods, while revenue growth has decelerated for almost 60% to 34% last quarter.Palo Alto stock closed Monday at $153.95, up 0.61%. The stock has rebounded strongly since reaching a 52-week low of $114.64. But with better-than-expected results recently released from security software peers Check Point (), Palo Alto has more to worry about than just the aforementioned Cisco and Fortinet. Investors now want to know if the stock's hot streak can continue or if taking profits would be the better move.For the three months that ended January, Wall Street expects Palo Alto to deliver adjusted earnings per share of 62 cents, which would rise 44% year over year, while revenue of $429.6 million would risen 28% year over year. For the full year that ends July, earnings are projected to rise 66% year over year to $2.78 per share, while revenue of $1.8 billion would rise 30.70%.Despite the strong 28% projected revenue growth for the quarter, this would mark another growth deceleration of six percentage points from the third quarter. And this is why investors have gotten gun-shy. The stock was punished in November after the company’s billings, which refers to sales that had not closed, missed expectations.Billings is a closely-watched metric that underscores the strength of future business. Notably, the billings miss arrived even as the rate at which cyber threats continue to climb. To the extent Palo Alto’s weak first-quarter billings manifest into higher revenue and billings in the second quarter, these shares may yet be a bargain. But it makes more sense to not only wait for the actual results to be announced, but also hear what Palo Alto forecasts in terms of corporate security spending in 2017.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Palo Alto Networks (PANW) Earnings on Tap: What to Expect?@2017-02-28@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/palo-alto-networks-panw-earnings-tap-what-expect-2017-02-28
ontinuing with its dismal performance,  again reported lower-than-expected second-quarter of fiscal 2017 results.Palo Alto Networks reported adjusted loss per share (excluding amortization and other one-time items but including stock-based compensation), on a proportionate tax basis, of 58 cents. The figure was significantly wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 38 cents.The stock has gone down roughly 15.6%, underperforming the Zacks categorized  industry's gain of 17.4% in the past one year.Though Palo Alto Networks' revenues of $422.6 million surged 26.3% year over year, it missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $430 million. Moreover, the quarterly revenues came below the guided range of $426 million to $432 million, primarily due to weak go-to-market execution.Product revenues decreased a marginal 0.6% to $168.8 million. The company saw a 54% surge in subscription and support revenues ($253.8 million). SaaS-based subscription revenues climbed 59% from the year-ago period. Support revenues increased 48% year over year.Geographically, on a year-over-year basis, revenues from the Americas increased 28% and represented 69% of total revenue. Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) went up 27%, accounting for 19% of total revenue. Asia-Pacific was up 14% and brought in the balance.Also, customer wins coupled with expansion of the existing customer base supported quarterly revenues. Moreover, billings jumped 22% year over year to $561.6 million during the quarter.Palo Alto Networks' gross margin increased 130 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 71.9%, primarily backed by growth in both recurring subscription and support gross margins.The company reported an adjusted operating loss of $42 million, which widened from a loss of $40 million suffered a year ago. GAAP operating loss during the quarter came in at $54.4 million compared with a loss of $50.1 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Higher operating expenses (up approximately 25% year over year) also impacted operating results.The company's non-GAAP net loss was $59.6 million, wider than a loss of $39.5 million reported last year. On a GAAP basis, net loss was $60.6 million compared with a loss of $57.3 million reported in the year-ago quarter.Palo Alto Networks exited the second quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $1.354 billion compared with $1.390 billion in the previous quarter.Receivables were $386.1 million compared with $346.5 million in the last quarter. Palo Alto Networks' balance sheet does not have any long-term debt. The company reported cash flow from operations of $214.3 million during the quarter. Free cash flow came in at $169.6 million during the quarter. During the quarter, the company repurchased 900k shares worth $132 million.For the third quarter of fiscal 2017, Palo Alto Networks expects revenues in a range of $406 million to $416 million, up 17% to 20% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $453 million. The company expects non-GAAP earnings per share within 54 cents to 56 cents (excluding stock-based compensation expenses but including the impact of LightCyberacquisition).The company continues to expect fiscal 2017 non-GAAP earnings per share in a range of $2.45 to $2.50.Palo Alto Networks recently announced the buyout of LightCyber for $105 million. The acquisition will expand the company's Next-Generation Security Platform. We believe that this acquisition will not only increase its capabilities but the customer base as well.Palo Alto Networks allows firms, service providers and government bodies to impose tighter security measures through its network security platform. The company reported wider-than-expected loss in the second quarter. Revenues also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company also provided a tepid revenue guidance for the forthcoming quarter.Nonetheless, revenue growth seems to be steady, aided by strength across all its geographical regions and business segments. Also, customer wins coupled with expansion of the existing customer base are the other positives.

 posted a third consecutive earnings beat in its fourth-quarter 2016 results, as its adjusted earnings (including share-based compensation expense) of 6 cents per share for the quarter came above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 4 cents.However, non-GAAP earnings came in at 15 cents per share, down 21% from the prior-year tally of 19 cents per share. Top-line decline, driven by poor sales of professional printers and on-demand services, put pressure on the bottom line.Shares fell 4.4% at one point in late trading in the aftermath of the results, as investors were disappointed with the company's negative year-over-year earnings and revenue growth.On a GAAP basis, the company posted earnings of 5 cents per share, much better than the loss of 5.3 cents reported in the year-ago quarter. Despite soft revenue growth, lower operating expenses boosted the bottom line.For full-year 2016, 3D Systems generated non-GAAP earnings of 46 cents per share, which reflected impressive growth of 70.4% over the prior year.The 3D printer maker reported revenues of $165.9 million for the quarter, reflecting a year-over-year decrease of 9.5%. Steady demand for the company's software and healthcare solutions, along with strong industrial sales, could not offset the impact of weak sales of professional printers and on-demand services. Revenues also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $176.1 million by a small margin.For full-year 2016, 3D Systems generated revenues of $633 million, down 5% from the prior-year tally of $666.2 million.Coming back to the quarter, adjusted gross margin expanded 230 basis points on a year-over-year basis to 50%, aided by the company's shift from consumer products to materials, software and healthcare solutions, which carry higher margins.Also, the company's operating expenses descended meaningfully (down 11.4%) to $78.8 million, as SG&A (down 13.2%) expenses fell significantly,driven by the company's successful productivity improvement efforts. R&D expense (down 5.9%) also decreased year over year.Despite challenging market conditions, 3D Systems continues to focus on expanding its market share and exploring diverse market opportunities. The company has been driving improvements in its key processes, infrastructure and operations.3D Systems recently forged an important partnership with PTC. This alliance will see the two leaders joining forces to integrate 3D Systems' 3D Sprint SDK into PTC's flagship - Creo CAD platform. This, in turn, will deliver seamless CAD-to-print functionality to Creo users, in addition to an entire set of print management tools.During the quarter, 3D Systems rolled out 3D Sprint 2.0, a productivity-enhancing print management and print optimization software, developed for 3D Systems' plastic 3D printers. In addition, the company undertook operational restructuring initiatives, like improving the sales network as well as undertaking lean manufacturing initiatives, in supply-chain operations.However, the company's revenues from 3D printing products and services continue to be seriously undermined due to prolonged challenging market conditions that are hampering customers' capital investment cycles and hurting demand across all geographies as well.3D Systems is committed to channelizing its resources toward more profitable markets. The company recently announced its decision to cease the production of Cube, the entry-level consumer 3D printer. Although it might hurt revenues in the short term, we believe that it will direct the company's resources toward higher-margin products, and accelerate next-generation capabilities and thus enhance profitability over the long run.3D Systems ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $184.9 million, up significantly from the tally of $155.6 million a year back. For full-year 2016, cash generated from operating activities came in at $56.9 million, as against cash used in operating activities of $3.1 million in the comparable period last year. | Concurrent with the earnings release, the company provided its guidance for full-year 2017. 3D Systems estimates revenues in the range of $643-$684 million, which would reflect year-over-year growth of 2-8% in 2017. In addition, GAAP earnings per share are projected in the range of 2-6 cents per share, while non-GAAP earnings are expected to come between 51-55 cents per share.Over the past few quarters, 3D Systems has been experiencing unfavorable broader market conditions that have badly hit its financial performance. The company has been grappling with strong volatility in macroeconomic factors, such as economic slowdown, inflation, currency fluctuations, commodity prices and credit availability. These conditions continue to affect the company's performance.However, the company is taking initiatives to channelize its resources into more lucrative areas in professional and industrial markets. 3D Systems also conducted numerous successful product launches and strategic deals, which could aid the company in combating these persistent challenges in the near future.Also, 3D Systems' healthcare business continues to gain traction, driven by rising demand from customers who print medical and dental devices. The company is also focusing on enhancing its existing 3D printers' line, reinforcing partnerships and boosting productivity.3D Systems presently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the sector include Check Point Software Technologies Ltd.  , Dassault Systemes SA  and Aspen Technology, Inc.  . Check Point Software and Dassault sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while Aspen Technology carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).You can see Check Point Software is a leading provider of policy-based enterprise security and traffic management solutions.

Shares have added about 5.1% in that time frame, outperforming the market.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a pullback?

For the fourth quarter of 2016, the company reported better-than-expected results.Check Point's adjusted earnings per share (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets) of $1.33 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.15. Adjusted earnings also climbed approximately 21% on a year-over-year basis, driven mainly by higher revenues and a lower share count, which were partially offset by higher operating expenses.On a non-GAAP (excluding stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets) basis, the cybersecurity company posted earnings of $1.46, which were not only 21.7% higher than the year-ago quarter but way ahead of its own guidance range of $1.20 to $1.28. Moreover, it should be noted that this was the best quarterly non-GAAP EPS growth rate the company has witnessed since the third quarter of 2010.Fourth-quarter revenues came in at $486.7 million, up 6.3% year over year, and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $477 million. The figure was also close to the upper end of the company's guidance range of $460 million to $490 million (mid-point $475 million).Top-line growth was aided by sales growth of 9.7% in Products & Software Blades and 1.6% in Software Updates and Maintenance. The company also reported a 25.5% surge in subscription revenues at Software Blades.Check Point witnessed higher demand for data center and high-end appliances. Another factor contributing to overall growth was the increased number of large deal signings. The number of new customers who signed deals worth $1 million or more was 99, a 15% increase from the year-ago quarter's tally of 86. Moreover, customers who signed deals worth $50,000 and more contributed 76% to the total order value, up from 72% registered in the fourth quarter of 2015.Geographically, the Americas contributed 47% to revenues and Europe accounted for 38%, while Asia-Pacific, Japan, and the Middle East and Africa added the remaining 15%.On a year-over-year basis, adjusted gross profit (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets) increased 6.1% to $428.5 million.

The increase may also be attributed to higher research and development, and selling and marketing expenses as well as to acquisitions made over the past year. As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses increased 250 basis points (bps).Adjusted operating income (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets) came in at $244.7 million, up nearly 1% year over year.

During 2016, the company generated operating cash flow of $923 million. Moreover, Check Point repurchased $988 million worth of common stock in 2016.Taking into account the back-to-back quarters of favorable business trends, Check Point provided a strong revenue and earnings guidance for the first quarter and full year 2017.The company expects to generate revenues between $420 million and $440 million (mid-point $430 million).

"nvestors in Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd. (Symbol: CHKP) saw new options become available this week, for the October 20th expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 240 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CHKP options chain for the new October 20th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $100.00 strike price has a current bid of $6.30. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $100.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $93.70 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CHKP, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $100.92/share today.Because the $100.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 56%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of CHKP stock at the current price level of $100.92/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $105.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 9.49% if the stock gets called away at the October 20th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CHKP shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd. , as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing CHKP's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $105.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $105.00 strike represents an approximate 4% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 54%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).

igital home entertainment services and solutions provider,  reported decent fourth-quarter 2016 results, wherein its revenues improved year over year but earnings declined.The company reported earnings of 8 cents per share from continuing operations compared with 32 cents posted in the year-ago quarter as the benefit from revenue growth was more than offset by higher cost and expenses, increased income tax expenses and higher number of shares outstanding.It should be noted that TiVo Corporation was formerly known as Rovi Corporation. Upon successfully completing the acquisition of TiVo Inc. in early Sep 2016, Rovi adopted the iconic TiVo brand name. | Hence, it is the second quarterly results of the combined company. Let's discuss the quarter in detail -TiVo's revenues surged 68.7% year over year to $252.3 million mainly due to the inclusion of the first full quarter of TiVo Inc.'s business and revenues from Samsung's licensing agreement.The company's revenues from Licensing, services and software division increased 59.9% year over year to $238.5 million, contributing 95% to total revenue. Hardware division's revenues grew over thirty-seven times to $13.9 million and contributed 5% to total revenue.In terms of sales verticals, Service Provider revenues surged 43.6% year over year to $104 million and Consumer Electronics sales were $36.3 million, marking over two-fold year-over-year jump. Platform Solutions revenues increased about 2.5 times year over year to $86 million and Software and Services sales grew 10%. On the contrary, Other vertical's revenues declined 38% to $2 million.In terms of business segments, IP Licensing revenues grew 56.7% year over year to $140.4 million and contributed 56% to total revenue. Product revenues increased 86.7% to $112 million, contributing 44% to total revenue.The company's total cost of goods sold and expenses increased more than doubled year over year to $232.4 million from $114.4 million in the year-ago quarter. Moreover, as a percentage of total revenue, it expanded 15.6% to 92.1%, mainly due to inclusion of various one-time expenses related to the merger.TiVo's net income from continuing operations declined 62.4% year over year to $9.9 million, mainly due to higher cost and expenses along with increased income tax expenses.TiVo exited the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $309.7 million compared with $503.8 million at the end of previous quarter.Upon successful completion of the acquisition of TiVo Inc., the new company anticipates to generate revenues in a range of $800 million to $835 million (mid-point $817.5 million) in 2017. However, at the mid-point, it marginally fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $820.81 million.It further projects GAAP loss before taxes of $55 million to $70 million and non-GAAP pre-tax Income of $200 million to $225 million.We are encouraged by the company's robust top-line growth, which was mainly driven by the inclusion of the recently merged TiVo Inc.'s business and licensing agreement with Samsung. Although TiVo's bottom line declined year over year, it should be kept in mind that this was mainly due to one-time expenses associated with the merger.Investors also reacted positively to TiVo's fourth-quarter performance sending its shares as high as $22.50, before settling down at $21.70 in the after-hour trading session. Notably, the stock rose 13.6% in the extended trading session.We believe that the stock will see a significant upside once the market opens today. It should be noted that TiVo has underperformed the Zacks categorized  industry in the last three months. While the industry gained 6.7% in the said period, the stock lost 8.2% of its value.Prior to the acquisition, Rovi provided a set of solutions that allowed businesses to protect, enable and distribute digital goods to consumers, helping them discover and manage digital media across multiple channels. On the other hand, TiVo Inc. pioneered a brand new category of products by developing the first commercially available digital video recorder. However, over the years, the company expanded its capabilities beyond hardware sales and patent licensing to online subscription services.The merger has brought together two leading players in the media entertainment industry with complementary products and services as well as a number of patented technologies. The new TiVo Corporation is the global leader in entertainment technology and audience insights. The company has a diverse product portfolio that ranges from interactive program guide to DVR.

"ybersecurity firm  recently completed the acquisition of Arizona-based LifeLock Inc. in less than three months from signing the deal. The two companies had entered into a definitive agreement last November, under which Symantec agreed to pay $2.3 billion in cash to make this buyout.Founded in 2005 by Robert J. Maynard and Todd Davis, LifeLock offers identity theft protection services primarily in the United States. The company got itself listed in 2012 and currently has over 4.4 million customers. In June, Elliott Management Corp. unveiled that it owns an 11% stake in the company.The company, under its consumer segment, protects subscribers through monitoring identity-related events, such as new account openings and credit-related applications. Under the enterprise segment, it protects customers by delivering on-demand identity risk and authentication information about consumers.Its customers include financial institutions, telecommunication and cable services providers, government agencies, technology companies, large retailers, automobile and mortgage lenders, and e-commerce providers.In our opinion, the acquisition will be a strategic fit for Symantec, which is trying hard to expand its business in the high growth area of next-generation cybersecurity. The acquisition will help Symantec enhance its capabilities in identity protection, which is currently a huge concern for almost every sector, be it financials, retail or technology.Per Symantec, over 650 million people worldwide, including one-third of American citizens, were victims of cybercrime last year. The company also revealed that the digital safety market is anticipated to be approximately $10 billion while in the United States alone the total addressable market is projected to include 80 million people.Therefore, we believe that the acquisition will enhance Symantec's capabilities in identifying theft protection solutions, thereby enabling it to capitalize on the growing opportunities in the space.Apart from this, the acquisition will broaden Symantec's customer base. The company has an existing customer base of over 65 million. Therefore, we believe that the buyout will not only enhance the value of Symantec's identity management platform but will also be accretive to its top- and bottom-line results. Symantec expects the acquisition to be accretive to its non-GAAP earnings per share in fiscal 2019.Per the company press release, ""Symantec's acquisition of LifeLock brings together the #1 leader in consumer security with a leading provider of identity protection and remediation services. The combination will create the world's largest consumer security business with over $2.3 billion in annual revenue based on last fiscal year revenues for both companies.""Of late, Symantec's top and bottom lines have been under pressure due to persistent weakness in PC sales and loss of market share in the data storage segment. Additionally, intensifying competition from Palo-Alto Networks and FireEye has been eroding its market share in the enterprise segment.As a result, the company has been aggressively restructuring its business. In doing so, on Jan 29, 2016, the company closed the sale of its Veritas business for $7.4 billion to Carlyle Group. We believe that the deal has provided Symantec with much-needed funds to invest in fast-growing markets.The sale of the Veritas business provided Symantec with the financial flexibility to take the acquisition route to transform its struggling business. In August, the company completed the acquisition of Blue Coat, a leading web security solution provider, from private equity firm Bain Capital for a total cash consideration of $4.65 billion. Blue Coat's security solutions allow organizations to protect their web gateways from cyber attacks.We believe that these acquisitions will enable Symantec to strengthen its position in the enterprise security market.It should be noted that the company's restructuring initiatives have been appreciated by investors as reflected from its share price appreciation over the last one year period. During the said period, the stock has returned 52.7% compared with the Zacks categorized  industry's gain of 29.1%.However, it carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). This is probably due to its recently provided revenue outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, which fell short of our estimates. This undermines the company's growth potential. Although the company's restructuring initiatives appear to be in the right direction, we are cautious about the payback period.Some better-ranked stocks in the Computer-Software space are Check Point Software  , Imperva  and Intuit Inc.  . Of these, Check Point Software sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) while Imperva and Intuit carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).You can see  .Check Point Software has an estimated long-term EPS growth rate of 10% and has witnessed upward estimate revision for first-quarter and full year 2017 over the last 30 days.Imperva has an expected long-term EPS growth rate of 21.7% and has witnessed upward estimate revision for first and second quarters of 2017 over the last seven days.Intuit has an expected long-term EPS growth rate of 15.1% and has witnessed upward estimate revision for second and third quarters of fiscal 2017 over the last seven days.Today, you are invited to download the full list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 """"Strong Buy"""" stocks - absolutely free of charge.

 reported earnings (including stock-based compensation) of 12 cents per share in fourth-quarter 2016, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 17 cents. Earnings (excluding stock-based compensation) plunged almost 46% to 20 cents in the reported quarter.Revenues declined 2% from the year-ago quarter to $200.3 million. Unfavorable foreign currency affected revenues by 4% ($30 million).Following the results, shares increased 8.4% to close at $43.25 on Feb 24. The upside apparently reflected positive full-year 2017 guidance based on improving revenue visibility driven by a transition to recurring revenue mix as compared with perpetual licenses. Further, this is positive for the company's cash flow going ahead. | However, the transition to recurring revenue-based business model is expected to keep revenue growth under pressure in the near term. Moreover, unfavorable foreign exchange remains a concern. We believe that the 1.1% decline in share prices in the next trading session (Feb 27) displayed these headwinds.In fiscal 2016, earnings declined almost 5% to 77 cents per share on revenues of $750.3 million, which climbed roughly 10.2%. Total recurring revenue increased 16% from the year-ago quarter to $222.3 million. Total license and cloud backlog surged 26% year over year to $528 million.We note that Pegasystems has outperformed the Zacks  market in the last one year. While the stock gained almost 76%, the industry witnessed an advance of roughly 27%.Long term growth for Check Point is currently pegged at 10%.Software License revenues fell 24.2% from the year-ago quarter to $72.2 million. Maintenance revenues increased 10.1% to $57.8 million, while services surged almost 24% to $70.3 million. License & cloud bookings improved 32% from the year-ago quarter.Pegasystems solutions continue to be selected by the likes of Ford, Edison International, Sun Life and Nestle. The company has also expanded offerings to company's like PayPal  , Sprint, Standard Chartered Bank, Deutsche Bank and Express Scripts  .The company signed three customers with license and cloud commitment of greater than $10 million (Whales referred by the company) in the fourth quarter.Management stated that clients are opting more for term license arrangements as well as the Pega Cloud, which is the company's Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) offering.Gross margin contracted 500 basis points (bps) to 69.6% in the reported quarter.Operating expenses as percentage of revenues surged 640 bps to 61.8%, driven by higher selling & marketing (S&M), research & development (R&D) and general & administrative (G&A) expenses, which increased 330 bps, 280 bps and 70 bps, respectively.Operating margin was 7.9% as compared with 19.3% in the year-ago quarter. Unfavorable foreign currency headwinds and mix shift towards recurring revenues impacted margins by 4% (almost $35 million).Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $133.8 million as of Dec 31, 2016. Cash flow from operating activities was $19 million in the fourth quarter.In 2016, Pegasystems repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares for $27 million.For full-year 2017, revenues are projected to be approximately $860 million, up 15% over full-year 2016. Non-GAAP earnings are expected to be approximately $1.00 per share.Management expects consulting services business to grow at a high-single to low-double digit rate in the future.Currently, Pegasystems carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

"Image source: Getty.The good news for shareholders of  (NYSE: PANW) is that the stock has rebounded following a dismal 2016, jumping 16% in January. The not-so-good news is that wild stock price fluctuations are par for the course with Palo Alto. Now, after nearly two years of growing revenue more than 50%, Palo Alto is seeing its sales growth -- like that of many of its peers -- slowly coming back down to earth.Without the sky-high revenue, investors and some pundits are taking a closer look at the rest of Palo Alto's financials, and what they see doesn't paint a pretty picture. However, there are data-security providers that offer exposure to a market expected to soar in the coming years and are financially sound, offer industry diversification, and carry less volatility than Palo Alto. Two that come to mind as better buys -- though for different reasons -- are  (NASDAQ: CSCO) and  (NASDAQ: CHKP) .Image source: Cisco.Data security sales are fairly low on the list of revenue drivers for Cisco today, but that's changing with each successive quarter. Of its primary units, security was handily Cisco's fastest-growing business last quarter, and don't be surprised to see more of the same when it announces fiscal 2017 second-quarter results on Feb. 15.Cisco's security sales accounted for $540 million of its $12.4 billion in total revenue last quarter, and that's already more than Palo Alto and Check Point. Security grew 11% compared with a year ago, and with Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins' strategy of shifting to burgeoning markets, including cloud data centers and the Internet of Things, data security will become increasingly important.That's one of the upsides to Cisco in the security space. Because Cisco is also leading the charge in other fast-growing opportunities, it isn't overly reliant on one market. The introduction of Cisco's new ""Digital Building Switch"" that delivers ""smart"" functionality to buildings is one recent example of its diverse offerings. And with a 3.4% dividend yield, Cisco is a much better buy than Palo Alto for growth and income investors.Image source: Check Point Software.When Check Point shared its fourth-quarter results on Jan. 19, its stock jumped about 7% and has maintained those gains since. That may come as a surprise, given that its revenue climbed only 6%. Palo Alto disappointed last quarter, reporting a 34% sales improvement. Why the different response? The answer to that question is why Check Point is a better buy, particularly for investors who prefer relative stability.Though Check Point's revenue grew 6%, its earnings per share (EPS) climbed 21% including one-time items. Palo Alto's EPS, despite its 34% increase in sales to $398.1 million, was a loss of $0.69 a share, 47% worse than a year ago. Check Point's 26% increase in its low overhead, recurring subscription revenue of $110 million, and CEO Gil Shwed's cost-management efforts translate to a strong bottom line.Check Point was able to report such stellar EPS results because its total expenses -- both cost of revenue and operating expenses -- equaled 50% of its $486.7 million in revenue. Palo Alto spent $50 million more than its total revenue in the quarter, which is why EPS continues to decline along with its sales growth.Analysts aren't quite as enamored with Palo Alto as they were a few months ago, though the consensus price target is still $176.67, equal to nearly 20% appreciation in the near term. One pundit suggests Palo Alto shares will climb as high as $210.Neither Cisco nor Check Point has earned analysts' good tidings, at least to the extent Palo Alto has. That said, Cisco's market diversification, its fast-growing security sales, and an industry-leading dividend make it a hands-down better buy. And for a pure-play data-security alternative, Check Point offers a few things Palo Alto doesn't: increasing profits; a focus on consistent, sustainable growth; and relative stock price stability.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"olding individual stocks can be exciting and financially rewarding. But finding the best stocks is easier said than done, and all too many promising stocks come with increased volatility and risk.So we asked three top Motley Fool contributors to each pick a safe stock they believe investors would be wise to buy right now. Read on to see why they chose  (NYSE: MA) ,  (NASDAQ: CHKP) , and  (NYSE: GM) .Image source: Getty Images. (  )  Mastercard released a decidedly  late last month. But that should be music to conservative investors' ears. Revenue grew 9.5% year over year, to $2.76 billion, technically falling just short of the 11% growth Wall Street was anticipating. Gross dollar volume also rose 9% at constant currency, excluding EU regulatory changes, while net income climbed a more modest 5%, excluding special items. But thanks to a combination of share repurchases and effective cost management -- operating expenses declined 1% year over year -- Mastercard still managed to grow earnings per share 9%, to $0.86, a penny per share above expectations.But more pertinent to this discussion is that Mastercard's results were aided by improving economic activity across most of its geographic markets. During this quarter's conference call with investors, management highlighted that post-election optimism in the U.S. remains relatively high, with consumer confidence, unemployment, and wages appearing to hold steady. And according to Mastercard CEO Ajay Banga, the ongoing economic recovery in Europe has proved ""persistent"" over the past year, led by Germany and -- perhaps counterintuitively -- supplemented by stronger growth in travel to the UK given the weaker pound following last year's Brexit vote.On the other hand, consumer and business confidence in Australia is weak, and Brazil is only just crawling out of a deep recession that should help spur Mastercard's business there. The company is also taking a cautious view of Asia, given a prolonged slowdown in China. But it sees potential for government economic policies in India to help modernize the cash-reliant country's payment systems over the longer term.To that end, Banga also reminded investors that in the retail business alone, 85% of the world's retail payments are still in cash and check. That's not to mention Mastercard's emphasis on increasing its share in commercial payments, and its faster-growing services business -- which includes safety and security, consulting, information services, data analytics, and loyalty and rewards programs -- leaving the company with a long runway for growth over the next decade.Add to that its modest dividend yielding around 0.8% annually as of this writing, and I think Mastercard represents a compelling portfolio candidate for investors looking for an attractive combination of growth potential and relative stability. (  )  With its stock up 12% since it announced fourth-quarter and 2016 earnings on Jan. 19, Check Point may not seem like an ideal choice for a list of safe stocks to buy now. However, the reasons Check Point has finally caught investors' eyes is why it warrants inclusion.Last quarter was indicative of what to expect from Check Point. Unlike many of its peers, Check Point doesn't spend indiscriminately, and shareholders benefit with continued growth on its bottom line. Last quarter, the company reported revenue of $487 million, a 6% year-over-year increase. However, earnings per share (EPS) rose 21% to $1.31, including one-time items. Check Point's EPS excluding one-time expenses also climbed 21% to $1.46.CEO Gil Shwed's steady-as-she-goes business model also includes delivering on Check Point's annual recurring revenue (ARR) initiative via its software subscriptions. Last quarter, subscription-driven ARR sales climbed a whopping 26% to $110 million. For the 2016 fiscal year, ARR jumped 22% to $390 million of Check Point's $1.74 billion in total revenue, and that trend shows no signs of slowing.There are a couple of reasons that Check Point's focus on recurring revenue, particularly when combined with its stringent cost-management efforts, makes it ideal as a safe stock pick. First, it simply costs less to service existing, subscription-paying customers than to rely on new sales. Second, the relatively stable, and still growing, revenue translates to a reliable foundation investors can count on. That certainly beats the wild swings some of Check Point's peers deal with, and is why it's a safe stock to buy now. (  )  The auto industry has done extremely well in recent years, posting record sales results in 2015 and 2016. General Motors has taken full advantage of the industry's success, having emerged from bankruptcy following the financial crisis to rebuild its automotive empire.General Motors has several favorable conditions right now that give it a margin of safety. First, the company trades at a ridiculously low valuation of just four times trailing earnings, reflecting the expectation that a cyclical downturn in the automotive industry will inevitably send its bottom line lower. Yet even if profits come in at the company's 2017 forecast of $6 to $6.50 per share, General Motors would still sport an extremely favorable valuation compared to most stocks in the market. Moreover, GM's dividend yield of more than 4% gives investors added incentive to hold on to the stock.Some have also noted the potential political risk involved with General Motors, given that it manufactures vehicles not only in the U.S. but also around the world. Yet so far, the Trump administration has had open dialogue with automakers such as GM, and CEO Mary Barra seems optimistic that a favorable solution can be reached. With good long-term prospects, General Motors looks like a good bargain right now.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

imilar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is  , which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) further confirms weakness in CTXS.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen 3 estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with no upward revisions. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from $4.45 a share a month ago to its current level of $3.78.Also, for the current quarter, CTXS has seen 3 downward estimate revisions versus no revisions in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to 75 cents a share from $1.06 over the past 30 days.The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 15% in the past month. | So it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore, at least if you don't have a long time horizon to wait.If you are still interested in the Computer - Softwareindustry, you may instead consider a better-ranked stock - Check Point Software Technologies Ltd.  .

" ended 2016 on a strong note with better-than-expected results for the fourth quarter of 2017. The company's top- and bottom-line results also reflected year-over-year growth.The network security solution provider's adjusted earnings per share (excluding one-time items but including stock-based compensation) came in at 18 cents, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 8 cents. Moreover, on a year-over-year basis, the company's adjusted earnings jumped six folds driven mainly by strong top-line growth and better cost management.Fortinet reported fourth-quarter revenues of $362.8 million, up 22.4% year over year, and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $352 million. Segment-wise, Product revenues increased 9.8% year over year to $158.9 million, while Services revenues surged 34.4% to $203.9 million.The year-over-year improvement was primarily aided by seasonal demand, improvements in sales productivity and success in selling multiple product deployments. A large number of deal wins and customer additions during the quarter also contributed to top-line growth.During the quarter, Fortinet added over 10,000 customers, bringing the total count to over 300,000.The company witnessed 27% year-over-year growth in the number of deals worth over $100,000, while the number of deals worth over $250,000 and $500,000 increased 24% and 31%, respectively.Billings were up 22% on a year-over-year basis to $463.4 million.Gross profit increased 26.7% from the year-ago quarter to $271.9 million. Moreover, gross margin expanded 250 basis points (bps) to 74.9%, primarily backed by sales of higher-value subscription bundles.Furthermore, the company has efficiently managed its operating expenses this quarter. As a percentage of revenues, adjusted operating expenses (excluding one-time items but including stock-based compensation) contracted 440 bps year over year to 61.4%. In dollar terms, however, it increased 14.3% to $222.9 million.Adjusted operating profit jumped two and half folds to $49 million from $19.5 million in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted operating profit margin expanded 660 bps to 13.5% mainly due to improved gross margin and efficient cost management.Adjusted net income jumped over six folds year over year to $31.8 million from the year-ago quarter level of $5.3 million. | Fortinet exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments of approximately $1.09 billion, up from $1.03 billion at the end of the previous quarter. Accounts receivable were $313 million, compared with $239 million at the end of the third quarter.During the quarter, the company generated operating cash flow of $101 million. Free cash flow for the quarter came in at $84.2 million. In 2016, the company generated operating cash flow of $345.7 million and free cash flow of $278.5 million.During the fourth quarter, Fortinet repurchased shares worth $35.8 million, while in the full year, total share buyback under its current authorization was $110.8 million.Buoyed by a better-than-expected fourth-quarter performance, Fortinet provided a strong outlook for the first quarter 2017 and the full year.For the first quarter, management expects revenues in the range of $330-$335 million (mid point: $332.5 million) and non-GAAP earnings per share of 15-16 cents (mid point: 15.5 cents). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues and earnings is pegged at $332.08 million and 2 cents, respectively. Billings are expected in the range of $380 million to $388 million. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be 74-75%, whereas non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be between 11% and 12%.For 2017, management expects revenues in the range of $1.470-$1.480 billion (mid point: $1.475 billion) and non-GAAP earnings per share of 87-89 cents (mid point: 88 cents). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues and earnings is pegged at $1.47 billion and 29 cents, respectively. Billings are expected in the range of $1.750 billion to $1.770 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin is projected to be 74-75%, whereas non-GAAP operating margin is anticipated to improve to 16%.Fortinet's network security solutions include firewall, VPN, application control, antivirus, intrusion prevention, web filtering, anti-spam and WAN acceleration. The company reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter results. Despite persistent macro uncertainties, management seems to be positive on the back of a healthy network security market, solid product line-up and investment plans.Furthermore, the company provided an encouraging outlook for the first quarter of 2017and the full year.We believe that the industry has huge growth potential. Note that the financial well-being, brand image and reputation of enterprises and governments are always exposed to the risk of cyber threats. Consequently, cybersecurity has become a mission-critical, high-profile requirement.With rapid technological advancement, organizations are increasingly adopting the ""bring your own device"" (BYOD) policy to enhance employee productivity with anytime/anywhere access. This trend, in turn, calls for stricter data security measures.Moreover, various independent research firms forecast strong demand ahead. According to a Markets and Markets report, worldwide cyber security spending will reach $101 billion in 2018 and $170 billion by 2020.Therefore, with its sustained focus on product innovations and strategic acquisitions, we believe that Fortinet is well positioned to capitalize on the huge opportunity available in the space.However, competition from key network security players such as Cisco Systems Inc.  , Check Point  , Juniper Networks  and Palo Alto Networks, remains a concern.Currently, Fortinet has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@iShares MSCI EAFE ETF Experiences Big Inflow@2017-02-10@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ishares-msci-eafe-etf-experiences-big-inflow-2017-02-10

hares of  went down more than 5% yesterday, after the company reported unimpressive results for the fourth quarter of 2016 and provided a not-so-encouraging guidance for the first quarter.Arrow's adjusted earnings of $2.00 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.01. However, earnings increased from $1.95 per share reported in the year-ago quarter. On a GAAP basis, earnings were $1.81 compared with $1.69 reported a year ago.Arrow's revenues, on a reported basis, were $6.443 billion, down 4.6% from the year-ago quarter. Quarterly revenues also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.518 billion.On a reported basis, revenues from Global components increased 8.9% to $3.99 billion. On an adjusted basis (excluding the impact of changes in foreign currencies and acquisitions), the figure grew 9.6%. Geographically, revenues from America and Asia-Pacific increased 4% and 22.4%, respectively. Sales from Europe went down approximately 1% on a year-over-year basis.Revenues at Global Enterprise Computing Solutions (ECS) came in at $2.45 billion, down 20.6% on a year-over-year basis. On an adjusted basis, revenues decreased 20.5%, primarily due to the impact of acquisition and foreign currency fluctuations. Revenues from the Americas were down 19.7% year over year, whereas revenues from Europe decreased 22.4%.Gross margin increased 40 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis and came in at 12.8%. Also, Arrow reported adjusted operating margin of 4.4%, down 20 bps, and operating income of $280.9 million in dollar terms, down 1%.The company's adjusted net income (excluding the effect of restructuring, gain on sale of investment and amortization) was $188.7 million or $2.00 per share, compared with $182.1 million or $1.94 per share last year.Arrow exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $534.3 million, compared with $384.4 million at the end of the previous quarter.

Also, revenues decreased year over year. The company issued a not-so-encouraging first-quarter 2017 outlook.Notably, original equipment manufacturers, contract manufacturers and commercial customers are selecting Arrow's distribution channels for marketing their products. The company's core strength in providing best-in-class services and easy-to-acquire technologies should drive growth further.Meanwhile, incremental sales from strategic acquisitions, such as Computerlinks, are expected to boost the top line, going forward. However, uncertain economic conditions, a high debt burden and competition from the likes of Avnet  remain concerns.Currently, Arrow has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Better-ranked stocks in the technology sector include Seagate Technology plc  and Check Point Software Technologies Ltd.  , both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

 is set to report fourth-quarter 2016 results on Feb 2. Last quarter, the company posted a narrower-than-expected loss. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.FireEye, headquartered in Milpitas, CA, is a global provider of web, email, file and malware security to both enterprises and governments. Lately, the company's top-line growth has been affected due to its transition to the cloud and a shift in its business model from hardware centric to subscription-based services.It should be noted that the company generates higher initial sales from hardware than subscriptions. Although a shift from product-based to subscription-based business model will lead to more stable revenues in the long run, we believe the transition will have a negative impact on FireEye's results in the fourth quarter.Furthermore, intense competition from other major and established players like Check Point Software Technologies Ltd.  and Palo Alto Networks Inc. may also negatively impact its fourth-quarter results.Nonetheless, FireEye's ongoing cost optimization initiatives, which include the closure of some facilities, headcount reductions and minimization of discretionary spending, should aid its bottom line in the fourth quarter.Our proven model does not conclusively show that FireEye is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in its upcoming release. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below. The Earnings ESP for FireEye is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at a loss of 49 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . FireEye carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. | Here are a couple of companies which, as per our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:CEVA Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +9.52% and a Zacks Rank #3.

" reported third-quarter fiscal 2017 results. The company's adjusted earnings (excluding deferred revenues fair value, amortization, restructuring and other one-time items but including stock-based compensation) of 22 cents per share came a penny ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate. On a year-over-year basis, it remained flat.Furthermore, on a non-GAAP basis, Symantec's earnings came in at 32 cents per share, which not only came ahead of its own guidance range of 27 cents to 29 cents but also marked a year-over-year increase of 23%. The year-over-year improvement in non-GAAP earnings was mainly driven by increased sales.Despite a strong bottom-line performance, shares of Symantec fell approximately 4% in yesterday's after-hour trade as the company's top-line results and fourth quarter revenue outlook fell short of analysts' expectations.Nonetheless, the stock has outperformed the Zacks categorized  industry in the year-to-date period. Symantec shares gained 11% in the said period while the industry's gain was just 5.6%.Symantec's revenues of $1.041 billion increased 14.5% year over year mainly driven by strong performance at the company's Enterprise Security segment. However, it fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.085 billion.Nonetheless, adjusted for deferred revenues fair value, revenues were $1.088 billion compared with $909 million in the year-ago quarter. Moreover, the company's non-GAAP revenues were above the mid-point of its own guidance $1.070 billion to $1.090 billion (mid-point: $1.080 billion).Segment-wise, the Consumer Security division witnessed a 4% year-over-year decline in revenues, while revenues at Enterprise Security increased 30% on a year-over-year basis. Moreover, adjusted for deferred revenues fair value, Enterprise Security revenues surged 40%.Symantec's adjusted gross profit of $917 million was up 19.7%, primarily attributable to a higher revenue base and lower cost of goods sold. Consequently, as a percentage of revenues, gross margin improved 380 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 86.9%.Furthermore, adjusted operating income increased 8.3% year over year to $234 million, as the benefits from increased revenues and lower cost of goods sold were partially offset by a 24.2% jump in adjusted operating expenses. Consequently, adjusted operating margin contracted 130 bps year over year to 22.5%.On a non-GAAP basis, operating income grew 30.3% year over year to $331 million while margin improved 250 bps to 30.4%. Moreover, non-GAAP operating margin was higher than the company's guidance range of 27% to 28%.The better-than-expected margin was mainly driven by strong top-line growth and realization of cost savings ahead of time. As per Symantec, it remains on track to realize over $200 million of cost savings in fiscal 2017 through its cost restructuring initiatives and synergies from the newly acquired business, Blue Coat.Adjusted net income for the quarter came in at $136.6 million compared with $151.6 million in the year-ago quarter. However, on per share basis, adjusted earnings per share were flat year over year at 22 cents as a lower numerator was offset by a lower denominator.Symantec exited the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $5.575 billion, compared with $5.619 billion last quarter. Long-term debt was $6.358 billion, down from $6.576 billion in the previous quarter.During the first three quarters of 2016, Symantec used operating cash flow of $573 million. Moreover, it paid $173 million as dividend during the period.Symantec did not provide any update on the fiscal 2017 guidance. It should be noted that during the second-quarter earnings release, the company had reiterated its non-GAAP revenue guidance but raised its non-GAAP operating margin and earnings per share outlook for fiscal 2017. For fiscal 2017, Symantec still expects revenues in a range of $4.040 billion to $4.120 billion (mid-point $4.08 billion). Non-GAAP operating margin is now anticipated in a range of 27% to 29% (previously 26%-28%). Non-GAAP earnings per share are now expected to be $1.12 to $1.18 (previously $1.08 to $1.14).However, it provided guidance for the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, Symantec expects GAAP and non-GAAP revenues in a range of $1.039 billion - $1.059 billion (mid-point $1.049 billion) and $1.070 billion - $1.090 billion (mid-point $1.080 billion), respectively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.11 billion.GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin is projected in a range of 1%-3% and 27%-29%, respectively. Management expects to report a breakeven to loss of 2 cents on a GAAP basis for the fourth quarter. However, on a non-GAAP basis, it expects earnings between 27 cents and 29 cents.During the third quarter of fiscal 2017, Symantec entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Arizona-based LifeLock Inc.  for $2.3 billion. The company anticipates completing the acquisition on Feb 9.In connection with this, the company yesterday announced raising $1 billion in aggregate principal amount by issuing senior unsecured notes due 2025.In our opinion, the acquisition will be a strategic fit for Symantec, which is trying hard to expand its business in the high growth area of next-generation cybersecurity. The acquisition will help Symantec enhance its capabilities in identity protection, which is currently a huge concern for almost every sector, be it financials, retail or technology.Symantec expects the LifeLock acquisition to contribute about $100 million in revenues and around $9 million of non-GAAP earnings before interest and taxes in the fourth quarter. However, the benefits will not impact its net income as these will be offset by incremental interest expenses from the debt used to fund the transaction.Symantec reported modest third-quarter results wherein its bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missed the same. However, the company exceeded its own guidance on all metrics. | According to Symantec CFO, Nick Noviello, ""Our third quarter results exceeded our constant currency revenue, operating margin, and EPS guidance. In just two quarters since combining Symantec and Blue Coat we are tracking ahead of schedule on product integrations, cost savings and synergies. We are pleased to be increasing our fiscal year 2017 financial outlook.""Investment in growth areas such as Enterprise Backup, Storage Management and Security businesses are expected to boost Symantec's long-term prospects. Moreover, restructuring initiatives and synergies from acquisitions are expected to support its bottom line.Nonetheless, we are disappointed by the company's fourth quarter revenue guidance, which fell short of our estimate. Furthermore, the company's announcement of issuing another $1 billion of senior notes to fund the acquisition of LifeLock will increase its interest expenses, thereby negatively impacting its bottom-line going forward.Moreover, smaller companies like Kaspersky are consistently launching comparable products. These, along with competition from the likes of Microsoft  , remain headwinds. The uncertainty over PC sales adds to its woes.Currently, Symantec carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A better-ranked stock in the computer software space is Check Point Software  , sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see  .The stock has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice while matching the same once in the trailing four quarters.

hareholders of  (NYSE: PANW) are being rewarded in 2017. As of Jan. 26, Palo Alto stock is up 17% this month, which isn't surprising. Relatively short run-ups, as well as significant Palo Alto share price declines, is par for the course.The reaction to last quarter's earnings explains Palo Alto's recent history. After a disappointing quarter, its share price nosedived 15% overnight. The concern is what's behind the wild share price swings and if there will be progress made when Palo Alto reports fiscal 2017 second-quarter results on Feb. 23? If not, Palo Alto will remain one of the riskier stocks in the data security sector.Image source: Palo Alto Networks Security.In some respects, Palo Alto is a victim of its own apparent success. Until 2016's third quarter, Palo Alto had reported a nearly two-year run of revenue growth of 50% or more. Both analysts and investors alike seemed more than willing to overlook Palo Alto's mounting losses because of its stellar top-line improvements.In fact, many analysts are still in Palo Alto's corner. It has a buy rating and consensus price target of $172.5, or another 18% upside. One estimate goes so far as to suggest Palo Alto stock will hit $209 a share.The problem is that like Palo Alto's peers, including  (NASDAQ: CHKP) , the pace of growth is slowing. Last quarter, Palo Alto reported a 34% jump in sales to $398.1 million. The aforementioned 15% drop in value was the result. Any guesses what will happen if Palo Alto simply meets its forecasted 27% to 29% revenue improvement this quarter to $426 million to 432 million? Exactly.With sales slowing, fairly dramatically in Palo Alto's case, prospective investors would be wise to monitor Palo Alto's spending. Slowing revenue growth hasn't slowed Palo Alto's soaring overhead, and that's becoming harder to overlook with each passing quarter. The inevitable consequence of slowing top-line gains with rampant spending is increasing losses.Combined, Palo Alto's cost of revenue and operating expenses totaled $448 million last quarter, or 113% of revenue. That compares with $329.2 million in total costs a year ago, equal to 111% of sales. A stunning $220.3 million last quarter, 38% more than a year ago, was spent on sales and marketing alone. Palo Alto's open checkbook policy is continuing even as growth is easing, which is why its level of risk is rising right along with overhead.For some perspective, Check Point Software's total costs were $245.3 million in its fourth quarter, a hair over 50% of its $486.7 million in revenue. The result was a 21% increase in earnings per share to $1.31, and $1.46 excluding one-time costs, also good for a 21% improvement. Check Point's bottom line came from just a 6% in total revenue. As for sales-related expenses, Check Point spent $116.8 million in the fourth quarter, or 24% of revenue.Palo Alto's net loss last quarter of $0.69 a share was 47% worse than a year ago. Bulls may point out that non-GAAP (excluding one-time items) per-share earnings were improved. True. However, the reason for that was the adding back in of the whopping $1.28 per share Palo Alto paid out in stock-based compensation, up from $0.86 a year ago. Some investors don't see a problem with tweaking non-GAAP earnings per share by adding back in share-based comp while others do.Considering sales easing is expected to continue, the amount of risk Palo Alto shareholders assume is directly related to its spending, which in turn is destroying its bottom line. The upcoming quarter will speak volumes about Palo Alto's future. But don't be surprised to see more of the same from Palo Alto, essentially buying revenue -- through excessive spending -- appears to be ingrained.Until Palo Alto is able to either kick-start its revenue growth -- not a likely scenario given market conditions -- or streamline its operations to invigorate earnings, it will remain the riskiest stock in its peer group.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Among the largest underlying components of EFA, in trading today Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (Symbol: TEVA) is down about 1.3%, NXP Semiconductors NV (Symbol: NXPI) is up about 1.3%, and Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd. (Symbol: CHKP) is higher by about 0.7%.  The chart below shows the one year price performance of EFA, versus its 200 day moving average:Looking at the chart above, EFA's low point in its 52 week range is $50.94 per share, with $60.33 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $59.94. Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@iShares MSCI EAFE ETF Experiences Big Inflow@2017-02-02@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ishares-msci-eafe-etf-experiences-big-inflow-2017-02-02
" ended 2016 on a strong note, reporting splendid fourth quarter results. The company's top and bottom line results not only surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate but also improved year over year.The company posted non-GAAP earnings (excluding discontinued operations and one-time items) of $1.66 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.51. DST Systems' non-GAAP earnings also registered a year-over-year increase of 18.6%, mainly driven by higher revenues, effective cost management and lower share count.Shares of DST Systems gained 2.6% yesterday. | Total revenue in the fourth quarter came in at $398.8 million, up 4.1% from the year-ago quarter. Excluding out-of-the-pocket reimbursements, consolidated operating revenues increased 3.1% year over year to $373.7 million, which was way ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $366 million.Financial Services operating revenues (excluding out-of-the-pocket reimbursements) remained almost flat year over year at $272.7 million. Benefits from businesses acquired during 2016 and increased revenues from professional services were largely offset by extension of certain long-term contracts with lower pricing and a fall in mutual fund registered shareowner account processing revenues.Healthcare Services operating revenues were up 13.7% on a year-over-year basis and came in at $111.9 million, primarily due to expansion in high-value services for medical and pharmacy businesses, new medical claims and organic growth.Non-GAAP cost and expenses were up 1.2% from the year-ago quarter to $315.6 million. However, as a percentage of revenues, costs and expenses were down 230 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 79.1% due to better cost management.Non-GAAP operating income increased 16.7% year over year and came in at $83.2 million. Operating margin was also up 230 bps on a year-over-year basis to 20.9%. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by cost-cutting measures within the Financial Services segment.DST reported non-GAAP net income of $53.9 million compared with $48.9 million reported in the year-ago quarter.The company's balance sheet as of Dec 31, 2016 looked very impressive as it has managed to lower its long-term debt and increased available cash and cash equivalents during the quarter by generating funds through the sale of the North American Customer Communications (NACC) business.The company exited 2016 with $195.5 million in cash and equivalents compared with $79.5 million at the end of 2015. Long-term debt (including current portion) was $508.2 million compared with $562.1 million as of Dec 31, 2015.During the fourth quarter, DST Systems repurchased roughly 0.675 million shares worth $75 million. Furthermore, since the beginning of Jan 2017, the company has repurchased $47 million worth of its common stock. It now has $103.0 million remaining under the existing $300 million share repurchase plan announced in Jun 2016.On Jul 1, 2016, DST Systems announced the completion of the sale of the NACC business to Broadridge Financial Solutions Inc. (BR) for a cash consideration of $410 million. The company recorded an estimated $340.1 million pretax gain on the transaction during the last reported quarter.DST Systems' NACC was the largest transactional printer in North America. The unit offers customers communication services including print and digital communication solutions, content management, postal optimization and fulfillment.DST Systems reported splendid fourth-quarter results, wherein earnings and revenues both surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Moreover, both revenues and earnings grew year over year.We are still of the opinion that DST Systems' business volume and massive scale of operation in Financial Services will attract new customers. Moreover, we expect steady contributions from acquisitions to support revenue growth. Continued share buybacks and dividend payments are the other encouraging factors.However, persistent decline in registered accounts, ongoing consolidation in the U.S. financial services market and stiff competition from International Business Machines Corporation  and Fiserv Inc.  may put its fundamentals under pressure. Moreover, a high debt burden still remains a major concern for the company.Notably, the stock price has underperformed the Zacks categorized  industry over the past one year. While the industry gained 24.4%, the stock gained only 12.3%.Currently, DST Systems carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A better-ranked stock worth considering in the Computer-Software industry is Check Point Software  , which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

" seems to be having quite a nightmare. Despite reporting narrower-than-expected loss for the fourth quarter of 2016, shares of the cyber security company could not arrest its fall in yesterdays' after hour trade.The cyber security solution provider posted adjusted loss (excluding one-time items but including stock-based compensation) of 22 cents per share, significantly narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 49 cents as well as the year-ago quarter's loss of 73 cents.On a GAAP and non-GAAP basis as well, the year-over-year comparisons were favorable. On a GAAP basis, the company reported loss of 37 cents per share, while it had reported a loss of 87 cents in the year-ago period.On a non-GAAP basis, FireEye posted loss per share of 3 cents compared with a loss of 36 cents in the fourth quarter of 2015. The quarter's non-GAAP loss per share was also significantly narrower than management's loss guidance of 16-18 cents (mid-point: 17 cents).Although this was the second consecutive quarter of better-than-expected results for the bottom line as well as year-over-year improvement, the company's stock bore the brunt of slowing top-line growth and a dismal outlook. Once investors' darling, FireEye's stock plunged nearly 18% and touched an all-time low of $10.35 yesterday.Notably, in the last one-year period, FireEye underperformed the Zacks categorized  industry. The stock lost nearly 28% in the said period comparing unfavorably with the industry's gain of 9.7%.FireEye's top-line performance was quite a disappointment. The company's fourth-quarter revenues of $184.7 million not only registered a marginal year-over-year decline for the first time ever but also fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $192 million as well as its own guidance of $187 million to $193 million (mid-point: $190 million).The company determined several internal and external factors which impacted its overall top-line performance. Internal factors include a number of sales leadership vacancies, reduced sales capacity and release of several major innovations on a limited basis focused on a set of targeted customers only. From an external perspective, the company analyzed less in the sense of urgency in some buyers.The company further revealed that dismal performance in the Asia-Pacific region was the main reason behind the underperformance. The performance in the Asia-Pacific region was mainly impacted by the company's management challenges.Billings decreased 14% to $221.8 million, below management's guidance of $230 million to $250 million mainly due to all the factors mentioned above.Segment-wise, Product revenues tanked 49.6% year over year to $33.6 million. Apart from the aforementioned factors, FireEye's strategy of transitioning its business to subscription and cloud-based offerings from hardware offerings was the main reason for the decline in product revenues. Subscription and Services revenues, on the other hand, rose 27.9% to $151.1 million.Nonetheless, FireEye continues to win large deals. Notably, the company closed 34 transactions with an individual value of over $1 million. The company also added 330 customers in the quarter. Moreover, its customer renewal rate remained above 90% during the quarter.Adjusted gross profit increased 1.6% from the year-ago quarter to $132.2 million. Gross margin improved 120 basis points (bps) to 71.6%.Adjusted operating expenses decreased 31.5% to $164.6 million. FireEye revealed that it managed to bring down its non-GAAP operating expenses on a year over year and sequential basis due to its sustained focus on cost optimization and productivity.The company posted adjusted operating loss of $32.4 million, 70.6% narrower than the year-ago loss of $110.3 million. Moreover, FireEye revealed that its non-GAAP operating margin was -1%, compared with -28% in the fourth quarter of 2015. This marked the best operating margin performance by FireEye in its entire history.Adjusted net loss for the fourth quarter was $35.9 million, compared with the year-ago net loss of $114.3 million. On a non-GAAP basis, the company reported net loss of $4.8 million compared with the year-ago quarter's loss of $56.5 million.FireEye exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $935.7 million, slightly higher than $926.2 million at the end of the previous quarter. Accounts receivable were $121.2 million compared with $124 million at the end of the third quarter. During the year, the company used $14.6 million of cash for operating activities.FireEye provided a disappointing first-quarter outlook. For the quarter, the company anticipates revenues in the range of $160 million to $166 million (mid-point: $163 million), below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $177.54 million. Billings are expected in the range of $130 million to $150 million. Non-GAAP operating margin is projected to remain in the band of -24% to -26% of revenues. The company expects non-GAAP loss per share of 26-28 cents (mid-point: 27 cents). Operating cash flow is likely to remain in the range of negative $30 million to negative $40 million.For 2017, the company provided only quantitative guidance. FireEye expects billings and revenues to improve throughout the year, mainly in the second half. It further anticipates positive operating cash flow for the first time ever in 2017.FireEye, headquartered in Milpitas, CA, is a global provider of web, email, file and malware security to enterprises and governments. The company posted dismal fourth-quarter results and provided a disappointing outlook.Although FireEye posted narrower-than-expected loss during the quarter, it marked the first year-over-year decline in revenues for the company. The dreary outlook makes us more cautious over the stock's future performance. | We believe that FireEye's dismal fourth-quarter performance was mainly due to its internal challenges as other companies in the space including Check Point Software  and Proofpoint  have reported tremendous top-line growth.Notably, over the past several quarters, the company has been losing business to its rivals. FireEye faces stiff competition from other well-established players in the cyber security space. Furthermore, the company's top-line growth has also been affected due to its futuristic approach toward transitioning itself to cloud and shifting its business model from hardware centric to subscription-based services. It should be noted that the company generates higher initial sales from hardware than the subscriptions.Due to the aforementioned factors, the company's top-line growth rates have been slowing down as evident from its last quarterly results.Nonetheless, FireEye's management has been striving to turn the business around through a string of initiatives, which includes new product launches, acquisition and cost optimization. Although the company expects these initiatives to prove beneficial in the long run, uncertainty related to the payback period prevails.Currently, FireEye carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A better-ranked stock in the broader technology sector is Aspen Technology, Inc.  , sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

" reported better-than-expected results in the third-quarter of fiscal 2017. The top and the bottom line also witnessed impressive year-over-year improvement.The company's earnings (including stock-based compensation but excluding all other one-time items) of 52 cents per share came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 49 cents. The figure also increased 6.1% from the year-ago quarter on the back of strong top-line growth and effective cost management.Xilinx reported fiscal third-quarter revenues of approximately $585.7 million, up 3.4% year over year and above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $579 million. The quarter marked the fifth consecutive quarter of revenue growth. On a sequential basis, the company's revenues grew roughly 1.1%.The robust revenue growth was mainly driven by strong sales of the company's 16nm Ultrascale+, 20nm Ultrascale, and 28nm Zynq products. Moshe Gavrielov, Xilinx President and Chief Executive Officer said that ""The growth from these products was driven by a broad base of markets such as data center, automotive, test & measurement, wired and wireless communications and space"".Furthermore, the company's wireless business rebounded, mainly driven by 4G business in China and India as well as pre-5G deployment.On the basis of End Market, sales at the Communications & Data Center division increased 4% from the prior-year quarter and 7% sequentially. Sales at the Industrial, Aerospace & Defense division increased 5% on a year-over-year basis and 1% sequentially. However, revenues at Broadcast, Consumer & Automotive decreased 2% year over year and 13% sequentially.Product-wise, revenues from Advanced products increased a whopping 30% year over year and 2% sequentially, driven mainly by strong sales of 28-nm, 20-nm and 16-nm products. On the other hand, as expected, revenues from core products declined 12% from the year-ago quarter. However, it remained flat sequentially.Geographically, on a year-over-year basis, revenues from Europe and Asia-Pacific increased 13% and 9%, respectively. On the other hand, revenues from Japan and North America declined 14% and 3%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.Xilinx reported a 70 basis point (bps) contraction in adjusted gross margin on a year-over-year basis to 69.6%. Also, reported gross margin was above the company's guidance of 69%.Adjusted operating expenses increased 7.6% to $243 million as the company continues to strategically increase its investments in R&D. Moreover, as a percentage of revenues, operating expenses amounted to 41.5%, reflecting a 160 bps year-over-year increase. On a reported basis, the company's operating expenses were $244.5 million, which was almost in-line with its own expectations of $245 million.Adjusted operating income of $164.4 million remained almost flat when compared with the year-ago quarter. However, adjusted operating margin contracted 100 bps as the benefit from improved gross margin was more than offset by higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenues.Adjusted net income for the quarter came in at $143.3 million compared with $134.2 million. | Xilinx exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments of approximately $3.25 billion, compared with $3.49 billion in the previous quarter. The company has total long-term debt (long-term debt plus current portion) of about $994.8 million.During the quarter, Xilinx generated cash of $105.6 million from operations and incurred $19.9 million as capital expenditure. Moreover, the company paid $83.3 million as cash dividends and repurchased shares worth $213.1 million during the quarter.In the first three quarters of fiscal 2017, Xilinx generated cash of $627.8 million from operations and incurred $51.8 million as capital expenditure. Moreover, the company paid $250.7 million as cash dividends and repurchased shares worth $414 million during the first nine months of the current fiscal.Concurrent with fiscal third-quarter results, Xilinx announced that its board of directors has approved a quarterly cash dividend of 33 cents per share. The raised dividend will be paid on Feb 23 to shareholders of record date as on Feb 8.For the last quarter of fiscal 2017, the company expects revenues in a range $590 million to $620 million (mid-point $605 million). The mid-point of the company's guidance for the fourth quarter is below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $610.28 million.Gross margin is anticipated to be in between 68% and 70%. Operating expenses are likely to be around $244 million, which includes approximately $1 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. Effective tax rate stands at approximately 14%.Keeping its earnings streak alive for the eleven successive quarters, Xilinx once again reported better-than-expected results, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both counts. Also, the company's top and bottom line both increased year over year.However, the company's revenue guidance for the fourth quarter was slight disappointing as it fell short of our estimate at the mid-point.Nonetheless, increasing demand for 28-nm, 20-nm and 16-nm nodes, driven by higher wireless deployments and strength in the wired communication segment, are expected to remain growth drivers. The company's new product launches should further aid revenues.Notably, the California-based chipmaker has outperformed the Zacks categorized Semiconductor-Pro Logic Device industry in the last one year. In the said period, shares of Xilinx gained 27.8%, outperforming the  industry's gain of 22.4%.Currently, Xilinx has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

" reported mixed second-quarter fiscal 2017 results wherein its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues missed the same. Avnet reported second-quarter adjusted earnings of 77 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents.Moreover, adjusted earnings were 2 cents higher than the year-ago quarter. The adjusted figure excludes restructuring, integration and other charges, and amortization of intangible assets.Before delving into the financial results, it should be noted that in the past few months, Avnet has been taking major restructuring steps to streamline its business. It intends to focus on high growth businesses only and divest low profit or loss making businesses.In doing so, the company has already entered into an  (TS) business to Tech Data Corporation  . The cash-stock deal is valued at $2.6 billion.Owing to the pending sale of the TS business, Avnet has decided to report it as discontinued operations beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2017.The company's quarterly adjusted revenues of $4.274 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.351 billion. Also, revenues were near the low end of management's guidance of $4.20 billion to $4.50 billion (mid-point $4.35 billion).However, on a year-over-year basis, revenues witnessed a 2.7% increase. The company's quarterly revenues mainly benefited from the newly acquired Premier Farnell business.Adjusted operating income tanked 5.9% from the year-ago quarter to $189.4 million mainly due to a 30.6% rise in adjusted operating expenses. Adjusted operating margin was 4.4% compared with 4.8% in the year-ago quarter.Adjusted net income amounted to $100.8 million, or 77 cents per share, compared with $101.3 million, or 75 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. | Avnet exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1.270 billion compared with $1.197 billion in the previous quarter. Long-term debt was $3.382 billion. During the first half of fiscal 2017, the company generated $240.1 million of cash from operational activities.Avnet paid a dividend of $43.4 million during the first six months of fiscal 2017. However, the company did repurchase shares during the period. At the end of first half of fiscal 2017, Avnet has $174.9 million remaining under the current share repurchase authorization program.The company provided its outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2017, which only includes EM and the newly acquired Premier Farnell businesses. The company projects sales in a range of $4.30 billion to $4.6 billion (mid-point $4.45 billion). Currently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $4.46 billion.Adjusted earnings per share are expected in a range of 80 cents to 90 cents. The tax rate is likely to be in the 23%-27% band.Avnet posted mixed results for the second quarter of fiscal 2017, wherein the bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missed the same. However, both earnings and revenues increased on a year-over-year basis.Note that Avnet has been taking major restructuring steps to mainly focus on the EM business. The divestment of the Technology Solution division will allow Avnet to focus on high growth areas such as marketing electronic components and related products in the supply chain. The company intends to use its resources to make investments in embedded solutions, IoT and critical digital platforms as well as expand its footprint in newer markets.In Oct 2016, Avnet completed the much awaited  in a total cash deal worth approximately £691 million. U.K.-based Premier Farnell is engaged in the distribution of technology products and solutions, particularly engineering solutions to the electronic system design, maintenance and repair communities.With its business spread across Europe, North America and Asia Pacific regions, the company operates in about 36 countries. The company believes that the acquisition will strengthen its worldwide digital footprint.In our opinion, the acquisition will strategically fit with Avnet's policy of focusing on high growth electronic component business.Nonetheless, although Avnet has acquired over 100 small companies, it will be a challenging task for it to integrate Premier Farnell, its largest ever buyout.Furthermore, a significant portion of Avnet's revenues comes from the sale of semiconductors, which is a cyclical industry, characterized by changes in technology and manufacturing capacity and subject to significant market upturns and downturns. Intensifying competition from Arrow Electronics Inc.  and Ingram Micro also remains a headwind.Notably, Avnet's share price has underperformed the Zacks Categorized Electronics Parts Distribution industry over the last one year. While the industry gained 48.3%, the stock gained only 17.7%.Currently, Avnet has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A better-ranked stock worth considering in the broader technology sector is Check Point Software  , which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

" (NYSE: PANW) kicked off the year with a bang, rising nearly 13% so far in January, nearly 4% since competitor  (NASDAQ: CHKP) reported finishing 2016 with another solid quarter. However, Palo Alto investors have seen this movie before. Palo Alto stock was flying high with its string of reporting 50% quarterly jumps in revenue each quarter, which ended earlier this year.Now that sales growth has slowed to the low 30% range, and expectations are for even less in the quarter that ends at the end of this month, the roller-coaster ride that comes with owning shares of Palo Alto will likely continue. But there are a few data security stocks that offer upside without as much risk, including one ideal for growth and income investors. Let's take a look.Image source: Check Point Software.One reason Check Point stock is bumping up against its 52-week high is that CEO Gil Shwed's strategy of growing subscription sales -- a source of recurring revenue -- have been an unmitigated success. Check Point increased sales 6% year over year to $487 million last quarter, but its subscription revenue soared 26% to $110 million.A year ago, subscriptions equaled 19% of total revenue; now that figure is 23% and climbing. Not only do recurring sales give Check Point a relatively solid revenue foundation, the shift is also in line with Shwed's focus on managing expenses. Recurring revenue costs less to generate over time than new sales, which is one reason Check Point offers less risk than its peer.Expense management helps set Check Point apart from Palo Alto. It helped drive a 21% jump in Check Point's earnings per share (EPS) last quarter. Check Point's total operating expense equaled 50% of revenue last quarter, which has generally been the case. And Palo Alto? Including the cost of revenue, as is the case with Check Point's expenses-to-sales results, Palo Alto's overhead was approximately $50 million more than it generated in revenue.Image source: Cisco.Last quarter,  (NASDAQ: CSCO) reported $540 million in security sales, good for an 11% improvement year over year. In addition to Cisco's in-house data security solutions, its $71 billion in cash and equivalents allow it to continue adding to its product suite, as it did last quarter with the closing of its $293 million deal for CloudLock.Similar to Check Point and, to a lesser extent, Palo Alto, Cisco has adopted a subscription-based model. CFO Kelly Kramer in a November press release pointed to Cisco's subscription and software offerings ""as we transition our business to a more recurring revenue model"" as a key to its 3% EPS growth year over year, after one-time charges. Not bad considering Cisco grew total sales -- after excluding its now divested SP Video unit -- by 1% to $12.4 billion.Another reason Cisco warrants inclusion on a list of stocks that are better than Palo Alto is the diversity of its business. Cisco has long been a leader in switches and routers, but it continues to add software, cloud data center, and Internet of Things (IoT) solutions to its arsenal, along with security. In addition to its relative stability and product diversification, Cisco's nearly 3.5% dividend yield also makes it an ideal growth and income alternative. Palo Alto does not pay a dividend.Image source: Fortinet.The closest to Palo Alto among these three stocks is  (NASDAQ: FTNT) in that it has also enjoyed soaring total revenue. Like Palo Alto, Fortinet's 22% increase in sales to $316.6 million in the third quarter was down after a string of even stronger quarters. However Fortinet, like Check Point and Cisco, doesn't spend more than it generates and its profitability translates to slightly less risk than Palo Alto with its mounting losses..Though not in Check Point's range of 50%, or even Cisco's 76%, Fortinet's combined cost of revenue and operating expense equaled 98% of total sales. A rather sizable jump in sales and marketing-related overhead played a big role in Fortinet's costs last quarter, and it likely will again when it announces earnings on Jan. 26.However, Fortinet is consistently profitable, and while not growing its top line as it had been, the 32% increase in deferred revenue of $934.8 million last quarter bodes well for the future.The reliability of Check Point, Cisco's market strength and dividend, and the consistent profitability of Fortinet while growing revenue 20% or more each quarter makes each one a better stock than Palo Alto.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"Image source: Getty.Though it was a surprise to some given the 9% jump in share price since announcing earnings on Jan. 19,  's(NASDAQ: CHKP) strong fourth quarter and fiscal year was a product of CEO Gil Shwed's strategic plan. Rather than spend indiscriminately as peers  (NYSE: PANW) and, to a lesser extent,  (NASDAQ: FTNT) do, Check Point has opted to be more like the tortoise than the hare.No flashy quarters of 30% plus revenue gains, just a steady increase in overall sales with an emphasis on one of Check Point's greatest strengths: building a foundation of recurring revenue. What makes Check Point a solid investment even as its stock hits a 52-week high is that it should continue to deliver in the three areas that drove last quarter's results.Image source: Check Point Software.Check Point ended its fourth quarter much as it did for the year, revenue growth of 6% and 7%, respectively. That may not impress Palo Alto fans following its 34% increase last quarter to $398.1 million in revenue, or Fortinet shareholders with its 22% jump to $316.6 million, but pundits and investors didn't mind.Not only did Check Point chime in with another consistent year of sales, its quarterly revenue of $487 million was well above analyst estimates of $478 million. That revenue ""beat"" certainly played a part in Check Point's stock closing up over 7% after sharing the good news. Check Point's consistent, if not spectacular, top-line growth was nice, but it was how it achieved it that bodes well for the future.Shwed's made no secret of his intention to drive subscription sales and enjoy the recurring revenue that comes along with it. One peek at the last quarter and year is a clear indication the plan is working like a charm. Though product, license, and software update sales continue to make up the largest pieces of Check Point's software revenue pie, subscriptions are gaining fast.An important component in last quarter's 6% total revenue increase was the whopping 26% jump in subscription sales to $110.5 million, even as product and software update sales merely inched up year over year. Better still, Check Point reported a 22% increase in the key metric for the year to $389.9 million. Which means not only did recurring revenue from subscriptions pop last quarter, the foundation-building efforts are gaining momentum.Check Point's successful business model transition should be music to the ears of risk averse investors or those that prefer a stock that boasts a relatively reliable, steady source of revenue that falls to the bottomline. Relying on sky-high revenue gains at the expense of profits is Palo Alto Networks' and Fortinet's world, and as subscription sales continue to climb, the differences will become even more pronounced.Check Point's cost management is a significant differentiator from Palo Alto and Fortinet as evidenced by last quarter's sales and marketing-related costs. Check Point's equaled 24% of sales. By comparison, Palo Alto spent 55% of its $398.1 million to fund its sales efforts while Fortinet forked out 49% of its $316.65 million in quarterly revenue. Expenses were also a factor in Check Point's impressive 21% jump in earnings per share last quarter to $1.46, after removing one-time items.If Check Point's 6% revenue improvement drew a smile from analysts, its EPS really had them beaming. Consensus estimates were for $1.25 per share earnings, a target Check Point surpassed by 17%. For the year, Check Point's $4.72 EPS was a 13% increase from a year ago. Just as its subscription sales are on the rise, so too are Check Point's earnings.Growth where it counts, all-important subscription sales, and watching costs to boost the bottom line were three reasons Check Point stock is flying high with no end in sight.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"fter a couple of disappointing earnings reports,  turned its performance around remarkably, as it reported fourth-quarter 2016 IFRS earnings of €1.26 ($1.36) per share, which reflected an impressive 18% growth from the year-ago figure of €1.07 per share. The figure also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.10 by a striking 23.6%.Robust growth in Cloud subscriptions and support, along with consistent strength in Cloud and software business, drove earnings.For full-year 2016, IFRS earnings jumped 18% year over year to €3.03 per share, on the back of rapidly expanding cloud business and sturdy growth in support revenue.Total IFRS revenues for the fourth quarter were €6,724 million ($7,255 million), up 6% year over year. A flourishing cloud business, along with strong growth of support revenues, aided top-line growth during the quarter. Also, new cloud bookings - a key indicator of sales success in cloud business - were up a whopping 40% to €483 million in the reported quarter.However, quarterly revenues lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7,298 million.Revenues for 2016 went up 6% year over year to €22.06 billion, driven by a 31% increase in new cloud bookings and cloud, and software growth.Cloud and Software business, which includes Cloud Subscriptions & Support and Software licenses & support, reported fourth-quarter revenues of €5,760 million ($6,215 million), up 7% year over year. Individually, Cloud Subscriptions & Support garnered revenues of €827 million ($892 million) in the quarter, up 31% year over year; while Software licenses and support reported revenues of €4,933 million ($5,323 million), up 4% on a year-over-year basis.In addition, for the reported quarter, Services revenues came inflat year over year at €963 million ($1,039 million).Overall, IFRS Cloud and software revenues, mainly driven by IFRS Cloud Subscriptions & Support strength, witnessed the highest growth in the EMEA region and APJ (both up 9%), followed by the Americas (up 5%).The EMEA region recorded double-digit software license revenues growth in Germany and the UK. Moreover, growth of software licenses revenue in Mexico proved conducive to the sales growth of the Latin American region. This supplemented top-line growth in the Americas. For the APJ region, double digit software license growth in China, India and Japanacted as a strong catalyst.SAP reported IFRS operating margin of 28.8%, up200 basis points from the figure recorded in fourth-quarter 2015. Additionally, the company recorded an almost 14% increase in its operating profit, which came in at €1,936 million ($2,089 million).SAP's human capital management (''HCM'') applications continue to act as the key growth driver, with SuccessFactors Employee Central surpassing the 1,580-customer mark at the end of the fourth quarter. Also, SAP's Customer Engagement and Commerce solutions grew in double digits during the quarter.Moreover, consistent solid market traction of the SAP S/4HANA platform is proving to be the strongest profit churner. Year over year, S/4HANA adoption doubled to more than 5,400 customers in 2016. The company also gained 1,300 customers in the reported quarter, of which 30% are new. This hugely fuelled the company's revenues. The SAP HANA Cloud Platform (""HCP"") has been aiding clients in extending functionalities, building new applications, and integrating across cloud and on-premise platforms, which in turn is bolstering its growth.This apart, SAP's business networks (which it manages through three main players - namely Ariba, Fieldglass and Concur) experienced 19% growth in cloud subscriptions and support revenue during 2016. Over the past year, the Ariba network handled the trading of 2.5 million connected companies, which was worth over $885 billion; while Concur managed travel and expenses of more than 45 million end users, and Fieldglass helped in managing 3.1 million flexible workers.For the year ended Dec 31, 2016, the company's operating cash flow came in at €4.63 billion (approximately $5 billion), up an impressive 27% on a year-over-year basis; while free cash flow generated by the company came in at €3.63 billion ($3.92 billion), up 21% compared to the year-ago tally.As on Dec 31, 2016, SAP had cash and cash equivalents of €3,702 million ($3,893 million) compared with €3,411 million recorded at the end of Dec 31, 2015.The company is highly optimistic about its sturdy backlog paired with a robust pipeline, which positions it for profitable growth in 2017. Full-year 2017 non-IFRS total revenue is now expected to lie in the range of €23.2-€23.6 billion at constant currencies (cc), which is higher than the expectations at the beginning of 2016.Also, 2017 non-IFRS operating profit is projected to be in a range of €6.8-€7.0 billion (at cc), which is also an improvement over the prior projections.We are optimistic about the company's strong momentum in its cloud business, which will boost growth.In fact, in light of sustained rapid growth in the cloud, robust software momentum and operating profit expansion, SAP raised its 2020 ambition as well. SAP now aims to achieve €8.0-€8.5 billion non-IFRS cloud subscriptions and support revenues (previously €7.5 − €8.0 billion) in 2020. Further, it will strive to generate €8.5-€9.0 billion non-IFRS operating profit (previously €8-€9 billion) on non-IFRS total revenues of €28-€29 billion (previously €26-€28 billion). | SAP has managed to deliver a robust top-line performance despite the so-called IT spending woes. The company has established dominance over three of the most critical client demand areas, namely efficient customer engagement, human capital management and interconnected commerce network. Stiff industry rivalry and cut-throat competition in contemporary business enterprises are causing firms to scour for technological platforms which can help them outshine peers.We believe that robust demand momentum for efficient software tools, by leading business enterprises, offers SAP excellent opportunities for future growth. Strong key financial metrics of the company and upward guidance revision strongly signal brighter days ahead.SAP currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

ast quarter,  broke its striking earnings beat streak that spanned nine quarters of back-to-back positive earnings surprises, as it reported in-line earnings. However, Waters Corp. resumed its streak in its just-reported fourth-quarter 2016 results, as its adjusted earnings of $2.21 per share trumped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.12 by 4.3%.The bottom-line figure fared even better in year-over-year comparison, reflecting a striking growth of 12.8% from the prior-year quarter tally of $1.96. Remarkable, broad-based top-line expansion along with growth in Asia and Europe, aided the earnings beat.Solid operational execution backed by the company's efficient business model also lent strength to the results. Further, a decline in interest expenses aided quarterly profits.For full-year 2016, adjusted earnings came in at $6.62, reflecting an increase of 12% over 2015.In the reported quarter, Waters Corp.'s net sales grew 7% year over year to $629 million and also came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $617 million.The upside in the top line came on the back of robust performance in the industrial end markets (up 14% on a constant currency basis). Further, the bio/pharmaceutical end market and the government & academic market (both up 6% on a constant currency basis) also drove the overall top-line growth.Also, impressive contribution from sale of key products across major geographies supplemented quarterly sales growth. In addition, Water Corp.'s recurring revenues and instrument system sales grew 8% and 9%, respectively, driving top-line growth.In terms of geographies, Waters Corp. witnessed strong sales in Asia and Europe, which posted 16% and 9% growth at constant currency. Sales in the U.S. also rose 2% year over year.For full-year 2016, sales for the company came in at $2,167 million, up around 6% from 2015 revenues.Total selling and administrative expenses in the quarter came in at $130.2 million, up from $128.7 million in fourth-quarter 2015. Research and development outlay for the quarter was $32.8 million, compared with $28.3 million incurred a year ago.Despite the rise in these expenses, operating income in the quarter climbed 14.9% year over year to $208.3million.Waters Corp.'s cash, cash equivalents and investments amounted to approximately $2.8 billion, higher than $2.4 billion as on Dec 31, 2015. The company's total liabilities at quarter end increased to about $2.4 billion from $2.2 billion as on Dec 31, 2015. | Waters Corp.'s leading position in the high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry markets is its key strength that has acted as a strong revenue driver for the past few quarters. The company's bright pharmaceutical business ended 2016 on a healthy note and looks set to continue its momentum going into 2017.Waters Corp.'s exposure in the pharma/biotech industry is primarily in regulated commercial lab environments, where demand is non-discretionary and not prone to cyclicality. This helps the company mitigate uncertain client spending stemming from macroeconomic volatility. Also, given the fact that liquid chromatography is used in a huge variety of applications, Waters Corp. stands to benefit significantly from this business, going forward.However, of late, vagaries in spending by the governmental and academic customers have been hurting the company's top line. Additionally, Waters Corp.'s escalating debt levels and R&D expenditure may dent its financials.Waters Corp. currently holds a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

witzerland-based computer peripherals company,  continued its impressive streak of huge earnings beats for the fifth consecutive quarter, as its third-quarter fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings (including stock-based compensation expense adjustments) of 59 cents per share dwarfed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 36 cents by nearly 64%.The company's shares jumped 14.4% at one time in  as investors cheered the remarkable results.Also, on a non-GAAP basis, the company's earnings per share came in at 56 cents, up 36.6% on a year-over-year basis. The bottom line's remarkable year-over-year growth was driven by robust performance across the company's improving product categories.Net sales for the quarter rose an impressive 7.3%, year over year, to $666.7 million, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $638 million. The entire growth was attributable to the company's Retail segment, which grew a remarkable 13%, year over year, in constant currency. This was the highest quarterly growth achieved by the segment ever. This was somewhat mitigated by revenues lost subsequent to the company's exit from OEM operations, which affected the year-over-year comparison.The Retail category recorded sturdy, broad-based growth across most of its businesses, with four of them charting double-digit growth over third-quarter fiscal 2016. Gaming and Video Collaboration stood out as the strongest, followed by Mobile Speakers category.Gaming surged 38% year over year to $107.2 million, driven by strength in PC gaming, fresh product launches and marketing initiatives. On the other hand, Video Collaboration grew 37% to $35.8 million on the back of double-digit growth from all three regions. Logitech is optimistic about its leadership position in webcam and audio technology as well as its channel expansion initiatives.The Mobile Speakers unit continued charting its robust growth trajectory on the back of greater channel penetration and solid growth across EMEA region, growing 25% year over year to $106.6 million.Audio-PC & Wearables also demonstrated remarkable growth, with a robust 17% increase in revenues, to $67.2 million on a year-over-year basis. Its numbers benefited from addition of the Jaybird family of wireless earbuds to its portfolio, although supply constraints restrained further upside which the company had projected.Keyboards & Combos grew 8% year over year, while Pointing Devices and PC Webcams showed modest growth of 2% and 3%, respectively. This was the eleventh consecutive quarter of growth for Keyboards & Combos, while growth in PC Webcams wassupplemented by strong contribution from C922 Pro Stream webcam.In addition, sales under the Home Control category increased 5% to $26.9 million, driven by the recent integration of Alexa into Logitech's Harmony Hub.Tablet & Other Accessories space was the only segment which contracted, with its revenues plunging 31%, year over year, to $24.9 million, hurt by persistent sluggish product demand.Logitech generated its highest non-GAAP gross margin in its history, of 37.4% (up 380 basis points year over year), bolstered by improved cost efficiency and increased scale.Non-GAAP operating margin for the company expanded a remarkable 300 bps, year over year, to 14.9%, as non-GAAP operating income jumped 33.6% year over year to $99.1 million on top-line strength. The growth in operating profits reflects focused cost-control initiatives and disciplined operational spending as well.As on Dec 31, 2016, Logitech's cash and cash equivalents were $513.6 million compared with $509 million as of Dec 31, 2015.In light of such exceptional quarterly results, Logitech raised its guidance for fiscal 2017. It now expects to post non-GAAP operating income in the range of $225-$230 million (up from earlier guidance of $195-$205 million). Further, the company now projects its Retail sales to grow 12-13% in constant currency terms, up from prior projections of 8-10% growth. | Logitech's earnings results highlight the company's impressive traction across its markets. It is confident of sustaining the momentum in the quarters ahead. Logitech has been benefiting from its sturdy business model that emphasizes on maximizing profit in PC peripherals and expanding into new business categories. Despite declining PC sales and macroeconomic uncertainty, the company seems to be on a sustainable growth curve.The company anticipates the momentum in its Gaming category to continue in the quarters ahead on the back of a strong product portfolio.

Strong economic data suggested that the U.S. economy continues to fire on all cylinders, but that led to higher bond yields and fears that tightening monetary policy from the Federal Reserve could pose threats to growth during the rest of the year.Yet even amid nervous market sentiment, some stocks managed to gain ground.  (NASDAQ: CSX) ,  (NASDAQ: OCLR) , and  (NASDAQ: CHKP) were among the best performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so well.Image source: CSX.CSX jumped 23%, with many investors pointing to speculation that the railroad giant might be the target of takeover efforts.  on Tuesday afternoon, which included a 2% drop in net income and adjusted volume declines of 1%. However, the hard-hit coal segment improved from recent poor performance, and a positive outlook on some key industries suggested potential upside for the railroad.Yet in an unusual turn of events,  (NYSE: CP) CEO Hunter Harrison quit his job with the Canadian railroad and said that he would seek to work with an activist investor to get hired at CSX. That led to an analyst upgrade from  , but it's far from certain how CSX will respond, or whether the move will lead to anything.Fiber-optics specialist Oclaro climbed 17% after announcing preliminary results for its fiscal second quarter. The company said that sales would come in at the top of its prior guidance range, and adjusted operating income would be about $36 million, well above previous predictions of $22 million to $26 million.Oclaro saw particular strength in the 100G market, and strong margin figures, a rich product mix, and solid internal execution to maximize growth opportunities contributed to the winning quarter. As CEO Greg Dougherty put it, ""Our excellent preliminary results for the December quarter once again demonstrated the strength of Oclaro's products in the markets we serve,"" and the optical components manufacturer believes that upward momentum could continue into the future.Finally, Check Point Software Technologies picked up 8%. The maker of network security products announced its fourth-quarter results Thursday morning, posting a 6% rise in sales and earnings per share of $1.46, up more than 20% from the year-ago period. Moreover, Check Point gave investors encouraging guidance for 2017 results, including expected adjusted earnings of $5.05 to $5.25 per share and revenue of $1.85 billion to $1.9 billion.Both figures exceeded the consensus forecast among investors, and it showed the impact of extremely strong growth in the mobile and threat-prevention areas. With cloud computing increasing risk levels for many clients, Check Point's products are likely to see even greater demand going forward.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"hares of  have been on the rise since it reported splendid third-quarter 2016 results. The indicators of a stock's bullish run include a rise in its share price and a continued uptrend in estimates.Check Point has been clocking solid returns over the last six months and has gained approximately 11.3%, outperforming the Zacks categorized  industry's gain of 10.2%.In the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Check Point's fourth quarter and fiscal 2016 witnessed upward revisions. For the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $1.15 per share, up from earnings of $1.14 per share earlier. Similarly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2016 is currently pegged at $4.14 per share compared with $4.13 projected 60 days ago.Check Point reported its quarterly numbers on Oct 31, following which its shares have gained over 6% so far. Check Point's adjusted earnings per share (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets) of $1.01 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 97 cents. Adjusted earnings also climbed 7.2% on a year-over-year basis, driven mainly by higher revenues and a lower share count, which were partially offset by higher operating expenses.Third-quarter revenues came in at $427.6 million, up nearly 6% year over year, and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $423 million. The figure was also close to the upper end of the company's guidance range of $405−$435 million (mid-point $420 million).Top-line growth was aided by sales growth of 9.6% in Products & Software Blades and 1.6% in Software Updates and Maintenance. The company also reported a 23.8% surge in subscription revenues at Software Blades.Check Point witnessed higher demand for data center and high-end appliances. Another factor contributing to overall growth was the increased number of large deal signings. The number of new customers who signed deals worth $1 million or more was 65. Customers who signed deals worth $50,000 and more contributed 73% to the total order value.We believe that Check Point Software will continue to benefit from strong demand for cybersecurity solutions. Note that the financial well-being, brand image and reputation of enterprises and governments are always exposed to the risk of cyber threats. Consequently, cybersecurity has become a mission-critical, high-profile requirement.With rapid technological advancement, organizations are increasingly adopting the ""bring your own device"" (BYOD) policy to enhance employee productivity with anytime/anywhere access. This trend, in turn, calls for stricter data security measures.Per IDC's report, corporate spending on threat intelligence security services will reach $1.4 billion in 2018 from an estimated $905.5 million in 2014. Another research firm, MarketsandMarkets, projects that the global threat intelligence security market will reach approximately $5.86 billion by 2020 from $3.0 billion in 2015, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.3%.We believe Check Point Software is capitalizing on this opportunity and this may well be reflected in the company's results in the to-be reported quarter.Furthermore, the rapid adoption of Check Point's data center appliances and the continuous enhancements in data center product lines are expected to provide adequate support to revenue growth. Additionally, the company's continuous share buybacks bode well for investors.Looking at these positives, we believe that Check Point is one technology stock that deserves a place in investors' portfolio.Check Point also delivered positive earnings surprises in three out of the last four quarters with an average beat of 3.55%.Check Point is currently trading at a lower price/earnings (P/E) multiple than the industry average. Therefore, we believe that Check Point with its lower forward P/E valuation of 20.7x compared with the industry average of 37.5x may be a great bet.However, we believe that there is still much momentum left in this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, which is quite evident from its long-term earnings growth rate of 10.1%.Thus, investing in this stock can reap returns in the short term.Stocks worth consideration in the broader technology sector include Broadcom Limited  , Seagate Technology plc  and Western Digital Corporation  . All the three stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see  .Broadcom, Seagate and Western Digital have a long-term expected EPS growth rate of 13.59%, 8.79% and 1.76, respectively.In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2017?Who wouldn't?

"t was hard to know exactly what to expect going into network security company  's(NASDAQ: CHKP) fourth-quarter results. After all, competitors like  (NASDAQ: FTNT) and  (NYSE: PANW) had both served notice that sales cycles were lengthening, and that's usually a clear sign of a slowing marketplace. Given Check Point's status as the established leader -- with non-GAAP operating income margin of 55% to protect -- it would have been natural for investors to be a bit fearful. But when the report was released on Thursday, earnings came in ahead of expectations.Let's take a look at what happened in the quarter and what it could mean for the rest of the sector.Image source: Check Point Software Technologies Ltd.Here are the headline numbers from the fourth quarter:The headline numbers were excellent, and even after an excellent run for the stock, the market took Check Point stock higher by 7.5% on the day. The stock is up nearly 25% in the last three months compared to a decline of 4% for Palo Alto Networks and a 4% increase for Fortinet stock.Both Palo Alto and Fortinet have made cautionary remarks in recent months. Fortinet missed management's revenue estimates in its third quarter (revenue came in at $316.6 million compared to a guidance range of $319 million to $324 million) and CEO Ken Xie had talked of ""moderated spending"" and ""extended sales cycles"" on the  in late October.Check Point subsequently gave a  of third-quarter earnings, with CEO Gil Shwed claiming he hadn't seen the kind of environment reported by Xie. However, if you thought the network security industry was out of the woods, that wasn't the case.Palo Alto Networks reported first-quarter 2017 results in November andCEO Mark McLaughlin said they were ""not as robust as we expected."" He went on to say that "" purchasing decisions have to go through additional approvals, particularly in larger companies on the increasingly larger opportunities we are winning. As a result, we saw some deals push."" It sounds similar to what Fortinet's management said. McLaughlin would later claim it was more to do with the market than the competition.That said, Check Point delivered another good quarter, and management discussed two company-specific factors that have probably played a role.First, CFO Tal Payne said the company achieved "" double-digit growth in our core appliances with strong transition to our new product family launched earlier this year. This quarter, over 85% of our appliances business comes from the new family."" As you can see below, product revenue (36% of total revenue) and software blade subscriptions (23%) increased their growth rates in the quarter, indicating success in expanding the customer base. This could be thanks to sales spurred by the new product family.Data source:Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. Year-over-year growth. Chart by author.Second, Payne talked of the ""fruits of the investment"" made in expanding the sales force, although, as one analyst remarked on the , it's taken awhile for the effect to be seen -- the increased investments began in early 2015. Shwed responded by saying it has taken a year for the benefits to come through, and the current quarter had confirmed the positive trend seen in the previous quarter.It's good news, but the increased sales force has come at the cost of margin contraction. data by  .The two factors -- new product family and increased sales force -- are obviously company-specific, and there is no guarantee that Fortinet and Palo Alto will report good results in their upcoming earnings. As for Check Point, the company closed out a good year, and guidance for first-quarter revenue of $420 million to $440 million implies year-over-year growth of 4% to 9%. All told, despite cautionary commentary elsewhere, Check Point expects to continue growing solidly in 2017.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

" is facing allegations over its hiring and rewarding practices. The U.S. Department of Labor has filed a lawsuit alleging that the technology giant pays more to white male workers compared to non-white and female counterparts for the same job.Further, the company allegedly favors Asian workers for product development and other technical roles compared to non-Asian workers.However, Oracle is not the only well-known name facing the Labor department's ire. Banking giant J.P. Morgan  has also been sued for discriminating against female workers. Further, Alphabet  division Google is involved in a lawsuit after it failed to provide compensation data and documents for its Mountain View headquarters as part of a routine compliance evaluation.In Sep 2016, the Labor department filed a lawsuit against data mining firm Palantir Technologies alleging systematic discrimination against Asian job applicants.Notably, all these companies are federal contractors and hence are prohibited from practicing employment discrimination. Per Labor department federal contractors are ""required to take affirmative action to ensure that equal employment opportunity is provided to applicants and employees in all aspects of employment.""Consequently, an adverse judgement will not only dent brand value but also risks the cancellation of all current federal contracts. Further, unless they reform their discriminatory practices they can be barred from entering into future federal contracts.Federal contracts contribute a very small portion of Oracle's total revenues. Per USASpending.gov data, direct sales to the federal government were $60.8 million in 2015, which was miniscule compared with its global revenues of $38.2 billion. | In Oct 2016, Oracle decided against participating through the Federal Supply Schedules (FSS) for government contracts. Reportedly, huge compliance requirements, the lawsuit threats related to False Claims Act (FCA) and the new Transactional Data Reporting (TDR) rule were cited as the primary reasons behind the decision.Moreover, Oracle's withdrawal from FSS doesn't make it ineligible for other government contracts like enterprise software awards from Department of Defense (DoD).Notably, in the past Oracle has faced FSS-related FCA lawsuits. The company paid nearly $100 million in 2006 to settle claims against PeopleSoft and roughly $200 million in 2011 to settle allegations that it overcharged schedule customers.Hence, we believe that barring Oracle from future government contracts (following an adverse ruling) will not materially impact the company's overall results.Oracle has gained 15.5% in the last one year, underperforming the Zacks  industry's increase of 22% in the same time frame.The underperformance of the stock can be attributed to the ongoing transition from licensing to the cloud business model that is keeping margins under pressure at the moment. Moreover, litigation matters are also keeping the share prices under check.Currently, Oracle carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Check Point Software  sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) is a stock worth watching in the sector.

he market is not really happy with  's  preliminary numbers for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2016. Following the announcement, the company's stock price declined nearly 2.9% in the last trading session to close at $44.05.We note that the stock has underperformed the Zacks classified  industry in the past six months. The stock has gained just 6.6% during this period, compared with an increase of 17.5% for the industry.Gigamon estimates revenues in the range of $84.5-$85 million for the fourth quarter, lower than the previous guidance of $91 million to $93 million, due to lower-than-expected product bookings in the North America region. The Zacks Consensus Estimates is pegged higher at $92 million. Non-GAAP earnings are anticipated to be in a range of 35-37 cents per share, again lower than the previous guidance of 36-38 cents per share.However, Non-GAAP gross margin is estimated in a range of 83% to 84% compared with the company's earlier guided range of 82% to 83%.Gigamon is scheduled to announce fourth-quarter and full year 2016 results on Feb 2, 2017.For 2016, Gigamon expects revenues to be approximately $310.3 million to $310.8 million, representing 40% increase on a year-over-year basis. However, the revenue projection falls short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $318 million.Non-GAAP earnings are projected in a range of $1.22 to $1.25, reflecting 50% year-over-year increase. This is primarily attributable to better-than-expected market share on the back of the company's key technology, solutions and partnerships.Non-GAAP gross margin is estimated in a range of 82% to 83% whereas non-GAAP operating margin is anticipated in a range of 22% to 23%.Gigamon's preliminary results didn't impress investors. However, the company's year-over-year revenue and earnings comparisons for 2016 were encouraging.We believe that Gigamon is well positioned to benefit from a rapidly growing network security solutions market, which is worth more than $18 billion. The ongoing transition to cloud and the fast adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology presents significant growth potential for the company.We believe that product launches will continue to drive growth. The GigaSMART, GigaVUE-HC1 and GigaVUE-HC2 platforms continue to witness increased adoption. Moreover, the company is adding clients, which should bolster its financial results.Gigamon currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

"Chicago, IL - January 23, 2017 - Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Features:  NYSE:  ,  NASDAQ:  NASDAQ:  NYSE:  and  NASDAQ: When the stock market surged to new all-time highs in November, it created a fantastic parade of opportunities with hundreds of stocks displaying their own strong momentum.But with so many ""price strength"" ideas to chose from, how do you narrow them down into the good, the bad, and the must-have?The answer is simple: match that price momentum with the number-one driver of stocks, Today I ran a Zacks Premium screen called  . This screen focuses on top Zacks Ranked momentum stocks in uptrends at or near their 52-week highs.These momentum stocks are currently exhibiting both price momentum and earnings estimate revision momentum. And forces of entropy aside, you know what Newton said about a body in motion.Only 14 names made the list. I'm going to share 5 of them with you.First, let's go over the screen parameters... Here they are with a brief description and recent catalysts... NYSE: AIT is one of North America's leading distributors of bearings, linear technologies, power transmission components, rubber products, specialty maintenance items and electrical/mechanical and fluid power products and systems to the MRO (maintenance and repair operations) and OEM (original equipment manufacturer) markets.This $2.4 billion company reports earnings on January 26 and became a Zacks #2 Rank after analysts moved up their EPS estimates in the past week. After a 14.75% earnings beat last quarter that launched shares from $50 to $62, maybe they know something we don't. NASDAQ: CHKP is a leading provider of policy-based enterprise security and traffic management solutions. Through its patented Stateful Inspection technology, the company delivers Secure Enterprise Connectivity solutions that protect information assets and enhance the performance of enterprise networks.CheckPoint delivered a 15.6% earnings beat on January 19 and shares surged 7.5% to highs not seen since the DotCom Bubble. The stock is a Zacks #2 Rank now but I expect as the analysts update their EPS models that it will rise into the top tier very soon. NASDAQ: The $42 billion rail freight giant was a big mover on Jan 19 as the stock vaulted over 23% on the day on 98.5 million shares, 10X the normal volume. The move came following reports that the former Canadian Pacific CEO Hunter Harrison is teaming up with activists to shake up the railroad company.But the outlook had already brightened considerably before this news as the company witnessed eight positive estimate revisions in the past 30 days, pushing the stock to a Zacks #2 Rank. I would keep this one on your buy list for a pullback in the $38-40 zone. NYSE: LyondellBassell Industries is a $36.5 billion manufacturer of chemicals and derivatives for multiple industries including packaging, electronics, automotive components, home furnishings, construction materials and biofuels. It also operates as a refiner of heavy high-sulfur crude oil produce and is engaged in the marketing and selling of polyolefins, polypropylene and polyethylene resins.The stock became a Zacks #2 Rank after 2017 EPS estimates rose from $9.51 to $9.71. The next quarterly earnings report is February 3 and Wells Fargo recently reiterated their Outperform rating with a valuation range of $98 to $102. NASDAQ: Skyworks Solutions is a $14.5 billion wireless semiconductor company focused on radio frequency (RF) and complete system solutions for mobile communications applications. Their name is virtually synonymous with the Internet of Things for which they will supply a large portion of the RF chips as the IoT grows to 50 billion connected devices by 2020.SWKS just reported another strong quarter and outlook on January 19, igniting shares to a $10 or 12.75% gain on Friday Jan 20. As with Check Point, I expect this Zacks #2 Rank to see solid upward EPS revisions that push its Rank higher next week.I hope this ""double the momentum"" list gives you at least one, or three, ideas to keep on your radar.You are welcome to download the full, up-to-the-minute list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 ""Strong Buy"" stocks free of charge.

"hares of  were up 7.5% yesterday following the company's announcement of impressive fourth-quarter 2016 results, wherein its revenues and earnings came ahead of its own expectations as well as the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Check Point's adjusted earnings per share (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets) of $1.33 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.15. Adjusted earnings also climbed approximately 21% on a year-over-year basis, driven mainly by higher revenues and a lower share count, which were partially offset by higher operating expenses.On a non-GAAP (excluding stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets) basis, the cybersecurity company posted earnings of $1.46, which were not only 21.7% higher than the year-ago quarter but way ahead of its own guidance range of $1.20 to $1.28. Moreover, it should be noted that this was the best quarterly non-GAAP EPS growth rate the company has witnessed since the third quarter of 2010. | Fourth-quarter revenues came in at $486.7 million, up 6.3% year over year, and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $477 million. The figure was also close to the upper end of the company's guidance range of $460 million to $490 million (mid-point $475 million).Top-line growth was aided by sales growth of 9.7% in Products & Software Blades and 1.6% in Software Updates and Maintenance. The company also reported a 25.5% surge in subscription revenues at Software Blades.Check Point witnessed higher demand for data center and high-end appliances. Another factor contributing to overall growth was the increased number of large deal signings. The number of new customers who signed deals worth $1 million or more was 99, a 15% increase from the year-ago quarter's tally of 86. Moreover, customers who signed deals worth $50,000 and more contributed 76% to the total order value, up from 72% registered in the fourth quarter of 2015.Geographically, the Americas contributed 47% to revenues and Europe accounted for 38%, while Asia-Pacific, Japan, and the Middle East and Africa added the remaining 15%.On a year-over-year basis, adjusted gross profit (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets) increased 6.1% to $428.5 million. However, as a percentage of revenues, gross profit contracted 20 basis points (bps) to 88%.Adjusted operating expenses (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets) rose 13.8% year over year to $183.8 million as the company continued to make investments. The increase may also be attributed to higher research and development, and selling and marketing expenses as well as to acquisitions made over the past year. As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses increased 250 basis points (bps).Adjusted operating income (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets) came in at $244.7 million, up nearly 1% year over year. However, margins contracted 260 bps as a percentage of revenues mainly due to higher operating expenses.Adjusted net income (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets and other one-time items calculated on a proportionate tax basis) was $225.3 million or $1.33 per share, up from $197.7 million or $1.10 reported last year.Check Point exited the year with cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and short-term investments of approximately $3.669 billion. During 2016, the company generated operating cash flow of $923 million. Moreover, Check Point repurchased $988 million worth of common stock in 2016.Taking into account the back-to-back quarters of favorable business trends, Check Point provided a strong revenue and earnings guidance for the first quarter and full year 2017.The company expects to generate revenues between $420 million and $440 million (mid-point $430 million). The mid-point of the guidance is slightly higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $428.7 million. Non-GAAP earnings are projected in a range of $1.15 to $1.20 per share. GAAP earnings per share are anticipated to be 17 cents or less. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.03 per share.For 2017, Check Point anticipates to generate revenues between $1.85 billion and $1.90 billion (mid-point $1.875 billion). The mid-point of the guided range was is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.84 billion. Non-GAAP earnings are projected in a range of $5.05 to $5.25 per share. GAAP earnings per share are anticipated to be 70 cents or less. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $4.39 per share.Check Point ended 2016 on a strong note, reporting better-than-expected results for the fourth quarter. The robust year-over-year upside in the top and bottom lines was encouraging. Buoyed by a strong quarterly performance, the company provided a solid outlook for the first quarter and full year 2017.Favorable fourth quarter results and a strong outlook sent shares of this Israel-based cybersecurity firm as high as $97.92, touching nearly its 16-year high. However, the intraday gain slightly cooled off later in the day and the stock settled at $96.34, up 7.5% from the previous day's closing price.Notably, Check Point has been clocking solid returns over the last three months and has gained approximately 25%, outperforming the Zacks categorized  industry's gain of just 6.2%.Moving ahead, rapid adoption of Check Point's data center appliances and continuous enhancements in data center product lines are expected to provide ample top-line support.Furthermore, we believe that Check Point Software will continue to benefit from strong demand for cybersecurity solutions. Note that the financial well-being, brand image and reputation of enterprises and governments are always exposed to the risk of cyber threats. Consequently, cybersecurity has become a mission-critical, high-profile requirement.Per IDC's report, corporate spending on threat intelligence security services will reach $1.4 billion in 2018 from an estimated $905.5 million in 2014. Another research firm, MarketsandMarkets, projects that the global threat intelligence security market will reach approximately $5.86 billion by 2020 from $3.0 billion in 2015, representing compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.3%.We believe Check Point Software is capitalizing on this opportunity and this may well be reflected in the company's forthcoming quarterly results. Additionally, the company's efforts on continuous share buybacks bode well for investors.Check Point currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

"Chicago, IL - January 16, 2017, 2016 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include  (NASDAQ:  -  ),  (NASDAQ:  -  ),  (NASDAQ:  -  ),  (NASDAQ:  -  ) and  (NASDAQ:  -  ).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations. Worldwide IT spending is projected to total $3.46 trillion in 2017, a 2.7% increase from $3.38 billion in 2016, as per a recent report from information technology research and advisory firm, Gartner.If this happens, the year will mark a solid recovery in IT spending after two consecutive years of decline. Notably, in 2015 and 2016, worldwide spending declined 5.5% and 0.6%, respectively.Worldwide IT spending forecast provided by Gartner indicates major technology trends across, IT services, hardware, software and telecom markets. The firm has been providing forecasts for more than a decade and organizations have been using its reports to make critical business decisions.Although the recent forecast is 0.2% lower than its previous projection of 2.9% growth, John-David Lovelock, research vice president at Gartner is confident that year 2017 is ""poised to be a rebound year in IT spending"".According to Lovelock, the growing adoption of cloud, blockchain, digital business and artificial intelligence are driving IT spending and may even push it beyond the projected 2.7% growth. However, he opines that due to some political uncertainty in global markets various enterprises might adopt a ""wait-and-see approach"" and ""forestall IT investments"".Per its latest report, every IT segment will witness growth in spending with Enterprise Software leading the way. It may witness a 6.8% rise this year and reach $355 billion.It will be followed by the IT Services segment, which is anticipated to register 4.2% growth in spending and reach $938 billion. The growth is expected to be mainly driven by increased investments digital business, intelligent automation, and services optimization and innovation, which will be partially offset by broad economic challenges.Spending across Data Center Systems segment may see a 2.6% increase and touch $175 billion mainly driven by an anticipated rise of 5.6% in the global server market. The growth across global server market will be driven by ""aggressive build-out of cloud computing platforms by companies"" including Amazon (NASDAQ:  -  ), Alphabet (NASDAQ:  -  ) aka Google and Microsoft (NASDAQ:  -  ).The Communication Services segment is likely to witness growth of 1.7% and reach $1.41 trillion. Spending on Devices is projected to remain almost flat at $589 billion.Apart from providing estimates for 2017, the IT research firm also provided forecasts for 2018, which according to it will mark another year of growth. For 2018, Gartner predicts worldwide spending to reach $3.55 trillion, marking growth of 2.6% from the 2017 estimated level.Enterprise Software segment will continue to lead with 7% anticipated growth, while IT Services, Data Center Systems and Communication Services segments will witness a respective increase of 4.7%, 1% and 1.3% in spending. Spending on Devices will continue to remain flat.However, it should be noted that despite projections of growth in 2017 and 2018, overall IT spending will remain below the 2014 level of $3.8 trillion.Over the last one and a half years, worldwide IT spending has been hit hard by global concerns such as a persistent decline in  , slowdown in the Chinese economy and a strong U.S. dollar against major currencies. Additionally, last year's events like the hype over Brexit, the U.S. Presidential election and the Fed rate hikes also made organizations tighten their spending on IT.Nonetheless, the recent forecasts provided by Gartner depict that this year may witness a revival in overall spending, primarily led by Software and IT Services segments.So, it will be prudent to shift your focus to Software and IT Services stocks that still hold promise.

"Straight off the bat, I'll state that I'm a supporter of  (NASDAQ:  ). In my opinion, it has a strong business, very competent leadership, and best of all - location, location, location! Investors have considerable difficulty buying into a great company in a less than stellar industry. FEYE stock, on the other hand, is a direct play on cybersecurity. That's somewhat of an important issue, you might say. Source: On the surface level, FireEye stock has all the right components of a proper investment.But InvestorPlace contributor Dana Blankenhorn is spot on when he states that FEYE ""lives on the bleeding edge of computer security. It should be a great place for FEYE stock to live, but that's  what it can deliver what the market wants."" So far, the markets have voted with their wallets, and the overall picture is hardly inspiring.We have to consider that FEYE stock was once threatening to carry a triple-digit price tag. Now, FireEye stock can be acquired for less than a prime-time movie ticket. Furthermore, Mr. Blankenhorn points out that what ""customers prefer are the solutions of  (NYSE:  ), which focuses on security as a service, built around its own firewalls, the Wildfire Threat Intelligence cloud and an endpoint protection system called Traps.""Even there, neither PANW nor FEYE are in the clear. Blankenhorn states that the 90-9-1 rule - essentially, that the market leader takes most of the spoils, and the rest are fighting for survival - will always pressure any competitor in cybersecurity. Currently, Palo Alto has better intelligence in their products, which is a plus against FireEye stock. However, cyber attacks are  . The question of which company provides a better security platform can, and will, change rapidly.That issue brings the competitive environment of FEYE stock into focus. As InvestorPlace writer Tom Taulli bluntly states, competition is ""  for the cybersecurity market."" Some of the top names fighting for the scraps are  (NASDAQ:  ),  . (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ). Taulli further notes that some ""mega tech companies have also moved aggressively into the space, such as  . (NASDAQ:  ). But perhaps the biggest threat is from the startups, which have the benefit of a flush venture capital market.""The bottom line here is that any screw up or any missed opportunity can set a player back years. In cybersecurity world, that's a lifetime.  (NASDAQ:  ) offers a cautionary tale of what can happen when complacency overrides adjusting to consumer trends. Certainly, it's not an enviable position to be in.So is there any light at the end of the tunnel? I believe that there is. The other three-word mantra of what makes a good business is ""people, people, people."" And guess what? FEYE has some of the best people in this rough and tumble sector.At the top of the foodchain is CEO Kevin Mandia, a renowned name within the industry. His career began as a security officer in the United States Air Force, and later as a cybercrime investigator in the Air Force Office of Special Investigation.Taulli gave a resounding endorsement of his qualifications when he wrote that ""Mandia has a  of deep experience with the technical aspects of cybersecurity and also how to build successful companies. So regarding the product line, a key part of his strategy is to offer more affordable solutions so as to cater to smaller customers.""Let's also not forget that FEYE stock is backed by still-robust fundamentals. It has impressive reach with its service and product lineup. According to its latest quarterly earnings report, the company tacked on 287 new customers, 47 of which were for high-roller amounts exceeding $1 million. Revenue is also chugging along at an impressive rate despite the newness factor of FireEye stock wearing off.Of course, no matter what anyone says, FEYE stock is a risky proposition.Click to EnlargeThese are shares that, since its first full year as a publicly traded entity, returned a pathetic average loss of 34%. Adding to the concerns, the returns progressively worsen - 2014 lost 24%, 2015 shed 33%, and last year, FEYE gave up nearly 46%.But here's something to chew on - the choppiness has definitely eased in the past three years. I say that because in 2014, the spread between the absolute high and low of the year was 292%. The following year, the margin was 180%. Last year, it was just under 107%.For some, that's still too wild. However, the math is clear. FireEye stock is definitely stabilizing.On a qualitative basis, I think this is an exciting juncture for the company. They might be in a tussle with Palo Alto and other competitors, but who isn't fighting? There's never going to be a perfect situation. That said, as a contrarian opportunity, I think it'd be remiss not to consider FEYE stock. It's in the right industry with the right people - all they need is the right opportunity.That's a bet I think most people are willing to take.The post ) Stock Backs up the Hype? appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Is 2017 Finally the Year FireEye Inc (FEYE) Stock Backs up the Hype?@2017-01-16@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-2017-finally-the-year-fireeye-inc-feye-stock-backs-up-the-hype-2017-01-16
"Cybersecurity stocks have taken a hit over the past few years, but there has been one company that has made that bearishness look downright placid -  (NASDAQ:  ). Source: FEYE stock has lost value for the past three years, and now trades a long way from its all-time high of $85 in early 2014.Indeed, FEYE has many issues. There's the drastic slowdown in sales, the abrupt departure of the CEO last year and, of course, the intense competitive environment. Not the least of which is FireEye's meandering transition to the cloud and its hesitancy to adopt next-generation technologies.In light of all this, is it any wonder that FEYE stock has been so terrible? Nope.But when it comes to investing, there are often nice opportunities with contrarian plays. So might this be the case with FireEye stock? Well, to see, let's take a look at three pros and three cons: It does seem overblown that FEYE stock is headed for near oblivion. The fact is that the company still has an impressive business, with a wide array of products and services. In the latest quarter, FEYE added  and there were 47 that entered into transactions in excess of $1 million. The total customer account is over 5,000 and more than 940 are on the Forbes Global 2000. As for revenues, they came to $186.4 million in the most recent quarter. In all, there is $926.2 million in the bank. Consider that the market cap of FEYE stock is only about $2.2 billion. CEO Kevin Mandia has wasted little time in making serious restructuring efforts. Then again, he is one of the top influencers in the cybersecurity industry. He  as a security officer and then as a cybercrime investigator in the Air Force Office of Special Investigation. After these stints, he went into the private sector, having worked at various firms like Sytex, and also co-authored two well-regarded books. Then he went on to launch Mandiant in 2004, eventually  in 2014.In other words, Mandia has a rare blend of deep experience with the technical aspects of cybersecurity and also how to build successful companies. So regarding the product line, a key part of his strategy is to offer more affordable solutions so as to cater to smaller customers. To this end, FEYE has launched FireEye Essentials. But, of course, another high priority is the cloud, which is part of the FireEye as a Service (FaaS) platform. Some of the recent product launches for this include Cloud MVX - which does not require a hardware appliance and is priced on a subscription basis - and MVX Smart Grid (this is for those companies that prefer on-premise approaches, such as in industries like financial services and healthcare).Then there are other important tools like the FireEye Security Orchestrator, which manages threats and responses across massive organizations. As a testament to its power, a government agency made a seven-figure purchase of the software during the  . More than ever, we rely on core technologies that are becoming essential to everyday living. No doubt, there is the ubiquity of smartphones and wearables. But with the Internet of Things, there is the growth in technology for autos, homes and even medical devices. Protecting these systems from cyberattacks is only getting more complicated. As a result, the growth for the industry is likely to remain strong for the long haul. According to a report from  , the global spending is expected to jump from $73.7 billion in 2016 to $101.6 billion by 2020. The deceleration of the top line has certainly been dramatic. During the first quarter of 2015, revenues soared by  . Yet for the latest earnings report, there was only a 13% gain. Keep in mind that FEYE expects the situation to get even worse. The guidance for the fourth quarter is for revenues of $187 million to $193 million, which would translate to an increase of  . It's important to note that a big part of the reduction has come from the transition to a subscription business model, which means not as much revenue can be recognized up front. Despite this, there is little doubt that FEYE has been losing momentum. That's why the company has focused on restructuring its operations. It's intense for the cybersecurity market. Just some of the top operators include  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NYSE:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ). But some mega tech companies have also moved aggressively into the space, such as  (NASDAQ:  ). But perhaps the biggest threat is from the startups, which have the benefit of a flush venture capital market. The fact is that a technology lead can easily disappear - and it can be very tough to regain it. A prime example of this is  (NASDAQ:  ), which relied too long on its antivirus franchise and did not make enough investments to refresh its product offering. FEYE has been a consistent money loser. True, this is fairly common throughout the cybersecurity industry. But then again, losses become much more of a problem when sales are rapidly falling! Unfortunately, there are no signs that FEYE will hit profitability anytime soon. For the current quarter, analysts expect a net loss of 16 cents a share. The company has made progress with reducing costs, yet as  James Brumely  : ""… an even closer inspection reveals that relative improvement almost entirely came from the $10.7 million reduction in R&D spending - a cost cut that may come back to haunt the company in the long run.""Tech turnarounds are always difficult, and many fail. But again, FEYE has a CEO with a strong background and is making smart decisions. Actually, the company is already starting to see positive results.Besides, the valuation is fairly reasonable. Consider that FEYE stock trades at about three times its sales. By comparison, both PANW and  (NASDAQ:  ) sport multiples of about eight times sales.OK then, should you buy FEYE stock now? I think so, given that it looks like a good value play on a growth industry.The post ) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 Cons appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Should I Buy FireEye Inc (FEYE) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 Cons@2017-01-12@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/should-i-buy-fireeye-inc-feye-stock-3-pros-3-cons-2017-01-12
" is set to report fourth-quarter 2016 results on Jan 19. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 4.12%. Notably, Check Point Software has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice while matching the same once in the trailing four quarters. It has an average positive earnings surprise of 3.55%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.We believe that Check Point Software will continue to benefit from strong demand for cybersecurity solutions. Note that the financial well-being, brand image and reputation of enterprises and governments are always exposed to the risk of cyber threats. Consequently, cybersecurity has become a mission-critical, high-profile requirement.With rapid technological advancement, organizations are increasingly adopting the ""bring your own device"" (BYOD) policy to enhance employee productivity with anytime/anywhere access. This trend, in turn, calls for stricter data security measures.Moreover, various independent research firms had forecasted strong demand in 2016. Gartner had forecasted that worldwide Information Security Spending would reach $81.6 billion in 2016, marking year-over- year growth of 7.9%.We believe that Check Point Software must have capitalized on this opportunity and this may well be reflected in the company's results in the to-be reported quarter.Furthermore, the rapid adoption of Check Point's data center appliances and the continuous enhancements in data center product lines are expected to provide adequate support to revenue growth. Additionally, the company's continuous share buybacks bode well for investors.However, competition from Cisco, Juniper Networks and Fortinet  , an uncertain economic environment and currency headwinds remain concerns.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Check Point Software will beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at $1.15. Hence, the difference is 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . Check Point Software carries a Zacks Rank #1. Though Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 increases the predictive power of ESP, the company's ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. | Here are a couple of companies which, as per our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Seagate Technology Plc  , with an Earnings ESP of +1.87% and a Zacks Rank #1.

ike many providers in the data security market, both  (NYSE: PANW) and a primary competitor  (NASDAQ: CHKP) were glad to put 2016 in the rearview mirror. In many ways, 2016 turned out to be the year that wasn't for data security providers.Tighter IT budgets and longer sales cycles were the likely culprits. But with the number of large security breaches of late and sky-high market expectations -- one report suggests a combined $1 trillion will be spent on cybersecurity over the next five years -- the best is yet to come. So, Palo Alto or Check Point?Image source: Palo Alto Networks.There was a lot to like, and quite a bit not to like, about last quarter. On the upside, Palo Alto's $398.1 million was a 34% increase from a year ago. An indication that Palo Alto's push to drive subscription and service sales is gaining steam was its 69% improvement in deferred revenue year over year to $1.4 billion.Palo Alto's record deferred revenue, according to CFO Steffan Tomlinson, was the result of customers buying into hybrid cloud software-as-a-service (SaaS) solutions, which in turn drives recurring revenue subscriptions and services. So why is Palo Alto stock down by double digits since sharing quarterly results?Investors and pundits alike have overlooked Palo Alto's continual losses and spending because of its 50% plus top-line growth. Not only have revenue gains slowed, based on Palo Alto's mid-range guidance of $429 million for this quarter, which would be a 28% improvement, but it will continue. The revenue easing is more difficult to ignore given Palo Alto's spending.Last quarter, operating expenses soared to $346.7 million, up a jaw-dropping 39%. Combined with Palo Alto's 28% increase in cost of revenue to $101.2 million, it spent $118.8 million more than a year ago. And it gets worse. Sales and marketing costs -- not research or the development of new solutions -- equaled 55% of total revenue. That's nothing more than buying sales.Image source: Check Point Software.Check Point CEO Gil Shwed has long been a staunch supporter of managing overhead, which in turn has helped boost bottom-line results as it did again last quarter. Check Point's $428 million in sales in its third quarter was a 6% improvement compared to the prior year. That may not sound like much, but there's more to the Check Point story.Thanks in part to adoption of Check Point's security platform solution, its subscription revenue has been steadily climbing. Third-quarter subscription sales jumped 24% to $99 million, nearly a quarter of Check Point's total revenue. That solid revenue foundation, which is getting stronger with each passing quarter, is part of the reason Check Point doesn't need to spend indiscriminately to generate sales gains.Check Point's operating expenses climbed 11% in the third quarter while cost of revenue inched up just 6%. In terms of sales expense relative to revenue, Check Point spent just 24% in the quarter, less than half what Palo Alto did. Check Point's expense diligence combined with its ongoing share buyback initiative -- it repurchased 3.2 million more shares last quarter -- helped it post $0.99 earnings per share, equal to a 7% improvement. Excluding one-time items, Check Point's EPS jumped 9% to $1.13.To sum up, the difference between the two is that despite Palo Alto's top-line growth far exceeding that of Check Point's, its stock is down 15% since announcing earnings. Check Point's stock has been much more stable, matching its pre-earnings results of $64.56 a share.Growth investors with a high-risk tolerance may see Palo Alto's nosedive as an opportunity, and there's substance to that, with so much market potential in the coming years. Check Point shareholders aren't likely to see wild spikes or declines because of its more conservative business approach.Which is the better buy? Check Point's stringent expense management and its emphasis on growing EPS and subscription revenue earn it the nod.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

" is one of the technology companies that demonstrated remarkable share price performance in the last six months. The stock has surged roughly 20.6%, outperforming the Zacks categorized  industry's gain of 12% in the same time frame.We believe that the company's restructuring initiatives, which include divestment of certain assets and acquisitions, have reinstated investors' confidence in the stock. Notably, over the last several quarters, Symantec's top and bottom line were under pressure due to persistent weakness in PC sales, which particularly hurt its core Norton Anti-virus software business. Apart from this, intensifying competition from Palo Alto Networks  , FireEye Inc.  and Check Point Software  eroded its market share in the enterprise segment.To counter the downside, the company singularly focused on restructuring its business. In doing so, on Jan 29, 2016, Symantec closed the sale of the Veritas business to Carlyle Group for $7.4 billion. We believe that the deal provided Symantec with much needed funds to continue expanding its product portfolio as well as its presence in the fast growing markets.Symantec also completed the acquisition of Blue Coat, which will enable it to reduce its dependence on the PC market and strengthen its position in the enterprise security space. Revenues from the enterprise security segment are now expected to contribute 62% to the company's top line.We expect these restructuring initiatives and acquisitions to contribute significantly to this cybersecurity stock's overall growth.It should be noted that the company has posted impressive results in back-to-back quarters. For the last reported quarter, the company posted in-line earnings while revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. We were also encouraged by the company's overall performance as it exceeded the guidance on all metrics.Further, Symantec's guidance for the full year as well as third quarter were encouraging wherein it expects strong revenue and margin improvements.Going ahead, investment in growth areas such as Enterprise Backup, Storage Management and Security businesses are expected to boost Symantec's long-term prospects.

yber security is going to be in the news over the next week or so. The Congressional hearings into the hacks of the Democratic National Committee e-mail server and that of Clinton campaign chair John Podesta begin today, with the public version of the intelligence community’s reports being made available on Monday.These reports and hearings may or may not prove beyond reasonable doubt that Russia was involved in the attacks, but regardless of whether or not you believe that to be the case, the fact is that both servers were compromised. Add in the  from Yahoo concerning their massive security breach and you have an atmosphere where cyber security is sharply in focus, and that should benefit stocks in the sector.Some may say, and with some justification, that any further revelations of security lapses could have the opposite effect. It seems that despite the best efforts of the cyber security industry, the criminal elements still have the upper hand, and can penetrate any defense the industry sets up. What that ignores, though, is the fact that for corporations who handle sensitive customer data, which is pretty much every modern company, perception is reality.Even if they have their doubts as to the effectiveness of security measures, they have to be seen to be taking the problem seriously, and that means spending money on it. Furthermore, that dynamic doesn’t only apply to the private sector. President-elect Trump has already stated his intention of launching a large cyber security initiative, and an injection of Federal dollars into the industry would also help.The problem for investors though is that despite the industry’s obvious potential, it has been, to date, an area of underperformance. In many cases, particularly with the U.S. companies in the sector, there has been decent revenue growth but rapidly increasing costs have left firms losing money, and the stocks have suffered as a result.Some of those costs have come from stock related compensation to attract top talent in the competitive jobs market in Silicon Valley, but companies such as FireEye () and Palo Alto Networks () have also been investing heavily in new security suites and platforms.Both FEYE and PANW have the advantage of being government certified, and if Trump does go forward with his cyber security push, those investments over the last year or so should pay off handsomely as 2017 unfolds. It is reasonable to assume, given Trump’s “America First” stance in the election, that U.S. companies will be awarded any Federal contracts that result from those policies, which is why I prefer FEYE and PANW to other, maybe more obvious picks in the industry.The two big Israeli companies in the field, CyberArk () and Check Point Software (), for example, both have the advantage of being proven profit makers and have a history of beating market expectations for earnings. By contrast, FEYE is still seeking its first profitable quarter as a public company and PANW has missed expectations in each of the last four quarters.For those reasons I would not put anybody off of CYBR and CHKP as a way to play the sector. As I said above, though, my preference would be for the two domestic names. Both will be in line for Federal contracts and both have been investing heavily. Now looks like the time to cash in on that investment.Whether or not you agree with that assessment, the most important thing for investors is that you have exposure to the sector. Any combination of the four stocks mentioned above or a broader based play such as the ETFs  or  will work, but some exposure is definitely warranted as the subject gains increasing attention.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Two Cyber Security Stock Picks For 2017@2017-01-05@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/two-cyber-security-stock-picks-2017-2017-01-05
"espite similarities, cybersecurity companies  (NASDAQ: FEYE) and  (NASDAQ: CHKP) are decidedly different in a number of ways.First, a quick look at the similarities. Both provide a comprehensive suite of data security solutions, including recent additions to address the growing number of companies shifting information to the cloud. Both companies are also in the midst of transitioning to a subscription-based, recurring-revenue model that should translate to reduced expenses over time. It simply costs less to service existing customers than to rely solely on driving new, one-time sales of products.That said, there are also some glaring differences between FireEye and Check Point that are worth considering before investing in either.Image source: Check Point.Unlike FireEye and other peers, Check Point CEO Gil Shwed hasn't sacrificed the bottom line by spending indiscriminately, which is what made last quarter a bit of an anomaly. Check Point's total operating costs climbed 11% year over year to $221 million, thanks to a 15% increase in selling and marketing expenses.Generally, Shwed is fairly tight-fisted when it comes to spending, but, similar to FireEye, Check Point's expense increase was a mere blip on the radar to grow its subscription sales. The difference is that Check Point's overhead equaled just 52% of its $427.6 million in revenue last quarter, compared to FireEye writing checks for $111.34 million more than it generated in sales.The result, and a common theme with Check Point, was a nearly 8% improvement in earnings per share last quarter to $0.99, despite posting ""just"" 6% year-over-year total revenue growth. As for Check Point's recurring revenue initiatives, sales of its subscription software blades climbed 24% to $98.6 million.Now toss in software updates and maintenance revenue of $192 million, and more than two-thirds of Check Point's sales last quarter were non-product-related. And working with some of the industry's biggest players, Check Point is making an all-out effort to gain market share in the cloud via its vSEC and R80 security solutions.The answer boils down to investors' risk tolerance and long-term objectives. For growth investors comfortable with near-term non-profitability who have the stomach for share-price swings, FireEye takes the prize. But for those in search of a steady, proven performer that will consistently report profitable quarters, Check Point is a no-brainer.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"orldwide IT spending is projected to total $3.46 trillion in 2017, a 2.7% increase from $3.38 billion in 2016, as per a recent report from information technology research and advisory firm, Gartner Inc.  .If this happens, the year will mark a solid recovery in IT spending after two consecutive years of decline. Notably, in 2015 and 2016, worldwide spending declined 5.5% and 0.6%, respectively.Worldwide IT spending forecast provided by Gartner indicates major technology trends across, IT services, hardware, software and telecom markets. The firm has been providing forecasts for more than a decade and organizations have been using its reports to make critical business decisions.Although the recent forecast is 0.2% lower than its previous projection of 2.9% growth, John-David Lovelock, research vice president at Gartner is confident that year 2017 is ""poised to be a rebound year in IT spending"".According to Lovelock, the growing adoption of cloud, blockchain, digital business and artificial intelligence are driving IT spending and may even push it beyond the projected 2.7% growth. However, he opines that due to some political uncertainty in global markets various enterprises might adopt a ""wait-and-see approach"" and ""forestall IT investments"".Per its latest report, every IT segment will witness growth in spending with Enterprise Software leading the way. It may witness a 6.8% rise this year and reach $355 billion.It will be followed by the IT Services segment, which is anticipated to register 4.2% growth in spending and reach $938 billion. The growth is expected to be mainly driven by increased investments digital business, intelligent automation, and services optimization and innovation, which will be partially offset by broad economic challenges.Spending across Data Center Systems segment may see a 2.6% increase and touch $175 billion mainly driven by an anticipated rise of 5.6% in the global server market. The growth across global server market will be driven by ""aggressive build-out of cloud computing platforms by companies"" including Amazon  , Alphabet  aka Google and Microsoft  .The Communication Services segment is likely to witness growth of 1.7% and reach $1.41 trillion. Spending on Devices is projected to remain almost flat at $589 billion.Apart from providing estimates for 2017, the IT research firm also provided forecasts for 2018, which according to it will mark another year of growth. For 2018, Gartner predicts worldwide spending to reach $3.55 trillion, marking growth of 2.6% from the 2017 estimated level.Enterprise Software segment will continue to lead with 7% anticipated growth, while IT Services, Data Center Systems and Communication Services segments will witness a respective increase of 4.7%, 1% and 1.3% in spending. Spending on Devices will continue to remain flat.However, it should be noted that despite projections of growth in 2017 and 2018, overall IT spending will remain below the 2014 level of $3.8 trillion.Over the last one and a half years, worldwide IT spending has been hit hard by global concerns such as a persistent decline in  , slowdown in the Chinese economy and a strong U.S. dollar against major currencies. Additionally, last year's events like the hype over Brexit, the U.S. Presidential election and the Fed rate hikes also made organizations tighten their spending on IT.Nonetheless, the recent forecasts provided by Gartner depict that this year may witness a revival in overall spending, primarily led by Software and IT Services segments.So, it will be prudent to shift your focus to Software and IT Services stocks that still hold promise.

"ext-gen firewall vendor  (NYSE: PANW) shed nearly 30% of its value over the past year due to ongoing concerns about its slowing sales growth, widening losses, and rising competition. But as Palo Alto hovers near its 52-week low, investors might be tempted to start a position in this high-growth stock. However, I believe that the stock could still fall further for five main reasons.Image source: Getty Images.Palo Alto currently trades at 8 times trailing sales. That's a high P/S ratio compared to many of its cybersecurity peers --  (NASDAQ: FTNT) trades at 4 times sales,  (NASDAQ: FEYE) trades at 3 times sales, and  has a P/S ratio of 4.With the market hovering near all-time highs and big investors rotating out of the tech sector toward energy and financials, tech stocks with high valuations and zero GAAP profits or dividends (like Palo Alto) could be highly exposed to big sell-offs.Palo Alto posted 34% year-over-year sales growth last quarter, but that represented its slowest growth rate since its 2012 IPO. Analysts expect the company to post 31% sales growth this year, compared to 49% growth last year. That slowdown has been attributed to slower enterprise spending, competition in the perimeter security space, and a market shift from on-site appliances to automated solutions and subscription-based software and services.To stay competitive in that market, Palo Alto launched its Next-Generation Security Platform to bundle together natively integrated technologies, automated protection solutions, and threat intelligence sharing solutions on a scalable platform for businesses.However, rivals like Fortinet and FireEye are also expanding with similar bundled plays. Fortinet offers an integrated security platform which bundles additional security services with its firewall, and FireEye recently unveiled Helix, which bundles its threat prevention services together under a single user interface.  (NASDAQ: CSCO) also bundles next-gen firewalls and other security tools with its networking hardware and software -- making it tough for stand-alone players like Palo Alto and FireEye to stay competitive.Palo Alto's bottom line growth initially looks solid -- its non-GAAP net income rose 66% annually to $51.2 million last quarter. But on a GAAP basis, its net loss widened from $39.9 million to $61.8 million. That disparity was mainly caused by its stock-based compensation (SBC) expenses, which rose 55% annually last quarter and gobbled up 29% of its revenues.High SBC expenses are common in the competitive Silicon Valley job market, but that puts Palo Alto at a clear disadvantage against non-Silicon Valley rivals like Israeli firewall vendor  (NASDAQ: CHKP) -- which spent a mere 5% of its revenue on SBC expenses last quarter. But if Palo Alto cuts jobs and SBC expenses, as FireEye is currently doing, it could eventually be outgunned by its rivals' better-funded R&D and sales teams.If Palo Alto shares were considered undervalued, we should see lots of insider buying. However, insiders actually sold nearly 900,000 shares over the past six months without buying a single share on the open market. Many major executives, including CEO Mark McLaughlin, sold large positions when the stock hit the $140s earlier this year.Insiders have plenty of reasons to sell their shares, but those sales seemingly contradict the two-year $500 million buyback plan the company announced in late August. But as I noted in a  , that buyback plan is likely aimed at offsetting the share dilution from its big stock bonuses instead of tightening up its earnings per share.Palo Alto Networks might  like a great growth stock, but its sales growth is slowing down and analysts' rosy projections for 32% annual earnings growth over the next five years are based on its non-GAAP earnings.Palo Alto is still a ""best in breed"" player in the crowded cybersecurity market, but its stock could keep falling if it doesn't counter its competitors in the security platform market and get its costs under control.

nce investors' darling in the cyber security space, things have not been in favor of  for a while now. The stock is likely to close in the red once again this year, continuing its downfall for the third consecutive year.On the very first day of its trade on the Nasdaq (Sep 20, 2013), the stock closed at $36, which was 80% higher than the Initial Public Offering (IPO) price of $20. The company ended the year 2013 on a strong note with its share prices increasing to $43.61.FireEye's shares shot up to as high as $86 in Feb 2014 on rumors of its merger with privately-held security software firm, Mandiant. However, shares fell drastically as the deal didn't materialize and never went even close to the Dec 31, 2013 closing price. In 2014, the stock lost almost 28%.The downfall continued in 2015 too with shares of FireEye declining 34%. Notably, at yesterday's closing price of $11.82, the stock has lost 67% from its first day trade and 41% from its IPO price.So far this year, FireEye has lost 43% compared with the Zacks categorized  industry's average negative return of just 6.3%.Over the past several quarters, the company has been losing business to its rivals. FireEye faces stiff competition from other well-established players in the cyber security space which includes Cisco  , Check Point Software  and Palo Alto Networks  . These players have deals with large numbers of security vendors and have broader product portfolio, giving them a competitive advantage over FireEye.Furthermore, the company's top-line growth has also been affected due to its futuristic approach toward transitioning itself to the cloud and shifting its business model from hardware centric to subscription-based services. It should be noted that the company generates higher initial sales from hardware than the subscriptions.Due to the aforementioned factors, the company's top-line growth rates have been slowing down as evident from its last quarterly results. During third-quarter 2016, FireEye's year- over-year revenue growth rate slowed down to a meager 12.6% from 45.6% and 165.1% registered in third-quarter 2015 and 2014, respectively. Additionally, the company's revenue growth guidance of just 1% to 4% for fourth-quarter 2016 reflects its limited growth prospects.Furthermore, the company's bottom-line results failed to please as well. Since Sep 2013 when it was debuted on the stock markets, the company has not been able to report profits in even a single quarter. In fact, FireEye's GAAP loss has widened on a year-over-year basis.Going ahead, negative operating cash flow remains a major headwind for FireEye, which may hinder the execution of its growth plans. In the first three quarters of 2016, the company generated negative operating cash flow of $21.5 billion. Considering the projections given by FireEye for the fourth quarter, the company is expected to end 2016 with a negative operating cash flow between $41 million and $51 million.To counter the aforementioned challenges, FireEye has taken a number of initiatives. Early this year, it acquired iSIGHT Partners to strengthen its current product lineup and offer an intelligence-led security model for enterprises of any size that other security providers will find difficult to match.FireEye has also taken over Invotas, a firm specializing in improving response times post a cyber-attack. Its product, Security Orchestrator, is designed to compile information from a range of security products and automate responses when an incident occurs.The company has launched FireEye Essentials, a lower-cost and simpler version of the FireEye Global Threat Management platform. It is targeting smaller, mid-market companies with the new offering.Furthermore, last month it has launched new Cloud MVX and MVX Smart Grid offerings, a lower cost intelligent threat detection solution for large enterprises as well as mid-market businesses.Also, FireEye is focusing on cost cutting initiatives, which include the layoff of 300 to 400 workers to boost its bottom-line performance. Through these initiatives, it intends to generate annualized cost savings of approximately $80 million.Though shifting its business model to subscription-based services will generate lower revenues initially but the same will be stable in the long-run as organizations usually renew their subscriptions with the existing products or even with higher versions. Moreover, subscription-based services generate higher gross margins.All these indicate FireEye's efforts to move beyond the enterprise level and end-point protection products it had started off with. These factors are also likely to aid the company's long-term results.We believe that the company's turnaround efforts will yield results in the long run. Given the positive earnings estimate revisions over the last 60 days and its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), we are optimistic about FireEye's recovery in 2017.You can see  .In addition to the recommendations that are available to the public on our website, how would you like to follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time?Our experts cover all kinds of trades… from value to momentum . . . from stocks under $10 to ETF and option moves . . . from stocks that corporate insiders are buying up to companies that are about to report positive earnings surprises.

"espite similarities, cybersecurity companies  (NASDAQ: FEYE) and  (NASDAQ: CHKP) are decidedly different in a number of ways.First, a quick look at the similarities. Both provide a comprehensive suite of data security solutions, including recent additions to address the growing number of companies shifting information to the cloud. Both companies are also in the midst of transitioning to a subscription-based, recurring-revenue model that should translate to reduced expenses over time. It simply costs less to service existing customers than to rely solely on driving new, one-time sales of products.That said, there are also some glaring differences between FireEye and Check Point that are worth considering before investing in either.Image source: Check Point.Unlike FireEye and other peers, Check Point CEO Gil Shwed hasn't sacrificed the bottom line by spending indiscriminately, which is what made last quarter a bit of an anomaly. Check Point's total operating costs climbed 11% year over year to $221 million, thanks to a 15% increase in selling and marketing expenses.Generally, Shwed is fairly tight-fisted when it comes to spending, but, similar to FireEye, Check Point's expense increase was a mere blip on the radar to grow its subscription sales. The difference is that Check Point's overhead equaled just 52% of its $427.6 million in revenue last quarter, compared to FireEye writing checks for $111.34 million more than it generated in sales.The result, and a common theme with Check Point, was a nearly 8% improvement in earnings per share last quarter to $0.99, despite posting ""just"" 6% year-over-year total revenue growth. As for Check Point's recurring revenue initiatives, sales of its subscription software blades climbed 24% to $98.6 million.Now toss in software updates and maintenance revenue of $192 million, and more than two-thirds of Check Point's sales last quarter were non-product-related. And working with some of the industry's biggest players, Check Point is making an all-out effort to gain market share in the cloud via its vSEC and R80 security solutions.The answer boils down to investors' risk tolerance and long-term objectives. For growth investors comfortable with near-term non-profitability who have the stomach for share-price swings, FireEye takes the prize. But for those in search of a steady, proven performer that will consistently report profitable quarters, Check Point is a no-brainer.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

With the holiday season officially upon us, a month of eating, drinking and spending is sure to have its consequences. But that doesn't mean you choice in stocks to buy for 2017 has to be detrimental. Source: Now is the time to buy a gym membership, get some healthy recipes on the go and get your portfolio in shape to prepare for the resolutions you are bound to make come midnight on Dec. 31 - lose weight, live a healthier life and most importantly, make more money.While the first two may be a bit harder to come by and much easier to fail, making more money can be easily done with a well-balanced portfolio in 2017.With that in mind,  (NYSE:  ),  (NYSE:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ) are four of the best stocks to buy for 2017.Here's a look at why you should consider buying these four stocks ahead of the New Year.Mostly, though, there are a good set of tailwinds for BAC stock going forward. It's a bit overextended here after the post-election run, but it sports an average valuation for its peers with a price-to-earnings of 14 on next year's earnings.Banking stocks have had a rough few years as tighter regulations and ultra-low interest rates have weighed on their profits. However, better days are on the horizon for the financial sector as an improved economy, imminent interest rate hikes and GOP dominance in Washington are all good signs for U.S. banks.BAC is likely to be one of the largest beneficiaries of the improved conditions in the financial sector, making it a top pick for 2017 stocks to buy.Most agree that an interest rate increase is coming next year, and Bank of America will make around  worth of interest income on its deposits should those predictions come true. This should give BAC stock a significant boost next year.Athletic apparel maker Nike has had a difficult year and the firm's share price has fallen 19% since the beginning of January. However, NKE's dominance in the industry and solid financials make now a good time to add the firm to your portfolio.The consumer discretionary sector will likely see a lift in the coming year as an improving economy will give people extra spending cash. Should a downturn occur, investors need only look at Nike's performance during the recession in the early 2000's. When many larger firms went out of business, NKE was able to stay afloat and even increased its dividend payments.Not only is Nike one of the best stocks to buy as far as the consumer discretionary sector goes, but the stock may also become a great income investment. Currently, NKE's dividend yield is just 1.42%, but the company has a proven track record of consistently increasing dividend payouts.Investors can expect dividend increases to continue as well, because the firm's payout ratio is just 30%.This year was a big year for cybersecurity firms after several high-profile hacking attacks prompted everyone from big businesses to independent homes to get a better handle on their internet security.While there are quite a few big name security firms to choose from, CHKP is one of the best cybersecurity stocks to buy because the company has focused on underserved markets like mobile security and the internet of things, and the firm has proven itself to be cost-conscious and financially sound. Check Point is also much cheaper than many of its rivals with a price-to-earnings ratio of 20.7%.CHKP pays much lower salaries and stock bonuses than most of its competitors. Check Point's operating expenses rose to 52% percent of its total revenue in the most recent quarter, marking a quarter of big-time spending for the firm. However, compared to its peers like  (NYSE:  ), whose expenses equal a whopping 86% of its revenue, CHKP is a very conservative firm.Not only that, but its location is in Israel, where cybersecurity has been a priority; this gives the company an edge.NFLX went from being a must-have tech stock to losing nearly 10% of its value earlier this year after its earnings report when it was unable to add as many subscribers as it initially planned.However, this dip in the Netflix share price is one of the reasons it's one of the best stocks to buy, especially considering that next year is set to be a big one for the streaming service. Netflix has partnered with  (NYSE:  ), which will be a big-time benefit when it comes to content. The partnership means that NFLX will be able to make many of the nation's biggest blockbusters available on its platform each month.Adding Disney content to its repertoire means that Netflix has a much stronger value proposition and will likely be able to lure even more people into subscribing. Not only that, but there is  that the Disney deal may give the firm the ability to raise its prices. All of these factors are likely to improve shareholder sentiment in the coming year and bring NFLX stock much higher.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@The 4 Best Stocks to Buy for a Market-Beating 2017@2016-12-06@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-4-best-stocks-to-buy-for-a-market-beating-2017-2016-12-06
"ver the past few years, the surge in data breaches worldwide has boosted bullish interest in the cybersecurity industry. However, many cybersecurity stocks have stagnated or faltered over the past year due to slowing sales growth, low profitability, high valuations, and rising competition.Image source: Getty Images.The  , which owns a basket of  , has advanced less than 3% over the past 12 months, underperforming the S&P 500's 6% gain. To see if these stocks can bounce back, we should identify some key trends which could affect the cybersecurity sector in the coming year.More than 5.3 billion records were lost or stolen during data breaches over the past three years, according to the Breach Level Index. 52% of respondents in CyberEdge Group's 2015 Cyberthreat Defense Report believed that their companies could be hit by successful cyberattacks within the year.Bigger companies are slowly responding to these threats, but  's 2016 Annual Security Report found that only 29% of small to medium-sized businesses used basic security tools to prevent breaches.  (NASDAQ: SYMC) also found that three quarters of all monitored websites had exploitable vulnerabilities.Those weak security measures, combined with the growing number of unsecured IoT (Internet of Things) gadgets on the market, could result in more  in the coming year.Image source: Getty Images.As more data breaches occur, companies will need to prioritize cybersecurity spending. Lloyd's and Juniper Research estimate that the global cost of handling cyberattacks will surge from $400 billion in 2015 to $2.1 trillion in 2019 -- indicating that demand for ""best in breed"" cybersecurity services will rise over the next few years.The Trump Administration plans to develop a new national cybersecurity plan to counter attacks from foreign hackers. This means that higher spending from government agencies could boost revenue at government-certified cybersecurity firms like  (NASDAQ: FEYE) and  (NYSE: PANW) , as well as the cybersecurity arms of defense companies like  .However, President-elect Trump faces a tough uphill battle to restore confidence in the government's cybersecurity capabilities -- three-quarters of respondents in Passcode's recent survey of digital security and privacy experts didn't believe that cybersecurity standards would improve under a Republican administration.Many cybersecurity companies post solid revenue growth, but only a few are able to generate consistent GAAP-adjusted profits. This is because many cybersecurity companies have weak cash flows, and use high stock-based compensation (SBC) to attract top talent.Those high expenses made Silicon Valley-based FireEye and Palo Alto unprofitable on a GAAP basis, and both companies have struggled to keep those costs under control. However, Israeli cybersecurity companies like  (NASDAQ: CYBR) and  (NASDAQ: CHKP) generally pay lower salaries and stock bonuses than their Silicon Valley counterparts, making both companies profitable by both non-GAAP and GAAP metrics.Looking ahead, investors should see if the Silicon Valley players can get their costs under control, and see if non-Silicon Valley cybersecurity firms can keep expanding and building competitive workforces.Many analysts believe that the fragmented cybersecurity market is on the brink of a major consolidation. Over the past few years, larger tech companies like Cisco, Symantec, and  have all beefed up their security businesses with various acquisitions.Cisco became a direct competitor to Palo Alto and FireEye with its purchases of Sourcefire and ThreatGRID; Symantec is evolving into an  with its purchases of BlueCoat and LifeLock; and IBM's purchases of Resilient, Lighthouse, and CrossIdeas bolstered its IT security capabilities.Smaller stand-alone service players like Palo Alto, FireEye, and CyberArk could find it tough to compete with these bundled solutions. But at the same time, these companies all have ""best in breed"" products -- Palo Alto's next-gen firewall, FireEye's threat prevention solutions, and CyberArk's privileged account management platform are all widely used by large companies.Therefore, it's more likely that bigger companies like Cisco, Symantec, and IBM will  these companies and their customers instead of trying to marginalize them. However, some of these companies' valuations might need to drop before they can be considered reasonable acquisition targets. For example, Palo Alto and CyberArk both trade at 9 times sales -- which is much higher than the industry average of 5 for software companies.Investors should be  picky with cybersecurity stocks in 2017. It's better to stick with companies like CyberArk, which have concrete profits, than companies like Palo Alto, which have robust revenue growth but weak control over their expenses.However, I believe that all investors should have some exposure to the cybersecurity market, which could experience very steep growth over the next few years as cyberattacks and data breaches escalate.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"Image source: Getty Images.Volatility and high-flying valuations are tech stock characteristics that cause some investors to avoid the sector entirely. However, that's painting with too broad a brush -- and a good way to miss out on some of the best opportunities on the market. While the dangers inherent to buying stocks priced for high growth and the threat of disruption in the broader space make some tech companies a poor fit for portfolios that aim to minimize risk, the sector also hosts standouts that any investor should consider.With the goal of identifying tech stocks that deserve a spot in any portfolio, we asked three Motley Fool contributors to spotlight their pick for a top stock in the space. Here's why  (NASDAQ: PCLN) ,  (NASDAQ: CHKP) , and  (NASDAQ: CSCO) made the list. : For years I believed that The Priceline Group was just another online travel site, so I couldn't figure out why its stock was always hitting new highs. That all changed in 2010, when I was finally educated about the business. I've since come to believe that this tech stock that belongs in every investor's portfolio.The Priceline Group has transformed itself into a market darling thanks to its  . The company has a long history of making smart acquisitions that have helped to power its revenue and profits higher for years on end.While you're probably already familiar with several of its brands -- think Kayak, Priceline, OpenTable, RentalCars, and more -- the majority of the company's profits come from Booking.com, the leader in the European hotel market. The company spent years to build out a large network of hotels, which have attractive customers who value selection. In turn, that has encouraged more hotels to sign up, creating an unbeatable competitive advantage.Looking ahead, Priceline looks well positioned to take advantage of the shift toward online travel. It also boasts a handful of partnerships that are likely to greatly benefit it over the long term. Since the global online travel market is estimated to be worth $492 billion (and growing), I  that this company's future looks bright. : With a wide range of investment styles and needs out there, picking a stock that looks to be a good fit for all investors is no easy task, but Cisco Systems has the makings of a top choice, thanks to its balanced components of value, growth potential, and returned income.Trading at roughly 13 times forward earnings estimates, the stock is priced far below both the network hardware industry multiple of 25 and the S&P 500's average forward earnings multiple of 18, and it's backed by a rock-solid balance sheet. As of the fiscal year ended July 30, Cisco had $65.8 billion in cash and short-term assets while holding $28.6 billion in long-term debt, and the company is adding to its balance each quarter thanks to strong cash flow.The company posted $12.42 billion in free cash flow in its last fiscal year, up roughly 20% over a five-year period, and strong cash generation is helping the company distribute and grow its dividend while also adding to the books. With an annualized payout of $1.04 and roughly 5 billion shares outstanding, the cost of distributing the company's dividend represents just around 42% of last year's free cash flow -- indicating room for continued growth. Even if near-term payout increases are small, its yield already sits at a chunky 3.3%.As the leader in the network hardware space, Cisco looks to benefit from the dramatic increase in data load and connected devices brought on by the Internet of Things. It's also building out its device connectivity platform and is poised to be a big player in the development of crucial IoT technologies and services. The company's core routing and switching business is under pressure, which is a key factor in the company's inexpensive valuation, but the stock has lots of room to run if IoT and other emerging business ventures continue to play out favorably. : Unlike many of its peers in the data security space, Check Point doesn't ""wow"" investors each quarter with 30% or 40% top-line growth. So why does Check Point stock belong in every tech stock portfolio? Because even the most aggressive long-term investor should consider a consistently reliable, continuously profitable stock, and that's exactly what founder and CEO Gil Shwed provides, quarter in, quarter out.Check Point once again delivered in its recently announced third quarter. Despite reporting ""only"" a 6% jump in revenue, earnings per share climbed 7% including one-time expenses, and an impressive 9% after factoring in costs. The increase in EPS over and above revenue gains is an ongoing theme of Check Point's and speaks to Shwed's strict expense management philosophy. That's something its unprofitable peers can't seem to grasp.Check Point's strategic objective of building recurring revenue stream via its data center, cloud, and enterprise security solutions is also gaining momentum. Last quarter, Check Point's product and license revenue grew just 1% to $136.9 million. But Check Point's subscription sales soared 24% compared with a year-ago to $98.58 million.The better news is that Check Point's initiative to increase its consistently reliable revenue streams will continue to rise after its 15% jump in deferred revenue to $889 million last quarter. Check Point lacks the flash of its competitors, but in an industry expected to generate $1 trillion over the next five years, it's one of the few data-security providers investors can rely on to deliver bottom-line results, each and every quarter.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

n Nov 24, 2016, Zacks  downgraded network security solutions provider,  to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Palo Alto Networks' stock has been on a downtrend ever since it reported dismal first-quarter fiscal 2017 results. Shares slipped 13.3% since the announcement. In fact, the company's stock price has been declining for a while now, as is evident from its year-to-date plunge of 20.7%.Coming to the first-quarter results, the company's adjusted loss per share (excluding amortization and other one-time items but including stock-based compensation), on a proportionate tax basis, was 58 cents. The figure was significantly wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 27 cents and the loss of 36 cents in the year-ago quarter.Though Palo Alto Networks' revenues of $398.1 million surged 34% year over year, it missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $400 million.The company also reported an adjusted operating loss of $38.7 million, which increased from a loss of $21.8 million suffered a year ago. Higher operating expenses (up approximately 38.7% year over year) impacted operating results.The company also provided a tepid second-quarter revenue guidance. For the second quarter of fiscal 2017, Palo Alto Networks expects revenues in the range of $426 million to $432 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $432 million.We believe that all the aforementioned factors led to downward revisions in Palo Alto Networks' estimates. Over the past seven days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2017 increased from a loss of $1.10 per share to loss of $1.12.Also, Palo Alto Networks has been witnessing an increase in operating expenses due to stepped-up investments in research and development, and marketing strategies, which have been offsetting the benefit of higher revenues.

"hough its stock price jumped about 4.4% since the company announced yet another solid quarter on Oct. 31,  (NASDAQ: CHKP) shares have since eased. In fact, some industry pundits have even lowered their already muted expectations for Check Point, suggesting that ""intensifying competition and an uncertain macroeconomic environment add to its [Check Point's] woes.""The Street's negativity toward Check Point is nothing new.

With that in mind, here are a few things that make Check Point worthy of consideration.Image source: .Image source:  .Check Point isn't alone in its effort to establish a consistent, ongoing stream of recurring revenue, which it accomplishes by selling its software-blade -- or data security modules -- subscriptions. And Check Point's growing annual recurring revenue is having a positive impact on earnings per share (EPS), before and after factoring in one-time expenses. Notably, the same cannot be said of Palo Alto Networks and others.Last quarter's $427.6 million in sales was ""just"" a 6% improvement over 2015's third quarter. To put that into perspective, Palo Alto Networks reported a 41% increase in sales a quarter ago, to $400.8 million, and is expecting over 30% year-over-year improvement this quarter. That's where many investors and analysts seem to stop in comparing the two industry stalwarts.But a closer look reveals that Check Point's $98.6 million in subscription sales in the third quarter was an impressive 24% jump from a year ago, and combined with the company's updates and maintenance revenue of $192 million, equaled 68% of total sales. That's a solid foundation for a consistent, reliable source of revenue, and it's growing.Due in large part to a boost in expenses related to growing its software-blade recurring-revenue sales efforts, Check Point saw total operating expenses climb to $221 million in its third quarter, representing 52% of its total revenue. For Shwed and team, that's akin to a Check Point spending spree, but a well-conceived one, given the long-term upsides of growing recurring revenue.By comparison, Palo Alto's overhead of $344.5 million last quarter equaled 86% of its $400.8 million in revenue. And there's little doubt that expenses as a percentage of revenue will be in a similar sky-high range when Palo Alto reports fiscal 2017 first-quarter results after the close Nov. 21.Yet Palo Alto stock is a consensus buy, with an average target price of $180.89 a share, or 13% above current levels. Check Point? Its stock is rated a hold, with a share price expected to climb less than 1%, to $84.11. Apparently, growing EPS 7% year over year including expenses -- as Check Point did last quarter, above its 6% revenue gain -- takes a back seat to revenue growth of over 30% at the expense of profitability, as is the case with Palo Alto.Check Point is not an appropriate investment alternative for everyone -- nor is any one stock, for that matter. Some investors and pundits have made abundantly clear their belief that what matters is double-digit revenue growth, regardless of how it's accomplished.Last quarter's ho-hum reaction to beating revenue target of $423 million and EPS guidance of $1.08 excluding one-time costs -- Check Point reported $1.13 -- says more about the Street than it does about Shwed and team. Even so, Check Point fills an investment niche its peers don't: a consistent, relatively predictable stock for investors who appreciate growing profitability.Even investors whose tolerance for risk is slightly higher than that of their conservative peers should give Check Point a good look. Almost every portfolio can benefit from at least one or two stocks that deliver bottom-line results quarter in and quarter out, and that describes Check Point to a T.

"ybersecurity firm  is reportedly one of the potential bidders for Tempe, AZ-based LifeLock Inc.  . The other potential bidders' names making the headlines are private equity firms, TPG Capital and Permira.The financial data provider, Bloomberg was the first to break the news on Nov 11 wherein it revealed that LifeLock is in talks with several parties and TPG Capital is one of them. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  has reportedly been hired by LifeLock for consultation about the sale.Per Bloomberg, the first round of bidding may commence this month and will value LifeLock at approximately $2 billion. Notably, since Bloomberg's last Friday report, shares of LifeLock have gained over 16% so far. | Founded in 2005 by Robert J. Maynard and Todd Davis, LifeLock offers identity theft protection services primarily in the United States. The company got itself listed in 2012 and currently has over 4.4 million customers. In June this year, Elliott Management Corp. unveiled that it owns 11% stake in the company.The company, under its consumer segment, protects subscribers through monitoring identity-related events, such as new account openings and credit-related applications. Under the enterprise segment, it protects customers through delivering on-demand identity risk and authentication information about consumers.Its customers include financial institutions, telecommunication and cable services providers, government agencies, technology companies, large retailers, automobile and mortgage lenders, and e-commerce providers.In our opinion, the acquisition will be a strategic fit for Symantec, which is trying hard to expand its business in the high growth areas of next-generation cybersecurity space. The acquisition will help Symantec enhance its capabilities in the identity protection services which is currently a major concern for almost every sector, be it financial institutions, retailers, technology companies, etc.Apart from this, the acquisition will broaden Symantec's customer base. The company has an existing customer base of over 65 million. Therefore, we consider that the buyout will not only enhance the value of Symantec's identity management platform but will also be immediately accretive to its top- and bottom-line results.Furthermore, Symantec has huge available cash to undertake the acquisition. At second-quarter fiscal 2017 end, the company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $5.619 billion. Therefore, it need not borrow from outside to fund the acquisition. | Of late, Symantec's top and bottom lines have been under pressure due to persistent weakness in PC sales and loss of market share in the data storage segment to other rivals. Additionally, intensifying competition from Palo-Alto Networks and FireEye has been eroding its market share in the enterprise segment.As a result, the company has been aggressively restructuring its business. In doing so, on Jan 29, the company closed the sale of its Veritas business for $7.4 billion to Carlyle Group. We believe that the deal has provided Symantec with much-needed funds to invest in the fast growing markets.The sale of the Veritas business provided Symantec with the financial flexibility to take the acquisition route to transform its struggling business. In August this year, the company completed the acquisition of Blue Coat, a leading web security solution provider, from private equity firm Bain Capital for a total cash consideration of $4.65 billion. Blue Coat's security solutions allow organizations to protect their web gateways from cyber-attacks.We believe that these acquisitions will enable Symantec to strengthen its position in the enterprise security market.However, it should be noted that the news is merely a speculation at this point. Therefore, it will be too early to judge the actual benefits of the acquisition for Symantec.Currently, Symantec carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).You can see  .A better-ranked cybersecurity stock is Check Point Software  , which carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The stock witnessed upward estimate revisions in the last 30 days and has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 3.55%.Today, you are invited to download the full list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 """"Strong Buy"""" stocks - absolutely free of charge.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets.

These reports have been hand-picked from among the roughly research reports issued by our analyst team today. You can see the complete list of  shares have gained more than 7% year-to-date, outperforming the peer medical devices space, on the back of the company's recent product launches and FDA approvals. The analyst likes the $1.1 billion acquisition of Heartware International, which is expected to significantly boost its Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure business, but worries about the company's sluggish spine business over the past few quarters. (You can  ) shares have lagged the insurance space this year, but the Zacks analyst thinks the company stands a good chance of taking leadership in the P&C space, benefiting from complementary products and services. Its inorganic growth story seems impressive and should help it achieve higher long-term ROE. A strong capital position helps Chubb to engage in shareholder friendly moves and invest in strategic initiatives that drive growth. However, the company's exposure to cat loss (estimates $200 million cat loss in fourth quarter from Hurricane Matthew) and a low interest rate environment are headwinds. The recent uptrend in long-term interest rates is beneficial to Chubb and others in its space. (You can  ) shares have been strong performers this year, but they have come under pressure in recent sessions as long-term interest rates have trended up following the election. The analyst emphasizes that the company has benefitted from new electric rates and above-average temperatures in its service territories. Moreover, Exelon is gaining from the Pepco Holdings acquisition, which contributed $130 million to its earnings in the reported quarter. However, Exelon is subject to the impact of commodity price volatility, and price fluctuation in the wholesale markets.

"he world is becoming increasingly connected through networks and data in an ecosystem governed by digital technologies which have created immense opportunities for individuals, businesses and organizations. The assimilation of mobile, IoT devices, cloud computing, and other high-tech solutions have changed the way people, businesses, organizations and governments connect and work.While the interconnectivity of devices and use of sophisticated technologies is positively changing the world, it is increasingly being challenged by cybercrime, clearly reflected by the steep rise in the number of cyber-related frauds and crime reported in the recent years.Cisco points out that, “Cybercriminals have refined their back-end infrastructures to carry out attacks in ways that increase efficiency and profits” and thus every industry, from financial services to entertainment, is vulnerable to such risks. In 2015, cybercrime ranked as the  reported economic crime. Increasingly frequent and precision-based cyber-attacks call for a stronger fortification against them.Cyber attacks can be categorized across various degrees. While some involve data breaches which exposes sensitive information like trade secrets, personal data, intellectual property, and other confidential information, others threats involve disabling software infrastructure, taking over systems, or denial of service.The total number of cyber security incidents reported in 2009 were 3.4 million while the number increased to 59.1 million in 2015, as per a PwC global . “The U.S. Federal Reserve detected more than 50 cyber breaches between 2011 and 2015, with several incidents described internally as ""espionage,"" according to Fed records” as  by Reuters. A recently released  by MetricStream reveals that 66.2% of financial organizations faced at least one cybersecurity attack in the last year.Popular retail houses such as Target and Home Depot have been victims of such activities resulting in loss of costumer data and credit card information. Not just companies, even individuals are prone to risk with an estimated an “estimated 556 million people falling victim to cybercrime annually” which translates to 12 people every second. These figures perhaps don’t reflect the exact situation as many cybercrime incidents either go unreported or undetected for a long time.Cyber attacks don't just result in losses of money or data, they also dent the reputation of the entity affected by the attack, culminating in the loss of trust among suppliers and customers. Attacks can also trigger regulatory or legality proceedings, negligence claims, and can lead to the loss of productivity and competitiveness, especially in cases of industry espionage which often go undetected. It is  that globally, cybercrime costs will touch $6 trillion annually by 2021, from $3 trillion in 2015.The race among the cyber criminals and cyber security providers is a tough and a challenging one. It is unbelievable how a computer node in part of the world can actually play mischief with bank accounts or get control of a company’s sensitive data, which may be in another part of the world.Given the growing incidence and sophistication of cyber-attacks, corporations and governments have increased allocations towards combating cybercrime. In fact, many have even resorted to insurance coverage for cyber liability. It is  that the cyber insurance market could grow to $5 billion by 2018 in annual premium and to at least $7.5 billion by 2020.The global spending on cybersecurity products and services for defending against cybercrime is projected to exceed $1 trillion cumulatively over the next five years, from 2017 to 2021 as per the  of Cybersecurity Ventures.In the U.S., President Obama laid great emphasis on cybersecurity as he identified it “as the most serious economic and national security challenge.” According to the Cybersecurity National Action Plan (CNAP), the U.S. administration  an investment of over $19 billion for cybersecurity as part of the President’s Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 Budget, representing a more than 35% increase from FY 2016 in overall Federal resources for cybersecurity.Microsoft  that by 2020, 4 billion people will be online, 50 billion devices will be connected and data volume will be 50 times great than it is today. It is also estimated that about 75% of infrastructure will be controlled by third party cloud or internet service providers. Thus, “As we look to the future, the explosion of connected devices and data flows are making it even more challenging to protect against advanced targeted attacks.”While this is a challenging situation, there lies great opportunity for companies operating in the field of cyber security, as they witness an increased demand for products which empower companies and institutions to fight the menace of cybercrime.International Business Machines Corporation (), Cisco Systems, Inc. (), Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (), root9B Technologies Limited (), Fortinet, Inc. (), Check Point Software Technologies Limited (), FireEye, Inc. (), Gigamon, Inc. () and Symantec Corporation () are some of the listed companies in the U.S. working actively on cyber security solutions. The increased competiveness within the space and the challenges thrown by hackers and cybercriminals are compelling these companies to stay ahead of the dark shadows looking to cast their spell.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@As Cybercrime Rises, So Does Spending On Cyber Security@2016-11-14@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/cybercrime-rises-so-does-spending-cyber-security-2016-11-14

" reported lower-than-expected first quarter of fiscal 2017 results.Palo Alto Networks reported adjusted loss per share (excluding amortization and other one-time items but including stock-based compensation), on a proportionate tax basis, of 58 cents. The figure was significantly higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 27 cents. The company had suffered a loss of 36 cents in the year-ago quarter.Though Palo Alto Networks' revenues of $398.1 million surged 34% year over year, it missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $400 million. The year-over-year improvement in revenues was primarily backed by strength in the network security market, a strong product lineup and deal wins.Product revenues jumped 11% to $163.8 million. The company saw a 57% surge in subscription and support revenues ($234.3 million). SaaS-based subscription revenues climbed 65% from the year-ago period. Support revenues increased 49% year over year.Geographically, on a year-over-year basis, revenues from the Americas increased 33% and represented 70% of total revenue. Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) also went up 32%, accounting for 18% of total revenue. Asia-Pacific was up 47% and brought in the balance.Also, customer wins coupled with expansion of the existing customer base supported quarterly revenues. Moreover, billings jumped 33% year over year to $516.9 million during the quarter.Palo Alto Networks' gross margin increased 120 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 74.6%, primarily backed by growth in both product recurring subscription and support gross margins.The company reported an adjusted operating loss of $38.7 million, which increased from a loss of $21.8 million suffered a year ago. GAAP operating loss during the quarter came in at $49.9 million compared with a loss of $32 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Higher operating expenses (up approximately 38.7% year over year) also impacted operating results.The company's adjusted net loss was $51.9 million, wider than a loss of $31.6 million reported last year. On a GAAP basis, net loss was $61.8 million compared with a loss of $39.9 million reported in the year-ago quarter.Palo Alto Networks exited the first quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $1.390 billion compared with $1.285 billion in the previous quarter.Receivables were $346.5 million compared with $348.7 million in the last quarter. Palo Alto Networks' balance sheet does not have any long-term debt. The company reported cash flow from operations of $203.3 million during the quarter. Free cash flow came in at $182.4 million during the quarter. During the quarter, the company repurchased 340k shares worth $50 million.For the second quarter of fiscal 2017, Palo Alto Networks expects revenues in the range of $426 million to $432 million, up 27% to 29% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $438 million. The company expects non-GAAP earnings per share within 61 cents to 63 cents (excluding stock-based compensation expenses).The company continues to expect fiscal 2017 non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $2.75 to $2.80. Revenues for the same period are expected to grow in the range of 30% to 31%. | Palo Alto Networks allows firms, service providers and government bodies to impose tighter security measures through its network security platform. The company reported wider-than-expected loss in the first quarter. Revenues also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company also provided a tepid forthcoming revenue guidance.Nonetheless, revenue growth seems to be steady, aided by strength across all its geographical regions and business segments. Also, customer wins coupled with expansion of the existing customer base are the other positives. We believe that the company's product refreshes will boost revenues, going forward.The company is also keen on expanding its cloud exposure. Nevertheless, a volatile spending environment and competition from Cisco Systems, Inc.  and Check Point Software Technologies Ltd.  remain concerns.Currently, Palo Alto Networks has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

 is set to report third-quarter 2016 results on Nov 3. Last quarter, the company posted a narrower-than-expected loss. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.FireEye, headquartered in Milpitas, CA, is a global provider of web, email, file and malware security to both enterprises and governments. Near-term prospects for the company are not very promising.We have recently noticed that FireEye is losing business to its rivals. In spite of witnessing year-over-year revenue growth, the top line has missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the four trailing quarters. On the other hand, rivals such as Check Point Software Technologies Ltd.  and Palo Alto Networks Inc. reported revenues that were not only higher on a year-over-year basis, but were also above the Zacks Consensus Estimate.The company has failed to impress on the bottom-line front as well. Since Sep 2013, when it was listed on the NASDAQ Stock Exchange, the company has not been able to report profits for even a single quarter.Nonetheless, FireEye's management has been trying hard to turn the business around. During first-quarter 2016, the company acquired iSIGHT Partners to strengthen its current product line-up and offer an intelligence-led security model for enterprises of any size that other security providers will find difficult to match.FireEye also acquired Invotas, a firm specializing in improving response times after attacks, during the quarter. Invotas' lead product - Security Orchestrator - has been designed to compile information from a range of security products and automate responses when an incident occurs.Furthermore, the company launched FireEye Essentials, a lower cost and simpler version of the FireEye Global Threat Management platform. It is targeting the smaller, mid-market companies with this new offering.These moves are important as they indicate FireEye's efforts toward moving past the enterprise-level end-point protection products it had started with. Also, these factors are likely to aid results in the to-be-reported quarter. | Our proven model does not conclusively show that FireEye is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in its upcoming release. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below.

Please check our  that enables you to find stocks that are expected to come out with earnings surprises. FireEye has a Zacks Rank #3. Though this increases the predictive power of ESP, the company's ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are a couple of stocks, which you may consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases:Stratasys Ltd.  , with an Earnings ESP of +41.67% and a Zacks Rank #1.You can see  .Asure Software Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +14.29% and a Zacks Rank #2.Beyond this Analyst Blog, would you like to see Zacks' best recommendations that are not available to the public?

hares of  spiked yesterday following the company's announcement of splendid third-quarter 2016 results, wherein its revenues and earnings topped its own expectations as well as the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Check Point's adjusted earnings per share (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets) of $1.01 came in ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 97 cents. Adjusted earnings also climbed 7.2% on a year-over-year basis, driven mainly by higher revenues and a lower share count, which were partially offset by higher operating expenses.On non-GAAP (excluding stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets) basis, the cybersecurity company posted earnings of $1.13 which were not only 8.7% higher than the year-ago quarter but way ahead of its own guidance range of $1.03 to $1.10. | Third-quarter revenues came in at $427.6 million, up nearly 6% year over year, and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $423 million. The figure was also close to the upper end of the company's guidance range of $405−$435 million (mid-point $420 million).Top-line growth was aided by sales growth of 9.6% in Products & Software Blades and 1.6% in Software Updates and Maintenance. The company also reported a 23.8% surge in subscription revenues at Software Blades.Check Point witnessed higher demand for data center and high-end appliances. Another factor contributing to overall growth was the increased number of large deal signings. While the number of new customers who signed deals worth $1 million or more was 65, that of customers who signed deals worth $50,000 and more contributed 73% to the total order value.Geographically, the Americas contributed 49% to revenues and Europe accounted for 35%, while Asia-Pacific, Japan, and the Middle East and Africa added the remaining 16%.On a year-over-year basis, adjusted gross profit (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets) increased 5.9% to $377.4 million, while gross margin remained flat at 88.4%.Adjusted operating expenses (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets) rose 12.9% year over year to $167.6 million as the company continued to make investments. The increase may also be attributed to higher research and development, and selling and marketing expenses as well as to acquisitions made over the past year. As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses increased 240 basis points (bps).Adjusted operating income (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets) came in at $210.3 million, up nearly 1% year over year. However, margins contracted 240 bps as a percentage of revenues mainly due to higher operating expenses.Adjusted net income (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets and other one-time items calculated on a proportionate tax basis) was $173.4 million or $1.01 per share, up from $171.1 million or 94 cents reported last year.Check Point exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and short-term investments of approximately $3.708 billion. During the first three quarters of 2016, the company generated operating cash flow of $740.1 million. Moreover, during the first nine months of 2016, Check Point repurchased $739.9 million worth of common stock.For the fourth quarter, the company provided a strong revenue and earnings guidance. It expects to generate revenues between $460 million and $490 million (mid-point $475 million). The guidance range at mid-point is slightly higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $474.6 million.Non-GAAP earnings are projected in the range of $1.20 to $1.28 per share. GAAP earnings per share are anticipated to be approximately 15 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.12 per share.Check Point Software reported better-than-expected third-quarter 2016 results, with both its top and bottom lines marking a year-over-year improvement. The year-over-year upside in the top and bottom lines was further encouraging. Buoyed by a strong quarterly performance, the company provided a robust outlook for the fourth quarter.Moving ahead, rapid adoption of Check Point's data center appliances and continuous enhancements in data center product lines are expected to provide ample top-line support. Additionally, the company's efforts on continuous share buybacks bode well for investors.However, competition from Cisco Systems Inc.  , Juniper Networks Inc.  and Fortinet Inc.  , along with an uncertain economic environment and currency headwinds, remain major concerns.Check Point currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

"ollowing  's(NASDAQ: FTNT) pre-announcement on Oct. 11 that it would miss management's revenue forecast, investors in  (NASDAQ: CHKP) had a right to fear the worst from their company's third-quarter earnings, which were reported Oct. 31. In the end, Check Point's revenue came in at the top end of guidance and earnings per share were ahead of the estimate, with CEO Gil Shwed claiming he hadn't seen any of the kind of lengthening in the sales cycle that Fortinet's management spoke of.Let's take a look at the earnings report.Starting with the headline numbers from the third quarter:The headline numbers were good, but on an underlying basis revenue was even better. I have three points regarding the numbers, but first, here is a chart of revenue share so you can see the relative importance of each revenue stream:Data source: Check Point Software Technologies investor presentation.As with many companies growing software subscriptions (in this case Check Point's ""software blades""), there is a short-term hit to revenue growth. In Check Point's case this is because the price of the software blade is separated from the appliance product and then recognized on the balance sheet as deferred revenue over time. CFO Tal Payne disclosed that the net effect on revenue was $6 million to $8 million; in other words, revenue growth was arguably closer to 7.6% in the quarter.As you can see below, deferred revenue growth continues at a very strong clip, as does software-blade revenue. For reference, software-blade subscriptions made up 23.1% of revenue compared to 19.7% in the same period last year.Data source: Check Point Software Technologies investor presentation.It's important to recognize the importance of the shift to deferred revenue, because on a superficial basis revenue growth is slowing. In addition, as you can see below, revenue growth in products and licenses -- the key to future software updates and maintenance growth -- appears to be slowing. However, recall that as Check Point increases the software blades bundled with product appliances, it becomes less important to purely look at products and licenses sales growth.That said, overall revenue growth has clearly been slowing in recent quarters:Data source: Check Point Software Technologies investor presentation.Third, revenue growth came in at 6%, but non-GAAP operating income increased just 1.1%. Why?The answer lies in the margin compression caused largely by management increasing sales and marketing expenses in order to drive revenue growth. Check Point needs to do this in order to maintain its leadership position in the marketplace, and continue to grow its installed base. LHS = left-hand scale. RHS = right-hand scale.Wondering how 1.1% operating-income growth led down into 9% non-GAAP EPS growth? The answer is a reduced share count created by share buybacks.Check Point's management affirmed it hadn't seen any of the ""moderated spending environment, extended sales cycles and sales execution challenges "" spoken about by Fortinet's CEO Ken Xie during that company's . That suggests that Fortinet's troubles may well be company-specific. On the other hand, Check Point is aggressively increasing sales and marketing efforts -- at the cost of margin -- and revenue growth is expected. However, Check Point's underlying revenue growth is good, and the growth in deferred revenue should lead to plenty of revenue and cash flow in future.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@iShares Core MSCI EAFE ETF Experiences Big Inflow@2016-10-27@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ishares-core-msci-eafe-etf-experiences-big-inflow-2016-10-27

You can see the complete list of  shares have gained more than 7% year-to-date, outperforming the peer medical devices space, on the back of the company's recent product launches and FDA approvals. The analyst likes the $1.1 billion acquisition of Heartware International, which is expected to significantly boost its Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure business, but worries about the company's sluggish spine business over the past few quarters. (You can  ) shares have lagged the insurance space this year, but the Zacks analyst thinks the company stands a good chance of taking leadership in the P&C space, benefiting from complementary products and services. Its inorganic growth story seems impressive and should help it achieve higher long-term ROE. A strong capital position helps Chubb to engage in shareholder friendly moves and invest in strategic initiatives that drive growth. However, the company's exposure to cat loss (estimates $200 million cat loss in fourth quarter from Hurricane Matthew) and a low interest rate environment are headwinds. The recent uptrend in long-term interest rates is beneficial to Chubb and others in its space. (You can  ) shares have been strong performers this year, but they have come under pressure in recent sessions as long-term interest rates have trended up following the election. The analyst emphasizes that the company has benefitted from new electric rates and above-average temperatures in its service territories. Moreover, Exelon is gaining from the Pepco Holdings acquisition, which contributed $130 million to its earnings in the reported quarter. However, Exelon is subject to the impact of commodity price volatility, and price fluctuation in the wholesale markets.

ne of the most common value investing patterns is to hunt for stocks with a low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. That's because this basic measure of how much investors are spending for $1 worth of earnings speaks of undervaluation. The logic is simple - a stock's current market price does not justify its higher earnings and therefore leaves room for upside.But have you ever given it a thought that stocks with a rising P/E can also be worth buying. We'll tell you why.The concept is that as earnings rise, so should the price of the stock. As forecasts for expected earnings come in higher, strong demand for the stock should continue to push up its prices. After all, astock's P/E gives an indication of how much investors are ready to shell out per dollar of earnings.Suppose an investor wants to buy a stock with a P/E ratio of 30. This means that he is willing to shell out $30 for only $1 worth of earnings as he expects earnings of the company to rise at a faster pace in the future owing to strong fundamentals.So, if the P/E of a stock is rising steadily, it means that investors are assured of its inherent strength and believe that more positives are to come out of it.Also, studies have revealed that stocks have seen their P/E ratios jump over 100% from their breakout point in the cycle. So, if you can pick stocks early in their breakout cycle, you can end up seeing considerable gains.In order to shortlist stocks that are exhibiting an increasing P/E, we chose the following as our primary screening parameters.(These two criteria point to flat earnings or a growth trend over the years).(These two criteria show that price of the stock is increasing consistently over the said timeframes).(Here, the case for consistent price gains gets even stronger as it displays percentage price changes relative to the S&P 500).(A 20% increase in the price of a stock from the breakout point gives cues of an impending uptrend. But a jump of over 100% indicates that there is limited scope for further upside and that the stock might be due for a reversal).In addition, we place a few other criteria that lead us to some likely outperformers. Only companies with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) rating can get through. You can see  . High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity.Just these few criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to just 18.Here are five out of the 18 stocks: : This is a biopharmaceutical company withZacks Industry Rank in the top 39%.

"Chicago, IL - October 26, 2016 - Stocks in this week's article include  ,  ,  ,  and  .One of the most common value investing patterns is to hunt for stocks with a low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. That's because this basic measure of how much investors are spending for $1 worth of earnings speaks of undervaluation. The logic is simple - a stock's current market price does not justify its higher earnings and therefore leaves room for upside.But have you ever given it a thought that stocks with a rising P/E can also be worth buying. We'll tell you why.The concept is that as earnings rise, so should the price of the stock. As forecasts for expected earnings come in higher, strong demand for the stock should continue to push up its prices. After all, astock's P/E gives an indication of how much investors are ready to shell out per dollar of earnings.Suppose an investor wants to buy a stock with a P/E ratio of 30. This means that he is willing to shell out $30 for only $1 worth of earnings as he expects earnings of the company to rise at a faster pace in the future owing to strong fundamentals.So, if the P/E of a stock is rising steadily, it means that investors are assured of its inherent strength and believe that more positives are to come out of it.Also, studies have revealed that stocks have seen their P/E ratios jump over 100% from their breakout point in the cycle. So, if you can pick stocks early in their breakout cycle, you can end up seeing considerable gains.In order to shortlist stocks that are exhibiting an increasing P/E, we chose the following as our primary screening parameters.(These two criteria point to flat earnings or a growth trend over the years).(These two criteria show that price of the stock is increasing consistently over the said timeframes).(Here, the case for consistent price gains gets even stronger as it displays percentage price changes relative to the S&P 500).(A 20% increase in the price of a stock from the breakout point gives cues of an impending uptrend. But a jump of over 100% indicates that there is limited scope for further upside and that the stock might be due for a reversal).In addition, we place a few other criteria that lead us to some likely outperformers. Only companies with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) rating can get through. You can see  . High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity.Just these few criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to just 18.Here are five out of the 18 stocks: : This is a biopharmaceutical company with a Zacks Industry Rank in the top 39%. The stock has a Zacks Rank #2. : It is a provider of policy-based enterprise security and traffic management solutions. The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 39%. The stock has a Zacks Rank #2. : This Zacks Rank #2 company is a manufacturer and supplier of 4G semiconductor solutions. The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 11%. : The Zacks Rank #2 company is into the real estate business. The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 39%. : The company is into the production of silver in Mexico. It belongs to a Zacks Industry Rank in the top 24%.

" is set to report third-quarter 2016 results on Oct 31. Last quarter, the company posted in-line earnings. Notably, Check Point Software has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice while it has matched the same once in the trailing four quarters and has an average positive earnings surprise of 4.22%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.The heightened worries over increasing price competition in the cybersecurity space due to Fortinet Inc.'s  recent guidance cut have been swept away by better-than-expected results delivered by Proofpoint last week. This signifies that the challenges raised by Fortinet were company specific and are unlikely to impact the industry.Therefore, we believe that Check Point Software will continue to benefit through strong demand for cybersecurity solutions. Note that the financial well-being, brand image and reputation of enterprises and governments are always exposed to the risk of cyber threats. Consequently, cybersecurity has become a mission-critical, high-profile requirement.With rapid technological advancement, organizations are increasingly adopting the ""bring your own device"" (BYOD) policy to enhance employee productivity with anytime/anywhere access. This trend, in turn, calls for stricter data security measures.Moreover, various independent research firms forecast strong demand ahead. According to a Markets and Markets report, worldwide cyber security spending will reach $101 billion in 2018 and $170 billion by 2020. Gartner had earlier revealed that IT security spending peaked to $75 billion in 2015.We believe that Check Point Software is well positioned to capitalize on this opportunity and this may reflect in the company's to-be-reported quarterly results.Furthermore, the rapid adoption of Check Point's data center appliances and the continuous enhancements in data center product lines are expected to provide adequate support to revenue growth. Additionally, the company's continuous share buybacks bode well for investors.However, competition from Cisco, Juniper Networks and Fortinet, an uncertain economic environment and currency headwinds remain concerns. | Our proven model does not conclusively show that Check Point Software will beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 97 cents. Hence, the difference is 0.00%.Please check our  that enables you to find stocks that are expected to come out with earnings surprises. Check Point Software carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Though Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 increases the predictive power of ESP, the company's ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are a couple of companies which, as per our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Boyd Gaming Corp.  , with an Earnings ESP of +16.67% and a Zacks Rank #2.You can see  .NVIDIA Corp.  , with an Earnings ESP of +8.93% and a Zacks Rank #3.Beyond this Analyst Blog, would you like to see Zacks' best recommendations that are not available to the public?

yber security stocks have been on a torrid run with most of them hitting new highs lately thanks to the volley of cyberattacks and increased speculation of M&A activity. Additionally, an earnings beat by Proofpoint  last week swept away the negative sentiments in the industry built in by Fortinet's  profit warning and made investors confident about earnings results of other players (read:  ).As a result, two cyber ETFs -  and  - will be on investors' radar for the coming weeks as Q3 unfolds. Among some top players, Juniper Networks  is slated to release its earnings result on October 25 after the opening bell while Check Point Software Technologies  will post its results on October 31 before the opening bell. CyberArk Software  , FireEye  , Imperva  and Symantec  will release their quarterly reports on November 3. All these six stocks account for nearly 25% of HACK and 20% of CIBR.Given this, it is prudent to look at our Zacks model to find out any hidden gems that would fuel the performance of the industry and ETFs in the weeks ahead: has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an  of 0.00%, which makes surprise prediction difficult. The stock saw a negative earnings estimate revision of five cents over the past 90 days for the yet-to-be-reported quarter. However, it delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 2.34%. The stock has a VGM Style Score of B. (Please check our  that enables you to find stocks that are expected to come out with earnings surprises) has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, which makes surprise prediction difficult. Though Check Point delivered positive earnings surprises in the last four quarters, with an average beat of 4.22%, the stock saw negative revision of four cents over the past 90 days for the yet-to-be-reported quarter. The stock has a VGM Style Score of D. has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. However, the earnings surprise track over the past four quarters is good, with an average beat of 68.21%. The stock also witnessed a positive earnings estimate revision of three cents over the past 90 days for the yet-to-be-reported quarter. The stock has a VGM Style Score of C (read:  ). also has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. It saw negative earnings estimate revision of a couple of cents over the past three months for the to-be-reported quarter but delivered positive earnings surprises in the last four quarters, with an average beat of 10.12%. The stock has a VGM Style Score of C. has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +20.64%, indicating a reasonable chance of beating estimates this quarter. While the company delivered earnings surprises in two of the past four quarters with an average beat of 23.26%, its earnings estimate for the yet-to-be-reported quarter moved down by 18 cents over the past three months. The stock has a VGM Style Score of C (read:  ). has a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. Like many of its peers, it also saw its earnings estimates moving down by 7 cents for the yet-to-be-reported quarter. However, the earnings surprise history is good, with average beat of 6.07% for the past four quarters. The stock has a horrible VGM Style Score of F.It seems that cybersecurity stocks might not beat this earnings season though the overall tech sector is expected to post an earnings growth of 1.1% compared with 1% growth in the second quarter. As such, investors should maintain caution while trading in the cyber security ETFs in the weeks ahead (see:  ).Zacks' free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

"While it may seem like election coverage is the only thing hitting the airwaves these days, cybersecurity has stolen its fair share of headlines too.  (NYSE:  ), which was all set to buy  (NASDAQ:  ), just came out and said the massive breach may be enough to actually impact the deal. Meanwhile, The White House has publicly blamed Russia for a hack of the Democratic National Convention and said it would respond.This year was a big year for cybersecurity firms after several high-profile hacking attacks prompted everyone from big businesses to independent homes to get a better handle on their internet security. While there's nothing good about bad cybersecurity, this news does bode well for  (NASDAQ:  ). From an investment standpoint, these recent headlines confirm that cybersecurity is a good sector to bet on, while Check Point - one of the largest pure-play vendors in the world - remains one of the best plays in the space.Of course, firewalls can't stop every threat, so CHKP has developed a comprehensive solution to attacks known as unified threat management (UTM).In the recently reported second quarter, for example, CHKP stock introduced new optimized appliances that will provide organizations of any size ""the power to run advanced threat prevention capabilities, such [as] full inspection of encrypted data, without compromising performance.""That wasn't the only victory in the company's most recent earnings report, though; there were tangibles to applaud as well. While many companies are struggling to grow earnings - especially organically - Check Point posted solid, consistent growth. In Q2, earnings and revenue each grew by over 7%. Meanwhile, there's a laundry list of fundamentals to like: CHPK stock boasts a profit margin of 41% and a 20% return on equity, to name a few.Plus, as  recently pointed out, Check Point's CEO has marketing spend under far better control than its competitor  (NASDAQ:  ). Plus, the company boasts a strong balance sheet, which is always one of the most important factors I consider before committing to an investment.Despite these solid numbers, Check Point stock has been suffering lately. Shares of CHPK have slid over 13% in the last six months. That leaves CHPK stock at a good price, considering the megatrend it has at its back.Indeed, while 7% of the CHPK float is held short, short sellers have been backing off since the need for cybersecurity software continues to be evident.Indeed, the Yahoo hack and the DNC hack are hardly anomalies these days - they draw such media attention because they represent the ongoing threat everyone from individuals to corporations face in the digital world day in and day out.The post ) Is a Strong Buy appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Check Point Software Technologies Ltd.

"f you buy a stock when its price-earnings ratio is higher than its projected earnings growth rate for the year, then you're paying a premium for the stock. Yet many investors are willing to pay that premium if a company has a strong record of robust sales and earnings growth, or if it resides in a high-growth sector.Image source: Getty Images.One such company is  (NASDAQ: CYBR) , an Israeli cybersecurity firm that provides PAM (privileged account management) solutions that shield companies from insider attacks by hackers and disgruntled employees. Its stock currently trades at around $50 as of this writing, which translates to a trailing P/E of 65 and a forward P/E of 39.Those figures are pretty high relative to its projected earnings growth of 7% this year and 20% next year. Those multiples are also much higher than the average P/E of 29 for the business software and services industry. Let's see why investors are willing to pay a premium for CyberArk, and whether or not the stock is still worth buying at current prices.Unlike many of its cybersecurity peers, CyberArk is profitable by both non-GAAP and GAAP metrics. The company's non-GAAP net income rose 123% annually to $35.3 million last year, while its GAAP net income improved 158% to $25.8 million.It accomplishes this with more disciplined spending, especially in regards to stock-based compensation expenses, which are excluded from non-GAAP earnings. During the first half of 2016, CyberArk's stock-based compensation (SBC) expenses only claimed less than 8% of its revenues.By comparison,  's(NASDAQ: FEYE) SBC expenses gobbled up about 35% of its sales during the first half, while  '(NYSE: PANW) claimed about 30% of its sales in fiscal 2016. Neither FireEye nor Palo Alto is profitable on a GAAP basis.CyberArk's non-GAAP earnings growth is expected to slow to the single digits this year due to R&D for new products and an aggressive expansion of its sales team. That's where FireEye, Palo Alto, and other cybersecurity firms ran into trouble, but CyberArk's record of disciplined spending will likely keep it profitable.Most cyberattacks occur from external sources, which prompted many cybersecurity firms and larger IT companies to develop perimeter defenses like firewalls and threat detection systems. Fewer companies focused on countering internal threats with PAM solutions, enabling CyberArk to quietly become the biggest player in the niche market.CyberArk's customer list includes 40% of the Fortune 100 and 17 of the biggest banks in the world, and it is the only PAM solution certified by the U.S. Department of Defense. That ""best in breed"" reputation enabled it to secure PAM partnerships with large IT players like  and  . It also gave CyberArk the market clout to launch the C3 Alliance, a consortium of companies that integrate its PAM solutions into their own security platforms.Those tailwinds are generating robust sales growth for CyberArk. Its sales rose 56% in 2015, and analysts are anticipating 32% sales growth this year. However, that estimate could actually be conservative if data breaches continue surging and CyberArk's sales force expansion pays off.Worldwide cybersecurity spending could hit $1 trillion between 2017 and 2021 according to Cybersecurity Ventures. Meanwhile, the cybersecurity sector remains ripe for consolidation, with many companies like CyberArk dominating specific niche markets. (NASDAQ: CHKP) was reportedly in talks to acquire CyberArk earlier this year, but the rumors eventually faded. Nonetheless, CyberArk could still be a compelling acquisition target for perimeter players or bigger IT companies looking to dominate the PAM market with a single purchase. CyberArk's valuations look a bit lofty, but its enterprise value of $1.2 billion and its clean balance sheet still make it an attractive takeover target.CyberArk is a volatile stock which isn't for conservative investors. But if you believe that data breaches will continue rising, I strongly believe that CyberArk is one of the best plays in the sector. Its robust sales growth, consistent GAAP profitability, dominance of the PAM market, and attractiveness as a buyout target all indicate that it might be worth paying a premium for.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

ybersecurity firm  (NASDAQ: FTNT) has fallen 13% over the past month, with most of the decline occurring after it pre-announced its third quarter earnings on Oct. 11. The numbers initially looked decent -- the company expects revenue to rise 20% to 22% annually, while billings should improve 14% to 16%.Source: Fortinet is also selling more subscription bundles with its hardware to boost its gross margins. That effort has clearly paid off over the past two years.Source: Meanwhile, Research and Markets estimates that the  of security appliances will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 11.4% between 2016 and 2020, fueled by an increase in data breaches.While Fortinet's annual sales growth is slowing down, it's unlikely to drop to the single digits for the foreseeable future. With an enterprise value of $4.4 billion and a clean balance sheet, Fortinet could also be a lucrative takeover target for larger players like Cisco.I believe that Fortinet's lower valuation and consistent margin expansion make it a more compelling buy than Palo Alto. But I also believe that the market for firewalls and threat prevention solutions is a crowded one, and that Fortinet may struggle to keep pace with its larger rivals over the long term.Therefore, I would avoid Fortinet unless its sales growth accelerates again. Until that happens, Fortinet will likely remain under pressure as investors focus on higher-growth plays in the cybersecurity sector.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

"f the question of how much risk investing in  (NYSE: PANW) poses is asked of the 35 analysts who follow its stock, the vast majority would likely say not much. Of course, all stocks come with some measure of risk, but with a consensus ""buy"" rating and price target of $180.23 a share -- one analyst has gone so far as to estimate a whopping $215 -- pundits like what they see.That said, as with any stock that relies heavily on continuing to post top-line growth to fuel investors' good tidings, it doesn't take much to knock the Palo Altos of the world off their lofty perch. But how likely is Palo Alto to stumble in the coming quarters? The answer to that question will determine Palo Alto's level of risk.Image source: .Image source:  .Until this year, Palo Alto's revenue growth was off the charts. For nearly two straight years, Palo Alto posted revenue gains of over 50%.  (NASDAQ: FTNT) , one of Palo Alto's data security peers, has a nice quarterly sales jump of its own, boosting revenue 30% or more for the past year. But even that can't touch Palo Alto.The top-line revenue improvements slowed last quarter -- Palo Alto's fiscal 2016 Q4 - but a 41% year-over-year gain to $400.8 million is nothing to be ashamed of, and helps explain analysts' bullish sentiment. Sales had climbed 48% in Q3 to $345.8 million. But Palo Alto's good news doesn't begin and end with revenue growth.Palo Alto added some 3,000 new customers last quarter, and now boasts ""approximately 34,000."" The swelling client base is largely due to Palo Alto's next-gen security platform -- an end-to-end solution rather than a piecemeal approach -- and it's driving increases in recurring revenue. Palo Alto now generates more service sales, and the ongoing revenue that comes with it, than products. A positive trend that shows no signs of slowing anytime soon.The reason for Palo Alto's current valuation -- it actually has a larger market capitalization than consistently profitable  (NASDAQ: CHKP) -- is its history of soaring revenue gains, which far and away poses its biggest risk should it stumble. And investors may get a taste of that risk this November when fiscal 2017 Q1 earnings are announced.Forget the 50% plus revenue gains of the past, or even the company's more recent 40% plus improvements: Palo Alto's guidance for this quarter is $396 million to $402 million, equal to a 33% to 35% increase compared to a year ago. As if its forecast for this quarter weren't eye-opening enough given its historical gains, it's indicative of a trend, and not a good one.The risk -- and it's a very real one -- is if Palo Alto doesn't positively surprise Wall Street and posts ""just"" 35% sales growth, investors may start running for the hills. Worse still would be if Palo Alto's guidance for fiscal Q2 continues the quarterly revenue slide it's in the midst of.Unlike Check Point that can at least point to ongoing per-share earnings improvements quarter in and quarter out, just as it did again in Q2 by posting an 8% pop to $0.95, Palo Alto's bullish followers rely on swelling sales to justify its ongoing lack of profitability. When sky-high revenue growth disappears, what will Palo Alto bulls lean on then?Investors are also less likely to be tolerant of Palo Alto's inevitable slowing top-line growth if it continues to spend like there's no tomorrow. The risk lies in CEO Mark McLaughlin's unwillingness to alter Palo Alto's open checkbook policy, and when the sales are no longer through the roof, shareholders will get antsy and rightfully so.Cost of revenue climbed 38% last quarter to nearly $102 million, and operating expenses soared to $344.5, up 41% year over year. By comparison, Check Point's operating expenses inched up 5% in Q2, as did its cost of revenue.So, how risky is Palo Alto? It's teetering on the edge of slowing sales and skyrocketing expenses, and it doesn't get much riskier than that.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. And we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in-the-know investors!

"nvestors in Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd. (Symbol: CHKP) saw new options begin trading this week, for the November 18th expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CHKP options chain for the new November 18th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $72.50 strike price has a current bid of $1.10. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $72.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $71.40 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CHKP, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $76.40/share today.Because the $72.50 strike represents an approximate 5% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 73%.

If an investor was to purchase shares of CHKP stock at the current price level of $76.40/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $77.50. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 3.99% if the stock gets called away at the November 18th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CHKP shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd. , as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing CHKP's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $77.50 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $77.50 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

"Image source: Getty Images.Technology affects almost every area of modern life, and its far-reaching impact is only becoming more pronounced as a growing global middle class utilizes a range of new devices and services and the world becomes increasingly connected. With these big trends underway, the technology sector is home to stocks with some of the best growth potential on the market, and selecting strong tech companies can have a huge positive impact on your portfolio over time.With that in mind, we asked three Motley Fool contributors to identify a stock that deserves consideration for your portfolio this September. Here are the companies they picked. One tech stock that I think is worth buying today is  (NYSE: EPAM) , a provider of outsourced software, technology engineering, and digital content services.Companies of all shapes depend on EPAM to help them create custom applications or develop full software products that help keep their businesses humming. Those products are often considered to be mission-critical and are complex to create, so once a new client learns to trust EPAM, it tends to stay very loyal. In fact, EPAM's top 10 clients have been buying from the company for an average of nine years.EPAM has also done a great job at diversifying its customer base so it's not overly dependent on any one sector of the economy. The company's clients come from a variety of industries, like media and entertainment, life sciences and healthcare, travel, financial services, and more.What investors should love about this business model is that the need for EPAM's services is constant, so the company has tremendous insight into its future revenue and profit streams. EPAM estimates that almost 90% of its full-year revenue is predictable at the start of the year, which should give investors high confidence when management gives its guidance. That should bring a smile to investors' faces as the company is projecting currency-neutral revenue growth of 26% this year and earnings per share of at least $2.97. I think those numbers are highly achievable, as over the last five years EPAM's revenue growth rate has actually been closer to 33%.Over the longer term, Wall Street projects that EPAM will grow its profits by 20%, which is an impressive number for a company that is trading at only 19 times next year's earnings estimates. That makes EPAM Systems a great tech stock to consider buying. In an industry noted for its wild stock price fluctuations, data security provider  (NASDAQ: CHKP) bucks the trend. CEO Gil Shwed has no interest in forgoing bottom-line growth strictly to fund revenue gains of 30% or even 40% -- as Check Point's peers do.Last quarter was typical of what to expect from Check Point, which is why it's an ideal choice in September for slightly more conservative investors not interested in stock price roller-coaster rides. Check Point reported $423 million in sales last quarter, good for a 7% year-over-year improvement. Better still -- and a significant difference relative to Check Point's peers -- not only was the company profitable, but earnings per share (EPS) jumped 8% compared to 2015's Q2, and 10% after excluding one-time items.Digging a bit deeper exposes what differentiates Check Point even further from its ""spend at all costs"" competitors. Check Point's ongoing expense management was a key to its posting such strong EPS growth, even beyond its revenue gains. That's in contrast to  (NYSE: PANW) , whose total operating expenses last quarter soared to 86% of total revenue. Check Point, on the other hand, spent 52% of its $423 million in sales on overhead. Check Point's conservative management philosophy isn't right for all investors: Some are willing to take more risk on a stock that just may deliver ""the next big thing.""But for buy-and-hold investors who appreciate a strong management team, fundamentals that consistently deliver, and a stock that is cheap at just 15 times future earnings, Check Point is a sound tech stock to invest in this September. (NASDAQ: QCOM) stock has gained just 18% over the last five years, lagging far behind the  's increase of roughly 82% and the  's increase of roughly 114%, but the leading mobile chipmaker's comparatively slow growth, strong dividend profile, and opportunities in emerging segments could point to a buying opportunity.The company's sales and earnings have fallen over the last two years due to stagnation in the mobile market and turbulence in the company's licensing business, and concerns remain about competition from third-party rivals and mobile original equipment manufacturers increasingly opting to produce their own chips, but Qualcomm looks poised to be a major beneficiary of the growth in device connectivity known as the Internet of Things (IoT), with a recent survey from consulting group LexInnova identifying the company as the leader in high-value IoT patents. The company's expertise in low-power-consumption chips should help it ride momentum as the need for modems and sensors increases.On the returned-income side of things, Qualcomm has a great history of dividend growth, and the stock boasts a roughly 3.5% yield. The company has delivered payout increases for 13 years running, and its dividend has grown 146.5% over the last five years and 341.7% over the last 10 years, so investors can feel confident counting on continued payout increases.Priced at roughly 14 times forward earnings estimates, Qualcomm is a potential value play, and packs an attractive income component that strengthens the case for holding the stock long term.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

"Cybersecurity stocks the world over just got the best media coverage they could ever hope for. As Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton sparred at Hofstra University, millions tuned in, and subsequently, tuned out of ""Monday Night Football."" Ratings for the popular sports broadcast plummeted, possibly to the lowest level in its history. There will never be another day when cybersecurity stocks take precedence over football. And there has never been a time when the issue has been more important. Source: That much was obvious as digital defense solutions were one of the weakest issues overall for both presidential candidates. Hillary Clinton gave the most  , distinguishing cyber-attacks between independent threats and state-sponsored infiltration. Donald Trump, on the other hand, rambled on about a ""400-pound"" hacker, and his ten-year old son's computer skills. Despite that, millions of voters will not forget Clinton's email scandal, nor the recent cyber-attack against the Democratic National Committee.The reality is that digital warfare was a time bomb that exploded years ago, and we're just now catching on. No longer limited to identity theft for purely financial motivations, the online battlefield has extended to a litany of agendas. The exponential variables that exist today are a nightmare scenario for law enforcement agencies. At the same time, one industry's misfortune is another one's gain. Stable and well-capitalized cybersecurity stocks have tremendous tailwinds that they can wield to their advantage.Better yet, the world now knows that digital warfare is a ""big league"" problem. Here are three cybersecurity stocks that should upload huge gains in the markets.Click to EnlargeThanks to the hacking breach at  . (NASDAQ:  ), online threat intelligence and security solutions firm  (NASDAQ:  ) finally have some good news to celebrate.Last week, Yahoo executives acknowledged that a ""state-sponsored actor"" stole identifying information from 500 million user accounts in 2014. As the company has a superior security system in place, it's obvious that the broader threat is worse than realized. The implication is very positive for cybersecurity stocks, and FEYE is no exception.Immediately following the announcement, FireEye stock jumped up 5%. From there, it has continued to inch forward in the markets. However, investors generally have not been bullish. Year-to-date, FEYE is down 30%. In comparison, YHOO shares are up 28%, despite their horrible admission. Commonly cited concerns are the negative profitability margins, as well as dubiously leading in revenue underperformance. Most importantly to investors, FireEye has been on a decidedly bearish track since its initial public offering.All of these reservations are absolutely valid. Even if FEYE got up and running, it will likely be a choppy ride. That said, I think you have to treat cybersecurity stocks not just on individual merit, but on the direction of the industry. Companies like FireEye have a tendency to  . From an investment point of view, cybersecurity is only going to increase as a globally important issue.You can take that to the bank. And while I wouldn't necessarily share the same level of confidence for FEYE specifically, it's in a remarkably lucrative sector.Click to EnlargeIt has been a good month for  (NASDAQ:  ). The network security firm has won industry recognition for its superior breach-defense platform.In addition, FTNT benefited from a 41% year-over-year bump in security appliance shipments in the second quarter. That led to a 25% market share in the quarter, which further solidified FTNT as the world leader in security  . Finally, the presidential debate was a remarkable showpiece for Fortinet and all cybersecurity stocks.But just as digital threats are a constantly evolving risk factor, counteracting solutions must also demonstrate agility. This is where FTNT separates itself from several other cybersecurity stocks. Rather than focusing on a one-size-fits-all solution, Fortinet is positioning itself as an end-to-end services provider. As we've learned in recent times, cyber-attacks are not limited to a single motive or agenda. Thus, all digital applications - personal devices, networks and the cloud - are potential targets.Financially, FTNT is a stable organization. Top-line sales growth is among the best in the business, and the company has no debt. On the other hand, profitability margins are very low, leading to less-than-desirable earnings growth. That clearly hasn't bothered investors. Fortinet stock is up over 16% this year, and the trend looks strong. Unless something drastic were to occur, FTNT is setting itself up nicely for 2017.As cybersecurity stocks continue to hit the news cycle, Fortinet is one you want to keep on your short list.Click to EnlargeWhen it comes to counterterrorism and threat intelligence, there is no better prepared country than Israel. In addition, Israel is blessed with a highly educated workforce, and its companies are efficiently operated.These outside factors lend a significant boost of confidence towards the Tel Aviv-headquartered  . (NASDAQ:  ). Among cybersecurity stocks, CHKP is on the fast track to be the most valuable in the industry.That's a bold statement, but let's consider a few factors. First, Check Point chief Amnon Bar-Lev is a man that knows what he's doing. Rising through the ranks of the Israeli Air Force, Mr. Bar-Lev has been involved in defense systems all throughout his career. Second, the financial stability of CHKP stock is unreal. Margins are through the roof, return on equity is well above industry standard at 20% and Check Point has no debt.With all that being said, CHKP stock has seen better times. On a YTD basis, shares are down 5%. The slowdown in market value, however, should be viewed as a discounted buying opportunity. There aren't many companies that have leadership like this, regardless of sector. That cybersecurity stocks are in a very positive limelight is icing on an already gratuitous cake.If there's any investment to consider within online network defense, CHKP is it.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@3 Cybersecurity Stocks That Will Rise During the Election Season@2016-09-29@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-cybersecurity-stocks-that-will-rise-during-the-election-season-2016-09-29
 data by With strong leadership in place, a recurring revenue business model, and a happy employee base, Paycom easily qualifies as one of the best-run companies in tech. (NASDAQ: ATVI) has managed to stay at the top of the volatile video-game industry thanks to deft management and consistently prescient navigation of industry trends, earning a place on the short list of the best-run companies in tech. The company has not been without controversies over the years, and CEO Bobby Kotick has sometimes received the ire of gaming enthusiasts, but no other publisher has a better history of introducing and maximizing the value of new franchises over the past two decades.The company has mastered the difficult art of hit replacement -- introducing new series that strike chords with players as previous properties begin to lose their pull. Activision Blizzard has also kept decade-old properties including  and  alive as billion-dollar annual revenue generators. Recognizing that the company had fallen behind in the fast-growing and increasingly important mobile segment, Activision management made the decision to acquire King Digital at a premium price of $5.9 billion. The move put more debt on the company's books, and how exactly the acquisition will play out in the long term remains to be seen, but the acquisition has given the company a rapid growth path in mobile that also creates synergistic opportunities in its traditional business. So far, it looks like the type of forward-thinking management that has propelled the company through the yearsStock performance can't always be taken as a great indicator of management quality, but Activision's gains are testament that the team running things has gotten a lot right through the years, with its share price increasing roughly 270% over the past five years and more than 550% over the past decade.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

"oth  (NASDAQ: FEYE) and  (NASDAQ: CHKP) have struggled a bit this year in terms of their respective stock prices. FireEye shareholders have really taken it on the chin in 2016, as its stock slowly rebounds from a post-second-quarter sell-off. To his credit, CEO Kevin Mandia and the FireEye board aren't sitting idly by while earnings continue to decline.Check Point stock is also in the red this year, though its 5% easing is just a blip compared with FireEye's 28% nosedive. On the other hand, Check Point is consistently growing its top and bottom lines, but its 7% year-over-year revenue gain last quarter pales in comparison with FireEye's 19% improvement. The cybersecurity peers are taking different paths to growth, making the question of which is the better stock to buy a relatively easy one to answer.Image source: .Image source:  .Similar to FireEye, Check Point's 21% increase in subscription and software blade sales -- and the licensing fees those represent -- were the driving force behind its 7% total revenue gain last quarter. Unlike its competitors, however, Check Point CEO Gil Shwed has a firm grasp on spending. Take FireEye's sales and marketing costs equal to 69% of sales, for example: Check Point spent just 25% of its $422.7 million in revenue on its sales and marketing teams.Shwed's stinginess is one reason Check Point was able to grow earnings per share 8% in its second quarter, and 10% after excluding one-time items. Though Check Point didn't share specifics, customer adoption of its new security appliance resulted in ""a marked increase in unit sales"" last quarter, which in turn helped pad its strong recurring subscription revenue.As for its stock repurchase plan, Check Point brought nearly 3 million shares back in-house last quarter, and it has board approval to repurchase $250 million more. The 100 million fewer shares outstanding this quarter compared with a year ago has boosted EPS and will continue to do so long into the future.Check Point's stringent cost controls and continued growth -- albeit slower than its competitors -- has also contributed to its rock solid balance sheet. Check Point has $1.3 billion in cash and short-term equivalents as of last quarter, $3.7 billion when longer-term marketable securities are tossed in, both up slightly over 2015. Not surprisingly given its spending, FireEye is bleeding cash with just shy of $917 million in ready funds compared with $1.17 billion a year ago, with no longer-term securities on the books.So which stock is the better buy? Given the uncertainty surrounding FireEye's much-needed restructuring and its off-the-charts spending, particularly when compared with the consistently profitable Check Point even without the ""wow factor"" its competitors enjoy, the answer is clear-cut: Shwed and team win by a country mile.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

hares of  (NYSE: PANW) have declined nearly 20% in 2016 because of ongoing concerns about its slowing sales growth and widening losses. However, I believe that the cybersecurity company could face even more pain ahead, because of five red flags.Source: That move should frustrate investors, since Palo Alto isn't using SBC because it lacks an adequate cash flow. At the end of the year, its full-year free cash flow rose 85% to $585.6 million, while its cash and equivalents position nearly doubled to $734.4 million. That means that instead of buying back stock to offset SBC, Palo Alto could be funding more of its employees salaries in cash or buying other companies to get its sales growth back on track.If a company's insiders believe that its best days are ahead, they typically buy their own stock. However, Palo Alto's insiders sold 5.53 million shares over the past 12 months but bought fewer than 886,000 shares. Over the past three months, insiders sold over 100,000 shares but didn't buy any shares.CEO Mark Mclaughlin, CFO Steffan Tomlinson, CTO Nir Zuk, President Mark Anderson, and Officer Ren Bonvanie sold over 82,000 shares in late August, shortly before the company's fourth-quarter earnings report knocked the stock down 7% on Aug. 31. Mclaughlin sold 70,000 of those shares.Wall Street falls out of love quickly with high-multiple stocks that are experiencing slowing growth. Palo Alto's P/S ratio of 9 isn't cheap relative to many of its cybersecurity peers, and these five red flags could limit the stock's upside potential. I still consider Palo Alto a best-in-breed cybersecurity play, but it could be tough for the stock to continue rallying as strong as it did over the past four years.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

"he last two days are a microcosm of the concerns surrounding  (NYSE: PANW) stock -- at least for investors without a cast iron stomach. From the middle of this month to Monday, Aug. 30's closing price of $143.50, Palo Alto shares had jumped 10% ahead of its fiscal 2016 Q4 and annual earnings news. Following its relatively sound quarter, Palo Alto stock opened the following day plummeting about 13%.Like last quarter, the problem is relatively strong revenue growth coupled with less-than-ideal guidance for fiscal 2017 Q1. So, what can Palo Alto do to break free of the ongoing rollercoaster ride -- its 52-week trading range is $111.09 to as high as $194.73 -- it has subjected its shareholders to the past year? If CEO Mark McLaughlin and team can deliver in a few key areas, Palo Alto will finally become the stock so many pundits and investors believe it can be.Image source: Getty.Palo Alto delivered a 41% jump in sales last quarter to $400.8 million, beating guidance of 36% to 37% improvement to a mid-point of $388 million. In fiscal Q1, Palo Alto expects a 33% to 35% jump in revenue to about $399 million. Playing the ""guidance game"" -- in which CEOs sacrifice short-term stock price hits based on forecasts it is fairly confident it will beat -- is nothing new, and this quarter has much the same feel to it.Is McLaughlin toying with forecasts to garner short-term gains after an earnings ""beat""? Only he knows, but it's consistent with Palo Alto's management approach: sacrifice long-term profitability -- or even a shift in that direction -- for top-line growth. Its history of sky-high revenue gains are why so many analysts have a love affair with Palo Alto, including a consensus $185 average price target and a ""strong buy"" recommendation.It's time to take a more structured, long-term view toward profitability and managed growth, rather than a ""growth at all costs"" mentality, even if that means Palo Alto takes it on the chin in the interim. In fact, one of Palo Alto's primary competitors is a case in point. (NASDAQ: CHKP) CEO Gil Shwed's disciplined approach to spending and management has translated to ""just"" single-digit revenue gains for over a year, including 7% in Q2. Check Point's slow-but-steady approach isn't going to deliver ""wow"" revenue growth each quarter. But it does increase profits and offers a lot less volatility.Check Point stock is down 6% this year; Palo Alto's is down 25%. And Check Point's 52-week trading range of $71.64 to $89.98 is nothing compared to Palo Alto's more than $80 one-year price spread. Palo Alto's spending soared again last quarter, though to its credit, not quite as much as its revenue grew. Total cost of revenue and operating expenses combined increased 40% to $446.2 million in Q4, compared to its 41% sales gain.One of Palo Alto's expenses in particular offers a world of opportunity to minimize overhead and, in turn, boost bottom-line results. The amount Palo Alto shells out each quarter for sales and marketing expenses to drive revenue, along with its share-based compensation, are exceedingly high. A full 66% of Palo Alto's $344.5 million in operating expenses -- equal to $228.1 million -- went to the sales and marketing teams. That translates to Palo Alto spending 59% of its entire quarterly revenue to get its message, and sales folks, out in the streets.With that kind of expenditure, Palo Alto should be generating at least 40% plus revenue each quarter. By comparison, Check Point's sales-related expenses were $107.6 million, equal to 48% of operational costs and about a quarter of its $422.75 million in sales in Q2.Palo Alto Networks can sell its services; it added nearly 3,000 or so clients sequentially last quarter. But managing those and other costs requires a long-term view with an eye toward profitably. When Palo Alto starts showing signs of progress in these key areas, rather than a focus on its quarterly revenue ""wow"" factor, shareholders will reap the rewards.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

n the surface,  (NYSE: PANW) looks like a great growth stock. The cybersecurity company's quarterly revenues rose an average of 54% over the past four quarters, and analysts expect it to post 47% sales growth for the year.However, the stock is actually down more than 20% this year thanks to the glaring differences between Palo Alto's  (adjusted) and  (unadjusted) earnings. Last quarter, Palo Alto's non-GAAP net income rose 88% annually to $38.5 million. But on a GAAP basis, its net loss widened from $45.9 million to $70.2 million. That disparity was caused by the company's biggest mistake of the year: failing to keep its stock-based compensation under control.Image source:  .Simply put, Palo Alto is enriching its employees at the expense of its investors.

 (NYSE: PANW) and  (NASDAQ: CHKP) are two of the largest firewall vendors in the world. The number of personal records exposed in data breaches worldwide doubled to 178 million last year, according to the Identity Theft Resource Center, indicating that business  be booming for both companies.Yet shares of Palo Alto and Check Point have declined 18% and 4% respectively since the beginning of the year due to concerns about slower enterprise spending and competition from bigger rivals. Will either stock bounce back in the near future? Let's examine their core businesses, growth, and valuations to decide.Source: But in terms of non-GAAP profits, which are used in analyst forecasts, Palo Alto's outlook is stronger. Analysts expect Palo Alto's non-GAAP earnings to improve 42% annually over the next five years, which gives it a 5-year price/earnings to growth (PEG) ratio of 1.2.Check Point's ea rnings are expected to rise 10% annually over the next five years, which gives it a higher PEG ratio of 1.7. This means that Palo Alto is still cheaper than Check Point relative to its non-GAAP earnings growth potential.Based on its sales, non-GAAP earnings growth, and valuations, Palo Alto is a more promising investment than Check Point. But as I mentioned in previous articles, Palo Alto's upside will remain limited if it can't reduce its  or buy  to maintain its long-term sales growth.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

 went down about 2.6% in after-hour trade yesterday in response to higher-than-expected loss reported for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.Also, higher operating expenses more than offset the benefits of robust revenue growth resulting in a wider year-over-year loss.

SaaS-based subscription revenues (part of service revenues) climbed 66% from the year-ago period.Geographically, on a year-over-year basis, revenues from the Americas increased 41% and represented 72% of total revenue. Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) also went up 41%, accounting for 17% of total revenue. Asia-Pacific was up 42% and brought in the balance.Also, customer wins coupled with expansion of the existing customer base supported quarterly revenues. Moreover, billings jumped 45% year over year to $572.4 million during the quarter.Palo Alto Networks' gross margin increased 80 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 74.6%, primarily backed by improvements in recurring services gross margin and revenue base.The company reported an operating loss of $45.4 million, which narrowed from a loss of $34.5 million suffered a year ago. Higher operating expenses (up approximately 41.1% year over year) also impacted operating results.The company's net loss was $54.5 million, wider than a loss of $46.1 million reported last year. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $46.2 million compared with $25 million reported in the year-ago quarter.Palo Alto Networks exited the fourth quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $1.285 billion compared with $1.08 billion in the previous quarter.Receivables were $348.7 million compared with $267.6 million in the last quarter.

The company reported wider-than-expected loss in the fourth quarter, while revenues comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Revenue growth seems to be steady, aided by strength across all its geographical regions and business segments. Also, customer wins coupled with expansion of the existing customer base positively impacted revenues. We believe that the company's product refreshes will boost revenues, going forward.The company is also keen on expanding its cloud exposure. Nevertheless, a volatile spending environment and competition from Cisco Systems, Inc.  and Check Point Software Technologies Ltd.  remain concerns.Currently, Palo Alto Networks has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

"Growth investors are notoriously fickle when it comes to earnings reports. Unbridled enthusiasm leads them to bid up shares of rising stars, only to stampede for the exits when the company fails to meet ridiculously high expectations.In many cases, it's not long before investors calm down and once again look at the company rationally. They reassess the longer-term outlook - the same story that probably got them excited about the stock in the first place - and bid shares right back up. Sometimes it doesn't even take an earnings miss to send shares crashing, but merely a change in the company's financial outlook. Lowered guidance may send analysts and shareholders fleeing, even if the company is still on a strong growth trajectory.So, when I see a best-of-breed company in one of my favorite long-term industries plummet after its earnings report, I get excited.Few firms have been as innovative in information security as  (  with its advanced detection technology and threat intelligence feed.Security advisory firm SSP Blue estimates global spending on information security could reach $170 billion by 2020, which represents nearly 18% compound annual growth from the $75 billion spent in 2015. Much of this growth is expected to be driven by the Internet of Things revolution and the shift to cloud-based storage, which present new challenges for companies in this space.In its 2016 analyst day briefing, FireEye reported its Multi-Vector Virtual Execution (MVX) engine has a 99% accuracy at reporting ""true positives,"" i.e., actual security threats, versus an accuracy rate of just 37% for competitor  (  ) and 26% for  (  ).Meanwhile, FireEye said products from competitors reported up to 246 times more ""false positives"" - warnings of nonexistent threats, which waste valuable time and resources - than FireEye products.[More from StreetAuthority.com:  ]It's not surprising that this kind of industry would attract rabid growth investors. Unfortunately, FEYE shares seem to attract the worst in herd mentality.The stock is notorious for its volatile performance around earnings, but upon closer inspection, a pattern has developed.FireEye has beaten earnings expectations by an average of 11% over the past 12 quarters but has seen its shares tumble on the release in 10 of the past 12 quarters. It seems a combination of strong growth and investor exuberance drives expectations and shares skyward ahead of the quarterly reports, irrational selling follows, and it starts all over again.Following the most recent earnings announcement, FEYE plummeted as much as 17.6% on Aug. 5. The company reported an adjusted Q2 loss of $0.33 per share, but this was better than the $0.39 loss analysts were expecting. While revenue came in below estimates, it jumped 19% year over year. FireEye also added 308 new customers during the quarter.The disappointment came as management lowered its guidance for full-year revenue by about $70 million and forecast a 2016 loss of $1.30 per share. This caused a number of firms, including  (  ) and Citigroup Inc (  ), to downgrade shares to ""hold"" or ""neutral.""Part of the company's problem over the most recent quarter was its position as a premium security consulting service. Management noted that fewer large-scale hacking events had been reported so far this year, which means customers may be more likely to gamble on cheaper products and services from FireEye's competitors.FireEye has decided to target mid-market customers by separating its MVX Engine into a customer premise-based sensor and a cloud-based threat subscription service. This will enable it to offer its cloud-based service at a lower price and compete for price-conscious clients.Management also announced a restructuring plan to cut $80 million from costs through 2017, including up to 400 layoffs.[More from StreetAuthority.com:  ]Even on the lowered guidance, the midpoint of $722 million for expected 2016 sales still represents growth of 16% over last year, while the expected full-year loss of $1.30 per share is an improvement over last year's loss of $1.61.Here's how to profit from FEYE's post-earnings pattern:Last week's sell-off is a familiar song - and one that could mean handsome profits for investors and traders.Long-term investors should come out ahead as double-digit sales growth eventually results in profits. Between headlines of hacking for political information and the constant reports of financial information breaches, digital security is sure to be one of the most promising industries of the next decade.Short-term traders are also presented with an opportunity to position themselves in shares now for a near-term rebound. Looking at price performance following quarterly earnings since the end of 2013, FEYE has closed an average of 10.4% higher two months after the reportBut since the stock is so volatile, I prefer to use a strategy that offers some downside protection. It's known as a covered call, and many of you may already be familiar with this simple and conservative strategy. If you're not, you can  .Basically, a covered call involves buying at least 100 shares of a stock and then immediately selling a call option against them to bring in additional income. By accepting this payment, you agree to sell your shares at a higher price (the option's strike price) if they are above this level when the option expires. The income from selling the call is yours to keep no matter what, so if the stock falls, the covered call trader is in a better position than the person who bought shares outright.[More from StreetAuthority.com:  ]With FEYE trading at $13.91 at the time of this writing, we can buy 100 shares and simultaneously sell one  , which is trading around $0.87 ($87 per contract, which controls 100 shares). This gives us a net cost of $13.04 per share, which is a 6.3% discount to the current price and a huge 22.2% discount to where shares were trading before the post-earnings sell-off.If the shares close above the $14 strike price at expiration on Sept. 16, our shares will be sold for that price. In this case, we will make $0.09 in capital gains, plus the $0.87 for selling the call. That gives us a total return of $0.96 for a 7.4% gain on our cost basis of $13.04. Because we'd earn that in 37 days, the annualized return works out to 73%.If shares fail to reach the $14 strike price on expiration, I would gladly hold them and sell another call option against the position each month until shares rebound and get called away. My guess is it won't be long before long-term growth has investors bidding the shares up again, and I think FireEye can be profitable as soon as the second half of next year.Growth in information security means this leader can endure these temporary growing pains to reward investors able to see beyond the knee-jerk reaction to earnings. Of course, while we're waiting for shares to rebound, we can continue to bring in income by selling calls.

"Image source: .Image source:  .Despite its consensus price target of $185 -- 44% higher than Aug. 9's closing price --  (NYSE: PANW) is facing challenges that its once skyrocketing revenue growth can no longer hide. Until Palo Alto recently announced fiscal 2016 Q3 revenue growth of 48%, it had been on a nearly two-year run of 50% or better top-line improvements.Palo Alto's stellar top-line gains masked the fact that its spending borders on reckless. Last quarter, Palo Alto's operating expenses jumped a mind-boggling 50%, and cost of revenue climbed 44%. Considering guidance for the current quarter calls for 36% to 37% top-line growth, Palo Alto's increasing losses can't be overlooked any longer.But there are alternatives in the fast-growing data security market that are better buys, including  (NASDAQ: CHKP) ,  (NASDAQ: CSCO) , and  (NYSE: IBM) .One of Palo Alto's primary competitors may seem like an odd choice as a better buy, but Check Point brings something to the table its peer is sorely lacking: a focused management team committed to minimizing overhead even as it continues to grow.Last quarter was typical of CEO Gil Shwed's long-term strategy of building a sustainable, subscription-based recurring revenue stream while managing spending. Sales improved a ""mere"" 7%, but thanks to the aforementioned emphasis on expense management, GAAP earnings per share, including one-time items, grew 8% to $0.95. Earnings rose 10% on a non-GAAP basis.Subscription revenue from Check Point's software blades jumped 21% in Q2 to $93 million and now represents 22% of total sales. Another measure of Check Point's success in building a foundation of recurring revenue was its 14% jump in deferred sales to $892 million. Check Point won't post 30%-plus jumps in revenue each quarter. That's not Shwed's plan. But its profitable, solid fundamentals and predictable slow-but-steady improvement make Check Point a sound choice.Though it may not be the first name that comes to mind in a discussion of data security stocks, Cisco is quietly making a name for itself. In a recent study conducted by NSS Labs, one of the data security industry's leading research firms, Cisco's Firepower 820 solution tested off the charts in both connections per second and effectiveness.Palo Alto entered two of its solutions for testing, and while it performed admirably, Cisco was at or near the top of the nine products tested in most every category. The better news for Cisco investors is that customers are taking notice. According to CEO Chuck Robbins, last quarter's 3% increase in total revenue to $12 billion was driven in part by a 17% year-over-year improvement in security sales.Going forward, Cisco should continue to enjoy double-digit gains in data security revenue because of its strategic plans for the fast-growing Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud markets. Making IoT gadgets and cloud hosting is nice, but the real opportunity lies with the data. Security is top of mind for many IT execs, and Cisco is becoming a solution of choice.As is the case with Cisco, IBM is in the midst of a transformation away from old-school enterprise hardware to cloud, data analytics, and cognitive computing. Data security is a key component of IBM CEO Ginni Rometty's ""strategic imperatives,"" and it's ahead of its objective of garnering 40% of total sales from its new-ish group by 2018.Over the trailing 12 months, IBM's strategic imperatives sales were $30.7 billion as of Q2 and now represent an impressive 38% of total revenue. And that figure has increased with each successive quarter, led by IBM's skyrocketing growth in all things cloud-related, including data security.Like Cisco, IBM doesn't break out security revenue specifically, but Rometty did say sales climbed 18% in Q2, and there's no reason to think that rate will slow anytime soon. As a leader in cloud and data analytics, IBM's security unit is ideally suited to ride the coattails of its strategic-imperatives push. IBM's diverse product lineup and positive momentum also make it a better buy than Palo Alto, both now and in the months and years ahead.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

e issued an updated research report on  on Aug 19.Fortinet is a provider of network security appliances and Unified Threat Management network security solutions to enterprises, service providers and government entities worldwide. Its solutions are designed to integrate multiple levels of security protection, including firewall, virtual private networking, anti-virus, intrusion prevention, Web filtering, anti-spam and wide area network acceleration.In late July, the company reported better-than-expected results for second-quarter 2016, wherein both the top line and the bottom line outpaced the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate.Although Fortinet's adjusted earnings per share were flat at year-ago levels, revenues jumped around 30%, aided primarily by its strength in the network security space. A large number of deal wins and customer additions during the quarter further drove top-line growth.Buoyed by the strong top-line performance in the second quarter, Fortinet raised its full-year revenue and billing expectations. The company now anticipates revenues in the range of $1.274 billion to $1.284 billion (previous projection: $1.262-$1.272 billion), representing a year-over-year improvement of 27%. Billings are now projected in the range of $1.530 billion to $1.540 billion, up from the earlier guidance of $1.520-$1.530 billion.We believe the company's strategy of focusing on selling subscription-based services will facilitate more stable revenues and margin expansion. Subscription-based service is a high gross margin business (approximately 80%) compared to the hardware-centric model.Furthermore, Fortinet has made strategic acquisitions to expedite growth. Last year, the company acquired Meru Networks, a company engaged in the development and marketing of a virtualized wireless LAN solution. The acquisition is a positive for Fortinet as it will help to strengthen the latter's cloud capabilities and expand the solutions portfolio, thereby allowing it to tap into the $5 billion worldwide enterprise Wi-Fi market with integrated and intelligent secure wireless solutions.Despite of these growth initiatives, we are somewhat skeptical about Fortinet's near-term performance due to changing customer spending behaviors. During the second quarter, various players in the cyber security space noticed that companies have been breaking their cybersecurity investment plans into phases and implementing the same over longer periods of time, instead of making a single large investment.Therefore, we are concerned that 2016 spending may fall to 2014 levels. Notably, cybersecurity spending by companies had skyrocketed last year due to a series of high-profile security breaches.Intense competition from key network security players such as Cisco Systems Inc.  , Check Point Software  , Juniper Networks  and Palo Alto Networks is another major concern.Currently, Fortinet carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

 could be a stock to avoid from a technical perspective, as the firm is seeing unfavorable trends on the moving average crossover front. Recently, the 50 Day Moving Average for CHKP broke out below the 200 Day Simple Moving Average, suggesting short-term bearishness.This has already started to take place, as the stock has moved lower by 4.4% in the past four weeks. And with the recent moving average crossover, investors have to think that more unfavorable trading is ahead for CHKP stock.If that wasn't enough Check Point Software Technologies isn't looking too great from an earnings estimate revision perspective either. It appears as though many analysts have been reducing their earnings expectations for the stock lately, which is usually not a good sign of things to come.Consider that in the last 30 days, 4 estimates have been reduced, while none have moved higher. Add this in to a similar move lower in the consensus estimate, and there is plenty of reason to be bearish here.That is why we currently have a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) on this stock and are looking for it to underperform in the weeks ahead. So either avoid this stock or consider jumping ship until the estimates and technical factors turn around for CHKP.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ? Today, you can download  .

 reported better-than-expected results for second-quarter 2016, wherein both the top line and bottom line outpaced the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. The network security solution provider's adjusted earnings per share (excluding one-time items but including stock-based compensation) came in at 3 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate stood a tad lower at 2 cents.However, on a year-over-year basis, the company reported earnings remained flat, while on a GAAP basis, it reported a loss of a penny, compared with breakeven results in the year-ago quarter.Fortinet reported second-quarter revenues of $311.4 million, up 29.9%. Revenues also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $304 million and exceeded the company's guidance of $301-$306 million. Segment-wise, Product revenues jumped 19% year over year to $136.6 million, while Services revenues surged 40% to $174.8 million.The year-over-year improvement was primarily aided by strength in the network security market. A large number of deal wins and customer additions during the quarter further contributed to top-line growth.During the quarter, Fortinet added approximately 9,000 customers, bringing the total count to over 280,000. The company witnessed 36% year-over-year growth in the number of deals worth over $100,000, while the number of deals worth over $250,000 and $500,000 increased 35% and 19%, respectively.Billings soared 26% on a year-over-year basis to $373.8 million.Gross profit increased 33.2% from the year-ago quarter to $226.9 million. Moreover, gross margin expanded 190 basis points (bps) to 72.7% primarily backed by sales of higher-value subscription bundles.Higher-than-expected adjusted operating expenses (up 35.9% year over year) hurt operating results. As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses increased 320 bps to 71.1%. Adjusted operating profit during the quarter came in at $5.6 million, lower than the year-ago quarter profit level of $7.5 million.Fortinet exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments of approximately $984.8 million, up from $952.6 million at the end of the previous quarter. Accounts receivable were $254.4 million, compared with $220.1 million at the end of the first quarter.During the quarter, the company generated cash flow of $67.9 million. Free cash flow for the quarter came in at $53.5 million. In first half of 2016, the company generated operating cash flow of $168.5 million.During the first six months of 2016, Fortinet repurchased 2 million shares worth $50.0 million. However, during the second quarter, the company did not repurchase any stock.For the third quarter, management expects revenues in the range of $319-$324 million and non-GAAP earnings per share of 17-18 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues and earnings are pegged at $318.9 million and 7 cents, respectively. Billings are expected in the range of $372 million to $376 million in the third quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be 73-74%, whereas non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be between 14% and 15%.Fortinet has raised its 2016 revenue and billing guidance. The company now expects revenues in the range of $1.274 billion to $1.284 billion (previous projection: $1.262-$1.272 billion), representing a year-over-year improvement of 27%. The guided range also lies above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.27 billion.Billings are now projected in the range of $1.530 billion to $1.540 billion, up from the earlier expectations of $1.520-$1.530 billion.However, the company maintained its guidance for earnings. During its first-quarter , Fortinet had anticipated earnings for the full year to be between 69 cents and 71 cents. | Fortinet's network security solutions include firewall, VPN, application control, antivirus, intrusion prevention, web filtering, anti-spam and WAN acceleration. The company reported better-than-expected second-quarter results. Despite persistent macro uncertainties, management seems to be positive on the back of a healthy network security market, solid product line-up and investment plans.However, competition from key network security players such as Cisco Systems Inc.  , Check Point  , Juniper Networks  and Palo Alto Networks, remains a concern. Nonetheless, product ramp-ups, deal wins, continuous growth in the network security market and expected benefits from the ongoing investments should provide ample tailwinds.Currently, Fortinet has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"he question of which is the better buy,  (NASDAQ: FTNT) or  (NASDAQ: CHKP) , would appear to be a no-brainer. Though both stocks are down since announcing so-so second-quarter earnings results and disappointing forecasts for the current quarter, based on its 9% jump in share price year to date, investors seem to be in Fortinet's camp.Check Point's share price is down nearly 8% in 2016, though it's worth noting 7% of that decline has come since announcing Q2 earnings results on July 26. But there's a bit more to the Fortinet and Check Point stories, including polar opposite management styles, Check Point's recent change in business focus, which will affect the next couple of quarters, and bottom-line results.Image source: .Image source:  .Fortinet has increased revenue by 30% or more following Q2's $311.4 million for a year straight. CEO Ken Xi noted that while Fortinet's billings didn't quite match the pace of its top-line growth, the $373.8 million was good for a 26% year-over-year improvement.Add non-GAAP (excluding one-time items) earnings per share (EPS) of $0.14, good for a 33% improvement, and Fortinet seemingly had a solid quarter. However, like Check Point and others in the data security space, including  (NYSE: PANW) , Fortinet's guidance for the current quarter left pundits and investors wanting.Fortinet's guidance included $0.17 to $0.18 non-GAAP EPS along with revenue in a range of $319 million to $324 million. Not bad when you consider analysts' consensus estimates are for earnings of $0.18 per share and sales of $320.15 million: both well within Fortinet's own expectations for the current quarter.At the mid-point of Fortinet's revenue forecast, Q3 will see the end of the aforementioned string of quarterly sales gains of 30% or more. Assuming Fortinet sales total $322 million this quarter, that equates to ""just"" a 24% improvement compared to 2015's Q3. The problem with slowing sales is that Fortinet investors have essentially ignored the company's lack of profitability because it was growing sales so consistently. But those days are over.Image source: .Image source:  .Check Point has taken a slower, more cautious approach to growth. Until last quarter's 7% revenue bump to $423 million, it had boosted its top line by 9% a quarter for nearly a year and a half straight. It's not in the same ballpark as Fortinet, nor will it be, given Check Point CEO Gil Shwed's commitment to expense management rather than a ""growth at all costs"" mentality.As was the case with Fortinet, Check Point's top and bottom lines both met Q2 expectations, but revenue and EPS guidance for Q3 landed in the mid to low end of analyst estimates. Check Point expects sales to fall in a range of $405 million to $435 million in Q3 and non-GAAP per-share earnings between $1.03 to $1.10. That compares with the Street's estimates of $422.8 million in sales and EPS of $1.08.Should Check Point deliver on the high end of its revenue target in Q3, it would be particularly impressive. Not only would a third quarter of around $425 million equal a 5% improvement year over year, it would do so without the benefit of as much as $10 million in sales. Check Point's shift to a subscription-based model means some revenue is no longer recognized immediately.In other words, if not for an accounting change that will affect both Q3 and Q4 results by deferring revenue into 2017 -- as much as $20 million is expected to roll over to 2017 in Q4, plus the $10 million this quarter -- Check Point would have enjoyed an 8% jump in revenue this quarter -- if it's able to deliver around $425 million.In Q3, the modular software blade products -- home of its subscription sales -- reported a 21% revenue gain to $93 million and are making up an ever-larger piece of Check Point's revenue pie. That, along with Shwed's spending control, is why Check Point will remain consistently profitable while Fortinet continues to battle with soaring overhead.To put that into perspective, Check Point's operating expenses in Q2 equaled 52% of sales. Fortinet? Its operating expenses are equal to 74% of sales, and that's up from last year's 70%.For those of us who prefer consistent growth, profits, and sound fundamentals, Check Point is the stock to buy, hands down.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. And we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early, in-the-know investors!

"ased on the bullish sentiment of industry analysts, it may seem unlikely to some that  (NYSE: PANW) stock could perform any worse than it already has in 2016. Down over 29% year to date, including another 4.4% on Aug. 10, it's becoming harder to justify pundits' consensus $185 price target and what amounts to a strong ""buy"" recommendation.After nearly two years of posting revenue growth of 50% or more, Palo Alto finally broke its impressive string last quarter by reporting a ""mere"" 48% jump in sales to $345.8 million. But what really sent Palo Alto shares nosediving from its pre-earnings price of $148.18 a share was its guidance for the current quarter. So, how could things get any worse for Palo Alto shareholders?Image source: Palo Alto Networks.The reason Palo Alto has underperformed most of its peers of late - its stock has been battered in 2016 compared to a 6.5% improvement across the data security sector -- was its revenue guidance of 36% to 37% this quarter. Its long run of top-line improvements overshadowed its ongoing lack of profitability, but those days are long gone.That makes this quarter's sales that much more critical. It's likely that CEO Mark McLaughlin's guidance of $386 million to $390 million for Palo Alto's fiscal Q4 was on the low end of actual expectations so it could post an earnings ""beat"" when it reports fourth-quarter and fiscal 2016 annual results on Aug. 30.However, if Palo Alto merely hits its 36% to 37% year-over-year revenue increase forecast or, worse, falls short by even the slightest of margins, shareholders will pay a steep price. Palo Alto's 52-week trading low of $111.09 would be in range if revenue doesn't perform up to expectations.The good news for Palo Alto is that the market for cybersecurity solutions is expected to skyrocket to over $202 billion in five years. The not-so-good news is that kind of revenue opportunity leads to increased competition, and not just from its existing peers including  and  .Two tech heavyweights that immediately come to mind are  (NASDAQ: CSCO) and  (NYSE: IBM) . Cisco and IBM are each in the midst of significant business transitions that include shifting focus to the fast-growing cloud and Internet of Things (IoT) markets. Both up-and-coming markets entail gathering massive amounts of data for storage, analytics, and ultimately providing customers with actionable results.A concern of most all cloud and IoT customers is data security, which is why both Cisco and IBM have made it a priority, and it's working. CEO Chuck Robbins attributed at least part of Cisco's 3% jump in revenue last quarter to the 17% increase in data security-related sales. IBM did Cisco one better by reporting an 18% year-over-year improvement in security revenue. Palo Alto's sandbox is getting bigger, and so are the players it's competing with.The reason Palo Alto continues to lose more and more money each quarter is spending -- lots and lots of spending. Again, investors looked the other way when Palo Alto was growing quarterly sales by more than 50%, but now that those days are past its management of expenses, or lack thereof, will be the target of more intense scrutiny. Last quarter was a microcosm of Palo Alto's rising overhead.Operating expenses soared 50% in fiscal 2016's Q3 to $309.5 million and Palo Alto's cost of revenue jumped 47% to $94.9 million. Even more disconcerting was that 57% -- a staggering $202 million -- of Palo Alto's $345.8 million in total sales went to pay for its sales and marketing efforts.Palo Alto hasn't painted a pretty picture for investors of late, and if it's not able to deliver revenue results this quarter, fight off some big-time competitors, and control its pocketbook, shareholders may not have seen the worst of it yet.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

" (NASDAQ: CHKP) delivered good second-quarter results on Tuesday, but lowered revenue and earnings estimates for the coming quarters. Let's take a look at the results and the nuances behind management's commentary.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.The headline figures:Now, a look at management's commentary on guidance:It's here where things get tricky. Although management didn't change its full-year guidance for revenue of $1,720 million to $1,790 million, and non-GAAP EPS of $4.45 to $4.60, it noted the following:Let's dig into what this means.There are two points to discuss. First, Check Point sells appliances (product revenue), which come bundled with software blades -- customers can add more blades with different applications later -- and also sells software updates and maintenance.The following chart shows how strongly software-blade revenue continues to grow. For example, at the start of 2013, software blades were responsible for 15% of revenue compared to 22% in the just-finished quarter.DATA SOURCE: CHECK POINT SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGIES LTD.What does this have to do with Check Point guiding revenue and earnings lower in the coming quarters? The answer is that, in accordance with accounting rules, Check Point must separate the software-blade revenue from the product revenue, even though they're sold together initially, and then recognize the blade revenue over time.The result is a shift from product revenue (recognized immediately) to deferred revenue. Not only is Check Point seeing a general increase in software-blade revenue, but its new appliances contain a ""richer software blade package,"" according to CFO Tal Payne on the .The result is a shift in revenue, and that's the main reason why management lowered expectations for revenue and earnings. For reference, the following chart shows how strongly deferred revenue has been growing in recent years. ALL DATA IN THOUSANDS OF U.S. DOLLARS.While management didn't explicitly blame pricing pressure for lowering revenue guidance, Payne hinted at it in a response to a question:Similarly, CEO Gil Shwed talked of a ""little bit"" more discounting on maintenance contracts, in order to retain the customer base.In a similar vein, Check Point is deliberately pursuing a policy of increasing sales and marketing in order to drive revenue growth. The chart below shows sales and marketing expenses, and non-GAAP operating income as a share of revenue.DATA SOURCE: CHECK POINT SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGIES LTD.Management's lowering of revenue expectations is more about a shift in its business model than any kind of fundamental weakness in its business. After all, it's difficult for management to predict exactly what products/software customers will buy. It's worth keeping an eye on any future pricing pressure -- usually a sign of increasing competition -- and how sales and marketing expenses might eat into operating income margin.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

"bout the only good news for  (NYSE: PANW) shareholders of late is that its stock price is slowly inching back up to its post-earnings level of $129.86. Of course, Palo Alto shares were sitting at $148.18 on May 26, before fiscal 2016 third-quarter earnings were announced, then nosedived over 12% the following day. With a 52-week high of $200.55 a share, value investors may think Palo Alto represents an opportunity.There is no shortage of bullish Palo Alto analysts -- one even upped his target price to a whopping $215 a share last month, and he's not the only pundit in the company's corner. The 37 analysts who follow Palo Alto have an average target price of $185.43, good for a 46% jump from Wednesday's close. The question is, why?Not only has Palo Alto's string of soaring quarterly revenue growth ended, but spending remains off the charts, and competition is heating up from the likes of  (NASDAQ: CHKP) -- not to mention some of the industry's largest data security players.Image source: Getty.It wasn't necessarily Palo Alto Networks' seven straight quarters of 50% or more revenue growth coming to an end in Q3 that sent its stock price reeling. Its guidance for the current quarter really stung. Palo Alto's top-line growth had been the primary driver of its once-soaring stock price. It sure wasn't profits fueling Palo Alto's fire, because the company's a long way from being in the black. Nor were Palo Alto pundits and investors citing its expense control efforts to warrant its sky-high valuation, because there aren't any.Last quarter's 48% increase in sales to $345.8 million was a bit of an eye opener given Palo Alto's long string of 50% or better. But with an expected year-over-year revenue between $386 million and $390 million, equal to a 36% to 37% improvement over this quarter, Palo Alto's revenue trend is now heading in the wrong direction.Palo Alto CEO Mark McLaughlin and CFO Steffan Tomlinson are quick to point out that free cash flow (FCF) is soaring, and they're right. In Q3, FCF rose an impressive -- at least at first glance -- 95% from the year-ago quarter, to $150.8 million from $77.4 million in fiscal 2015's third quarter. Sounds pretty good, right?The only problem with Palo Alto execs and bulls pointing to FCF as a sign the company is hitting on all cylinders is that a large part of the aforementioned 95% ""improvement"" is due to skyrocketing share-based compensation, as well as deferred subscription revenue.The $112.7 million Palo Alto paid out in share-based compensation this year was $48.6 million higher than the amount in 2015, and deferred revenue climbed $72.4 million, to $140.4 million. Though to Palo Alto's credit, soaring deferred revenue is a bullish sign in that it supports Tomlinson's assertion that ""particular strength in our subscription services"" last quarter helped drive results.But soaring share-based compensation costs are nothing to brag about, not to mention they skew FCF because let's face it, they're not really cash generated as much as a being a non-cash expense that is added back into the FCF calculation mix. In fact, remove the staggering $48.6 million increase in comp expense and Palo Alto's FCF grew 32%. High-growth companies often show strong FCF for the same reasons, which is why slow but steady data security providers, including Check Point Software, will rarely compare favorably against the Palo Alto Networks of the world.But that's primarily because Check Point's CEO, Gil Shwed, takes a more conservative approach to spending, as evidenced by last quarter's meager 2.5% increase in stock-based comp to $18.22 million, from $17.78 million a year ago. There's another significant difference between Palo Alto and Check Point for investors to consider: The latter is consistently profitable, including and excluding one-time items.When all is said and done, Palo Alto's stock price of around $125 a share is about right. At least until the company gets spending under control, which in turn will help stop the bleeding on its bottom line. And that is particularly vital now that its stellar top-line growth has become a thing of the past.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

" (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NYSE:  ) may have their fortunes reversed according to a note from Bernstein Research. Source: While CHKP stock is currently in the black for the year, PANW stock has suffered setback after setback, shedding 24% since the start of 2016. Bernstein Senior Analyst Pierre Ferragu, however, expects one of the two cybersecurity companies to fare better than the other.Palo Alto, says Ferragu, will post earnings above guidance, while Check Point's earnings should come somewhere in the mid-range.According to Ferragu, PANW issued modest guidance due to the ""volatile macroeconomic environment."" Bernstein estimates revenues of $391.2 million, well above the consensus for $389.4 million. And while firm expects PANW revenues and earnings to come in slightly under seasonality, Palo Alto's long-term outlook leaves the research firm ""relaxed"":""Palo Alto only owns ~8% of the installed base, though it captures half of revenue growth in the market. This signals a competitive edge in products, which, perceived or real, appears sustainable. We expect Palo Alto to more than double revenues in three years and quintuple earnings, as its very profitable subscription business model reaches maturity.""As for CHKP stock, Ferragu calls for ""slightly below consensus"" revenues and earnings. Bernstein's $417 million sales estimate, indeed, is much lower than the consensus for $422 million.Bernstein attributes its dismal view on CHKP stock to the company's opex growth outpacing sales and billings, a sign of deteriorating productivity. What's more, Bernstein notes that Check Point previously issued ""cautious commentary"" surrounding its IT spending and subscription revenue impact:""Combined with the continued deterioration of productivity, this may reflect the beginning of a loss of commercial momentum, as recently discussed. We expect to gain more visibility on this coming quarter.""Bernstein has slapped CHKP with an ""underperform"" rating and $65 price target, concluding that ""Check Point is the most at risk platform in the race,"" as its unpromising earnings can't sustain its lofty valuation.The firm rates PANW stock as ""outperform"" with a $200 price target, calling it the ""most likely winner of the infrastructure security race.""

 is set to report second-quarter 2016 results on Jul 26. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 4.30%. Notably, Check Point Software has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the trailing four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 5.09%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Near-term prospects for Check Point Software are not quite promising as changing customer spending behavior has already compelled one of its rivals, Imperva to lower its second-quarter 2016 outlook. Imperva cut its revenue growth forecast significantly and expects to post a much wider loss than previously projected.Imperva cited longer sales cycles for bigger deals and decrease in the size of several big purchases for the dull outlook. During the second quarter, it noticed that companies have been breaking their cybersecurity investment plans in phases and implementing the same over time, rather than making a single large investment.Therefore, we are concerned that 2016 spending may fall to 2014 levels. Notably, cybersecurity spending by companies skyrocketed last year due to a series of high-profile security breaches.All these factors keep us concerned about Check Point Software's second-quarter performance.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Check Point Software will beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. The Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -1.03%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of 96 cents is slightly lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 97 cents. Check Point Software carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).As it is, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum. | Here are a couple of companies which you may consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Open Text Corp.  , with an Earnings ESP of +1.10% and a Zacks Rank #1.Diebold, Incorporated  , with an Earnings ESP of +5.00% and a Zacks Rank #2.Boyd Gaming Corporation  , with an Earnings ESP of +3.33% and a Zacks Rank #2.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"nce again,  managed to impress investors with solid quarterly results. For the second quarter of 2016, the company reported in-line earnings and better-than-expected revenues.Check Point's adjusted earnings per share (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets) matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 97 cents. Reported earnings also climbed 7.8% on a year-over-year basis, driven mainly by higher revenues and a lower share count, which were partially offset higher operating expenses.Second-quarter revenues came in at $422.7 million, up nearly 7%, and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $421 million.Despite the strong top- and bottom-line performance, shares of the leading policy-based enterprise security and traffic management solution provider lost approximately 4% during yesterday's trading session due to a soft third-quarter outlook.Top-line growth was aided by sales growth of 9.6% in Products & Software Blades and 4% in Software Updates and Maintenance. The company also reported a 21% surge in subscription revenues at Software Blades.Check Point witnessed higher demand for data center and high-end appliances. Another factor contributing to overall growth was the increased number of large deal signings. While the number of new customers who signed deals worth $1 million or more was 63, that of customers who signed deals worth $50,000 and more contributed 72% to the total order value.Geographically, the Americas contributed 49% to revenues and Europe accounted for 36%, while Asia-Pacific, Japan, and the Middle East and Africa brought in the remaining 15%.On a year-over-year basis, adjusted gross profit (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets) increased 7.1% to $375.2 million, while gross margin improved 20 basis points (bps) to 88.8% from the year-ago tally of 88.6%.Adjusted operating expenses (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets) rose 14.8% year over year to $169.8 million as the company continued to make investments. The increase may also be attributed to higher research and development, and selling and marketing expenses as well as to acquisitions made over the past year. As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses increased 280 bps.Adjusted operating income (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets) came in at $205.4 million, up 1.5% year over year. However, margins contracted 260 bps as a percentage of revenues mainly due to higher operating expenses.Adjusted net income (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets and other one-time items calculated on a proportionate tax basis) was $169.0 million or 97 cents per share, up from $165.7 million or 90 cents reported last year.Check Point exited the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $1.33 billion, compared with $1.37 billion in the previous quarter.During the first half of 2016, the company generated operating cash flow of $526.2 million, compared with $477.1 million during the prior-year period.Moreover, during the first six months of 2016, Check Point repurchased $492.9 million worth of common stock.In spite of decent second-quarter results, Check Point gave a soft outlook for the third quarter. Management cited a shift in the business model to recurring revenues as the main reason behind the weak guidance.Check Point has revealed that its business model is skewing slightly toward an annual subscription-based model, because of which the company is selling more of bundled products than single products. This has resulted in the deference of some revenues to next year.Notably, over the past few quarters, Software Blades subscription revenues have been witnessing high double-digit growth as Check Point began offering software blades in bundles, including a series of new appliances. The company has also noted that the transition is progressing faster than anticipated, indicating an impact on third- and fourth-quarter results.During the second-quarter conference call, Chief Executive Officer Gil Shwed said that ""[the shift in business model] will lower revenues by approximately $8 million to $10 million on the third quarter and double than that for the fourth quarter, which also means an effect of approximately $0.03 and $0.06 to Q3 and Q4 earnings per share, respectively.""As a result, for the third quarter, the company projects revenues in the range of $405 million to $435 million and non-GAAP earnings per share in the $1.03-1.10 band. GAAP earnings per share are anticipated to be approximately 13 cents or lower.Check Point's second-quarter results were marked by in-line earnings and better-than-expected revenues. The year-over-year improvement in both the top and bottom line was further encouraging. | Moving ahead, rapid adoption of Check Point's data center appliances and continuous enhancements in data center product lines are expected to provide ample top-line support. Additionally, the company's efforts on continuous share buybacks bode well for investors.However, competition from Cisco Systems Inc.  , Juniper Networks Inc.  and Fortinet Inc.  , along with an uncertain economic environment and currency headwinds, remain major concerns.Check Point currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"hares of  soared significantly over the last 10 days. The main reason behind this could be its recent agreement to acquire Blue Coat, Inc., a leading web security solution provider, from private equity firm Bain Capital. (Read:  )The Blue Coat buyout is expected to enhance Symantec's capabilities significantly. As per Symantec, the acquisition will not only provide economies of scale and bolster its existing portfolio, but will also provide the necessary resources for the development of solutions to ""protect large customers and individual consumers against insider threats and sophisticated cybercriminals"".The deal will also give Symantec direct access to Blue Coat's huge customer base, thereby boosting the combined company's revenues. The company revealed that the combined entity's revenues would have been $4.4 billion in fiscal 2016 as against $3.6 billion it reported as a standalone company.Since the announcement of the Blue Coat acquisition on Jun 12, the stock has jumped over 20%. Moreover, shares of the company are now trading 28.7% higher than its last 52-week low of $16.14 attained on Mar 4. | Of late, Symantec's earnings and revenues have both been under pressure due to persistent weakness in PC sales, which is hurting the core Norton Anti-virus software business. Apart from this, intensifying competition from Palo-Alto Networks  , FireEye Inc.  and Check Point Software  has been eroding its market share in the enterprise segment.As a result, the company has had to resort to aggressive restructuring measures. Keeping with this, on Jan 29, Symantec closed the sale of its Veritas business for $7.4 billion to Carlyle Group (CG). We believe that the deal provided Symantec with much needed funds for expanding its product portfolio as well as its presence in fast growing markets.With the acquisition of Blue Coat, the company will be able to reduce its dependence on the PC market and strengthen its position in the enterprise security space. Revenues from the enterprise security segment are now expected to contribute 62% to the company's top line.We expect the latest acquisition to contribute significantly to the company's overall growth.Currently, Symantec carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"ven before the surprising Brexit vote sent the world's markets into a tailspin,  '(NYSE: PANW) stock was reeling. After announcing earnings on May 26, Palo Alto revealed it had finally broken its nearly two-year-long string of reporting quarterly revenue growth of 50% or more. As a result Palo Alto stock has nosedived 18% .The ""mere"" 48% jump in sales, to $345.8 million, in fiscal 2016's third quarter wasn't the only thing that disappointed investors. Palo Alto's guidance of $386 million to $390 million in the current quarter -- equal to year-over-year revenue growth of 36% to 37% -- fueled the bearish fire.As Palo Alto's stock price inches closer to its 52-week low of $111.09 a share, some value investors might consider it a bargain.Image source: Getty.It's unrealistic to assume Palo Alto could continue its impressive run of revenue growth indefinitely. As any business matures, even one some pundits expect to generate over $1 trillion in sales from 2017 to 2021, the slowing of top-line growth is inevitable. So it could be argued that Palo Alto's 48% sales gain in Q3, and even its expectations of a 36% to 37% revenue jump in the current quarter, is still commendable.Relative to its peers -- namely  (NASDAQ: FTNT) and  (NASDAQ: CHKP) -- Palo Alto's sales will continue to lead the pack. Fortinet also has a nice string of revenue growth intact, having reported 30% or more for three straight quarters. Check Point CEO Gil Shwed's methodical approach to its business has translated to just a 9% sales improvement the first quarter in 2016.One of the reasons Palo Alto compares so favorably to its competitors is its security platform solution: It was ahead of both Fortinet and Check Point in delivering an all-in-one platform rather than offering a piecemeal approach to data security sales. Palo Alto is also focused on further developing its recurring revenue streams via its subscription services, and it's working.According to Palo Alto CFO Steffan Tomlinson, last quarter's 48% revenue gain was largely due to ""increased investments in our Next-Generation Security Platform, with particular strength in our subscription services."" Service results actually surpassed new product sales last quarter -- a testament to Palo Alto's emphasis on generating a solid foundation of long-term, recurring revenue.Not surprisingly, when a stock generates investor interest based almost entirely on continuing its phenomenal top-line growth, as was the case with Palo Alto, it gets hit especially hard when the inevitable slowing kicks in. To put that into perspective, Palo Alto's stock is down 32% year to date, while Fortinet is flat and Check Point is down all of 5%. And that's not likely to change any time soon.Palo Alto's security platform solution and focus on subscription sales aren't unique any longer, as both Fortinet and Check Point have unveiled their own enterprise-wide data security solutions, which has increased service revenue. Fortinet CEO Ken Xie cited ""customer adoption of broad, integrated platforms"" as a key driver of last quarter's solid results, and Check Point's Shwed pointed to strong ""subscription revenue growth"" behind its solid, albeit not spectacular, Q1 sales.But growing competition in end-to-end data security solutions and competitors' efforts to increase their own recurring revenue streams are only blips on the radar as far as Palo Alto's troubles are concerned. The overriding problem is out-of-control spending that has left Palo Alto in the red for years, and will continue to do so in the foreseeable future.Spending -- both cost of revenue and operating expenses -- jumped a whopping 50% last quarter, to $404.4 million. And that's not even the worst part. Nearly half of all that overhead, $202 million to be precise, went to Palo Alto's sales and marketing efforts. These were not one-time investments for product development or infrastructure, but ongoing costs associated with selling its products, and there's no end in sight.When investors add it all up, Palo Alto's stock sell-off was a matter of when, not if. And even at these depressed levels, Palo Alto still has too many areas of concern to warrant a look.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. And we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in-the-know investors!

hares of  have been losing momentum of late. One of the major reasons behind this could be the company's wider-than-expected loss during the third quarter of fiscal 2016, along with a discouraging earnings guidance for the fourth quarter.Notably, the stock has tanked approximately 10% since the announcement of its third-quarter results on May 25. Also, year to date, the stock has lost over 25%.Although Palo Alto Networks' revenues came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate and recorded a year-over-year improvement, its bottom-line results were quite dismal.The company's adjusted loss (excluding amortization and other one-time items but including stock-based compensation) for the quarter was wider than both the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the year-ago quarter loss. Loss widened mainly due to higher operating expenses, which more than offset the benefits of robust top-line growth.Weighed down by the dismal bottom-line performance as well as enterprise spending concerns, the company gave a weak guidance for the fourth quarter. | Adding to its woes, Palo Alto Network faces stiff competition from several big and small players in the security application market. Over the past few years, demand for IT security has been growing on the back of increasing awareness, along with rising incidents of cyber-attacks, making the market more attractive for new players.Also, there are some established players in adjacent markets like Cisco Systems, Inc.  , Check Point Software Technologies Ltd.  and Juniper Networks, Inc.  that can cross-sell security products and include security into their existing product lines, further intensifying competition in the space.Also, the recent forecast on worldwide IT spending by Gartner has raised concerns about Palo Alto's near-term performance. The research firm predicted worldwide IT spending to increase just 0.6% year over year in 2016 to $3.54 trillion.Gartner cited the stronger dollar as the main reason behind the weak outlook. Notably, since the research firm started tracking expenses, 2015 witnessed the largest U.S. dollar drop in IT spending with worldwide IT spending declining approximately 5.8% year over year, or by $216 billion, to $3.52 trillion.Gartner also believes that worldwide IT spending will not be able to surpass the 2014 level of around $3.74 billion until 2019. Although the research firm has not commented on IT security spending, persistent softness in overall IT spending may hurt this industry too.Nonetheless, we are positive on the company's top-line performance. Revenue growth appears steady, aided by strength across all its geographical regions and business segments. Also, customer wins, along with expansion of the existing customer base, has positively impacted revenues. We believe that the company's product refreshes will further boost revenues, going forward.Currently, Palo Alto Networks carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the PowerShares Dynamic Networking Portfolio ETF (Symbol: PXQ), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $36.98 per unit.With PXQ trading at a recent price near $33.72 per unit, that means that analysts see 9.67% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of PXQ's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Barracuda Networks Inc (Symbol: CUDA), Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd. (Symbol: CHKP), and LogMeIn Inc (Symbol: LOGM). Although CUDA has traded at a recent price of $14.45/share, the average analyst target is 31.87% higher at $19.05/share. Similarly, CHKP has 14.38% upside from the recent share price of $81.15 if the average analyst target price of $92.82/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting LOGM to reach a target price of $69.00/share, which is 13.90% above the recent price of $60.58.

"ack in January, Israeli financial newspaper  claimed that firewall and security software vendor  (NASDAQ: CHKP) was in ""initial talks"" to buy privileged accounts protector  (NASDAQ: CYBR) .At the time, JPMorgan analyst Sterling Auty claimed that combining both companies made sense since they had complementary technologies and were both based in Israel, and Check Point's wider distribution channels could boost CyberArk's sales to a ""new level of scale."" CheckPoint finished last quarter with $3.7 billion in cash and equivalents, which would easily cover CyberArk's enterprise value of $1.1 billion even after factoring in a hefty acquisition premium.But Oppenheimer analyst Shaul Eyal claimed that the buyout had a ""low probability"" of happening, since Check Point generally buys much smaller companies and CyberArk would be its biggest acquisition ever.

"iting certain sources, yesterday Reuters reported that  is looking to raise $2.8 billion in term loans to complete its pending acquisition of Blue Coat Inc.The multinational mass media and information firm believes that the loans will comprise of a $1 billion three-year Term Loan A and $1.8 billion five-year Term Loan A. As per Reuters, ""Pricing opens at 150bp over Libor for the three-year and 175bp over Libor for the five-year.""Symantec and Blue Coat had entered into a definitive agreement last month, under which Symantec would pay a total cash consideration of $4.65 billion for the acquisition. The Norton antivirus maker expects to complete the acquisition in the third quarter of this year. | Blue Coat is a privately owned company, which was founded in 1996 as CacheFlow. The company's security solutions allow organizations to protect their web gateways from cyberattacks. In Dec 2011, the company was acquired by private equity investment firm, Thoma Bravo, for $1.3 billion followed by the Mar 2015 takeover by Bain Capital for $2.4 billion.At present, Blue Coat's Cloud Generation Security solutions are used by a worldwide customer base of over 15,000.The addition of Blue Coat is expected to enhance Symantec's capabilities significantly. As per Symantec, the acquisition will not only provide economies of scale and bolster its existing portfolio, but will also provide necessary resources to develop solutions to ""protect large customers and individual consumers against insider threats and sophisticated cybercriminals"".Apart from this, the deal will also provide direct access to Blue Coat's huge customer base, which will drive the combined company's revenues. In fact, Symantec estimated that the combined entity's revenues would have been $4.4 billion in fiscal 2016 as against $3.6 billion it reported as a standalone entity.Moreover, the transaction is anticipated to help Symantec realize cost synergies of approximately $150 million by the end of fiscal 2018. This will be in addition to cost savings of $400 million under its previously announced cost-efficiency program.The Blue Coat acquisition will also end Symantec's search for a new Chief Executive Officer (CEO). The company has been looking for the new CEO ever since Mike Brown announced his intension of stepping down from his post following dismal fourth-quarter fiscal 2016 results. On Jul 11, Symantec's management announced that the current CEO of Blue Boat, Greg Clark, will assume the role of the CEO of the combined company, once the deal is successfully completed.Of late, Symantec's top and bottom lines have been under pressure due to persistent weakness in PC sales, which particularly hurt its core Norton Anti-virus software business. Apart from this, intensifying competition from Palo-Alto Networks  , FireEye Inc.  and Check Point Software  has been eroding its market share in the enterprise segment.As a result, the company has been aggressively restructuring its business. In doing so, on Jan 29, the company closed the sale of its Veritas business for $7.4 billion to Carlyle Group (CG). We believe that the deal provided Symantec with much needed funds to continue expanding its product portfolio as well as its presence in fast growing markets.With the acquisition of Blue Coat, the company will be able to reduce its dependence on the PC market and strengthen its position in the enterprise security space. Revenues from the enterprise security segment will now contribute 62% to the company's top line.We expect the latest acquisition to contribute considerably to the company's overall growth.Currently, Symantec carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

" (NASDAQ: FEYE) and  (NASDAQ: CHKP) each supply advanced appliances and software solutions in the field of cybersecurity. Check Point offers network and endpoint security and aims to ""secure the Internet."" FireEye focuses on advanced threat detection and prevention, as well as incidence resolution technology. Both are highly visible and well-regarded organizations in the security sector. But which makes for the better investment?Let's begin by observing how these two companies fare on a handful of key metrics:
  
Data source: Check Point and FireEye SEC annual report filings, 2012-2015. *Not applicable as FireEye does not yet have positive earnings on which to base price-to-earnings comparisons.Check Point was incorporated in Israel in 1993, and its maturity shows. As one of the very first -- and oldest -- network security companies, Check Point has tallied a decent, if not pulse-raising, revenue compounded annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 8% over the last three years. Similarly, profits have increased at a modest CAGR of 4%.But what catches my eye, and perhaps yours as well, is Check Point's extremely high profitability. An operating income margin of over 50% is quite rare, even for a software company. In trade for moderate growth and profit expansion, a shareholder in Check Point can bank on extremely robust profits each quarter. That's quite appealing to investors with long holding periods.Scanning over the same information in FireEye's column, revenue growth is a standout metric. FireEye has continued to add customers and sales at a heady pace since its debut on the public markets in 2013.But to create this order of top-line expansion, FireEye has invested heavily in research and development while incurring a high cost of sales, and has yet to generate positive net income on an annual basis. In fact, FireEye's three-year revenue CAGR is exceeded only by its three-year loss CAGR. That is to say, the 96% annual average improvement in sales is topped only by the 147% annual growth rate of the company's losses.In the software industry, and indeed within the subsector of cybersecurity, investors value revenue increases but also demand some visibility into future profits. That FireEye continues to rack up losses while producing either negative or marginally positive operating cash flow each quarter has rattled its investors as of late.The chart above is indicative of some idiosyncrasies surrounding FireEye's business, in particular, its unique approach to security software. Rather than provide firewall protection or traditional intrusion prevention systems, FireEye's products guard against advanced threats in a virtual software environment, leaving an organization's native systems uncompromised.Thus, the company's software isn't top of mind as a foundational security solution, and some customers buy FireEye's offerings only when a significant corporate hack is widely publicized. Similarly, investors' interest in the company tends to rise in direct proportion to the buzz around global security threats.Management is well aware of this cyclical, news-driven phenomenon. In its annual reports, FireEye even acknowledges the risk that if the level of advance threats from rogue outfits, state-sponsored security hacking, and corporate espionage agents decreases, the company's business could be materially impacted.Check Point's software is closer to what a typical corporation reaches for when building a security solution to protect vulnerabilities enterprisewide. Check Point successfully bundles appliances and software ""blades"" to provide a comprehensive security option. While it's still very much a network security leader, the company has also branched out in the threat detection market, albeit using different technologies than FireEye.This year, Check Point's latest suites of security appliances are especially optimized for threat prevention. After introducing the data center and high-end 15000 and 23000 appliances last year, the company followed up with the small and midrange 1400, 3000, and 5000 series, which come out of the box with a full threat prevention suite enabled.Ultimately, which stock is the better buy? While Check Point may be the much more mature company, it's no slouch as an investment. Since the FireEye IPO nearly three years ago, Check Point stock has returned 48%. Compare that to FireEye itself, which has lost 56% cumulatively since going public.Despite its operational losses, FireEye shows a great deal of promise due to its ability to capitalize on a rapidly expanding niche market. But a return to an ascending stock chart will hinge on management's ability to control costs and squeeze higher revenue from current levels of selling expenses.The company is countering the cyclical sales weakness discussed above by developing long-term relationships with clients via multiyear contracts. It's also refining its skill in selling advanced solutions to multinational corporations and government entities. In the company's most recently earnings call, outgoing CEO Dave DeWalt noted that FireEye's largest transaction of Q1 2016 was an eight-figure contract with a U.S. federal entity to protect more than 100,000 email addresses.Conversely, Check Point can already point to a plethora of large, long-term clients; its continued success rests on its ability to innovate, while maintaining a reputation as an industry leader. Recently, CEO Gil Shwed promised that the company will soon extend its cybersecurity platforms into markets such as the Internet of things (IoT), national security, and critical infrastructure.Check Point has a long track record of successfully evolving along with market trends, so investors have a reasonable assurance that it will indeed capture crucial market share in cybersecurity in the coming years. An extremely healthy corporate balance sheet is well capable of supporting further market expansion.Considering all factors, FireEye will remain a somewhat speculative investment until the company can string together several profitable quarters. Check Point, despite a sleepier reputation, has proved a winning holding over the last few years. While both offer compelling reasons to invest, for the near future, Check Point will remain the better buy.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

"n an effort to recapture its momentum in the fast growing cybersecurity market,  is all set to acquire Blue Coat, Inc., a leading web security solution provider, from private equity firm Bain Capital.As per a definitive agreement signed by the two companies, Symantec will pay a total cash consideration of $4.65 billion for the transaction.

he more than 12% drop in  (NYSE: PANW) stock following its disappointing fiscal 2016 third-quarter earnings results was an overreaction, and those who acted on its price decline have already been rewarded. Palo Alto hasn't quite recouped the entire drop, but it had clawed its way back to $141 a share as of close of trading on June 2.Even with Palo Alto's stock inching up the last few days, it remains well below analyst expectations, which are nearly all positive. Yes, Palo Alto did receive a couple of analyst downgrades, but its target price remains 35% above current levels. By comparison,  (NASDAQ: CHKP) and   -- two of Palo Alto's peers and primary competitors -- have nowhere near the bullish sentiment from analysts as Palo Alto.Is Palo Alto investors' more cautious approach merited, or do the majority of analysts have it right that its stock will make up the difference?Image source: .Image source:  .Palo Alto had forecast a 43% to 45% jump in sales last quarter, slightly down from its string of 50% gains or more, but still an awfully sound quarter. Palo Alto's third-quarter revenue pleasantly surprised, climbing to $345.8 million, good for a 48% year-over-year improvement.Palo Alto's quarter also demonstrated that CEO Mark McLaughlin's objective of increasing recurring revenue and inking longer-term deals as measured by deferred sales is seeing success. Its Services unit results jumped 63% last quarter to $183.7 million and now makes up a majority of Palo Alto's total revenue. Service sales are integral to Palo Alto's plans to build a base of recurring revenue, and the division's results show the plan is working.Just three quarters into its fiscal 2016, Palo Alto has already bumped up its deferred revenue by 43%, and free cash flow climbed 95% year over year. Toss in its recent inclusion in  's Magic Quadrant ranking of network firewall providers -- for the fifth time -- and Palo Alto's product and services suite continues to warrant plaudits.Despite its slight beat in revenue guidance, Palo Alto's stock price fell because of its downbeat guidance. Sales are forecasted to tally $390 million on the high end this quarter, and non-GAAP (excluding one-time items) earnings of $0.50 are expected, barely meeting revised expectations. Palo Alto's 48% revenue jump last quarter was the first time in two years it has reported less than 50%, but at least that was close. This quarter's revenue guidance calls for 36% to 37% growth.With sales rising, albeit slower, why does Palo Alto continue to lose money quarter-in, and quarter-out? In a word, spending. What makes Palo Alto's lack of expense control worrisome is that it's not for infrastructure, research, or development -- often short-term overhead bumps associated with expansion. The primary culprit of Palo Alto's soaring costs relates to sales and marketing.The company spent $202 million on sales and marketing last quarter, equal to 58% of its total revenue. To put that in perspective, Check Point spent 23% of last quarter's $404 million in revenue on its sales and marketing efforts. Another significant difference between Palo Alto and Check Point is that the latter reports consistent profitability on a GAAP basis. It costs money to market and sell products and services, but the relative amount of recurring overhead Palo Alto shells out is substantial.Will Palo Alto reach nearly $190 a share as analysts predict? Eventually. However, the one thing Palo Alto had going for it -- ridiculously high revenue growth rates, which was enough for many investors to overlook its challenges -- is heading in the wrong direction.. Given its spending binge on recurring sales and marketing expenses, don't expect a profitable quarter any time soon. A more cautious approach to Palo Alto is warranted, regardless of what bullish analysts suggest.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

"nvestors are expecting big things from  (NYSE: PANW) when it reports fiscal 2016 third-quarter earnings after markets close May 26. Though Palo Alto's share price is down about 16% year to date, shareholders have enjoyed a 7%-plus jump the past week leading up to its third-quarter news.The question is whether Palo Alto stock warrants the positive expectations. The answer depends on whether Palo Alto is able to perform in three key areas. Considering its volatile trading history, anything short of spectacular will send its shares reeling. That said, if Palo Alto is able to demonstrate progress in those same critical aspects of its business, analysts' sky-high target price of $195.79 will be within reach.Image source:  .It's no wonder Palo Alto has caught the attention of growth investors the past couple of years given its impressive run of seven straight quarters of 50%-plus revenue gains. However, Palo Alto's revenue growth streak is expected to slow this quarter. Palo Alto CEO Mark McLaughlin shared revenue guidance of $335 million to $339 million -- good for a 45% improvement and on the high end of expectations.Anything short of meeting forecast sales and non-GAAP (excluding one-time items) earnings per share (EPS) of $0.41 to $0.42 will undoubtedly cause a sell-off of Palo Alto stock.Analyst's have high expectations of $339.48 million in sales and EPS of $0.42, and after Palo Alto's impressive string of quarterly revenue improvement, even the slightest miss would be unacceptable.Palo Alto's peers, including  (NASDAQ: FTNT) and  (NASDAQ: CHKP) can't touch its sales growth. However, they are both growing, Fortinet is on a nearly yearlong string of 30%-plus revenue growth. Check Point CEO Gil Shwed's slow but steady approach to growing its business has translated to a meager -- at least by comparison -- 9% jump in quarterly revenue. Yet Fortinet stock is up 10% year to date, and Check Point's up 6%.Despite its stellar top line, Palo Alto continues to report negative EPS each successive quarter. Incurring high one-time costs happens during a hyper-growth phase, usually to develop additional solutions and improve infrastructure, among other necessary outlays. The reason to monitor Palo Alto's overhead is  it's spending its revenue on.Of Palo Alto's $334.7 million in revenue last quarter, a whopping $187.6 million -- equal to 56% of total sales -- went to sales and marketing expenses. The nearly 60% increase in research and development (R&D) spend last quarter, and the 58% jump in Palo Alto's cost of revenue are legitimate costs of doing business. But the fact it spends well over half its revenue to sell and market its services is disconcerting, to say the least. McLaughlin needs to show Palo Alto is improving its expense management -- beginning now.One means of growing its top line without pouring more millions into marketing, and sales folks' pockets, is Palo Alto's burgeoning services unit. Unlike product sales, subscription services revenue requires less ongoing expenses and establishes a recurring revenue base -- something McLaughlin and Palo Alto CFO Steffan Tomlinson are focused on. And it's working.Last quarter's 54% jump in total sales was largely due to Palo Alto's services group's whopping 61% improvement to $164.8 million from last year's $102.1 million. Palo Alto's product division pitched in a 46% gain in sales last quarter. The company's focus on subscription services and the recurring revenue opportunity it represents is spot-on, and worth a look when Palo Alto reports fiscal Q3 earnings.It's not likely investors will settle for anything less than a spectacular Q3 from Palo Alto. To do that, Palo Alto needs to approach 50% top-line growth, show the Street it's getting its spending under control, and continue driving recurring services revenue. If not, it will be a long, uphill climb for Palo Alto shareholders. I don't know about you, but I always pay attention when one of the best growth investors in the world gives me a stock tip.

" recently bought more shares of  (NASDAQ: CYBR) after the cybersecurity company posted solid sales and earnings growth on May 5. I previously started my position in CyberArk before that earnings release, and I discussed my  for doing so: its ""best in breed"" reputation in privileged accounts protection, solid fundamentals, new partnerships, and buyout potential.However, shares of CyberArk were recently dented by mixed earnings from industry peer  (NYSE: PANW) , which provides next-generation firewall protection for businesses.Palo Alto's 48% annual revenue growth, 61% billings growth, and 88% non-GAAP net income growth all looked impressive compared to previous quarters, but the stock fell 12% on May 27 because of soft guidance and its widening GAAP loss. Some analysts, like Wunderlich's Rob Breza, recommend buying Palo Alto after that big dip, but I believe the stock remains a less compelling buy than CyberArk for three simple reasons.Palo Alto's enterprise value to sales ratio of 9 remains much higher than comparable companies like CyberArk and  (NASDAQ: FEYE) , which have respective ratios of 6 and 4. Palo Alto bulls might argue that the stock deserves a higher multiple because of its stronger sales growth -- the company is expected to post 47% sales growth this year, compared to 31% for CyberArk and 28% for FireEye.However, Palo Alto's high valuation, along with its enterprise value of nearly $11 billion (which could require a $15 billion-plus buyout), arguably makes it a less attractive takeover target than either CyberArk or FireEye, which respectively have enterprise values of $1 billion and $2.4 billion.Moreover, CyberArk beats Palo Alto in terms of GAAP profitability. CyberArk's GAAP net income improved 2% annually to $4.3 million last quarter. That's not terribly impressive, but it gives CyberArk an actual P/E ratio (albeit a high one at around 60), which makes the stock easier to properly value. That profit is also much better than Palo Alto's GAAP net loss, which widened from $45.9 million to $70.2 million between the third quarters of 2015 and 2016.A big weight on Palo Alto's bottom line was stock-based compensation, which surged 76% to $112.7 million (33% of its revenue) last quarter. CyberArk spent around 31% of its revenue on stock-based compensation last quarter, but it has generally maintained tighter control over its other operating expenses than Palo Alto.CyberArk faces less competition than Palo Alto, because it's widely considered the market leader in the niche market of privileged account management (PAM). CyberArk secures the accounts of 40% of the Fortune 100 companies and 17 of the 20 biggest banks in the world, which prevents hackers and disgruntled employees from stealing data. Its only meaningful competitor in that space is  (NASDAQ: CA) , but research company IDC notes that CyberArk remains the ""  "" of the PAM market.Palo Alto faces much stiffer competition in the next-generation firewall market.  (NASDAQ: CHKP) , which previously expressed interest in buying CyberArk, offers a firewall that competes against Palo Alto's. Networking giant  (NASDAQ: CSCO) purchased cybersecurity companies Sourcefire and ThreatGRID to improve its next-generation firewall and threat prevention solutions. If Cisco's firewall options continue improving, and it aggressively bundles those services with its networking hardware, Palo Alto could lose market share and be forced to cut prices.CyberArk doesn't have to worry about any comparable threats for now. Moreover, CyberArk's recent certification from the U.S. Department of Defense will ensure it remains the ""best in breed"" player in the PAM market for the foreseeable future. Its  , which aligns its PAM interests with  , FireEye,  , and other major tech companies, will also widen its moat against potential rivals like CA.CyberArk and Palo Alto are both risky plays, but more reasonable valuations, better profitability, and less competition make the former is a more compelling investment than the latter. I'm keeping an eye on Palo Alto and will revisit the stock if it declines further, but I wouldn't consider its recent plunge to be a great buying opportunity.

"Image Source: Getty.According to industry-watchers, the question of which is the better buy,  (NASDAQ: FTNT) or  (NASDAQ: CHKP) , is a no-brainer. Check Point's consensus share price target of $86.91 is a mere 3% above its current price, while Fortinet's target of $41.19 a share is 22% above Tuesday's closing price of $33.75. But there a couple of other considerations.First, relying strictly on analysts to determine what is, or what isn't, an appropriate investment is rarely a good idea. Second, Fortinet has opted to forego earnings for now to fuel its impressive top-line growth, while Check Point CEO Gil Shwed prefers a slow but steady approach. High-flying sales gainers will always be more attractive to some investors, but consistent growth also has a place for the more risk adverse.Image source: .Image source:  .Fortinet reported a 34% jump in sales in the first quarter to $284.6 million, marking its third straight quarter of 30% or more top-line improvement, and that streak will likely continue. Fortinet founder and CEO Ken Xie's initiative to drive end-to-end platform solution sales is already beginning to pay dividends thanks to its new-ish security fabric architecture.The security fabric platform gives Fortinet customers the ability to monitor all points of their enterprise, including multivendor networks and cloud-based, big data security threats. This solution got a boost recently with its deal to buy cloud, Internet of Things, and advanced analytics security provider AccelOps for $28 million (though that price could rise to $32 million if it meets performance objectives).Fortinet's deferred revenue and billings also bode well for a continued string of quarterly revenue increases. Deferred revenue climbed to $837.2 million in Q1 -- a 39% year-over-year improvement -- and billings of $330.5 million were 30% higher than a year ago. Both results point to a strong and growing revenue pipeline.However, fueling Fortinet's impressive top-line growth has come at a steep price, as demonstrated by Q1's $3.43 million loss, compared to last year's meager (but still positive) $1.56 million net profit. What makes Fortinet's spending spree worrisome is that $147.4 million - equal to 52% of total sales - went to sales and marketing. Those high costs will continue to eat into Fortinet's bottom line, unlike one-time investments in infrastructure or developing new products.Image source: Check Point Software Technologies.Check Point has its own streak of revenue gains, though its sixth straight quarter of at least 9% top-line growth doesn't sound quite as impressive as Fortinet's. But Check Point's comparatively slow sales improvements only tells part of its story. It, too, saw a nice bump in deferred revenue last quarter -- that figure grew 14% to $883 million -- and Check Point is also gaining momentum from a recent offering: high-end, data center security appliances.With the growth of the cloud, IoT, and big data, the amount of information being amassed and securely stored in data centers is growing exponentially. Naturally, one of the leading concerns of tech and business executives is ensuring all that data is secure. Data centers are the right market to target, and according to Shwed, Check Point's new offering ""got off to a great start in the marketplace.""Check Point is also delivering on another key initiative: Driving recurring revenue via subscription sales. Though software updates and maintenance continue to make up the majority of Check Point revenue -- $193.4 million of its $404.3 million in total sales last quarter -- subscription revenues climbed over 18% to $88.13 million, easily making that the fastest growing of its three primary divisions.Here's another factor Check Point has going in its favor: It continually makes a profit. Last quarter's GAAP (including one-time items) net income of $0.95 a share was a 10% year-over-year improvement. Shwed's emphasis on slow but steady growth may not wow the Street as Fortinet's does, but there's something to be said for being consistently profitable.Though they're peers, the differences in how Fortinet and Check Point go about their businesses are striking. So which is the better buy? For investors comfortable with risk and inevitable stock price swings, Fortinet comes out on top. But for risk-averse investors who still want consistent (albeit slower) growth, Check Point is spot on.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

hares of  went down about 9.9% in after-hour trade yesterday in response to higher-than-expected loss during third-quarter fiscal 2016. Also, a tepid fourth-quarter earnings guidance impacted the share price.Also, higher operating expenses more than offset the benefits of robust revenue growth resulting in a wider year-over-year loss. Palo Alto Networks reported adjusted loss per share (excluding amortization and other one-time items but including stock-based compensation), on a proportionate tax basis, of 86 cents. The figure was significantly greater than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 28 cents. The company had suffered a loss of 46 cents in the year-ago quarter.Palo Alto Networks reported revenues of $345.8 million, which not only surged 47.7% year over year but also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $339 million. The improvement in revenues was primarily backed by the strength in the network security market, strong product line-up and deal wins.Product revenues jumped 33.4% to $162.1 million, mainly driven by strong contribution from the PA-7050 and PA-7080 frameworks. Also, a 63% surge in service revenues, primarily due to higher adoption of subscriptions and high renewal rates on a year-over-year basis, positively impacted results. SaaS-based subscription revenues (part of service revenues) climbed 69% from the year-ago period.Geographically, on a year-over-year basis, revenues from the Americas increased 56% and represented 71% of total revenue. Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) went up 34%, accounting for 18% of total revenue. Asia-Pacific was up 24% and brought in the rest of the total revenue.Also, customer wins coupled with expansion of the existing customer base supported quarterly revenues. Moreover, billings jumped 61% year over year to $486.2 million during the quarter.Palo Alto Networks' gross margin increased 10 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 72.6%, primarily backed by favorable product mix and higher revenue base.The company reported an operating loss of $58.6 million, which widened from a loss of $36.7 million suffered a year ago. Higher operating expenses (up approximately 50% year over year) also impacted operating results.The company's net loss came was $70.2 million, wider than a loss of $45.9 million reported last year. On a non-GAAP basis, net loss was $38.5 million compared with a loss of $20.5 million reported in the year-ago quarter.Palo Alto Networks exited the third quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $1.08 billion compared with $822.9 million in the previous quarter.Receivables were $267.6 million compared with $150.5 million in the last quarter. Palo Alto Networks' balance sheet does not have any long-term debt. The company reported cash flow from operations of $470.6 million during the nine months ended Apr 30, 2016. Free cash flow came in at $150.8 million during the quarter.For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, Palo Alto Networks expects revenues in the range of $386 million to $390 million (mid-point $388 million), up 36% to 37% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $384 million. The company expects non-GAAP earnings per share within 48 cents to 50 cents (excluding stock-based compensation expenses), while the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at a loss of 23 cents.Palo Alto Networks allows firms, service providers and government bodies to impose tighter security measures through its network security platform. The company reported wider-than-expected loss in the third quarter, while revenues comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Revenue growth seems to be steady, aided by strength across all its geographical regions and business segments. Also, customer wins coupled with expansion of the existing customer base positively impacted revenues. We believe that the company's product refreshes will boost revenues, going forward.The company is also keen on expanding its cloud exposure. Nevertheless, a volatile spending environment and competition from Cisco Systems, Inc.  and Check Point Software Technologies Ltd.  remain concerns.Currently, Palo Alto Networks has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in the broader technology sector is TiVo Inc.  , sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"ike many growth stocks,  '(NYSE: PANW) value has bounced all over the place in the past year, as its 52-week trading range of $111.09 to $200.55 per share attests to. Price fluctuations are to be expected for hyper-growth stocks, since the slightest inkling of either good or bad news can send investors scrambling.For the past month and half, give or take, Palo Alto has been in a downward spiral, losing about 16%. What does Palo Alto need to do to win back investors' confidence, not to mention perform at the level so many of its bullish analysts expect? There are a few steps Palo Alto can take that will go a long way toward turning its recent negative sentiment around.Image source:  .For an impressive seven straight quarters, Palo Alto has posted revenue gains of 50% or more, which is a string none of its immediate competitors -- including  (NASDAQ: FTNT) and  (NASDAQ: CHKP) -- can touch.Small-ish Fortinet, at least in comparison to Palo Alto and Check Point, has posted a few quarters of 30% or more of top-line growth, while Check Point's six straight quarters of 9% sales gains speaks to CEO Gil Shwed's slow-but-steady management approach. Clearly, Palo Alto's sales results drive its future success, and it will need more of the same to keep investors in its corner.The upcoming quarter will say a lot about Palo Alto shareholders: Its guidance for the current fiscal 2016 Q3 is for ""just"" 43% to 45% year-over-year revenue improvement. That may not be good enough given Palo Alto's recent track record of 50% plus, but 45% top-line improvement -- if it comes to that -- needs to be the low-end watermark: Anything less, and the rollercoaster ride begins anew.To Palo Alto's credit, last quarter's $334.7 million in sales was evenly split between its product and services divisions. Services' $164.8 million stood out since it's a key component of CEO Mark McLaughlin's plans to balance high growth with recurring services revenue. Despite the positives, Palo Alto has a couple of concerns.For one, Palo Alto spent over $55 million more in operating expenses and total revenue costs than it earned. That was 44% higher than the year-ago period. Palo Alto bulls may point out that its non-GAAP (excluding one-time items) earnings per share climbed over 50% in its fiscal 2016 Q2, which is true. But the thing is, non-GAAP results exclude, among other things, share-based compensation, which helps us segue to Palo Alto's biggest expense-related concern.A whopping $106.9 million was paid out in share-based compensation last quarter, the majority of which went to its sales folks. That equates to nearly 30% of Palo Alto's total overhead, and you can bet Palo Alto's salespeople won't settle for less going forward. It would be one thing if all of that spending was in the development of new products or infrastructure, but that's not the case. And that's why compensation expenses warrant a place near the top of McLaughlin's to-do list.One of Palo Alto's competitive advantages over Fortinet and Check Point is its enterprise security platform. Both Fortinet and Check Point offer piecemeal security solutions for its commercial and government customers, which explains why Palo Alto owns the largest share of the fast-growing enterprise market.Maintaining its platform solution market leadership position will be critical in the months and years ahead for Palo Alto to meet the Street's high expectations, as evidenced by its consensus $190 price target. But it won't be easy, as both Fortinet and Check Point have developed their own data center and platform security solutions. Fending off Check Point with its $404 million in revenue last quarter may prove to be Palo Alto's biggest challenge. By comparison, Fortinet generated $284.6 million in Q1.Palo Alto shareholders will be vulnerable to price fluctuations: That's the nature of the growth stock beast. However, continuing to drive impressive revenue results, getting a handle on expenses -- particularly ongoing costs -- and fending off competition will put Palo Alto back into investors' good graces.

he hype surrounding the cyber security industry has cooled down this year given a choppy stock market, reduced cyberattacks and lower spending on cybercrime. In fact, many stocks were crushed by concerns over high valuation. In addition, mixed earnings reports from the industry players have taken away the sheen that was left in this corner of the broad technology sector.Let's dig into the earnings results of some of the cyber security firms that have the largest allocation to the ETFs in this industry: reported earnings per share of 15 cents and revenues of $46.9 million, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 11 cents and $44 million, respectively. The company projects earnings per share in the range of 18-20 cents on revenues of $47.5-$48.5 million, up 31-33% year over year, for the ongoing second quarter. For 2016, revenues are expected to grow 30%-31% to $209-$211 million and earnings per share are projected in the band of 87-91 cents.The lower end of both the earnings projections was well above the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of 15 cents and 62 cents, respectively, while the mid-point of the revenue guidance was in line with our estimates. CYBR gained 2.5% following the earnings announcement on May 5 after the closing bell (read:  ). beat our earnings estimate but missed on revenues. Net loss per share came in at 83 cents, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 89 cents loss but revenues of $168 million fell shy of our estimated $172 million. FireEye expects revenues of $178-$185 million for the second quarter and cut its full-year outlook to $780-$810 million from $815-$845 million. The upper end of both the ranges is much below our estimate of $194 million for the quarter and $830 million for the year at the time of earnings release.Net loss per share is projected in the range of 38-48 cents for the ongoing quarter and $1.20-$1.27 for the full year. The midpoint of both projections was better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 78 cents and $2.92, respectively, at the time of earnings release. However, shares of FEYE have tumbled 16.2% to date following its earnings announcement on May 5 after the closing bell on a reduced revenue outlook. topped our estimates for both the top and the bottom lines by $0.3 million and 4 cents, respectively. It expects earnings per share of $1.02-$1.09 on revenues of $405-$435 million for the second quarter. The midpoint is well above our current estimate of 98 cents for earnings but below our estimate of $422 million for revenues.For the full year, revenues and earnings are expected in the range of $1.72-$1.79 billion and $4.45-$4.60, respectively. The midpoint of the revenue estimate is slightly below the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.75 billion while the earnings projection is above our estimate of $4.13, respectively. The stock has plummeted 7.2% since its earnings announcement on April 20 before the opening bell. posted wider-than-expected loss of 6 cents against the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 1 cent but surpassed our revenue estimate by $11 million. It projects revenues in the range of $301-$306 million and earnings per share of 14 cents for the ongoing second quarter. Both were above our estimates of $300 million and 4 cents, respectively, for revenues and earnings at the time of the earnings release.For 2016, the company raised its revenue guidance from $1.25-$1.26 billion to $1.262-$1.272 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of 26% and was pegged above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.253 billion. Earnings per share are now expected in the range of 69-71 cents compared to the previous guidance of 67-69 cents. This was much above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 25 cents at the time of earnings release. The stock has risen nearly 6% following the Q1 earnings announcement on April 26 after the closing bell.Last but not the least,  lagged our estimates for both the top and the bottom lines by 4 cents and $35 million, respectively. For the second quarter, the company expects earnings per share in the range of 44-50 cents and revenues in the range of $1.16-$1.22 billion.

"ased on the beating its stock price took out-of-the-gate following fiscal third-quarter earnings results, it's safe to say  (NYSE: PANW) investors and pundits were not amused. The problems with Palo Alto's recent quarter range from increased spending to poor guidance and slowing revenue growth. And to make matters worse, it's a healthy dose of all three.Despite landing on the wrong side of the earnings fence, Palo Alto responded positively in one of its primary initiatives: boosting its source of recurring revenue. However, as noted in a recent  leading up to the May 26 announcement, Palo Alto investors' patience was only going to be tested for so long. At some point the company needs to perform beyond growing its top line, and it's running out of time.CEO Mark McLaughlin tried to temper expectations after reporting Palo Alto's second-quarter results by forecasting a 43% to 45% revenue improvement in Q3, ending its nearly two-year-long streak of reporting 50% or more quarterly sales growth. Palo Alto didn't quite reach the remarkable 50% revenue jump this past (fiscal third) quarter, but delivered a pleasantly surprising 48% gain, to $345.8 million. Analysts had expected sales of $339.48 million.On the earnings-per-share front, Palo Alto hit its high-end forecast of $0.42 on a non-GAAP (excluding one-time items) basis, which also matched pundits' expectations. Fiscal Q3 billings rose a whopping 61% last quarter, to $486.2 million, which would seemingly be a positive sign of what is to come in the current fiscal Q4. But it is not to be.If not reaching 50% revenue growth is partly to blame for Palo Alto's stock price nosedive, its forecast for the current quarter will be downright depressing. On the high end of McLaughlin's forecast, Palo Alto expects 37% revenue growth to end its fiscal year, or $390 million.On a more positive note, Palo Alto's services unit grew a whopping 63%, to $183.7 million, in Q3, and now represents 53% of total sales. Service sales, and the recurring revenue they generate, are a critical initiative for Palo Alto, and they took a step in the right direction last quarter.As noted before, Palo Alto has been on a spending spree for years to drive its stellar 50%-plus revenue jumps. But with growth beginning to slow -- Q3's results and this quarter's guidance are proof of that -- minimizing costs has become a necessity, not a nicety. The problem is, McLaughlin and team can't seem to keep their checkbooks in their pockets.A comparison with Palo Alto's peer and primary competitor,  (NASDAQ: CHKP) , demonstrates why the former's stock is down 26% year to date, and the latter's is up 3%. Palo Alto's total operating expenses of $309.5 million equaled 90% of sales. Check Point, on the other hand, spent 50% of last quarter's $404.3 million in revenue on its operating expenses.As for cost of revenue, Palo Alto spent $94.9 million to drive its product and services sales, more than twice Check Point Software's $45 million last quarter. Is it any wonder Check Point is profitable, on both a GAAP (including one-time items) and non-GAAP basis? And Check Point's profits continue to climb, too, rising 10% last quarter.Considering Palo Alto's slowing revenue growth and increased spending, it could be years before shareholders are in the black. Unfortunately, it gets worse because of the nature of Palo Alto's skyrocketing expenses. Check Point's sales and marketing costs equaled 23% of revenue in fiscal Q1, whereas Palo Alto's $202 million ate up a head-shaking 58% of its total sales last quarter. When investors add it all up, the answer is fairly straightforward: Slowing top-line growth was inevitable, but continuing to spend indiscriminately is not. Until McLaughlin reins in overheads, even improvement in services unit sales and the recurring revenue that comes with it won't be enough to placate shareholders. Nor should it be.

"As Sony Pictures prepared to release actor/director Seth Rogen's film The Interview in late 2014, the studio hadn't thought through its defenses. The dubious comedy, a send up of North Korean politics and leadership, engendered ill will with the real McCoy. North Korean hackers easily found their way through the Swiss-cheese firewall protecting the company's network.The hack quickly led to public file-sharing sites being deluged with four unreleased  (  ) films, 47,000 social security numbers and executives' private emails. In addition, threats of a 9/11-style attack on theaters viewing The Interview prompted Sony to initially scrap its release.(The film was later released on demand and in select theaters.)From a technology standpoint, Sony's response was what IDC analyst Laura Stuart calls a ""fantasy"" for most chief information security officers. It entirely ripped out and replaced its cybersecurity fabric, removing outmoded tech for next-generation iterations.Such dream moves are well beyond budget for most CISOs, Stuart says. ""The cost of that would, of course, be hard to get approved in most cases,"" she told IBD in an email.In January, an FBR analyst estimated only 15% of all firewalls employed next-generation cybersecurity. That leaves miles of headroom for firewall peddlers like  (  ),  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ) to secede older systems.Rumors of an IT spending slowdown followed gloomy forecasts from vendors like  (LNKD) and  (DATA) and sent cybersecurity stocks into a nose dive early this year. The selling sent IBD's 25-stock Computer Software-Security industry group down 32% in January through mid-February. The industry has not recovered as quickly as some others off its February lows, and on Friday was still down 13% for the year.Funny thing: The rumored spending pause never materialized, says Dougherty analyst Catharine Trebnick. In fact, a November 2015 Firemon survey of 600 IT professionals found that just half had implemented next-generation firewalls (NGFW) into their security infrastructure, up from a third the year earlier.""Although the market may be more saturated, we believe vendors such as Palo Alto Networks and Fortinet will continue to have room for several more quarters of strong growth replacing legacy systems,"" she wrote in an April 1 research report.Legacy firewalls act as a perimeter separating hackers from internal networks and operations. Once that perimeter is breached, the firewall can't prevent a hacker from roaming. That's where its next-generation cousin steps in. A next generation firewall acts as a platform from which a variety of security measures can operate.Broadly, that's where Wall Street expects the cybersecurity industry to settle. ""Platform"" has become an oft-repeated industry buzzword and platform-hucksters have played it up big. But analysts say the concept carries some weight.Across the board, IT professionals seemingly recognize the need for next-generation tech. Of Firemon's 600 respondents, 90.8% identified firewalls as critical as ever or more critical than ever to security operations.The number of IT pros with no NGFW dipped to 6.7%. Roughly half completely switched to NGFWs, leaving the balance operating on a mixture of both. Mixing tech is expensive and requires companies to retain expertise in both, William Blair analyst Jonathan Ho tells IBD.It's also insufficient.""The legacy tech still functions in terms of blocking points of protocols ... so it's not obsolete,"" he said. ""But that's no longer good enough in this environment. Some people leave (legacy tech) in place and buy solutions to augment. Some organizations just rip it out completely.""Last year, a comprehensive government review found civilian agencies spent 71% of their total IT budgets (about $36 billion) on maintaining legacy systems. Obama spurred progress with a $3.1 billion windfall -- part of a 35% increase to the $19 billion federal cybersecurity budget.The Information Technology Modernization Fund enables ""the retirement, replacement and modernization of legacy IT that is difficult to secure and expensive to maintain."" It also created a federal CISO position, now held by Tony Scott.For all the federal government's alleged hacking prowess, its cybersecurity is notoriously lax in some segments. Last June, north of 21 million people were exposed when hackers broke into the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. That followed a 2014 phishing attack that affected 800,000 U.S. Postal Service employees.According to a report from TheHill.com, OPM spent 80% of its fiscal 2014 budget on old IT, including a 60-year-old coding language, COBOL. Nearly $70 million was allocated to operations and maintenance, leaving $14 million for modernization.Obama's goal is to ensure ""individual agencies are not left on their own to defend themselves against the most sophisticated threats,"" according to a White House blog post. IT systems will, eventually, be replaced by more efficient, effective and secure solutions.That $3.1 billion seed is expected to fund $12 billion in modernization projects over 10 years, the White House estimates. Agencies are required to repay the funds used to upgrade their IT systems.But the government is a Johnny-come-lately to that modernization trend and will likely find itself riddled with red tape as organizations attempt to take advantage of that $3.1 billion, William Blair's Ho says. The private sector, on the other hand, embraced the trend early on.In 2013 and 2014, massive breaches at retailers  (TGT) and  (HD) threw gas on the cybersecurity fire -- prompting the proliferation of numerous point solutions, IDC's Stuart tells IBD. Most public cybersecurity companies filed their IPOs within the last decade.There has been ""a pattern of companies adopting ever more security products as point solutions plugging holes here and there and practically everywhere,"" she says. For that reason, most companies take an additive, incremental approach to cybersecurity.Now, the platform is establishing its dominance and giving vendors the chance to one-up each other.""What you're going to see in the next two to three years is winning vendors of those new point products expanding to provide more complete solutions again,"" she said. ""That level of integration works better on a product and technology level.""And dealing with fewer vendors is ultimately more effective, she says.Dougherty's Trebnick and William Blair's Ho agree. A company utilizing 30-40 vendors will be hard-pressed to track down the origin of a breach, Ho says. Trebnick says the small- and medium-business segment is now transitioning to platform solutions.""IT organizations believe platforms represent a simpler architecture,"" she wrote in a report. ""They may lack some functionality offered by best-of-breed solutions (but) enterprises are increasingly OK buying from a singular vendor due to price savings and tighter integrations.""By market share, Cisco, Check Point, Palo Alto Networks, Fortinet and  (INTC) McAfee lead the appliance firewall market, IDC wrote in a March report. In 2015, that market grew 9.9% year over year. Palo Alto and Fortinet led, with sales growth of 49.2% and 28.3%, respectively.Piper Jaffray analyst Andrew Nowinski doesn't see much rip-and-replace (like Sony's self evisceration) in 2016. Rather, he sees competitive displacements and a widespread firewall refresh as companies retire older (but not necessarily legacy) products from service.A survey of 26 vendors found that Palo Alto Networks is scooping share from Cisco and Check Point, Nowinski noted. IDC's data partially backs that up. On a year-over-year basis, Palo Alto Networks, Fortinet and Check Point gained share.Cisco lost market share, falling to 14.7% from 16.1% of the overall pie, but continued to lead the industry in 2015.Nowinski expects that trend to continue. Rivals will replace one another, and themselves, in 2016 as technology increasingly modernizes and vendors offer add-on services to their platform solutions.A Palo Alto NGFW, for example, lasts four to seven years, he said.""So, as you reach that time frame, a customer will refresh their firewall to the next-generation firewall,"" he said told IBD. ""And they'll deploy some new subscriptions with that because you need more processing power to run Wildfire and advanced threat protection.""Palo Alto Networks is currently in its 2010-2011 cohort -- meaning it could replace itself or another company could swipe the contract.""I know the overall investor sentiment is the firewall is well-penetrated and slowing growth,"" he said. ""But I think the reality is there's still a big opportunity for vendors to replace the firewalls even in their own installed base.""The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Rip-And-Refresh Battle Pits Cisco, Palo Alto, Fortinet, Check Point@2016-04-29@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/rip-and-refresh-battle-pits-cisco-palo-alto-fortinet-check-point-2016-04-29

hares of  gained over 9% during yesterday's after-hour trade following better-than-expected top-line results for first-quarter 2016 and an encouraging outlook for second-quarter and fiscal 2016.Nevertheless, Fortinet's bottom line results were quite disappointing. The network security solution provider's adjusted loss per share (excluding one-time items but including stock-based compensation) of 6 cents compared unfavorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 1 cent and came in contrast to the year-ago quarter earnings of 1 cent.Fortinet reported first quarter revenues of $284.6 million, up 33.7% from the year-ago quarter. Revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $273 million and exceeded the guided range of $270-$275 million. Segment-wise, Product revenues jumped 27.8% year over year to $124.6 million, and Services and Other revenues surged 38.7% to $115.4 million.The year-over-year improvement was primarily aided by strength in the network security market. A large number of deal wins and customer additions during the quarter also contributed to the robust top line.Billings increased 30% on a year-over-year basis to $330 million.Gross profit increased 38.5% from the year-ago quarter to $206.8 million. Moreover, gross margin expanded 260 basis points (bps) year over year to 72.7%, primarily due to sales of higher value subscription bundles.Higher-than-expected adjusted operating expenses (up 40.1% year over year) affected operating results negatively. As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses increased 330 bps to 72.9%. Adjusted operating loss during the quarter came in at $787 million as against a profit of $114.2 million in the year-ago quarter.Fortinet exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $952.6 million, up from $891.4 million at the end of the previous quarter. Accounts receivable were $220.1 million compared with $259.6 million at the end of the fourth quarter.During the quarter, the company generated cash flow of $100.6 million. Free cash flow for the quarter came in at $70.6 million. The company repurchased 2 million shares worth $50.0 million during the quarter.For the second quarter, management expects revenues in the range of $301-$306 million and earnings per share of roughly 14 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues and earnings are pegged at $300 million and 4 cents, respectively. Billings are expected to be in the range of $365 million to $370 million in the second quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be approximately 73%, whereas, non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be around 12%.Fortinet raised its 2016 guidance. The company now expects revenues in the range of $1.262 billion to $1.272 billion (previously $1.25 billion to $1.26 billion), representing a year-over-year increase of 26%. The revenue guidance is also above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.253 billion. Earnings per share are now anticipated between 69 cents and 71 cents (previous guidance 67 cents and 69 cents), much higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 25 cents.Fortinet's network security solutions include firewall, VPN, application control, antivirus, intrusion prevention, web filtering, anti-spam and WAN acceleration. The company reported mixed first-quarter results, wherein the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the bottom line compared unfavorably with the same.Nonetheless, we are encouraged by Fortinet's second-quarter and fiscal 2016 guidance. Despite the persistent macro uncertainty, the company seems positive on the back of healthy network security market, solid product line-up and investment plans.However, competition from key network security players such as Cisco Systems Inc.  , Check Point  , Juniper Networks  and Palo Alto Networks, remains a concern. Nonetheless, product ramp-ups, deal wins, continuous growth in the network security market and expected benefits from the ongoing investments remain positives.Currently, Fortinet has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"he number of personal records exposed in data breaches worldwide nearly doubled to 169 million in 2015, according to the Identity Theft Resource Center. That surge has fueled strong demand for cybersecurity services. Research firm Markets and Markets estimates that the global cybersecurity market will grow from $106.3 billion in 2015 to $170.2 billion by 2020.Yet that market remains heavily fragmented, with companies offering different bundles of services. Meanwhile, many cybersecurity stocks were crushed over the past year due to concerns about their high valuations in a choppy market. The  , which contains a basket of these top stocks, has fallen more than 20% over the past 12 months. These two factors have fueled speculation that the entire cybersecurity sector could undergo a major consolidation later this year. Let's take a look at two big buyouts which could occur if that happens.FireEye's real-time threat map. Image source: FireEye. , the world's top firewall provider, could also be interested in making a major cybersecurity purchase to juice up its sales, which rose 9% annually last quarter. At the top of the list is  , which protects privileged accounts and isolates threats within a network for 40% of the Fortune 100 companies and 17 of the world's 20 biggest banks. Yet its stock has tumbled around 40% over the past year due to concerns about slowing sales growth and competition from larger firms.Back in January, Check Point reportedly held takeover talks with CyberArk, which could complement its acquisition of two cybersecurity start-ups in 2015. At the time, Barclays analyst Saket Kalia said that the acquisition ""would be a net positive with added growth and expense synergies"" for Check Point. Oppenheimer & Co. analyst Shaul Eyal disagreed, noting that the smaller size of CheckPoint's most recent cybersecurity acquisitions (which were both under $200 million) indicated that there was ""a low probability"" that it would buy CyberArk, which has an enterprise value of $930 million.However, Check Point could certainly afford to pay a hefty premium for CyberArk, since it finished last quarter with $3.7 billion in cash, marketable securities, and short-term deposits. CyberArk's sales are expected to rise 29% to $207 million this year, which would be equivalent to about 12% of CheckPoint's estimated sales this year. CyberArk is also profitable on a GAAP basis, which means that it wouldn't become a dead weight on Check Point's bottom line like many of its unprofitable peers. More importantly, bundling CyberArk's ""best in breed"" privileged accounts protection services with its market-leading firewall could sharpen its competitive edge against other IT security firms. I believe that Cisco will stay away from FireEye for now, because it likely believes that ThreatGRID already widens its moat against FireEye in the threat prevention market. But if FireEye continues to fall, Cisco might try to buy the company at a steep discount. Check Point's purchase of CyberArk seems more likely, since the companies have already held talks, but the lack of subsequent news suggests that a deal won't happen anytime soon. Investors shouldn't buy shares of FireEye of CyberArk expecting a big buyout, but they should keep an eye on these two stocks and the overall sector for signs of a major consolidation.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

 is set to report first-quarter 2016 results on Apr 26. Last quarter, the company reported lower-than-expected earnings. Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Fortinet offers network security solutions, including firewall, VPN, application control, antivirus, intrusion prevention, web filtering, anti-spam and WAN acceleration. Although, the company's last quarter's bottom-line results were disappointing, we are encouraged by its strong top-line growth.Despite the lingering macro uncertainty, the company seems positive on the back of a healthy network security market, strong product line-up, deal wins and investment plans which should boost revenues in the first quarter.The demand for cyber security is on the rise and the previous quarterly results show that Fortinet is gaining from it. Notably, the company has been witnessing a higher number of large deal signings over the past few quarters which should aid results in the to-be-reported quarter.With the advancement in technology, more organizations are adopting the bring-your-own-device (BYOD) policy, which has enhanced employee productivity with anytime, anywhere access, while making it all the more necessary for the organizations to enforce stringent data security measures.However, we anticipate Fortinet's bottom-line results to be impacted by continuous investments in research and development and marketing strategies. Competition from key network security players such as Cisco Systems Inc., Check Point  , Juniper Networks and Palo Alto Networks also raise concern.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Fortinet will beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at a loss per share of a penny. Hence, the difference is 0.00%. Fortinet currently has a Zacks Rank #3 which when combined with a 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are a couple of companies which you may consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Barracuda Networks, Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +200.00% and a Zacks Rank #1.Align Technology Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +12.82% and a Zacks Rank #1.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"ybersecurity stocks have fallen out of favor over the past year, despite the ongoing escalation of data breaches worldwide. The  , which owns a basket of top cybersecurity stocks, has lost over 20% of its value over the past 12 months, presumably due to concerns regarding the sector's profitability, valuation, and competition from tech giants like  .Image source: Pixabay.However, I recently started a position in Israeli cybersecurity firm  , which has declined nearly 40% over the past 12 months. Here are my top four reasons for doing so. CyberArk specializes in the protection of privileged accounts, which are often accessed by hackers to gain access to restricted networks. If an account is compromised, CyberArk's software isolates the threat to prevent it from spreading across networks. 's annual Data Breach Investigations Report revealed that nearly 8% of data breaches in 2015 were caused by the misuse of privileged accounts -- which CyberArk specializes in containing. CyberArk's clients currently include 40% of the Fortune 100 companies and 17 of the 20 biggest banks in the world. The company's privileged account security platform is also the only one approved by the U.S. Department of Defense. The strength of CyberArk's customer base boosted its revenue 42% annually to $51.5 million last quarter.Last year, the number of personal records exposed in data breaches worldwide nearly doubled  to 169 million, according to the Identity Theft Resource Center. 40% of those breaches occurred in businesses, 36% in healthcare facilities, 9% in banks, 8% in the government, and 7% in education. CyberArk has a strong presence across all those markets, and demand will likely rise as attacks become more sophisticated. A common bearish argument against CyberArk is that larger rivals like firewall provider  and Cisco will strengthen their privileged account abilities and undercut CyberArk with cheaper bundles.That's why CyberArk recently launched the C3 Alliance, a group of companies which have agreed to integrate privileged account security into their own products. Early members of the alliance, which  calls the ""Justice League for privileged account protection"", include major tech players like  , threat prevention leader  , and antivirus software maker  . This move, along with its massive enterprise footprint and DoD certification, significantly widens its moat against bigger rivals. Many of CyberArk's cybersecurity peers, including Palo Alto and FireEye, are unprofitable on a GAAP basis. Yet CyberArk is profitable by both non-GAAP and GAAP measures, thanks to its more disciplined spending strategies. Last quarter, CyberArk's GAAP net income rose 48% annually to $9.9 million, while non-GAAP net income jumped 92% to $13.8 million.Looking ahead, analysts expect CyberArk to post 25% annual earnings growth over the next five years. That makes its forward P/E of 37 look a bit high, but it's much lower than Palo Alto's forward P/E of 58. CyberArk's trailing 12-month EV/FCF ratio of 20 is also much lower than Palo Alto's ratio of 29, indicating that it's cheaper relative to its free cash flow growth. CyberArk dominates a niche cybersecurity market, is profitable, has a decent valuation and no debt -- making it an ideal takeover target for bigger tech companies looking to add privileged account protection to their security portfolios. CyberArk's enterprise value of $970 million also makes it a fairly affordable purchase.Firewall provider  held talks to buy CyberArk in January, according to TheMarker, but there haven't been any new developments since then. Oppenheimer & Co. analyst Shaul Eyal noted that the smaller size of CheckPoint's recent cybersecurity acquisitions, which were under $200 million, indicated that there was a ""low probability"" that it would buy CyberArk. Nonetheless, CheckPoint can still afford to pay -- it finished last quarter with $3.7 billion in cash, marketable securities, and short-term deposits. I plan to average into CyberArk over the next year by buying the stock two or three more times, since it's been prone to wild price swings. CyberArk will report its first quarter earnings on May 5, and a big swing either way could represent another buying opportunity -- provided that the business remains in solid shape.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

" recently weighed the  of buying shares of security and storage appliance vendor  . In that article, I concluded that Barracuda would likely be marginalized by larger companies, which would cause billings and subscriber renewals to decline. It also seemed like the company has thrown in the towel by trying to sell itself, but a potential suitor has yet to emerge.With its fiscal fourth quarter earnings report right around the corner, we should take a look at the two biggest threats facing Barracuda today, and whether or not those challenges will cause it to miss expectations.Image source: Pixabay The biggest threat to Barracuda today is competition. The company is fairly small, with an enterprise value of $680 million, yet its revenue is growing at a much slower rate than bigger direct competitors in the security space like  and  . Barracuda's quarterly revenue has risen between 14% to 19% annually over the past four quarters, compared to more than 50% growth for Palo Alto and around 40% for Imperva. Barracuda expects sales to rise just 11% to 14% for the current quarter.In its most recent 10-K filing, Barracuda warns that the company faces ""intense competition in the security and storage markets"" and that it expects ""competition to increase in the future from larger, well-established competitors and new market entrants."" The company classifies these competitors into two groups. The first group consists of ""independent network security, storage and application delivery vendors"" like Imperva, Palo Alto,  , and  . The second group includes ""diversified IT suppliers"" like  and  .Barracuda warns that many of these larger players ""have acquired large security specialist vendors in recent years."" Cisco, for example, now bundles networking hardware and security solutions into its UCS (unified computing systems) for data centers. Hewlett-Packard acquired Aruba Networks last year to complement its enterprise storage business with networking hardware and services. These moves make it tough for any cybersecurity company which isn't classified as a ""best in breed"" solution to remain competitive. To make matters worse, Barracuda is heavily dependent on sales of physical storage and security appliances -- a market which is losing ground to virtual and cloud-based solutions. Barracuda's most attractive quality is its low enterprise value and valuation. Its EV/sales ratio of 2.2 is considerably lower than Palo Alto's ratio of 10.9 and Imperva's ratio of 5.2. That's probably why the company reportedly started working with  in February to find a buyer. Unfortunately, Barracuda is a slow-growth underdog in a market that values high-growth ""best in breed"" leaders.While it's true that a market consolidation of the fragmented security and storage market will likely occur in the near future, there are also simply more promising targets for buyers to consider.  , which offers a ""best in breed"" threat prevention solution certified by the Department of Homeland Security, currently trades below its IPO price with an enterprise value of $2.3 billion. Persistent rumors have suggested that Cisco or Hewlett-Packard could acquire it in the near future. Back in January, Check Point was reportedly holding acquisition talks with  , another ""best in breed"" player which protects privileged accounts for 40% of the Fortune 100 companies. CyberArk has an enterprise value of just $930 million and is profitable on a GAAP basis -- unlike Barracuda, which will likely remain unprofitable for the foreseeable future.With higher-growth companies like FireEye and CyberArk topping larger companies' list of potential security-related acquisitions, Barracuda simply doesn't seem like a great deal. If Barracuda doesn't get acquired, it could give up most of its 50%+ gains from the past three months, which were mainly fueled by those buyout hopes. Barracuda is a company that faces serious headwinds which won't dissipate anytime soon. Contrarian investors who are looking for signs of a turnaround should see if its renewal rate -- which hit its lowest level since going public last quarter -- improves and billings growth turns positive. If it fails to accomplish both things when it reports earnings on April 26, investors should steer clear of this troubled stock.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

It's also outside 10% of its closing record, set last August.One unique attribute about Israeli stocks is that they eschew long-term liabilities in favor of sustainable growth. Among the top 10 publicly traded companies in Israel by market capitalization, exactly half of them feature no debt on their balance sheets. Compare that to the top 10 American companies, where that ratio is 0%.While that means that many Israeli stocks forfeit the chance of crazy valuation spurts, it also limits their exposure to the whims of capital markets.  , Israeli stocks are generally the lenders, not the borrowers!In the spirit of the Passover season, Israeli stocks are supported by an underlying economic system that is arguably more stable than its Western counterparts. Thus, they are more likely to better absorb bearish markets.This was demonstrated most conspicuously during the 2008 global financial crisis. While Israeli stocks were certainly affected by the broad downturn, the country had  and maintained a healthy fiscal surplus. The end result spared Israel the brunt of the financial crisis.As the U.S. markets slug forward under a mixed earnings season, the stability and potential of Israeli stocks may be the best solution for investors.Cybersecurity is too big of an industry to miss, which should bode very well for information technology firm  (  ). Over the past decade, the U.S. government alone  on cybersecurity solutions. Embarrassing data breaches have negatively impacted well-known companies like  (  ) and  (  ). These and other developments play perfectly into the hands of CHKP, which has been at the  since 1993.As an investment, the stats on CHKP are compelling. Since 2010, annual revenue has grown an average of more than 10%. In addition, CHKP has some of the highest profitability margins in the IT security industry. This is evidenced by Check Point's annual earnings per share growth, which clocks in at 10%.Similar to many Israeli stocks, CHKP has no debt on its balance sheet. The company also maintains consistently strong free cash flow.From a technical viewpoint, CHKP has admittedly run into choppy waters. However, the IT firm is up 4% year-to-date, despite taking a 3% hit in the markets yesterday when it released its earnings results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2016. Although CHKP provided an earnings beat, Wall Street didn't take kindly to its  .But in the long run, CHKP is significantly more stable than its rivals. That could really become meaningful if the broad markets fail to spark confidence for the rest of this year.One thing is clear - cyber criminals won't miss an opportunity to exploit network weaknesses. Due to its strong position in a growing industry, CHKP has more upside potential than downside.It has been quite an interesting few weeks for technology firm  (  ). The leader in  - industry term for self-driving cars - received a big boost in the markets last month after a significant development in the automotive industry.On March 17, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced that major automakers have voluntarily committed to make automated emergency braking a  on almost all U.S. vehicles by 2022. Needless to say, the potential increase in consumer base for MBLY is huge.In fact, MBLY has one of the better bullish arguments among stocks in the self-driving sector. The company claims that millions of cars have already incorporated its automation program. The MBLY system is also compatible with  luxury cars, as well as vehicles produced by  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ).More importantly, its system can be installed on  . If rumors pan out and  (  ) joins the self-driving fray, MBLY can probably add another important customer to its growing list.Where MBLY loses some investors is in its financials. Although revenue and earnings in FY2015 jumped substantially from the prior year, the overall performance has been somewhat shaky. For example, net income was negative in three of the past five years.There are also rumblings by some analysts that MBLY is too tethered to its relationship with Tesla. A fallout there could mean troubling times ahead.However, MBLY is not a one-trick pony. Don't miss an opportunity to get on board a company leading a technological revolution.Among Israeli stocks, agricultural resource provider  (  ) has arguably the greatest fundamental challenge heading into the Passover holiday. Despite the fact that ICL is one of the  to the Chinese, Indian and European markets, the company lost over 42% of its equity value last year. Weakness globally for potash prices have not only pressured ICL, its competitors  (  ) and  (  ) have seen even worse damage.On the other hand, efforts by ICL to move forward under difficult circumstances appears to be winning supporters on Wall Street. In mid-March, the company announced that it will reduce capital expenditures and cut overhead for the remainder of this year by an additional $50 million. Since that announcement, ICL stock is up more than 9%. Even more surprising for investors is that ICL has cleared 21% YTD.Could a comeback rally take Israel Chemicals to the Promised Land?Unlike several other Israeli stocks, ICL has considerably expanded its debt exposure relative to its on-hand cash -  ! However, ICL has mitigated some of the damage from declining revenues by controlling its costs. As a result, ICL has very favorable profitability margins relative to its industry.Further, potash stocks broadly are experiencing a surge in the markets this month. This suggests that a rising tide may lift all boats.Because of the potash volatility last year, ICL is the most speculative of the Passover bets featured on this list. Nevertheless, momentum could be Israel Chemicals' best friend.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@3 Israeli Stocks You Can’t “Passover” – CHKP, MBLY, ICL@2016-04-21@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-israeli-stocks-you-cant-passover-chkp-mbly-icl-2016-04-21

"id  have a good quarter? The initial downward stock market reaction after the company reported this morning would indicate no, but given the moving parts in its numbers and how its near-term earnings are being affected by long-term strategic decisions, the answer might not be so simple to discern. Let's take a closer look at what went on with Check Point's first-quarter results and its guidance. Revenue of $404 million came in ahead of the bottom of management's guidance for $395 million to $410 million, and non-GAAP EPS of $1.06 was above the $0.99 to $1.05 range given on the previous .That's all well and good, but the market may not have been impressed with the guidance numbers, or at least the headline guidance numbers:Aside from the cautionary remarks, the revenue forecast is probably what scared the market. The midpoint of second-quarter revenue guidance implies a year-over-year growth rate of 6.2%, compared to the 8.5% recorded in the first quarter. Given that operating income margin declined to 50% from 52.9% in the same period last year, is Check Point's growth slowing at a time of declining margin? Not so fast. For the following three reasons, the reality is somewhat different than the headline numbers suggest.First, revenue isn't necessarily the best way to judge Check Point's progress. The company reports revenue from three different streams, a breakout of which can be seen in the table below. Essentially, Check Point operates a so-called razor-and-blade model, whereby hardware products are sold that then help generate software blade sales and software and maintenance sales.
  
ALL DATA FOR THE FIRST QUARTER. However, products are also sold bundled with software blades, and Check Point is adding more and more new blades to the bundles it sells. Moreover, there is a key difference between product and license sales and software blade sales. The former is immediately recognized in the profit and loss figures, but much of the latter's subscription revenue is recognized over time.Therefore, as Check Point adds more software blades to its product/blades bundles, more revenue will get shifted to its deferred revenue line (on the balance sheet) from its product revenue (profit and loss). Indeed, management said that in the second quarter, $5 million to $10 million would be shifted in this manner.Adding the midpoint of this estimate ($7.5 million) to the midpoint of second-quarter revenue guidance of $405 million to $435 million produces revenue guidance of $427.5 million, representing year-over-year growth of 8.2% -- a healthier number than the midpoint figure of 6.2% discussed above.As you can see below, growth rates remain strong for software blade subscriptions:DATA SOURCE: CHECK POINT SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGIES LTD. PRESENTATIONS.Second, operating income margin is in decline partly because Check Point is investing in sales and marketing in order to drive future growth. For example, selling and marketing expenses increased 21% to $91.8 million in the quarter, driving an overall operating expenses increase of 15%. In a sense, this is a sign of increasing competition, confirmed as rival network security company is doing the same thing. Fortinet's fourth-quarter 2015 sales and marketing expenses increased a whopping 47% as the company seeks to expand its installed base.Third, other key metrics increased handsomely for Check Point in the quarter. As you can see below, deferred revenue growth of 14% in the quarter keeps up the track record of mid-teen rate increases. Meanwhile, operating cash flow increased 13.4% in the quarter -- a far greater number than the operating income growth rate of 2.6%.DATA SOURCE: CHECK POINT SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGIES LTD. PRESENTATIONS. Check Point's headline guidance may have disappointed, but when adjusted for the anticipated shift from product to deferred revenue, it looks a lot better. Management has also in the past proved conservative in guidance. Meanwhile, cash flow and deferred revenue remains strong.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

n Apr 7, 2016, Zacks  downgraded  to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). Going by the Zacks model, companies holding a Zacks Rank #5 are likely to underperform the broader market.The company reported second-quarter fiscal 2016 adjusted loss per share (excluding amortization and other one-time items but including stock-based compensation), on a proportionate tax basis, of 83 cents. The figure was significantly greater than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 20 cents. The company had suffered a loss of 42 cents in the year-ago quarter.Adding to the woes, the company faces stiff competition from several big and small players in the security application market. Further, over the past few years, the demand for IT security has been on the rise driven by increasing awareness and cyber-attacks, making the market more attractive for new players.Also, there are some established players in the adjacent markets like Cisco Systems, Inc.  , Check Point Software Technologies Ltd.  and Juniper Networks, Inc.  that can cross sell security products and include security into their existing product lines, further intensifying competition in the space.Moreover, a dismal overall trend resulted in downward estimate revisions for Palo Alto. Over the last 60 days, four out of five estimates were revised downward for fiscal 2016. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for loss also moved down by 43 cents to a loss of $1.04 per share over the same time frame.It is worth mentioning that the recent forecast for worldwide IT spending by Gartner raises concerns about Palo Alto's near-term performance. The research firm expects worldwide IT spending to increase just 0.6% year over year in 2016 to $3.54 trillion. Gartner cited the stronger dollar as the reason behind the weak outlook. Notably, 2015 witnessed the largest U.S. dollar drop in IT spending, since the research firm started tracking the expenses. Last year, worldwide IT spending declined approximately 5.8% year over year or $216 billion to $3.52 trillion. Gartner also predicts that 2014 worldwide IT spending levels of about $3.74 billion won't be surpassed until 2019. Although the research firm has not commented on IT security spending, but a persistent softness in overall IT spending may negatively impact this industry too.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"teve Wozniak recently told  that ""cyber attacks and hacking"" were ""getting worse and worse year by year."" He's right: the Identity Theft Resource Center claims that the number of personal records exposed in data breaches surged 97% to 169 million in 2015. That's why research firm Markets and Markets believes that the global cybersecurity market will grow from $106.3 billion in 2015 to $170.2 billion by 2020.FireEye's real-time threat detection map. Image source: FireEye. CyberArk's software protects ""privileged"" accounts, which are often exploited to gain access to sensitive data. It also isolates threats once they breach a company's firewalls by locking down compromised computers or networks. Like FireEye, CyberArk has a ""best in breed"" reputation at what it does -- 40% of the Fortune 100 and 17 of the world's 20 biggest banks  use its services.CyberArk's revenue  rose 42% annually to $51.5 million last quarter, compared to 43% growth in the previous quarter and 81% growth a year earlier. License revenue -- which supports its maintenance and services revenue -- rose 35% to $33 million, compared to 49% growth in the previous quarter. Looking ahead, CyberArk expects its first quarter revenue to rise 29% to 32% and 2016 sales to improve 27% to 29%. Those numbers look solid, but the slowing growth rate spooked investors, and the stock fell to a 52-week low after that report in February.On the bright side, CyberArk's P/S ratio has declined from the 30s a year ago to just 7.3 -- still higher than the industry average, but ""cheaper"" than Palo Alto. But what really makes CyberArk stand out is its financial discipline and focus on profitability. Its GAAP net income rose 48% annually to $9.9 million last quarter, while non-GAAP net income rose 92% to $13.8 million. Analysts currently expect CyberArk to post 25% annual earnings growth over the next five years. Looking ahead, CyberArk faces the same threat as FireEye -- bigger companies could bundle similar services into their hardware or software products. But like FireEye, CyberArk has been widening its moat by buying smaller security firms  like Viewfinity. FireEye and CyberArk are both volatile stocks which aren't for risk-averse investors. But investors willing to ride out the near-term volatility could be richly rewarded over the next few years as companies boost their cybersecurity budgets to defend against hacks and data breaches.There's also a strong possibility that both companies will be acquired by larger firms. Cisco was once rumored to be interested in FireEye, and CheckPoint reportedly held talks to buy CyberArk earlier this year. Therefore, I think it's a good idea to keep a small portion of your portfolio reserved for either company -- but do your own due diligence before doing so.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

"Bernstein analyst Pierre Ferragu went into detail in a note on Tuesday as to why he sees  (  ) stock as being massively overvalued.Check Point was not so lucky. After initiating coverage on the cybersecurity sector about two weeks ago, CHKP was one of two new initiations. The other was  (  ), which was given an ""Outperform"" rating and a $200 price target,  .Ferragu and his team gave the Tel Aviv, Israel-based cybersecurity company an ""Underperform"" rating and a $65 price target, which implies downside of 22% from yesterday's close of $83.25.But why? What's so wrong with CHKP stock?Bernstein has four ""key convictions"" that lead to Check Point's miserable ""Underperform"" rating. The first is about the nature of the cybersecurity biz:""Conviction #1: In security, platform plays a role, but innovation is mostly about making existing platforms obsolete and, as such, drives structural market fragmentation…an installed base can drive sustainable and profitable revenues, but may not grant any share of incremental dollars spent.""Then, a fundamental dig on CHKP in particular:""Conviction #2: Next generation firewalls drive excellent growth, but the majority of this growth is being captured by new entrants.""New entrants (e.g. Palo Alto) have effectively brought-to-market next generation firewalls integrated with endpoint protection and cloud services, gaining strong momentum:  and  combined capture ~70% of the growth of the market, Check Point only 14% …""Point #3 is a bit disturbing as an investor, because it basically pertains to Check Point's brand image:""Conviction #3: Check Point's deficit in commercial performance is apparent. It is very likely to be more the consequence of perceived performance of the technology than real and objective performance issues …""""Based on interviews with IT decision makers, and more quantitative research, we conclude with a high level of conviction that Check Point's technology is perceived as lagging in today's market.""Finally, a note on CHKP stock's valuation: Ferragu and his team expect Check Point's top line growth to decelerate due to heightened competition in the coming years. So …""In that context we see valuation progressively heading towards levels in line with more mature tech companies, from ~11x EV/EBIT today, to ~9x, implying a target price of $65.""Point taken.Bernstein is simply  a fan of CHKP stock, and it gave you four compelling reasons why.

Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@IEFA, NXPI, CHKP, AER: ETF Inflow Alert@2016-04-05@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/iefa-nxpi-chkp-aer-etf-inflow-alert-2016-04-05
ver the past month we've seen two different partnerships announced in the information security industry, both involving sharing of intelligence on threats. What exactly does this mean and why are companies doing this? Although confusing at first, I believe it is a good thing for these companies as well as the industry as a whole. The latest two companies to get cozy is  and  . Although the two have had a relationship for the past 18 years, both companies  on Feb. 25 they will be taking it to a new level.Specifically, the companies outlined four areas of collaboration. The first, and what I believe to be the most significant, is shared threat intelligence. IBM and Check Point will share information with each other concerning any cyber threats. The sharing will be done through IBM's own threat intelligence sharing platform called X-Force Exchange.The other areas include integrated event management, a Check Point app that will run within IBM's products and will send threat data in real time, allowing operators to respond faster. IBM customers will also be able to deploy and manage Check Point's Mobile Threat Prevention.The announcement follows a similar one from  and  . On Jan. 20, both companies announced they would be joining forces and sharing data and product capabilities as well. Specifically, the combination will consist of Proofpoint's Targeted Attack Prevention (TAP), its SocialPatrol product, and Palo Alto's Next-Generation Security Platform. To understand the significance of this, it helps to look at how the industry as a whole has been evolving. While cybercrime has been around since computers and the Internet, it has recently taken center stage for many companies after high-profile and expensive cases of hacking and stolen information.As cybercrime ramped up, so did the number of firms, all focusing on protecting different parts of the network or offering specific solutions. While one vendor's product would protect against one type of attack, another product would have to be purchased to prevent against another type. This gave information security officers a huge headache as they not only had to buy all of these products, but also maintain, set up, and log in to each one individually.Businesses have responded by bundling and selling products together to relieve some of this pain for customers. But don't some of these companies compete with each other? Not exactly. Because these companies all focus on a specific area of expertise or type of attack, there is not as much concern about competition between them.For example, on its latest , Palo Alto CEO Mark D. McLaughlin noted that Palo Alto and Proof Point are in different markets but have complementary capabilities. Proof Point is concerned with email and messaging security, while Palo Alto is general network security.The other interesting shift in the industry is the sharing of threat intelligence. To some extent, security providers are only as good as the information they have regarding threats -- the more information a company has the more valuable. So at first glance, it seems odd these companies would voluntarily share their information with each other.However, because these companies are not competing directly against each other, the sharing of data benefits them both without giving the other a competitive advantage. McLaughlin also noted that customers are getting fed up with vendors trying to sell them intelligence. Instead, he believes in the near future the value proposition will be how security vendors handle intelligence and what they do with it.If the overall goal is to combat cybersecurity threats, then the sharing of intelligence should be a win-win for the companies providing the services, as well as the customers who will receive more effective solutions. This, in turn, will help the industry as a whole combat the problem, and companies will be willing to shell out more money for products that work. This collaborative dynamic will continue so long as the cybersecurity pie keeps growing. For now, it seems the space is big enough for these multiple companies with different approaches to get along. Spending on IT security totaled approximately $77 billion in 2015, and is expected to increase to $100 billion by 2018 according to market research firm Gartner.As the market matures in the coming years, there could be consolidation. Already security mergers and acquisitions have been increasing, with 133 security M&A deals reported in 2015, up from 105 in 2014. A survey by 451 Research found investment bankers expect security to have the most M&A activity this year, surpassing mobile technology, which held the spot for six consecutive years.This isn't a reason to stay away from the industry and in fact validates the investment thesis as large companies are willing to pony up the cash to fill product holes. This is why I personally prefer pure-plays in the security space -- not only do you get the high growth rates of these companies tied to security, but if consolidation does occur it will be the pure-plays that will be more likely to be purchased.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

hares of  gained more than 4% in after-hours trade yesterday in response to better-than-expected revenue growth during second-quarter fiscal 20Array6. The robust top-line performance was mainly driven by customer addition and expansion of the existing customer base. Also, encouraging third-quarter guidance boosted the share price.However, higher operating expenses more than offset the benefits of robust revenue growth resulting in wider year-over-year loss.

Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) went up 38%, accounting for Array9% of total revenue. Asia-Pacific was up 67% and brought inthe balance.Also, customer wins coupled with expansion of the existing customer basesupported quarterly revenues. Moreover, billings jumped 62% year over year to $459 million during the quarter.Palo Alto Networks' adjusted gross margin (excluding amortization and other one-time items but including stock-based compensation) decreased 80 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 7Array.9%, primarily backed by unfavorable product mix.The company reported adjusted operating loss (excluding amortization and other one-time items but including stock-based compensation) of $44.5 million, which widened from a loss of $28.2 million suffered a year ago. Higher adjusted operating expenses (up 52.8% year over year) also impacted operating results. However, adjusted operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, decreased 50 bps year over year.Palo Alto Networks exited the second quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $964.6 million compared with $76Array.3 million in the previous quarter.

hough the cyber security industry has lost its momentum in the past several months, partially due to the weakness in the broad technology sector, it is poised for exponential growth in the coming years in the face of increasing cybercrime and the need to protect against these threats. According to Gartner, global security spending will increase 4.7% year over year to $75.4 billion in 2015 with some analysts projecting the  to grow from  .The Q4 earnings reports of several industry players reflect this trend as most of them have beaten our earnings and revenue estimates with an encouraging outlook. Yet, they failed to drive the space and its ETFs higher that might suggest attractive entry point at the current level (read:  ).Let's dig into the earnings results of some of the cyber security firms that have the largest allocation to the ETFs in this industry: reported earnings per share of 30 cents and revenues of $51.5 million, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 13 cents and $44 million, respectively. The company projects earnings per share in the range of 15-16 cents on revenues of $42.5-$43.5 million, up 29-32% year over year, for the ongoing first quarter. The lower-end of both the guidance was well above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 12 cents for earnings and $42 billion for revenue.For 2016, revenues are expected to grow 27%-29% to $205-$207 million and earnings per share are projected in a band of 83-86 cents. The lower-end of both the full year guidance was also well above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $203 million for revenue and 67 cents for earnings. However, analysts were expecting earnings per share of 17 cents and 91 cents for the ongoing quarter and fiscal year, respectively, which sent shares of CYBR tumbling following the earnings announcement on February 11 after the closing bell. The stock lost 10.8% on February 12. beat our earnings estimate but missed on revenues. Net loss per share came in at 73 cents, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 76 cents loss but revenues of $185 million fell shy of our estimate of $187 million. FireEye expects revenues of $167-$177 million for the first quarter and $815-$845 million for the full year. The midpoint of the range was in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter and above our estimate of $824 million for the year at the time of earnings release.Net loss per share is projected in a range of 49-53 cents for the first quarter and $1.25-$1.32 for the full year.

That's all well and good, and sure, Goldman's a household name, so the rating means something.Bernstein initiated coverage on PANW stock, giving it an ""Outperform"" rating and a $200 price target, a 29% premium to yesterday's closing price.It also initiated coverage on cybersecurity rival C  (  ), but wasn't quite as kind.

The company can sustain superior growth rates for several years and we see recent valuation levels as fully justified.

We see Check Point remaining a relevant player in this evolution, but with pressure adding to its economic model over time.""For Bernstein to put Palo Alto in the same league as Cisco - who at $140 billion in market cap is worth roughly 10 times PANW - is pretty lofty praise.With Palo Alto Networks stock off to the tune of 11% this year, shareholders are hoping that Bernstein's on to something - because if it is, a major rally is in order very shortly.The post ) Stock Has 29% Upside appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@ANALYST: Palo Alto Networks Inc (PANW) Stock Has 29% Upside@2016-03-22@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/analyst%3A-palo-alto-networks-inc-panw-stock-has-29-upside-2016-03-22

eeping its earnings streak alive for the fourth consecutive quarter, the leading policy-based enterprise security and traffic management solution provider,  once again reported better-than-expected results for the fourth quarter of 2015.The company's adjusted earnings (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets) of $1.10 comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.04. The figure also grew 12.2% on a year-over-year basis, mainly driven by increased revenues and lower share counts. Higher operating expenses partially offset the benefit.Check Point's fourth-quarter revenues of $458.1 million increased 8.9% from the year-ago quarter and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $456 million.The year-over-year revenue growth was aided by a 7.4% increase in revenues from Products & Software Blades and a 5.2% improvement in Software Updates and Maintenance revenues. The company reported 21.7% year-over-year improvement in revenues from Software Blades subscription.Check Point witnessed higher demand for its data center and high-end appliances. Another factor that contributed to overall growth was the increased number of large deal signings. During the quarter, the number of customers who signed deals worth $1 million or more was 86 as against 85 in the year-ago comparable period. Moreover, customers who signed deals worth $50,000 and higher contributed 72% to the total order value compared with 71% in fourth-quarter 2014.Geographically, the Americas contributed 48% to revenues; Europe accounted for 37%, while Asia-Pacific, Japan and Middle East and Africa brought in the remaining 15%.On a year-over-year basis, adjusted gross profit (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets) increased 9.5% to $403.9 million, while gross margin improved 50 basis points (bps) to 88.2% compared with 87.7% a year ago.Adjusted operating expenses (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets) increased 16.3% year over year to $161.6 million as the company continued the investments. The year-over-year increase can also be attributed to higher research and development, selling and marketing and general and administrative expenses as well as acquisitions made over the last year. As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses increased 230 bps.Adjusted operating income (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets) came in at $242.3 million, up 5.5% year over year. However, margins contracted 170 bps as the benefit from increased gross margin was more than offset by higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenues.Adjusted net income (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets and other one-time items calculated on a proportionate tax basis) was $197.7 million or $1.10, up from $186.3 million or 98 cents reported in the comparable quarter last year.Check Point exited 2015 with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $1.28 billion compared with $1.56 billion in the previous quarter.

"espite the bearish sentiment in the market at present, ' (NASDAQ: CSCO) mixed second-quarter results were enough to take its stock higher. It wasn't a flawless report, but the tech giant did enough to dispel fears of an impending collapse in IT spending. Meanwhile, its transition toward more software and software-as-a-service (SaaS) based revenue continues to gain traction, even while its end markets are under pressure. It was definitely a mixed report, so let's take a look at the details. Total adjusted year-over-year revenue growth of 2% came in at the top end of company guidance of 0% to 2%, while non-GAAP EPS of $0.57 compared favorably to guidance for EPS of $0.53 to $0.55. Non-GAAP net income increased 6.7% to $2.93 billion.It's a good idea to separate out Cisco's product and service revenues (product revenue growth tends to lead service growth), and also keep an eye on its deferred revenue. The latter is important as it includes future revenue not yet recognized from things like SaaS -- a key part of Cisco's growth aspirations.As you can see below it wasn't a great quarter for product sales, but service growth remains solid.
  
 *REPORTED NUMBER, WHICH INCLUDES A DIVESTED BUSINESSTurning to deferred revenue, year-over-year growth of 8.3% looks impressive, but as the chartbelow shows, deferred revenue has been sequentially flat for the last two quarters.DATA SOURCE: CISCO SYSTEMS PRESENTATIONSThe question of how much revenue growth is being given up by shifting solutions toward cloud-based subscriptions (less upfront revenue, possibly more long-term revenue that shows up initially in the deferred revenue line) came up on the . In response, CFO Kelly Kramer stated that it was ""tough to quantify,"" but it was ""certainly something"" from revenue -- something to consider when looking at Cisco's weak headline growth numbers. Turning to segmented details, Cisco's core revenue (switching and routing) saw mixed performance. When last quarter's results were released, management outlined why it was confident that routing would return to growth, and as you can see below, routing had a good quarter. However, switching did not.IMAGE SOURCE: CISCO SYSTEMS PRESENTATIONSLast quarter, CEO Charles Robbins forecast that switching revenue would pass an ""inflection point"" in the second-half as revenue from next-generation data center switches offsets revenue declines from historical switching in data centers. It's only the second-quarter, but the weakness in switching plus management's commentary suggest the arrival of that inflection point might be delayed.For example, Kramer described the weakness as a macroeconomic issue: "" The 4% decline in switching was largely driven by macro weakness in our campus business, something that we've observed in the past during volatile times as customers pause spending decisions,"" she said. Meanwhile, Robbins disclosed, ""I will tell you that on the new order side on the data center switching business this quarter, we did see slightly positive growth on orders.""Clearly, the weak economy is hurting Cisco, and Robbins spoke of customers pausing ""a bit"" during the last three weeks of the quarter. On the other hand, areas of critical spending, such as network security, managed to grow -- pure-play network security companies such as  (NASDAQ: FTNT) , and  (NASDAQ: CHKP) also delivered  . Details of revenue growth: In a sense, it was a typical Cisco quarter, just one with a bit more economic weakness. By typical, I mean low single-digit growth with various parts of the portfolio of business bouncing up and down. For example, BRIC spending and networking bounced back from weak quarters, but enterprise spending and switching remained weak. It was also a negative quarter for data center spending.However, in a weak economy,a typical quarter is actually a good three months work. Cisco managed to deliver earnings that beat management's guidance, and the company remains a prodigious cash generator. In the current environment, that's enough .The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. And we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in-the-know investors!

etwork security company delivered a solid set of results on Thursday, helping ease fears of a slowdown in security spending. The headline numbers look good enough, and they came in toward the top end of the company's guidance, but there's a lot going on beneath the surface. Let's take a deeper dive into the numbers. Overall revenue increased 8.9% in the fourth quarter, with non-GAAP EPS of $1.20 coming in 12% ahead of the same period last year. However, both figures somewhat mask some key underlying trends with the company.Check Point operates a razor-and-blade business model and generates revenue from three related streams. Hardware product sales (38% of revenue in the quarter) are sold with software blades (19%), which offer a range of differing applications. The third revenue stream comes from software updates and maintenance (43%), which are sold into the installed base. Clearly, generating product sales is the key to future growth. If there are no hardware sales, there are no software blades sales or software maintenance revenue.As you can see below, growth of 7.4% in hardware sales helped continue a good run -- software updates and maintenance revenue should grow in due course.DATA SOURCE: CHECK POINT SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGIES LTD. PRESENTATIONS.While revenue increased nearly 9%, operating profit only increased 4.2% as operating margin fell to 52.2% from 54.5% in last year's fourth quarter. The reason? Operating expenses increased 14.5% with Check Point investing heavily in sales and marketing (up 21.7%) in order to drive new sales growth. As you can see in the chart above, it's a sign of the company's determination to accelerate growth following a stagnant period of product sales growth in 2013.Still, there is more. The third stream of revenue, software blade subscriptions continue to grow strongly, and along with them comes a substantive amount of deferred revenue, which will be recognized over time. In other words, deferred revenue is a snapshot of future earnings and cash flow.As you can see below, both remain on a strong growth track.DATA SOURCE: CHECK POINT SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGIES LTD. PRESENTATIONS.Essentially, the increases in sales and marketing expenses are in order to drive product sales and future growth, so you shouldn't just look at Check Point in terms of operating income growth and headline revenue. Turning to future expectations, management's guidance is as follows:The full-year revenue forecast implies a growth range of 5.5% to 9.8%, an increase of 7.7% at the midpoint and representing a slowing of growth from a 9% revenue increase in 2015. All told, it was a good set of results that confirmed management's sales and marketing initiatives are bearing fruit. The loss of operating margin is a concern, and 2016 may well see some more degradation. However, any worries on margin should be balanced by a consideration of the increased growth in product revenue and the promise of long-term earnings and cash flow streams from deferred software revenue.Check Point has always been the high-margin, high-cash-flow-generating company in the network security sector, but its management is making a concerted push for growth and its long-term revenue stream looks assured.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

 is set to report fourth-quarter 2015 results on Jan 28. Last quarter, the company reported in-line earnings. Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Fortinet offers network security solutions, including firewall, VPN, application control, antivirus, intrusion prevention, web filtering, anti-spam and WAN acceleration. Despite the lingering macro uncertainty, the company seems positive on the back of a healthy network security market, strong product line-up, deal wins and investment plans which should boost results in the fourth quarter.The demand for cyber security is on the rise and the previous quarterly results show that Fortinet is gaining from it. Notably, the company has been witnessing a higher number of large deal signings over the past few quarters which should aid results in the to-be-reported quarter.With the advancement in technology, more organizations are adopting the bring-your-own-device (BYOD) policy, which has enhanced employee productivity with anytime, anywhere access, while making it all the more necessary for the organizations to enforce stringent data security measures.However, margin contraction due to continuous investments in research and development and competition from key network security players such as Cisco Systems Inc., Check Point  , Juniper Networks and Palo Alto Networks remain the concerns.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Fortinet will beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 9 cents. Hence, the difference is 0.00%. Fortinet currently has a Zacks Rank #3 which when combined with a 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are a couple of companies which you may consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Facebook Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +2.00% and a Zacks Rank #3.Microsoft Corp.  , with an Earnings ESP of +1.45% and a Zacks Rank #3.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

hares of  gained over 8% during yesterday's after-hour trade following the better-than-expected top-line results for fourth-quarter 2015 and an encouraging outlook for 2016. The new share repurchase program announced yesterday also boosted the shares.Nevertheless, Fortinet's bottom-line results were quite disappointing. The network security solution provider's adjusted earnings per share (excluding one-time items but including stock-based compensation) of 3 cents missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 9 cents by a wide margin and declined for the year-ago quarter figure of 7 cents.The year-over-year decrease resulted from higher operating expenses due to stepped-up investments in research and development, and marketing strategies which more than offset the benefit of higher revenues.Fortinet reported fourth-quarter revenues of $296.5 million, up 32.4% from the year-ago quarter. Revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $296 million and came within the guided range of $293-$298 million. Segment-wise, Product revenues jumped 30.8% year over year to $144.8 million, and Services and Other revenues surged 34% to $151.8 million.The year-over-year improvement was primarily aided by solid yields from sales and marketing strategies and strength in the network security market. A large number of deal wins and customer additions during the quarter also contributed to the robust top line.Billings increased 35% on a year-over-year basis to $380.9 million.Gross profit increased 35.5% from the year-ago quarter to $214.6 million. Moreover, gross margin expanded 170 basis points (bps) year over year to 72.4%.Higher-than-expected adjusted operating expenses (up 41.2% year over year) affected the operating margin negatively. As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses increased 410 bps to 65.8%. Adjusted operating margin was 6.6%, down from 9% a year ago.Fortinet exited 2015 with cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $891.4 million, down from $908.2 million at the end of the previous quarter. Accounts receivable were $259.6 million compared with $174.1 million at the end of third quarter.During the year, the company generated cash flow of $282.5 million from operating activities as against $196.6 million in 2014. Free cash flow for the full year came in at $245.2 million.The 2016 guidance reflects Fortinet's optimism. The company expects revenues in the range of $1.25 billion to $1.26 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of more than 24%. The revenue guidance is also above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.241 billion at the mid-point. Earnings per share are anticipated between 67 cents and 69 cents (mid-point 68 cents), much higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 23 cents.However, the first-quarter outlook was slightly below expectations. Management expects revenues in the range of $270-$275 million and earnings per share between 8 cents and 9 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues and earnings are pegged at $277 million and 9 cents, respectively.In a separate press release, Fortinet announced a share repurchase authorization of $200 million to buy back its shares gradually in open market or privately negotiated transactions. The company plans to complete the repurchase by Dec 31, 2017.Fortinet's network security solutions include firewall, VPN, application control, antivirus, intrusion prevention, web filtering, anti-spam and WAN acceleration. The company reported mixed fourth-quarter results, wherein the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate but bottom line missed the same.Nonetheless, we are encouraged by Fortinet's 2016 guidance. Despite the persistent macro uncertainty, the company seems positive on the back of healthy network security market, solid product line-up and investment plans.However, margin contraction due to continuous investments in research and development and competition from key network security players such as Cisco Systems Inc.  , Check Point  , Juniper Networks  and Palo Alto Networks, remain the concerns. Nonetheless, product ramp-ups, deal wins, continuous growth in the network security market and expected benefits from the ongoing investments remain the positives.Currently, Fortinet has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

hares of cybersecurity firm  have been cut in half over the past year. That decline, which pushed the stock below its IPO price, was mainly  about its financial discipline, executive turnover, and rising competition. However, FireEye stock recently rebounded on two positive developments.FireEye's cyber threat map. Source: FireEye.FireEye's growth reflects that demand. In fiscal 2014, its revenue soared 163% annually to $425.7 million. Looking ahead, analysts expect its revenue to rise 47% in fiscal 2015 and another 30.5% in fiscal 2016. While that growth is slowing down, its business doesn't look like it will peak anytime soon, and analyst forecasts haven't been adjusted for iSight's upcoming contributions to FireEye's top line. FireEye's total deferred revenue also rose 61% annually to $454.9 million last quarter, indicating that demand for its services remains strong.With a P/S ratio of 4.1, FireEye stock remains fundamentally cheaper than cybersecurity peers  and  , which respectively trade at 12 and 10 times trailing sales. FireEye's biggest weakness is its lack of a defensive moat against bigger rivals like  and Palo Alto. Cisco, which acquired cybersecurity firms like SourceFire and ThreatGrid, has been adding similar threat prevention services to its security portfolio. Cisco often bundles these security products with its own networking hardware, which can prevent smaller challengers like FireEye from gaining ground among enterprise customers. Palo Alto, which develops an industry-standard firewall for businesses, also acquired cybersecurity firm Cyvera in 2014 to expand its threat-detection abilities.To counter these threats, FireEye will need to boost its R&D and marketing expenses. Unfortunately, FireEye remains unprofitable and burns through cash quickly. During the third quarter, its GAAP net loss widened from $120 million a year earlier to $135.5 million due to higher operating expenses and stock-based compensation. For 2015, it expects its operating margin to remain between negative 38% and 39%.FireEye's cash and equivalents rose from $146.4 million last year to $463.9 million, but only because it did a convertible debt offering to raise $800 million last May. CFO Michael Sheridan, who had been with FireEye since 2011, also abruptly resigned last July, casting doubts on the company's financial discipline. FireEye's insiders also don't seem confident in the company's future -- over the past 12 months, insiders only bought 725,000 shares, but sold 2.6 million shares. FireEye sells essential security services for an increasingly connected world, but its stock has too many problems to ignore. Sales growth, while robust, is slowing down. FireEye's net losses are widening, and it will likely need to keep burning through cash to keep up with its better-funded rivals.In a volatile market, FireEye shares could decline further due to its lack of earnings-based support. I'm not saying that investors should avoid FireEye, but they should approach this stock carefully and fully understand its risks.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

ergers & acquisitions (M&A) took center-stage last year and the trend is likely to continue this year as well.Of course, this could be a function of the rumor mill, but  is reportedly in discussions to acquire  , a provider of information technology security solutions. However, details are scarce at this point because neither party was available for comment.While CyberArk Software's shares jumped 19.6% on the news, Check Point shares were down 2.3%. If the deal materializes, it will be a big boost to Check Point's business, especially the fast-growing markets of Asia.The proposed CyberArk Software acquisition is expected to significantly expand Check Point's cyber security capabilities. Headquartered in Petach Tikva, Israel, CyberArk Software provides information technology security solutions. The company's services protect organizational privileged accounts from cyberattacks. The services also address the challenges of hard-coded, embedded credentials, and cryptographic keys from being hijacked and exploited by malicious insiders or external cyber attackers. So they are a nice complement to Check Point's firewall offerings.The acquisition is likely to result in revenue synergies because CyberArk has limited presence in North America, Europe and Asia that can be scaled up with the help of Check Point's reseller network.Cost synergies are also a possibility, but hard to tell because management of neither company has commented on the story.Check Point has a market capitalization of over $14 billion and has approximately $3.6 billion of cash and investments, compared with CyberArk's market capitalization of around $1.7 billion. If completed, the acquisition would mark Check Point's largest takeover in its history.Going forward, the CyberArk Software purchase is expected to have an impact on Check Point's adjusted earnings per share and operating profit margin.The demand for cyber security is on the rise. With the advancement in technology, more organizations are adopting a bring-your-own-device policy, which has enhanced employee productivity with anytime, anywhere access. However, it has made it all the more necessary to enforce stricter data security measures.The long list of data breaches is really putting the Internet security market in focus as companies are beginning to realize the necessity of enhancing cyber safety measures.From being a niche industry a decade ago, cyber security has grown into a very important segment in the IT space. In fact, some analysts expect the market to grow at a CAGR of 9.8% and reach about $170 billion by the end of this decade.In 2015, Check Point bought two small Israeli companies. The first being an Israel-based mobile security provider, Lacoon Mobile Security and the second one a cybersecurity startup, Hyperwise.The CyberArk Software acquisition will be a strategic fit for Check Point's cyber security business and should help drive long-term growth.Going forward, we remain encouraged by the rapid adoption of Check Point's data center appliances. Also, the continued enhancements in its data center product lines are expected to provide adequate support to revenue growth. We are similarly encouraged by Check Point's third quarter 2015 results, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Also, we remain optimistic about its encouraging fourth quarter earnings guidance.However, competition from Cisco Systems Inc.  , Juniper Networks Inc.  and Fortinet Inc.; an uncertain economic environment, competitive pressure and currency headwinds are concerns.Check Point carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

fter a lull in the second half of 2015, the cyber security space was suddenly on fire when the rumors of Israel cyber security firm Check Point Software Technologies (  ) being in initial talks to acquire smaller rival CyberArk Software (  ) surfaced.The proposed acquisition will lead to new growth opportunities and cost synergies for both companies over the long term. This is especially true, as it will likely add privileged account management to the portfolio of Check Point that would distinguish it in the cyber security market over the other vendors. On the other hand, the deal would expand CyberArk's reach in the market (read:  ).If the deal comes true, it would be the largest ever acquisition for Check Point. However, some analysts think chances of the combination of the two Israeli companies are less.The news spread an air of optimism into the broad cyber security space. Shares of CyberArk jumped 19.6% at the close on Wednesday and another 3.3% on Thursday while Check Point fell 2.3% on Wednesday but rose 0.9% on Thursday. The other stocks in the space also moved up immediately following the merger news on Wednesday but were down slightly at the close due to the weakness in the broad stock market.Given this, this niche area of the technology sector is in focus for the days ahead. Currently, there are a couple of cyber security ETFs that are detailed below (see:  ):The fund offers global exposure to those companies that ensure safety to computer hardware, software and networks, and fight against any sort of cyber malpractice. It tracks the ISE Cyber Security Index, holding 35 securities in its basket.

Shares of security software provider soared on Wednesday following a report that is engaged in talks to acquire the company. At noon Wednesday, the stock was up about 23%. Shares of security software provider  soared on Wednesday following a report that  is engaged in talks to acquire the company. At noon Wednesday, the stock was up about 23%. This is just a rumor at the moment, and an analyst from Oppenheimer believes that the chances of a deal taking place are low. However, with Check Point having a market capitalization of just over $14 billion, as well as roughly $3.6 billion of cash and investments, compared to CyberArk's market capitalization of about $1.7 billion after today's rise in the stock price, the deal is very doable from a financial perspective.It would be an expensive acquisition for Check Point, despite its ability to afford the deal. CyberArk generated $146 million of revenue and $23 million of net income over the past 12 months, putting the current stock price at about 11.6 times sales and 73 times earnings. CyberArk is growing fast, posting revenue growth of 56% in 2014, and its GAAP profitability is an exception rather than the rule in the cybersecurity software market, but this growth would need to continue for many years in order to justify the purchase price for Check Point. Consolidation in the security market is bound to occur over the next few years, regardless of whether this particular deal ends up being a reality.  , which aims to grow its own security business, has acquired a slew of smaller security firms over the past few years, and the company will likely continue doing so for years to come. Cisco estimates that the average large enterprise has 54 separate security vendors, making for a complex and convoluted security landscape.Any small security company is a potential acquisition target for Cisco or any other large provider of security software and services, and the number of companies scrambling for market share will likely be reduced in the coming years through mergers and acquisitions. While the Check Point-CyberArk deal is far from certain, CyberArk will remain an acquisition target regardless of whether this particular deal goes through.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

 is set to report fourth-quarter 2015 results on Jan 28. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 6.82%. Notably, Check Point has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the trailing four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 3.16%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Check Point posted solid results in the third quarter. Both the top line and the bottom line beat the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate and improved year over year.Check Point has been witnessing higher adoption of its Application Control, Anti-Bot and URL Filtering blades which, coupled with increased demand for its data center and high-end appliances, should boost results in the to-be-reported quarter. Increasing number of large deals is another positive.Also, the continuous enhancement in data center product lines should provide adequate support to revenue growth.However, an uncertain economic environment, competitive pressures, currency headwinds and competition from Juniper Networks  , Cisco Systems and Fortinet remain the concerns.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Check Point will beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at $1.04. Hence, the difference is 0.00%. Check Point carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are a couple of companies which you may consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Facebook Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +2.00% and a Zacks Rank #3.Microsoft Corp.  , with an Earnings ESP of +1.45% and a Zacks Rank #3.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

hares of CyberArk Software Ltd.  rocketed up over 20% today after rumors came about that Check Point Software Technologies  has interest in acquiring the smaller cybersecurity firm. As of 1:45 PM ET shares of CyberArk were trading around $46, up over $8 on the day. Check Point was down about 0.80% to about $78 a share around the same time.Though the deal is just a rumor and neither company has provided any insight, it would be financially possible and likely make sense for each firm. Check Point has a market capitalization of over $14 billion and has approximately $3.6 billion of cash and investments, compared to CyberArk's market capitalization of around $1.7 billion. If completed, the acquisition would be Check Point's largest ever.A deal between the two firms is one of many that are possible to occur in the security market as larger firms like Cisco Systems  , Microsoft  and Hewlett Packard Enterprises  all share in having the capability and interest to try and grow their security businesses.Rumors of deals in the cybersecurity industry may be prevalent in 2016 given that bigger firms may look to acquire smaller companies to boost their security arms. In other words, smaller cybersecurity firms similar to CyberArk may see days like today where there is a big increase in their stock price if acquisition rumors come about. The cybersecurity industry will continue to be one of interest as attacks on large companies and government agencies pop up throughout 2016 as they did often last year.Currently CyberArk holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), where as Check Point has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"Investors have shut the door on 2015.  (NASDAQ: FEYE) investors, on the other hand, slammed it. The past year was not kind to the cyber security company as the stock dropped 34% for the year. At just under $21, FireEye is now trading just a smidge above its original $20 IPO price.However, a new year is a time for new beginnings and optimism. Here are three reasons investors can open the door back up for FireEye stock in 2016. 3D printing, hover boards, and the Internet of Things are three emerging technologies that didn't quite live up to the hype. In 2016, the hype seems to be centered around drones and virtual reality. It's too early to see if any of these technologies will be a long-term winner but there is one technological trend that is not going anywhere: cyber security.According to Juniper Research, cyber crime will cost businesses over $2 trillion by 2019, almost 4 times the cost of breaches in 2015. Juniper also estimates the average cost of a data breach to exceed $150 million.The cost of a data breach is significant. Retail giant  (NYSE: TGT) has incurred $290 million in expenses since hackers made their way into Target's network in 2013. The costs may go higher as the company expects a class action suit from financial institutions and shareholders. It is also facing ongoing investigations by the State Attorney General and Federal Trade Commission.Often the financial costs associated with a breach are just the beginning. Once a breach is made public, a company's brand may never recover from the reputational hit it incurs. Businesses are beginning to take notice. The Global State of Information Security Survey by PWC reveals that respondents increased their cyber security budgets by 24% in 2015. Furthermore, 54% of respondents have a Chief Security Officer and 53% of businesses have implemented an employee training program revolved around cyber security. Given the damage a data breach can have on a business, I expect these numbers to increase beyond 2016. FireEye is currently not profitable-plain and simple. However, as the company continues to grow sales faster than costs, it's just a matter of time:1. Non-GAAP. Source: FireEye.Additionally, FireEye ended the third quarter with $28 million in positive operating cash flow for the year. This is a significant milestone as Wall Street and FireEye management were not expecting the company to stop bleeding money for another two to four more years. The past year has been a roller coaster ride for cyber security stocks.  (NYSEMKT: HACK), a cyber-security ETF, began the year trading just under $27 increased 31% in just 6 months. However, it ended 2015 essentially flat at $26. FireEye was even more volatile, increasing 74% from the beginning of the year to its all-time high. However, the stock ended the year down a total of 34%.The clouds may be parting, however and the recent pessimism in FireEye stock may have created an opportunity for investors. Not only is FireEye trading well below its peers, it is trading below the  software industry, which according to Capital IQ, boasts a P/S ratio of 6.7.
  
Source: Capital IQ.Although 2016 should be a bounce-back year, it is not going to be without difficulties. With the cyber security industry growing as rapidly as it is, competition is going to be fierce. However, the market is large enough that there is room for more than one winner. There will be growing pains, but in the new year, I expect FireEye to be one of those winners.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

2016 seems to likely to offer a slow-growth environment for world economies and many equities, but even in a slow-growth world there are particular industries and sectors experiencing rates of growth that investors can tap into. As of late, cybersecurity stocks have been some of the better risk-reward stocks and have been generating large capital gains in an otherwise lack luster market.The cybersecurity sector has been a hot one recently, especially as large companies like Apple  and Target  , along with government agencies, have fallen victim to high profile attacks by hackers.Also, cybersecurity stocks could be better off than many other stocks in a likely volatile market next year, as these companies are generating material growth in their financial results. One thing to keep in mind though is that reasonable valuations for this industry isn't exactly something that applies to many in the sector, as many cybersecurity firms are reinvesting heavily back into their businesses.As we roll into 2016, here are 3 buy-ranked cybersecurity stocks to consider in a world where cyber-attacks are ever more present and protecting against future ones is more important than ever:Check Point Software Technologies LTD  is a leading provider of policy-based enterprise security and traffic management solutions. The stock is currently holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), and could be a solid pick in the cybersecurity pick for 2016.With its industry leading products like the world's leading enterprise security suite, FireWall 1r, and its patented Stateful Inspection Technology, CHKP delivers Secure Enterprise Connectivity solutions that protect information assets and enhance the performance of enterprise networks.Analysts have become more bullish on the company's stock for 2016, as there have been 5 upward estimate revisions for 2016 in the last 60 days. CHKP is projected for EPS growth of 8.53% next year, and the company is looking to continue its streak of earnings beats into 2016, as it has been able to do so in each of the last 4 quarters by an average of over 3%.Based in Redwood, California, Qualys Inc.  is a provider of cloud security and compliance solutions that enable organizations to identify security risks to their information technology infrastructures in order to help protect their IT systems and applications from cyber-attacks. The company offers products for vulnerability management, policy compliance, web application scanning, malware detection, and associated security products.Qualys is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and analysts have become more bullish on this stock for 2016 as well. There have been 4 upward estimate revisions for 2016 in just the last 60 days, which has helped to push the Zacks Consensus Estimate up to $0.43 from $0.33 just 60 days ago.The cybersecurity firm is projected for substantial EPS growth in 2016 of 18.58%, and it hopes to keep its earnings beating streak going into the New Year. Qualys has been able to beat on earnings estimates in each of the last 4 quarters by a impressive average of 155.83%Finally there is Vasco Data Security International Inc.  , which designs, develops, markets and supports security products and services which manage and secure access to computer systems of corporate and government customers. Based in Oakbrook Terrace, Illinois, VDSI also enables secure financial transactions to be made over private enterprise and public networks.A current Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, VDSI has several pieces of data that make it a very solid option for 2016 in the cybersecurity sector. The Zacks EPS Consensus Estimate for next year has shot up to $1.04 from $0.82 just 60 days ago, suggesting strong analyst estimate revisions as of late for this stock.VDSI also holds a B for both its Growth and Value Style Scores from Zacks. This can be attributed to the company's current cash flow growth being approximately 117%, as well as its 20% Net Margin and 25.46% Return on Equity figures.In terms of a value stock, VDSI has a Price to equity ratio f 13.17, which is below the industry average, and an impressive figure in for a company in an industry where valuations tend to be high. The company also has a solid earnings yield figure, which is also above the industry average, at 7.59%.As more high profile cyber-attacks occur, both companies and governments will continue to put cybersecurity at the top of their lists of importance, increasing their spending in that area. This will benefit cybersecurity stocks greatly in moving forward as our world continues to become more and more dependent on the cyber networks.2016 could be a successful year for the cybersecurity sector as a whole, and investors can secure their portfolios with the top ranked stocks that have been selected above in order to profit in the New Year from this growing trend.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"here have been many headlines in the past decade about cybersecurity breaches and hacks -- not the least of which was the one that led to  paying out nearly $300 million to cover damages.Attitudes around online security are rapidly changing, as companies all over are waking up and starting to deal better with e-security. As a result, the sector is projected to grow to more than $170 billion by 2020.In this clip, The Motley Fool's Chris Hill and David Kretzmann talk about the recent past and the promising future of cybersecurity providers.A full transcript follows the video.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. And we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in-the-know investors! To be one of them,  . Target has agreed to pay $39 million to settle claims related to the data breach in 2013. $20 million of that goes to the banks, $19 million to reimburse  card issuers. Earlier this year, Target reached a similar settlement with  .And all told -- this is a little surprising to me -- all told, the company has said that they have spent nearly $300 million related to this data breach. And all I can think, David, is, I have to believe that at least one executive at Target is pounding the table, saying, ""I told you for three, four, five years, I told you we should be spending more on data security."" I mean, hindsight is 20/20, but don't you think that they could have paid a fraction of this amount, and made their security much much greater? Certainly. Cyber security, I think, for that reason, is growing really quickly now. The global cyber security market right now is growing at about a 10% pace each year, and it's expected to grow to more than $170 billion in size by 2020. So, clearly, there's a lot of tailwinds behind that market as more companies recognize the risk. They don't want to be in the headlines like Target or  or  or even the federal government with the Office of Personnel Management earlier this summer, who had a massive hack.So, in Target's case, they lost $40 million in credit and debit cards, and those were vulnerable for theft. And that obviously puts your customers at risk, it puts your brand reputation at risk, and certainly, the cost could have been a lot less than $300 million if they had been a bit more proactive in their security management. Part of the issue with, when we're talking about cybersecurity, a lot of the focus is placed on what we call ""the firewall,"" it's like the perimeter around the network of a company.But once a hacker gets through that network, and you can do it by accessing the credentials of a vendor, like with Target or Home Depot, then they can access your network, penetrate that firewall, or that perimeter around the network, and all of the accounts within that network don't have very much security. So, for example, if you have an administrative account, you might have 20 or 30 employees who all have access to the account, with the same password. So, if you're a hacker, as soon as you get that password, you blend right in with the employees. There's no way to tell that someone actually hacked the system.And then you have massive data breaches like this. So, you have some smaller companies like  , which is focused on securing those internal accounts, they're also called privileged accounts. So, really, the cybersecurity landscape is really evolving and expanding very quickly.And I think companies are recognizing now that it's not just a matter of regulatory compliance anymore. I think, maybe 10 or 20 years ago, that's what people thought about when they thought about cybersecurity, and that's how companies treated it. But now, they recognize, we have to be proactive with this. So, thanks to these big companies taking the hit in the headlines, I think companies are becoming more proactive. When you look at a company like  , which is very much in the business of cybersecurity, and the fact that their stock has been cut in half over the last 12 months, more so, as an investor, if you think, ""OK, I hear everything David's saying, this is a space I want to look at."" Is the risk and reward much greater for a FireEye than it is for a company like, say,  , which is a behemoth, and has deep enough pockets to be able to throw more money at this than FireEye ever could? Sure. There's a wide array of companies on this spectrum. So, you have some of the smaller companies like FireEye, versus some of the larger companies like Cisco or,  is another one. Just companies that are turning out a huge amount of cash. They're not growing as quickly like companies like  or FireEye, but they're also not losing gobs of money like Palo Alto and FireEye.So, you definitely have to evaluate that. You definitely don't want to go all in on, probably, any one of these companies, especially with those younger, newer companies, which are really focused on R&D, they're hiring a lot of people, they're spending a lot on marketing, they're not making money today. So, obviously, that amplifies the risk a good deal.The article  originally appeared on Fool.com.Copyright © 1995 - 2015 The Motley Fool, LLC. All rights reserved.

"is going down in flames. At least, that seems to be what many investors think. Over the past 12 months, shares of the cybersecurity specialist have lost 33% of their value, despite a (slightly) rising market. But on Tuesday morning, one analyst climbed way out on a limb and declared a halt to the selling.Bright and early Tuesday, ace analyst  announced it's upgrading shares of FireEye to buy, and raising its price target on the stock by $4, to $35. FireEye currently costs less than $22 a share, implying a possible 62% profit for investors who follow Citi's advice.But  you follow Citi's advice?After interviewing 51 chief information officers at various companies, Citi collated its results to come up with a series of reasons to be optimistic about FireEye -- both despite, and in part, because of, the stock's steep decline. Among these:Most interesting of all, though, is Citi's argument in favor of FireEye stock having an attractive valuation today. According to data from  , FireEye is both currently unprofitable and free cash flow-negative -- which would seem to complicate the task of arguing the stock is a buy based on valuation. And yet, Citi tries, telling investors to look at the stock in terms not of price and earnings, but of enterprise value and sales instead.So let's do that. At $3.5 billion in market capitalization currently, with $1.2 billion in cash and about $700 million in debt, FireEye sports a $3 billion  . Divide $581 million in trailing revenues into that, and the stock's EV/sales ratio is about 5.2.Now, even Citi admits it cannot quite call this valuation a bottom. A similar EV/sales calculation applied to security software rival  , for example, produces an EV/sales ratio of less than 2.0. On the other hand, Citi notes that FireEye is growing faster than many of its rivals. Analysts on average posit a 21% long-term profit growth rate for the company (whereas Symantec is pegged for only 5% growth).At the other end of the spectrum,  costs nearly 10 times EV/sales -- and Check Point is only expected to grow at about 11% over the next five years. So there's a bit more of a compelling argument that FireEye is a relative bargain there. Why compare FireEye to these two rivals? Mainly because they're the closest two stock picks we see on Citi's  scorecard, where we've been tracking this analyst's performance in the stock market -- and in the software sector in particular -- for nearly a decade now. Here are a few of Citi's representative picks of companies producing security software:
  
As you can see, it's been a bit of a mixed bag for Citi. And yet, over the course of 10 years of picking software stocks (while we've been watching), Citi has racked up a respectable record of 55% accuracy on its software recommendations -- and outperformed the broader stock market by a combined 1,250 percentage points across 31 public picks. FireEye is not at all the kind of stock I'd ordinarily  . The company has never earned a profit, it's only rarely (and barely) ever generated positive free cash flow. And it operates in the fast-changing tech sector, where new rivals emerge every day, and competition is fierce.Nonetheless, the stock is recommended by The Motley Fool, intensely popular on  (with CAPS members giving it a full five-star rating, the best score possible). Now, we find an ace software analyst recommending it in Citi. While I'd much rather wait and see this company demonstrate an ability to earn -- you know, an actual  -- before investing in it myself, I can see why other investors, less risk averse, would be willing to take a flier on the stock.I don't fully agree with Citi's argument, or its cobbling together of an EV/sales argument to support a stock just because there's no possible way to argue in its favor with a P/E analysis. But I'll admit -- based on the numbers I see, at least there  an argument to be made.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

hares of  gained about 3.8% in after-hour trade yesterday in response to the better-than-expected revenue growth during first-quarter fiscal 2016. The robust top-line performance was mainly driven by customer addition and expansion of the existing customer base. Also, encouraging second-quarter guidance boosted the share price.However, higher operating expenses more than offset the benefits of robust revenue growth resulting in wider year-over-year loss. Palo Alto Networks reported adjusted loss per share (excluding amortization and other one-time items but including stock-based compensation), on a proportionate tax basis, of 36 cents. The figure was significantly greater than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 16 cents. The company suffered a loss of 26 cents in the year-ago quarter.Palo Alto Networks reported revenues of $297.2 million, which not only surged 54.6% year over year but also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $280 million. Improvement in revenues was primarily backed by the strength in the network security market, strong product line-up, deal wins and investment plans.Product revenues jumped 45.5% to $147.7 million, mainly driven by growth in data center products. Also, a 64.6% surge in service revenues on a year-over-year basis positively impacted results. SaaS-based subscription revenues (part of service revenues) climbed 69% from the year-ago period.Geographically, on a year-over-year basis, revenues from the Americas increased 60% and represented 71% of total revenue.

Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@VT, NXPI, CHKP, MBLY: Large Inflows Detected at ETF@2015-11-10@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/vt-nxpi-chkp-mbly-large-inflows-detected-etf-2015-11-10

Revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $227 million and came above the guided range of $255-$260 million. Segment-wise, Product revenues jumped 36.5% year over year to $119.7 million, and Services and Other revenues increased 32.9% to $140.3 million.The year-over-year improvement was primarily aided by solid yields from sales and marketing strategies and strength in the network security market. A large number of deal wins and addition of customers during the quarter also contributed to the robust top line.Billings increased 41% on a year-over-year basis to $299.6 million.Gross profit increased 38% from the year-ago quarter to $188.4 million. Moreover, gross margin expanded 180 basis points (bps) year over year to 72.4%.Higher-than-expected adjusted operating expenses (up 47.6% year over year) affected the operating margin. As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses increased 610 bps to 68.6%, thereby negatively impacting margins. Adjusted operating margin was 3.9%, down from 8.1% a year ago.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowFortinet exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $908.2 million, up from $873 million at the end of the previous quarter. Accounts receivable were $174.1 million compared with $176.8 million at the end of second quarter.During the first nine months of 2015, the company generated cash flow of $214 million from operating activities as against $161.2 million in the same period last year. Free cash flow was $51.7 million compared with $50.7 million in third-quarter 2014.For the fourth quarter, management expects revenues in the range of $293-$298 million and earnings per share between 18 cents and 19 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues and earnings are pegged at $294 million and 13 cents, respectively.Fortinet marginally raised the full-year revenue outlook to a range of $1.006-$1.011 billion from the $1-$1.1 billion range. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.006 billion.Moreover, the company maintained the non-GAAP earnings per share range of 51 cents to 52 cents range, significantly higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 23 cents at the mid-point.Fortinet's network security solutions include firewall, VPN, application control, antivirus, intrusion prevention, web filtering, anti-spam and WAN acceleration. The company reported decent third-quarter results, with better-than-expected revenues and in-line earnings. Moreover, the company issued upbeat 2015 guidance.Despite the persistent macro uncertainty, Fortinet seems positive on a healthy network security market, product line-up and investment plans.Margin contraction due to continuous investments in research and development and competition from key network security players such as Cisco Systems Inc.  , Check Point  , Juniper Networks  and Palo Alto Networks remain the concerns. However, product ramp ups, deal wins, continuous growth in the network security market and expected benefits from the ongoing investments remain the positives.Currently, Fortinet has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

 is set to report third-quarter 2015 results on Oct 26. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 3.45%. Notably, Check Point has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the trailing four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 1.76%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Check Point posted solid second-quarter results. Both the top line and the bottom line beat the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate and improved on a year-over-year basis.Check Point has been witnessing higher adoption of its Application Control, Anti-Bot and URL Filtering blades which, coupled with increased demand for its data center and high-end appliances, should have a positive impact on the to-be-reported quarter results. Another factor that is likely to be a positive is the increasing number of large deals.Also, the continuous enhancement in data center product lines should provide adequate support to revenue growth.Moreover, Check Point's settlement with the Israeli tax authorities is a long-term positive. The company's continuous share buybacks bode well for investors.However, an uncertain economic environment, competitive pressure, currency headwinds and competition from Juniper Networks  , Cisco Systems and Fortinet remain the concerns.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Check Point will beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 88 cents. Hence, the difference is 0.00%. Check Point's Zacks Rank #3 when combined with a 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some companies which you may consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Facebook Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +5.71% and a Zacks Rank #1.Apple Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +1.60% and a Zacks Rank #2.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

" has been a stomach-churning stock to own over the past two years. It soared from an IPO price of $20 in September 2013 to $95 the following March. Since then, the stock has plunged back to the $20s due to concerns about competition, executive turnover, and its high valuations. Let's take a closer look at this beaten-down stock, and whether or not it's still a decent play on the growing cybersecurity market.FireEye's real-time cyber threat map. Source: FireEye. FireEye provides cybersecurity solutions that shield companies from Internet-based attacks. Unlike many other traditional cybersecurity firms, which offer systems that identify attacks after they occur, FireEye focuses on threat-prevention solutions.FireEye's income comes from four main sources: product revenue, product subscriptions, support and maintenance, and professional services. Product revenue and subscriptions respectively accounted for 34% and 33% of its top line last quarter. Support and maintenance revenue accounted for 15%, while professional services generated the remaining 18%.FireEye's total revenues rose 56% annually in the second quarter, compared to 69% growth in the first quarter and 184% growth in the prior year quarter. That slowdown has caused concerns that FireEye's growth could flatten out in a few quarters. Like many of its cybersecurity peers, FireEye remains in the red with a net loss of $133.6 million last quarter, compared to a narrower loss of $116.8 million in the prior year quarter. FireEye's critics note that  ,  , and other companies have recently launched threat-prevention products and services to challenge FireEye. FireEye is still considered the ""best of breed"" at protecting companies from malware, zero-day threats, and probing attacks, but it can't bundle its services into a larger package as some of its rivals can.For example, Palo Alto added new threat-detection abilities, obtained through its acquisition of Cyvera, to its core firewall service. Cisco, strengthened by its acquisitions of cybersecurity firms SourceFire and ThreatGRID, added similar features to its security products, which are frequently bundled with its networking hardware.In July, FireEye CFO Michael Sheridan, who had been with the company since 2011, resigned. That abrupt departure upset investors, since FireEye's financial track record had already been questionable:FireEye finished last quarter with $725 million in cash and equivalents, but without its debt offering in May, that figure would have been negative. FireEye appointed Michael Berry, the former CFO of Informatica, as its new CFO in September, but it's unclear if he'll fare much better than his predecessor. FireEye's core strength is its reputation as the ""go-to"" player in threat prevention. It was the first cybersecurity firm to be certified by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and was called upon to investigate data breaches at  ,  , and other major companies. Palo Alto, Cisco, and other rivals will need to prove their worth before being entrusted with similar tasks.FireEye's reputation also helps it secure big partnerships. Earlier this year, it signed a security services partnership with  , a threat intelligence-sharing deal with  , and agreed to integrate its security solutions into  's application delivery controllers. It also worked with  to create Visa Threat Intelligence, a subscription-based service that delivers real-time data on threats to merchants and card issuers.These deals strengthen FireEye's standing as an industry leader, so concerns about competitors marginalizing the company via bundling strategies could be overblown. As data breaches increase in frequency and complexity, demand for FireEye's threat-detection solutions will grow. That's why FireEye's deferred revenue, or advance payments for future services rendered, rose 77% annually to $410 million, and outpaced its actual revenue growth. FireEye's trailing P/S ratio of 9.3 initially looks expensive compared to an average of 2.8 for the application software industry. But the company is also posting double-digit revenue growth, while most of its industry peers aren't. FireEye also isn't that expensive compared to Palo Alto Networks, which trades at 15.3 times sales.Over time, FireEye's shares will stabilize as its revenue growth becomes more predictable and its losses narrow. For now, FireEye shares aren't for risk averse investors, and they could certainly fall further in this choppy market. But for investors who are willing to slowly accumulate a position over time to ride out the volatility, brighter days could be ahead.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

The only time anyone really thinks about Israel tends to be when there’s conflict in the Middle East. After all, the developed market nation is located in a pretty bad neighborhood. And considering that the majority of its neighbors want to blow it off the map, most investors just pass Israeli stocks right on by.However, that could be a huge mistake. Israeli stocks could be huge winners over the longer haul.Israel is a high-tech powerhouse. Unlike most of its neighbors, Israel wasn’t blessed with large oil and natural gas reserves. (.)In order to grow its economy, the nation plowed big bucks into research. If Israel was going to grow its economy, it was going to do so through software, tech, engineering and healthcare.And grow it has. Israel’s economy is set to .Today, many Israeli stocks sit at the top of the leader boards in their respective industries. In fact, there are hundreds of Israeli stocks listed on the venerable tech-oriented Nasdaq. Yet many investors probably have no idea are those companies are even domiciled in the nation.With that in mind, here are three Israeli stocks to buy today.No discussion about Israeli stocks would be complete without including healthcare giant Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA). TEVA is the world’s largest producer of generic drugs. Knock-off drugs heftily contribute to its bottom line.However, the Israeli pharma stock is more than non-name brand ibuprofen. TEVA is huge specialty drug maker as well. Its monster multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone produces about 20% of its quarterly sales.And while Copaxone is , TEVA isn’t resting on its laurels. It’s actually going on the hunt.First off, TEVA owns about 5% of biotech firm Mylan (). The Israeli firm continues to be a stalking horse and has made several (sometimes hostile) bids for the firm. More recently, Teva made a $40.5 billion bid for Allergan’s () generic biotech drug business. That buy will basically give TEVA around 1,000 new products to stuff into its pipeline. Those products will be essential to help replace lost sales from its blockbuster Copaxone once it officially falls off-patent.Meanwhile, shares of the Israeli stock are pretty cheap. TEVA stock trades for a forward P/E of just 11 and comes with a 2.7% dividend yield. Given the growth projections for TEVA, that’s a pretty good deal indeed.Most investors are familiar with many Israeli stocks products, but are completely unaware that they came from the nation. Case in point: Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP).Every time you’ve bought something online, you’ve used CHKP’s original contribution to the internet. The firm created the now-common “shopping basket” that’s on every e-commerce website. Since then, Check Point has gone on to become a giant in the cybersecurity marketplace. It actually created the first cybersecurity firewall. Nowadays, CHKP provides everything from software, hardware and consulting services to businesses and governments to help prevent various cyber-crimes.And that’s a good business to be in. , CHKP saw an 11% jump in its year-over-year earnings per share and 9% increase in its total revenues. Cash flows — which have supported a generous buyback program — also surged.With cybersecurity spending still rising and CHKP expanding into mobile and cloud security solutions, the times should continue to be good at the firm. Meanwhile, Check Point shares still seem cheap when compared to many of its peers. That combination of value and financial health means CHKP is one of the best Israeli stocks to own.There’s an old Wall Street adage that says, “Buy when there’s blood in the streets.” To say that CaesarStone Sdot-Yam (CSTE) has been bloodied is an understatement.CSTE has fallen by about 45% since a report came out from Spruce Point Capital Management — a noted short seller who has a short position in CSTE stock. Spruce Point claims that CaesarStone sells substandard products at premium prices, that its business model is unsustainable and that the firm is overstating its profit margins.CaesarStone is maker of quartz and polymer countertops, tiles and other stone-based housing products. Typically, CSTE’s products are found in higher-end homes — a sector of the housing market which is flourishing. The Israeli stocks market share has grown from about 3% in 2012 to about 14% today., the Spruce Point report and CSTE stock’s subsequent recent declines are bogus. Aside from the fact that firms have a right to sell products at whatever prices the public is willing to pay for them, the current CSTE stock price doesn’t factor in any growth in the U.S. housing market. According to UBS, that growth should put CaesarStone shares at about $67 — about double today’s selling price.That kind of upside makes CSTE one of the best Israeli stocks to buy for a medium-term trade.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@3 Underappreciated Israeli Stocks to Buy@2015-09-23@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-underappreciated-israeli-stocks-buy-2015-09-23
ollowing fellow IT security company  's near-20% drop after it reported results last Friday, investors in  must have had a nervous weekend waiting for earnings on the following Monday. In the end, Check Point's third-quarter earnings were fine, but the real question is: What will happen in the fourth quarter? Total revenue increased 9% in the quarter to $403.9 million, slightly ahead of the midpoint of the guidance range for $392 million to $410 million. Meanwhile, non-GAAP earnings per share came in $1.04, above the top of guidance for $0.92 to $1.02.In other words, the headline results were pretty good and mimicked how Fortinet beat guidance the previous week. Of course, the likely problem with Fortinet's results wasn't the earnings, but rather that guidance wasn't raised as much as the market had hoped, probably creating an excuse to sell a highly rated stock.Turning to Check Point's guidance for the fourth quarter:If you are wondering why EPS growth isn't keeping pace with revenue growth, it's largely because operating expenses are increasing as Check Point invests in order to generate revenue growth. Operating expenses increased to 49.3% of revenue in the third quarter compared to 46.7% in the same period last year. Around 60% of the increase in operating expenses came from sales and marketing increases. Ultimately, third-quarter operating margin fell to 56.4% from 58% in last year's third quarter. To put the revenue guidance into context, here is a graph of sequential (in this case, from the third to fourth quarters) growth rates for Check Point. As you can see, the midpoint of revenue guidance is for 12.7% sequential growth -- slightly below the average of 13.5% in the previous seven years. Growth rate is from third to fourth quarters.That said, in my opinion, Check Point's management tends to be conservative with guidance. Check Point's business model involves selling hardware in the form of products and licenses (around 33% of nine months' revenue) and then selling software blades (around 20%) -- blades perform a range of differing functions -- which work on Check Point's hardware. In addition, software and maintenance (48%) are sold into the installed base.All of this means that growing product and license revenue is the key to future growth, and as you can see below, the growth rate increased to 7.2% in the quarter. This bodes well for future software and maintenance growth.Data source: Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. presentations. Listening in on the , management vowed to continue investing in sales and marketing efforts and spent time highlighting the company's expansion onto new platforms. CEO Gil Shwed made this statement on the earnings release: In common with Fortinet, Check Point delivered a good set of results but guided a little bit below what some optimistic observers may have hoped for.Check Point investors should keep an eye on operating margin because management is keen to invest for growth. The good news is that Check Point is clearly generating revenue growth, and expanding into platforms such as smartphones and tablets offers good long-term growth prospects.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

"he ever-evolving technology sector has truly transformed our lives but not without some hiccups some may argue. That's because cyber crime, which is a broad word meaning the destruction of data, identity theft, spying and more have come along with it. Enterprises and government agencies are constantly threatened by hackers and therefore have to be vigilant about their cyber security measures.Over the past few years, high-profile business houses and government agencies have reported a significant rise in data breaches which, in turn, prompted them to impose tighter security measures.The latest data breach was reported by FXCM Inc.  , an online foreign exchange trading and related service provider, on Oct 1. According to the company, hackers gained unauthorized access to customer information and a few transfers were made from certain accounts. However, the loss was later compensated by the company.Earlier, in June, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), a U.S. federal agency that keeps employee information and handles security clearances, revealed that personal data of about four million current and former federal U.S. employees was compromised as a result of a cyber attack. This follows a couple of high-profile data breaches that affected customer data at Apple Inc.  , Target Corporation  and The Home Depot Inc.  .The continuous data breaches have proved the inadequacy of the security measures imposed by some of the big corporate houses and government agencies, especially in the wake of increasingly sophisticated attacks.Per the Center for Strategic and International Studies, cyber crime is a fast expanding business with high returns and low risks. The study projects that companies incur losses of about $445 billion per year globally due to these attacks.Citing an Identity Theft Resource Center (ITRC) report, 24/7 Wall St. reported that 563 data breaches have been recorded this year to-date Sep 22. Also, 'Key Findings from the Global State of Information Security Survey 2015' by PWC indicated that cyber security instances increased at a CAGR of 66% from 2009 to 2014.The long list of data breaches is really putting the Internet security market in focus as companies are beginning to realize the necessity of beefing up cyber safety measures.Moreover, with rapid technological advancement, more organizations are adopting the ""bring your own device"" (BYOD) policy to enhance employee productivity with anytime, anywhere access. This trend, on the other hand, has made it necessary for companies to enforce stricter data security measures.It should also be noted that cyber security companies are witnessing double-digit growth, while overall IT spending is anticipated to shrink 5.5% year over year to $3.5 trillion in 2015, according to research firm, Gartner. The research firm also estimates that worldwide spending on IT security in 2014 was about $70 billion which is likely to jump to $76.9 billion this year.This indicates that business houses and government agencies would rather compromise on other IT expenses than security measures which we believe will enhance long-term growth prospects for cyber security providers.From being a niche industry a decade ago, cyber security has grown into a very important segment in the IT space. In fact, some analysts expect the market to grow at a CAGR of 9.8% and reach about $170 billion by the end of this decade.Though millions of dollars and data are lost due to cyber crime, there does appear to be a positive side to it. Cyber security companies stand to gain from data breach as the chances of security-related purchase increase.While there are plenty of players in the industry, we would like to highlight five major companies that are projected to change the way we protect data.VASCO designs, develops, markets and offers cyber security products and services to corporate and government customers. Vasco's software and hardware products deliver robust, flexible and effective Internet and enterprise security solution to over 10,000 organizations across more than 100 countries.VASCO strives to expand its offerings through innovations and acquisitions. The company recently launched a comprehensive risk management solution - IDENTIKEY Risk Manager - to quickly detect and mitigate cyber attacks. Earlier this month, the company signed an agreement to acquire Silanis Technology Inc., a leading provider of electronic signature (e-signature) and digital transaction solutions used to sign, send and manage documents.Check Point is a leading provider of policy-based enterprise security and traffic management solutions. Through its patented Stateful Inspection technology, the company delivers secure enterprise connectivity solutions to protect information and enhance the performance of enterprise networks.Check Point pursues strategic alliances and acquisitions to boost its cyber security capabilities. Moreover, for the past few months, the company has undertaken several measures to tap the mobile security business which is gaining from the recent increase in the adoption of BYOD policy.In April, Check Point acquired Lacoon Mobile Security, an enterprise-level security solution provider for iOS and Android-based mobile devices. Moreover, in September, the company struck a new deal with privately-owned Acronis, a provider of data backup, recovery and security solutions that cater to all computing verticals. As part of this collaboration, Check Point Capsule, a mobile security solution, will be combined with Acronis Access Advanced, a secure access, sync and share solution, to protect mobile devices such as phones, tablets, laptops or smartphones.FireEye offers a platform for enterprises and governments to facilitate web security, email security, file security and malware analysis.FireEye has formed strategic alliances across various industries to expand its business. In the first half of 2015, the company partnered VISA (V) to create cyber security tools and services. The first-of-its-kind partnership will generate incremental revenues for FireEye.Fortinet offers network security appliances and Unified Threat Management network security solutions to enterprises, service providers and government entities worldwide. Its solutions are designed to integrate multiple levels of security protection, including firewall, virtual private networking, anti-virus, intrusion prevention, web filtering, anti-spam and wide area network acceleration.Fortinet has made strategic acquisitions to expedite growth.

 is set to report third-quarter 2015 results on Oct 22. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 50%. Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Fortinet reported better-than-expected second-quarter results, wherein both the top line and the bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Also, revenues compared favorably on a year-over-year basis.The year-over-year improvement was primarily aided by solid yields from sales and marketing strategies and strength in the network security market. A large number of deal wins and addition of customers during the quarter also contributed to the robust top line.Recently, Fortinet in partnership with Splunk, Inc., a provider of a platform for machine data analytics software, had launched a cyber security app for enterprises and service providers.Fortinet's FortiGate App for Splunk Enterprise uses the latter's platform to analyze log data produced by FortiGate appliances and thereby boosts threat detection and response times. It offers real time multivariate threat uncertainty, visualization and strange behavior detection within the framework of the organization's entire security data. Therefore, it enables enterprises and service providers to protect their networks from cyberattacks.We believe that Fortinet is positive on a healthy network security market, its product line-up and investment plans.Margin contraction due to continuous investments in research and development and competition from key network security players such as Cisco Systems Inc., Check Point  , Juniper Networks and Palo Alto Networks remain concerns. However, product ramp ups, deal wins, continuous growth of the network security market and expected benefits from ongoing investments are the positives.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Fortinet will beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 4 cents. Hence, the difference is 0.00%. Fortinet's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) when combined with a 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Fiserv, Inc.  Earnings ESP of +3.09% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)Apple Inc.  Earnings ESP of +1.60% and a Zacks Rank #3.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

" released a set of second-quarter earnings that suggested the company is on track with most of its growth initiatives in 2015. In recent years, the company has been known as the highly cash generative but low growth investment option in the network security sector. However, given its recent performance it might be time to reappraise that assessment. Let's take a closer look at the results. The headline numbers:As you can see above, revenue and earnings came in at the high end of guidance in the second quarter. In addition, the underlying trends in the business look solid. According to CEO Gil Shwed in the earnings release, the company saw strong demand across industries and business segments and data center, super high-end, and SMART-1 management appliances drove product revenue growth.Meanwhile, management outlined its future growth prospects by highlighting the acquisition of Lacoon Mobile Security as a way of expanding its mobile security offerings, a private cloud security product, and a partnership with network security company  (announced on April 20) to share threat intelligence in real time. As ever with Check Point, it's important to look at its products and licenses revenue growth. The company generates sales from three different, but related, revenue streams.Source: Check Point Software Technologies presentations.In case you are wondering about software blades subscriptions sales, they too continue to grow at a healthy clip, with growth of around 20% and above recorded in the last 10 quarters.Source: Check Point Software Technologies presentations. All told, it was a strong quarter for Check Point. Overall revenue growth of 9% in the quarter indicates that its ongoing recovery in products and licenses sales is feeding through to overall sales growth. Meanwhile, its industry-leading operating income margins remain strong at 50.3% compared to 52.3% in the same quarter last year -- despite a 13.6% increase in operating expenses as management expands its sales and marketing efforts in order to chase growth.Meanwhile free cash flow generation of around $190 million in the quarter represents nearly 48% of sales and 116% of net income. Check Point remains highly cash generative, but now it's also a growth story.One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World Wide Web to bed. And if you act quickly, you could be among the savvy investors who enjoy the profits from this stunning change.

hares of  gained over 9% in yesterday's after-hour trading session in response to the better-than-expected second-quarter 2015 results and upbeat guidance for the full year. The network security solution provider's adjusted earnings per share (excluding one-time items but including stock-based compensation) of 3 cents came a penny ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate.However, quarterly adjusted earnings compared unfavorably with the year-ago quarter figure of 5 cents. The year-over-year decline in earnings per share was mainly due to higher operating expenses as a result of increased investments in research and development, and marketing strategies.Fortinet reported second-quarter revenues of approximately $239.8 million, up 30% from the year-ago quarter. Revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $227 million as well as the guided range of $224-$228 million. Segment-wise, Product revenues jumped more than 34% year over year to $114.8 million, while Services and Other revenues increased 26.6% to $125 million.The year-over-year improvement was primarily aided by solid yields from sales and marketing strategies and strength in the network security market. A large number of deal wins and addition of customers during the quarter also contributed to the robust top line.Billings increased 40% on a year-over-year basis to $297.2 million and came above the guidance range of $263-$268 million.Gross profit increased 34.8% from the year-ago quarter to $170.9 million. Moreover, gross margin expanded 240 basis points (bps) year over year to 71%, in line with the higher end of the guidance range of 70-71%.Higher-than-expected adjusted operating expenses (up 44.8% year over year) affected the operating margin. As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses increased 680 bps to 67.9%, thereby impacting margins. Adjusted operating margin came in at 3.1%, down from 7.6% in the year-ago quarter.Fortinet exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $873 million, up from $804 million at the end of previous quarter. Accounts receivable were $176.8 million compared with $161.9 million at the end of first quarter.During the first half of 2015, the company generated a cash flow of $148.9 million from operating activities compared with $104.7 million in the same period last year. Free cash flow in the first two quarters was $73.5 million versus $34.1 million in the same period of 2014.Buoyed by better-than-expected second-quarter performance, Fortinet raised the full-year 2015 outlook. The company now expects revenues in the range of $1-$1.1 billion, up from $935-$940 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $940 million. Moreover, the company expects non-GAAP earnings per share within 51 cents to 52 cents, much higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 23 cents.Coming to the third-quarter 2015 outlook, management expects revenues within $255-$260 million, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $235 million. Earnings per share, on a non-GAAP basis, are anticipated to be approximately 12 cents, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 7 cents.Fortinet's network security solutions include firewall, VPN, application control, antivirus, intrusion prevention, web filtering, anti-spam and WAN acceleration. The company reported better-than-expected second-quarter results, wherein both the top line and the bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Moreover, the company issued an upbeat guidance for 2015 as well as the third quarter.Despite the persistent macro uncertainty, Fortinet seems positive on a healthy network security market, its product line-up and investment plans.Margin contraction due to continuous investments in research and development and competition from key network security players such as Cisco Systems Inc.  , Check Point  , Juniper Networks  and Palo Alto Networks remain the concerns. However, product ramp ups, deal wins, continuous growth of the network security market and expected benefits from the ongoing investments are the positives.Currently, Fortinet has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"nvestors in Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd. (Symbol: CHKP) saw new options become available this week, for the September 18th expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CHKP options chain for the new September 18th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $77.50 strike price has a current bid of $2.60. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $77.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $74.90 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CHKP, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $78.02/share today.Because the $77.50 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 54%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.35% return on the cash commitment, or 20.75% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd. , and highlighting in green where the $77.50 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $80.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.00. If an investor was to purchase shares of CHKP stock at the current price level of $78.02/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $80.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.10% if the stock gets called away at the September 18th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CHKP shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd. , as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing CHKP's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $80.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $80.00 strike represents an approximate 3% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 59%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.56% boost of extra return to the investor, or 15.86% annualized, which we refer to as the  .The implied volatility in the put contract example is 23%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 24%.

 is scheduled to report second-quarter 2015 results on Jul 23. Last quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 64.00%.Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Proofpoint is a leading security-as-a-service provider that focuses on cloud-based solutions for threat protection, compliance, archiving & governance, and secure communications. Organizations around the world depend on its expertise, patented technologies, and on-demand delivery system to protect against phishing, malware and spam, safeguard privacy, encrypt sensitive information, and archive and govern messages and critical enterprise information.The demand for cyber security is on the rise. With the advancement in technology, more organizations are adopting a bring-your-own-device (BYOD) policy, which has enhanced employee productivity with anytime, anywhere access, while making it all the more necessary for the organizations to enforce data security measures.Furthermore, since the beginning of 2015, numerous data breaches at high-profile business houses and government agencies have prompted the need to impose tighter security measures, in turn boosting the demand for cyber security products. Per Gartner, worldwide spending on IT security in 2014 was about $70 billion and is likely to reach $76.9 billion in 2015. These factors should aid Proofpoint's second-quarter results.However, an uncertain economic environment, currency headwinds and competition from Check Point Software Technologies Ltd.  and Symantec Corp. remain the concerns.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Proofpoint will beat earnings this quarter.

 disclosed advancement of its cyber security services and products portfolio for its federal clients. The company has decided to showcase its complete government product and cybersecurity service portfolio at the NSA-sponsored Information Assurance Symposium in Washington D.C.ViaSat's new offering will now enable the government agencies and military officials to protect and securely share their classified data and proactively detect and address threats in real time. The company applies a total system approach, which allows the users to optimize existing security investments and amalgamate new services and technologies, as per their need, to ensure a comprehensive view of their network security infrastructure.In particular, with regard to cybersecurity services, ViaSat's upgraded portfolio now includes vulnerability assessment and remediation services along with managed security services. On the other hand, the government security product offering now includes a wide range of network encryption products, commercial solutions for classified products and trusted cyber sensors.We are encouraged with this product enhancement move of ViaSat for federal clients that are one of the major revenue drivers for it.

 recently announced that it has completed the acquisition of Meru Networks (MERU), a company which engages in the development and marketing of virtualized wireless LAN solutions.The acquisition is a positive for the company as it will help Fortinet to expand its solutions portfolio, thereby addressing the $5 billion worldwide enterprise Wi-Fi market with integrated and intelligent secure wireless solutions. We believe that this acquisition will also expand its customer base.Under the terms of agreement, Fortinet will pay Meru $1.63 per share in cash and $44 million in equity shares. Post-acquisition, Meru will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Fortinet.The growing momentum of wireless networks is expected to spur future growth of the overall telecommunications industry. Wireless network standards are continuously evolving around the globe to provide faster data transmission speeds.Large business enterprises generally have a presence in different parts of the world. Thus a strong and efficient wireless network is of utmost importance to these companies in order to maintain seamless connection with remote operation sites.The U.S. is currently witnessing a boom in Wi-Fi networks. At present, more than 50% data transmission by smartphone users is taking place over Wi-Fi networks. Research firm WeFi Inc. projects that the number of commercial Wi-Fi hotspots are expected to reach 10.55 million in the U.S. by 2018. Meanwhile, cloud-managed Wi-Fi network has become the most efficient technology for large business houses.The acquisition is in line with Fortinet's strategy to invest in high-technology, innovative businesses that deliver strong top-line growth and expand margins. It will help the company to expand and accelerate the development of Wi-Fi solutions to offer a secure, continuous user experience - anytime, anywhere.

Despite the continuing macro uncertainty, the company seems positive on a healthy network security market, its product line-up, deal wins and investment plans, which should boost results in the upcoming quarter.However, continuous investments in research and development and competition from key network security players such as Cisco Systems Inc.  , Check Point  , Juniper Networks  and Palo Alto Networks are concerns.Currently, Fortinet has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

 is set to report second-quarter 2015 results on Jul 22. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 2.4%. It is worth noting that in the last four quarters, Check Point has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate three times while matching the same in one quarter.It has an average positive earnings surprise of 1.2%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Check Point delivered better-than-expected first-quarter results. Both the top and bottom lines beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Also, both revenues and earnings compared favorably on a year-over-year basis.Check Point has been witnessing higher adoption of its Application Control, Anti-Bot and URL Filtering blades, which coupled with higher demand for its data center and high-end appliances, should have a positive impact on the to-be-reported quarter results. Another factor that is likely to contribute to overall growth is the increasing number of large deals.Also, the rapid adoption of Check Point's data center appliances and the continuous enhancement in data center product lines are expected to provide adequate support to revenue growth.Moreover, Check Point's settlement with the Israeli tax authorities is a long-term positive. The company's continuous share buybacks bode well for investors.However, an uncertain economic environment, competitive pressure, currency headwinds and competition from Juniper Networks  , Cisco Systems and Fortinet remain concerns.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Check Point will beat earnings estimates this quarter. Thisis because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 87 cents. Hence, the difference is 0.00%.

Stocks recently featured in the blog include the  (  -  ),  (  -  ),  (  -  ),  (  -  ) and  (  -  ).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.  .Technology stocks surged yesterday after the busiest earnings week started off with some of the companies reporting strong quarterly results. In the broader technology sector, cyber security stocks stole the show after Fortinet Inc. (  -  ) and Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (  -  ) reported better-than-expected first-quarter 2015 results.Fortinet gained more than 9% in after-hours trade following better-than expected results wherein both the top line and the bottom line beat the respective Zacks Consensus Estimates. The company's revenues grew 26% year over year primarily aided by solid sales and marketing strategies and a strong network security market. A large number of deal wins and the addition of over 8,000 customers also contributed.However, quarterly adjusted earnings of a penny compared unfavorably with the year-ago quarter figure of 5 cents per share. The year-over-year decline in earnings per share was mainly due to higher operating expenses as a result of increased investments in research and development and the implementation of new marketing strategies.Fortinet's rival, Check Point, also delivered robust first-quarter results with both earnings and revenues beating the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate and improving year over year. The stock surged over 5% in yesterday's trading session.Check Point witnessed higher demand for its data center and high-end appliances. Another factor that contributed to the overall growth was the increasing number of large deal signings.It should be noted from yesterday's results that the cyber security stocks are witnessing double-digit growth, while the overall IT spending is anticipated to grow just under 3% in 2015, according to research firm Gartner.The demand for cyber security is on the rise and both companies have stepped up to deliver as can be seen from the quarterly results. Notably, both Fortinet and Check Point have witnessed a higher number of large deal signings.With the advancement in technology, more organizations are adopting a bring-your-own-device (BYOD) policy, which has enhanced employee productivity with anytime, anywhere access, while making it all the more necessary for the organizations to enforce data security measures.Looking at the results of Fortinet and Check Point, we expect positive results from other cyber security players which are scheduled to report soon. Therefore, we believe that it makes sense to invest in this hot industry group.Here are some stocks which could be interesting long-term investment options for those interested in the space. (  -  )CyberArk currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The IT industry is a good place for CyberArk to be operating within, as IT services ranks among the top 20% of industries. The EPS consensus has shot up over the past 90 days to 4 cents per share from a loss per share of 26 cents.The company hasn't even been trading publicly for a full year yet, but has performed extremely well in this short time frame. The company's third-quarter 2014 earnings beat our consensus estimate by a whopping 1600%.CyberArk has built momentum since then, surpassing our consensus for Q4 earnings by 1800%. Indeed, CyberArk's growth rate is too big to ignore. The company is expected to post earnings on May 7. (  -  )VASCO has a Zacks Rank #3. Expect more volatility with this stock, as it has a beta of 2.22. Our consensus estimate calls for an EPS of 18 cents. However, the company is geared to beat earnings this quarter, as it has a positive  of 11.11%.As per the Zacks proprietary methodology, stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank - Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) - and a positive Earnings ESP have a fairly high chance of performing well in the near term. Zacks Earnings ESP shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Also, as a matter of fact, VASCO has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last four quarter with an average surprise of 428.89%. The company is expected to post its next earnings on Apr 28. (  -  )FireEye has a Zacks Rank #3. Our consensus estimate calls for a loss per share of 80 cents.

yber security has now become one of the emerging and growing industries of the broad technology sector. With extensive adoption of Internet usage in mobiles and computers, the need for securing information has increased. And thanks to ceaseless cyber-attacks, the industry is likely to thrive. This could easily be depicted by an astounding run-up in cyber security stocks so far this year.In fact, the one-stop shopping place for this industry -  - has been on the fire and is leading the broad tech space. The product has surged 11.8% so far this year versus the 4.5% gain for the broad technology fund (  ). It has gathered enough interest from investors accumulating $658.6 million in AUM since its debut in November, and average daily volume is also solid, with around 394,000 shares exchanged in hand. Notably, the ETF is just up 0.41% compared to 1.7% gains for XLK over the past one month.As earnings from the cyber security firms are encouraging so far, the ETF will likely regain its solid run in the coming months. Most of the firms have managed to either meet or beat our estimates, spreading an air of optimism into the space yet again. Given this, it might be worth shedding some light on this ETF and its holdings for investors seeking exposure in this space. Below we highlight some of the key details regarding HACK and how recent earnings could contribute to this fund's solid run (read:  ).The fund offers exposure to the companies that ensure safety of computer hardware, software, networks, and fight against any sort of cyber malpractice. It tracks the ISE Cyber Security Index, holding 31 securities in its basket. It is well spread out across components, as each security holds no more than 6.17% of total assets.From an industrial look, software and programming accounts for nearly two-thirds of the portfolio while communication equipment and Internet mobile applications round off the top three. In terms of country exposure, U.S. firms take the top spot at 69%, followed by Israel (14%), the Netherlands (5%), South Korea (5%), Japan (4%), Finland (3%) and Canada (1%).Upbeat earnings and robust guidance from  ,  and  and the subsequent surge in their stock price led to the faith in the space and the ETF. The stocks climbed 5.5%, 12.9% and 6.04% respectively, following the earnings releases. CYBR and FTNT occupy the top and fourth spots, respectively, while CHKP accounts for the twelfth position in the basket. These firms combined to make up for 15.1% share of HACK.CyberArk reported earnings per share of 11 cents, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 4 cents. Revenues surged 89% year over year to $32.9 million and strongly surpassed our estimate of $26 million. The company projects earnings per share in the range of 4-6 cents on 48%-52% year over year revenue growth to $31.5-$32.5 million, up for the ongoing quarter. For 2015, revenues are expected to grow 32-34% to $136-$138 million and earnings per share are projected at 40-44 cents.The revenue guidance for both the quarter and the full year is much higher than our estimate of $31 million and $130 million, respectively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Q2 and FY2015 earnings is currently pegged at 6 cents and 20 cents (read:  ).Earnings per share at Fortinet came at 1 cent which strongly outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a breakeven while revenues of $213 million also edged past our estimate of $204 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is $227 million for the second quarter and $938 million for fiscal 2015, within the company's guided $224-$228 million and $935-$940 million, respectively. Earnings per share are expected in the range of 8-9 cents and 51-52 cents for the ongoing quarter and full fiscal year, respectively, the midpoint of which are much higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 1 cent and 22 cents, respectively.Check Point beat on both the top and the bottom lines by 2 cents and $2.6 million, respectively. The forward guidance for the second quarter and the full year is encouraging. The company expects earnings per share of 90-99 cents on revenues of $380-$400 million for Q2. The midpoints are well above our estimate of 87 cents for earnings and below our estimate of $391 million for revenues at the time of the earnings release. For the fiscal year, revenues and earnings are expected in the range of $1.6-$1.65 billion and $3.90-$4.02, respectively. The midpoints of both are well ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.62 billion and $3.68, respectively. also had a torrid run on its bullish outlook and revenue beat. The stock soared nearly 7.2% on the earnings announcement and hit a 52-week high of $27.28. Though earnings per share of 22 cents met our estimates, revenues of $1.07 billion were well ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.04 billion. For the second quarter, the company expects earnings per share in the range of 38-42 cents and revenues in the range of $1.09-$1.12 billion. The midpoints of both are much higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 28 cents and $1.09 billion at the time of the earning release. JNPR is one of its top 10 holdings, accounting for 4.54% share in the fund's basket.The cyber security ETF's second holding -  - comprising 5.1% share in the basket - topped our revenue estimates and guided higher. Revenues jumped 69% year over year to $125.4 million, well ahead of our estimate of $122 million. However, net loss of 80 cents was in line with our expected loss. Fireeye rose 0.8% following the earnings announcement (see:  ).Fireeye expects revenues in the range of $140-$144 million for the ongoing second quarter and $615-$635 million for the full year. The midpoint of the range is slightly below the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $143 million and $627 million, respectively. Net loss per share is projected at 47-50 cents for the second quarter and $1.75-$1.85 for the full year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at a loss of 88 cents and $3.38 cents, respectively.Though the cyber security ETF underperformed in recent months, it will likely regain its relative strength and outperform the broad technology space given the impressive earnings and solid guidance from many players. Further, the growing awareness for the protection against the cyber threats will likely take the space to new highs. So, for investors seeking to play the potential rise in cybercrime, HACK could be the ticket going forward.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ? Today, you can download  .

ource:  via FlickrUnfortunately, cyber crime isn't going away. Hacking scandals have become an almost regular occurrence for public companies, devastating the shares of those unfortunate enough to find themselves the victims of a major data breach.Investors looking to gain exposure to the cybersecurity market have a wide variety of options to choose from, but a few stocks stand out among the rest. Below are three of the best stocks in the space. Among cybersecurity stocks,  , the owner of Norton Antivirus, is perhaps the most reliable cash generator. Last quarter, it generated $358 million from operating activities, much of which it returns to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. At current levels, the company yields a little more than 2%, and it approved a $1 billion share repurchase program in February (about 6% of its current market cap).Symantec focuses primarily on endpoint security -- solutions installed on particular devices (PCs, mobile devices, etc.) designed to protect them from malicious activity. It's a well-established business and a staple for many IT departments.Symantec will become more of a pure play security business when it completes its planned split later this year: the company will spin off its Information Management business, Veritas, to shareholders. Last quarter, about 41% of Symantec's revenue came from this business, which is wholly unrelated to security. The split should benefit shareholders, creating two more focused businesses. Those interested only in the security business can sell their shares of Veritas. While a reliable cash cow, Symantec doesn't offer much growth. Last month management announced that its security business would enjoy revenue growth of only 0-2% for the current fiscal year. Investors looking for stronger growth could consider a more speculative stock like  . Whereas FireEye isn't yet profitable and is burning through cash, the company is dominating the new cybersecurity market it helped pioneer and has generated impressive revenue growth along the way.FireEye's services focus on advanced persistent threats (APT). In contrast to more traditional signature-based approaches -- the sort employed by Symantec -- FireEye tests potentially malicious software on its network of virtual machines in real time. This allows it to spot zero-day exploits -- exploits that programmers have had exactly zero days to solve.Last year, FireEye's revenue rose a stellar 163% on an annual basis, and if its guidance proves accurate,  . It's difficult to gauge when FireEye's growth will slow, but for more risk tolerant investors seeking a high-growth security stock, it's among the best.Check Point Software is somewhere in between Symantec and FireEye. It's a profitable company, but trading with a trailing price-to-earnings ratio in the mid 20s, it's much more aggressively valued than Symantec. It doesn't pay a dividend like Symantec, but the company is growing much more rapidly. In fact, when Check Point reported earnings late last month, it noted that its revenue rose 9% on an annual basis.Check Point is primarily an Internet security company, with a focus on network firewalls, but also offers other sorts of products (VPNs, intrusion prevention, antivirus, among others) and has been expanding into other areas. So far this year, the company has made two major acquisitions -- Hyperwise and Lacoon Mobile Security. Hyperwise is aimed at stopping zero-day exploits, whereas Lacoon is beefing up Check Point's offerings for mobile devices. Check Point is also targeting APTs, but using a different method than FireEye: rather than run malicious files in a virtual environment, Check Point offers what's called Threat Extraction -- the ability to remove malicious code from seemingly innocuous files.Check Point has been on a solid run, with shares rising nearly 30% in the last 12 months, but it if continues to execute, it could offer further upside.Apple forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering Apple's brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

 reported third-quarter fiscal 2015 adjusted loss per share (excluding amortization and other one-time items but including stock-based compensation) on a proportionate tax basis of 44 cents per share, which was significantly greater than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 18 cents per share. Also, adjusted loss widened from a loss of 25 cents per share reported in the year-ago quarter.Palo Alto Networks reported revenues of $234.2 million, which not only increased 55.4% from the year-ago quarter but also came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $221 million. Improvement in revenues was primarily due to growth in the company's product lineup, recurring subscription and support.Also, new customer wins coupled with expansion of existing customers positively impacted quarterly revenues. Customers at the end of the quarter ending Apr 30 were 24,000. Notably, better-than-expected growth across all its geographic theater was the other positive, which impacted revenues.Product revenues increased 44.5% and came in at $121.5 million, primarily driven by growth in data center products. Also, a 69.2% increase in service revenues on a year-over-year basis positively impacted revenues in the quarter. SaaS-based subscription revenues (part of service revenues) increased 71% on a year-over-year basis.Geographically, on a year-over-year basis, revenues from the Americas increased 60% and represented 67% of total revenue. Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) increased 42% and accounted for 20% of total revenue. Asia-Pacific was up 55% on a year-over year basis, representing 13% of total revenue.The company's adjusted gross margin (excluding amortization and other one-time items but including stock-based compensation) increased 53 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 74.5%, primarily due to favorable product mix and a higher revenue base.Palo Alto Networks reported adjusted operating loss (excluding amortization and other one-time items but including stock-based compensation) of $31.6 million, which increased from a loss of $15.5 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Higher operating expenses (up 62.2% on a year over year basis) impacted operating results. Also, operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues increased 371 bps on a year-over-year basis.The company's adjusted net loss (excluding amortization and other one-time items but including stock-based compensation) came in at $36 million, which widened from a loss of $19.7 million reported in the year-ago quarter.Palo Alto Networks exited the third quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $822.9 million compared with $675.1 million in the previous quarter. Receivables were $150.5 million versus $135.3 million in the previous quarter. Palo Alto Networks' balance sheet does not comprise any long-term debt.The company reported cash flow from operations of $87.2 million during the quarter and free cash flow came in at $77.4 million.For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, Palo Alto Networks expects revenues in the range of $252 million to $256 million (mid-point $254 million), up 41% to 44% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $222 million. The company expects non-GAAP earnings per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 to be in the range of 24 to 25 cents (excluding stock based compensation expenses) as against the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 19 cents per share.Palo Alto Networks offers a network security platform that enables firms, service providers and government bodies to secure their networks. The company reported greater-than-expected loss in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 while revenues came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company provided encouraging fourth-quarter guidance.Revenue growth seems to be steady and was positively impacted by strength across all its geographical regions and business segments. Also, new customer wins coupled with expansion of existing customers positively impacted quarterly revenues. We believe that the company's product refreshes will boost revenues, going forward.Palo Alto Networks replaced its competitor Juniper Networks  as the agency wide security provider for a Canadian government agency. It also became the agency wide security provider for a large U.S. retailer, replacing Cisco  .The company is also keen on expanding its cloud exposure. Nevertheless, a volatile spending environment and competition from Check Point Software Technologies Ltd.  remain concerns.Currently, Palo Alto Networks has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

 is a volatile stock -- and that is putting it mildly. Since its public market debut in late 2013 at $20, FireEye shares have surged as high as $85 and fallen as low as $24.Currently, shares of FireEye are trading right around $44 a share. That is exactly where they should be, according to analysts at Raymond James. In a report published late last month, Raymond James initiated coverage on FireEye with a market perform rating. Although the analysts believes FireEye has a lot of potential, its business model is also fraught with risks.There are two things to like about FireEye: rapid growth and dominance in an emerging cyber-security market.Last year, FireEye revenue rose an  on an annual basis. If its guidance proves accurate, it will rise another 42% to 46% this year. Many other cyber-security vendors cannot offer anything approaching those numbers.This rapid growth likely comes from the novel status of its products. In contrast to other vendors, which rely on more traditional solutions, FireEye sells a class of products designed to stop advanced persistent threats. Its virtual sandbox tests potentially malicious software in real time, allowing it to find exploits and vulnerabilities as the attacks occur.FireEye has other competitors in this space, but its products are widely viewed as best-in-class, according to Raymond James. It believes FireEye currently has roughly half the market for sandbox solutions.There are also plenty of things about FireEye that should make investors cautious. FireEye faces intense competition, continues to burn through cash, and the size of its business is difficult to project.FireEye may offer the best sandbox solution, but it is not the  .  ,  , and Trend Micro offer similar products. Other companies are expected to eventually enter the space, and in time, FireEye sales could be poached by larger companies that are able to offer APT solutions bundled with other products, such as firewalls.FireEye is also not profitable, and management does not expect that to change anytime soon. In 2014, FireEye burned through about $200 million in free cash flow. Raymond James believes the company will eventually achieve profitability, but it does not expect positive free cash flow until 2018.Lastly, the novel nature of the FireEye business makes the size of its future prospects difficult to project. Although IT departments are given fixed budgets that include spending on traditional cyber-security products, APT is often unaccounted for. That is an issue, as FireEye offerings are largely seen as a compliment to, rather than a replacement for, traditional offerings. FireEye has said its total addressable market could be as large as $30 billion, but Raymond James is skeptical. Instead, its analysts believe the total demand for APT products will be around $3.6 billion in 2019.Given its lack of profitability, it is difficult to value FireEye with traditional metrics. On an enterprise value-to-revenue basis, FireEye is aggressively valued compared to more established security vendors but less expensive compared to other small, speculative stocks.FireEye is currently trading at about 15 times enterprise value-to-revenue. That is better than its competitor Palo Alto Networks -- trading at about 17 times -- but worse than a profitable company like  trading at about 10 times.Given this blend of opportunities and challenges, it is easy to see why shares have traded so erratically. In the long run, FireEye will either successfully ramp up its business with continued dominance in the market or get muscled out of its niche as it burns through cash.

 is set to report first-quarter 2015 results on Apr 20. Last quarter, the company posted in-line earnings. It is worth noting that in last four quarters, Check Point has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice while matched the same in the other two posting with an average positive earnings surprise of 0.6%. Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Check Point has been witnessing higher adoption of its Application Control, Anti-Bot and URL Filtering blades which, coupled with higher demand for its data center and high-end appliances, should have a positive impact on the to-be-reported quarter results. Another factor that is likely to contribute to the overall growth is the increasing number of large deals.Furthermore, we remain encouraged by Check Point's sustained focus on expanding its product portfolio through acquisitions and offering industry-leading solutions which will drive growth. Also, we expect that the increasing IT security expenditure will benefit Check Point's results, going forward. Per research firm Gartner, worldwide spending on IT security in 2014 was about $70 billion and is expected to reach $76.9 billion in 2015.Also, the rapid adoption of Check Point's data center appliances and the continuous enhancement in data center product lines are expected to provide adequate support to revenue growth.However, an uncertain economic environment, competitive pressures, currency headwinds and competition from Juniper Networks, Cisco Systems and Fortinet remain the concerns.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Check Point will beat earnings estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 84 cents. Hence, the difference is 0.00%. Check Point's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) when combined with a 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some other companies, which you may want to consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Broadcom Corp.  , with an Earnings ESP of +5.00% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Apple Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +6.05% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Amazon.com Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +150.00% and a Zacks Rank #3.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

However, margins contracted 85 bps primarily due to higher expenses.Adjusted net income (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets and other one-time items calculated on a proportionate tax basis) was $162.1 million or 86 cents, up from $153.5 million or 78 cents reported in the comparable quarter last year.Check Point exited the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $1.28 billion compared with $1.31 billion in the previous quarter. Cash flow from operations was $284.6 million compared with $210.4 million in the previous quarter. During the quarter, Check Point repurchased 3 million shares for $242 million.Check Point expects revenues in the second quarter of 2015 to be the range of $380 million to $400 million, almost in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $391 million at the mid-point. The company expects non-GAAP earnings per share between 90 cents and 99 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 87 cents.The company expects 2015 revenues in the range of $1.600 billion to $1.650 billion and earnings between $3.90 and $4.02 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues and earnings are pegged at $1.616 billion and $3.68 per share, respectively.Check Point delivered better-than-expected first-quarter results. Both the top and bottom lines beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Also, both revenues and earnings compared favorably on a year over year basis. The company also provided an encouraging second quarter and full year guidance.Furthermore, the rapid adoption of Check Point's data center appliances and the continuous enhancements in data center product lines are expected to provide adequate support to revenue growth.Moreover, Check Point's settlement with the Israeli tax authorities is a long-term positive. The company's continuous share buybacks bode well for investors.However, competition from Cisco Systems Inc.  , Juniper Networks Inc.  and Fortinet Inc.  ; an uncertain economic environment, competitive pressure and currency headwinds are concerns.Check Point carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"n a move to enhance its mobile security capabilities, Internet and network security provider,  .  recently acquired an Israel-based mobile security provider, Lacoon Mobile Security. Though the financial terms of the deal remain undisclosed by both parties, an Israeli newspaper estimated that the deal was worth nearly $80 million.Headquartered in Tel-Aviv, Israel and founded in 2011, Lacoon offers enterprise-level security solutions for Apple Inc.'s  iOS and Google Inc.'s  Android-based mobile devices. Apart from this, the company provides real-time mobile security and intelligence to any organization's existing security and mobility infrastructures.With this, the company mainly focuses on organizations which have bring-your-own-device (BYOD) policies. Lacoon's technology detects device, application and in-network threats that BYOD exposes to the enterprises.According to chief executive officer and chairman of Check Point, Gil Shwed, ""Mobility has become the norm in business operations now more than ever before, because it enables employee productivity with anytime, anywhere access. However, companies are not necessarily protecting the data on mobile devices properly.""Therefore, the need for complete mobile security solutions has become most important. Though Check Point had launched its mobile security solution called Capsule last year, it did not get market attention due to the lack of a comprehensive security solution for mobile devices.Check Point has revealed that it will integrate Lacoon's products and employees into its operations thereby adding Advanced Mobile Application Threat Emulation, behavioral risk analysis and real-time anomaly detection capabilities to Capsule.Lacoon is the second acquisition made by Check Point in 2015. In February, the company acquired a cybersecurity startup, Hyperwise, also based in Israel. Hyperwise has developed a CPU-level threat detection technology that can eliminate cyber threats at the pre-infection point.We remain encouraged by Check Point's sustained focus on expanding its product portfolio through acquisitions and offering industry-leading solutions which have helped it to drive growth. Also, we expect that the increasing IT security expenditure will benefit Check point's results, going forward. Per research firm Gartner, worldwide spending on IT security in 2014 was about $70 billion and is expected to reach $76.9 billion in 2015.Moreover, breaches at Anthem Inc.  and Sony Corporation in late 2014 have increased awareness about the need for cybersecurity products.Currently, Check Point carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

echnology stocks surged yesterday after the busiest earnings week started off with some of the companies reporting strong quarterly results. In the broader technology sector, cyber security stocks stole the show after Fortinet Inc.  and Check Point Software Technologies Ltd.  reported better-than-expected first-quarter 2015 results.Fortinet gained more than 9% in after-hours trade following better-than expected results wherein both the top line and the bottom line beat the respective Zacks Consensus Estimates. The company's revenues grew 26% year over year primarily aided by solid sales and marketing strategies and a strong network security market. A large number of deal wins and the addition of over 8,000 customers also contributed.However, quarterly adjusted earnings of a penny compared unfavorably with the year-ago quarter figure of 5 cents per share. The year-over-year decline in earnings per share was mainly due to higher operating expenses as a result of increased investments in research and development and the implementation of new marketing strategies.Fortinet's rival, Check Point, also delivered robust first-quarter results with both earnings and revenues beating the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate and improving year over year. The stock surged over 5% in yesterday's trading session.Check Point witnessed higher demand for its data center and high-end appliances. Another factor that contributed to the overall growth was the increasing number of large deal signings.It should be noted from yesterday's results that the cyber security stocks are witnessing double-digit growth, while the overall IT spending is anticipated to grow just under 3% in 2015, according to research firm Gartner.The demand for cyber security is on the rise and both companies have stepped up to deliver as can be seen from the quarterly results. Notably, both Fortinet and Check Point have witnessed a higher number of large deal signings.With the advancement in technology, more organizations are adopting a bring-your-own-device (BYOD) policy, which has enhanced employee productivity with anytime, anywhere access, while making it all the more necessary for the organizations to enforce data security measures.Moreover, breaches at Anthem Inc.  and Sony Corp.  earlier this year boosted the need for cyber security products. Also, we expect the increasing spending on IT security to benefit cyber security companies' results, going forward. Per Gartner, worldwide spending on IT security in 2014 was about $70 billion and is likely to reach $76.9 billion in 2015.Looking at the results of Fortinet and Check Point, we expect positive results from other cyber security players which are scheduled to report soon. Therefore, we believe that it makes sense to invest in this hot industry group.Here are some stocks which could be interesting long-term investment options for those interested in the space.CyberArk currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The IT industry is a good place for CyberArk to be operating within, as IT services ranks among the top 20% of industries. The EPS consensus has shot up over the past 90 days to 4 cents per share from a loss per share of 26 cents.The company hasn't even been trading publicly for a full year yet, but has performed extremely well in this short time frame. The company's third-quarter 2014 earnings beat our consensus estimate by a whopping 1600%.CyberArk has built momentum since then, surpassing our consensus for Q4 earnings by 1800%. Indeed, CyberArk's growth rate is too big to ignore. The company is expected to post earnings on May 7.VASCO has a Zacks Rank #3. Expect more volatility with this stock, as it has a beta of 2.22. Our consensus estimate calls for an EPS of 18 cents. However, the company is geared to beat earnings this quarter, as it has a positive  of 11.11%.As per the Zacks proprietary methodology, stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank - Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) - and a positive Earnings ESP have a fairly high chance of performing well in the near term. Zacks Earnings ESP shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Also, as a matter of fact, VASCO has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last four quarter with an average surprise of 428.89%. The company is expected to post its next earnings on Apr 28.FireEye has a Zacks Rank #3. Our consensus estimate calls for a loss per share of 80 cents. However, the company is geared to report better bottom-line results, as it has a positive Earnings ESP of 6.25%.Also, as a matter of fact, FireEye has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the last four quarter with an average positive earnings surprise of 7.02%.

"etwork security company  delivered a strong set of first-quarter earnings on Monday, and the market rewarded investors by taking the stock higher by 5% on the day. Moreover, management announced a threat intelligence partnership with  . There's a lot to like about the earnings report, so let's take a more detailed look. First, the earnings:And the guidance:In a nutshell, revenue came in at the top end of company guidance, while earnings exceeded expectations. In addition, the second-quarter guidance, from a management that tends to give a conservative outlook, is pretty strong. The one disappointment came from management's affirmation, on the , of its full-year revenue guidance of $1.6 billion to $1.65 billion.In a review of  , I referenced the company's plans to invest in new hires to accelerate revenue growth. The expectation was that the company would feel the burden of the costs in the first half, with revenue starting to accelerate in the second half, as the new hires start to be more productive. As such, Check Point beat earnings estimates for the first quarter but didn't increase revenue guidance for the full year -- almost a mirror image of what some investors might have expected. On the same day, Check Point announced a partnership with FireEye. Essentially, the two companies will share threat intelligence data, for their respective customers to better benefit from their combined intelligence. According to Check Point's press release, both companies will ""update threat information in near-real time within an organization's environment.""On the Check Point ,  analyst Karl Keirstead asked a question about the overlap in the customer base between the two companies. CEO Gil Shwed replied:In other words, the partnership with FireEye is not likely to cause significant cannibalization for both companies. That's good news all round. Turning back to the numbers, a breakout of revenue demonstrates some strong underlying trends. Check Point operates a razor-and-blade business model, whereby software blades (20% of revenue in the quarter) and software updates (49%) are sold into its installed base of product and license holders (31%). Check Point needs ongoing product and license revenue growth to generate strong software blade and software update revenue growth.The good news is that, after a period of negative growth in 2012-2013, product and license growth is running in the mid-single digits. Software update revenue tends to follow product and license growth -- therefore, it's reasonable to expect good growth in software update revenue in future quarters. For reference, software blade revenue grew 20.4% in the quarter.Source: Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. presentations. The numbers look good from Check Point, and the company's growth initiatives should yield more growth in a few quarters' time. Meanwhile, the company continues to generate gross margin in the high-80% range. Operating income margin came in at 52.9% in the quarter, and there are no immediate signs that Check Point's excellent profit margins are about to come down.All told, a combination of revenue growth, margin generation, and strong free cash flow makes Check Point an attractive stock for investors looking for exposure to the network security sector.One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World Wide Web to bed. And if you act right away, it could make you wildly rich. Experts are calling it the single largest business opportunity in the history of capitalism...  is calling it ""transformative""...

Major health insurer Anthem Inc is just the latest in a long line of .Massive retailers like Target Corporation and Home Depot Inc and the world’s largest financial institutions like JPMorgan Chase & Co and Citigroup Inc have been hacked in the past few years, despite advanced security systems in place.And lawyers are beginning to look into corporate liability for giving up customers’ sensitive information.Needless to say, most companies and individuals are finally waking up to the pervasive needs of robust cybersecurity. Companies can’t even keep hackers out after spending more on their IT than some developing nations spend on their entire economies. The world is spending $71 billion on this industry, and the sector is still very young.That’s why cybersecurity stocks have been roaring in the past year. While the market has climbed a mere 12.5%, Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (CHKP) is up 20%, Fortinet Inc (FTNT) soared almost 50%, and VASCO Data Security International, Inc. (VDSI) has surged a startling 230%.Let’s take a closer look at each to see why these are the best cybersecurity stocks to buy.With a 20% 12-month gain, Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. is the slacker of the group. And it still has plenty of headroom for 2015.CHKP’s claim to fame is its Software Blade architecture, which is a very flexible and effective security architecture that allows CHKP to service the needs of clients of all shapes and sizes. On the consumer side, CHKP builds ZoneAlarm to keep hackers, spyware and identity thieves away from your data.At the end of January, FBR Securities raised its price target to $90 — 16% higher than current prices — and upgraded the stock to an “Outperform.”The company reported earnings in late January, and while earnings missed on the downside, revenue was higher than expected. And that suits CHKP just fine since management has stated that its goal is to increase revenue (aka grow its business), which usually has a short-term effect on earnings.Basically, you’re spending money to acquire customers and since not everyone will become a customer, you lose money on some of your efforts. But the customers you get, given the huge margins in the business, will boost earnings over the long term, as you build a bigger customer base.Fortinet Inc is also in growth mode, which has knocked the stock down since it quarterly numbers were announced. But it’s all part of larger plan and the next stage in the company’s growth efforts.Fortinet acquired XDN Inc, a cloud-based content solutions provider, a couple years ago, which will certainly help expand FTNT’s business into the cloud. Its main product is its FortiGate solutions architecture.FTNT has been around since 2000, so it has seen market highs and lows and also has been around to establish a solid reputation in the enterprise and network security sectors.In the past year, FTNT stock has risen almost 50%, and its recent results, as well as a jittery market have slowed down its growth track. After a selloff on its earnings report, the stock has continued hitting higher lows, which is a bullish sign.And having a good, longstanding reputation in the sector is going to become increasingly valuable as the space matures.The overachiever of the group is Vasco Data Security, Inc., up more than 200% in the past year.But, when things go up, they also come down. In the past month, VDSI has pulled back 10%. And it has a growing amount of short interest in the stock, which means a growing number of investors are expecting the price to go down before it goes up.Given that half of the shares are institutionally owned, there’s likely a fair amount of big money hedging their gains by putting shorts on the stock in case an unforeseen event driven selloff happens to the markets or the sector.On the other hand, Vasco still is up 200% in the past year. And the thing about short interest is, if the stock starts to rally, the shorts will have to cover at higher and higher prices, causing what’s called a short squeeze. Short squeezes accentuate the run of the stock to higher levels.Its key sectors are banking and financial services, which is a good place to be. And their clients tend to be big players in smaller markets, like Norway or Colombia. But that’s a great niche when competing with bigger firms that don’t focus on those clients and smaller competitors that don’t have the experience or reputation to grow their business with these unique clients.And the global slowdown shouldn’t be too difficult to work through since these companies need what VDSI is selling and the costs aren’t that much of an issue to them.VDSI is going to be volatile here, so if you buy in, think of this as an investment in cybersecurity growth for the long term, not a quick trade on a trendy sector.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@3 Cybersecurity Stocks for 2015 and Beyond@2015-02-10@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-cybersecurity-stocks-2015-and-beyond-2015-02-10
 reported second-quarter fiscal 2015 adjusted loss per share (excluding amortization and other one-time items but including stock-based compensation) on a proportionate tax basis of 42 cents per share, which was significantly wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 13 cents per share. Also, adjusted loss widened from a loss of 18 cents per share reported in the year-ago quarter.Palo Alto Networks reported revenues of $217.7 million, which not only increased 54.3% from the year-ago quarter but also came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $202 million. Improvement in revenues was primarily due to the company's product lineup, which includes its next-gen firewall security appliances.Also, new customer wins coupled with expansion of existing customers positively impacted quarterly revenues. Customers at the end of the quarter ending Jan 31 were 22,000. Notably, better-than-expected growth across all its geographic theater was the other positive which impacted revenues.Product revenues increased 43.1% and came in at $115.6 million, primarily driven by growth in high end appliances (including the PA-7050). Also, a 69.4% increase in service revenues on a year-over-year basis positively impacted revenues in the quarter. SaaS-based subscription revenue (part of service revenues increased 74% on a year-over-year basis).Geographically, on a year-over-year basis, revenues from the Americas increased 62% and represented 67% of total revenue. Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) increased 35% and accounted for 21% of the total revenue. Asia-Pacific was up 51% on a year-over year basis, representing 12% of total revenue.The company's adjusted gross margin (excluding amortization and other one-time items but including stock-based compensation) increased 143 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 74.8%, primarily due to favorable product mix and a higher revenue base.Palo Alto Networks reported adjusted operating loss (excluding amortization and other one-time items but including stock-based compensation) of $29.9 million, which increased from a loss of $14.4 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Higher operating expenses (up 72.2% on a year over year basis) impacted operating results. Also, operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues increased 938 bps on a year-over-year basis.The company's adjusted net loss (excluding amortization and other one-time items but including stock-based compensation) came in at $34.3 million or 42 cents per share, which widened from a loss of $14.6 million or 18 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.Palo Alto Networks exited the second quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $675.1 million compared with $771.5 million in the previous quarter. Receivables were $135.3 million versus $116.2 million in the previous quarter. Palo Alto Networks' balance sheet does not comprise any long-term debt.The company reported cash flow from operations of $76.8 million during the quarter and free cash flow came in at $70.7 million.For the third quarter of fiscal 2015, Palo Alto Networks expects revenues in the range of $219 million to $223 million (mid-point $221 million), up 45% to 48% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $210 million. The company expects non-GAAP earnings for the third quarter of fiscal 2015 to be in the range of 19 to 20 cents (excluding stock based compensation expenses), well above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 14 cents per share.Palo Alto Networks offers a network security platform that enables firms, service providers and government bodies to secure their networks. The company reported greater-than-expected loss in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 while revenues came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company provided encouraging third-quarter guidance.Revenue growth seems to be steady and was positively impacted by strength across all its geographical regions and business segments. Also, new customer wins coupled with expansion of existing customers positively impacted quarterly revenues. We believe that the company's product refreshes will boost revenues, going forward.Palo Alto Networks replaced its competitor Juniper Networks  as the agency wide security provider for a Canadian government agency. It also became the agency wide security provider for a large U.S. retailer, replacing Cisco  .The company is also keen on expanding its cloud exposure. Nevertheless, a volatile spending environment and competition from Check Point Software Technologies Ltd.  remain concerns.Currently, Palo Alto Networks has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"Shutterstock photoO nline security vendor Qualys is enhancing products and cross-selling more of its services to broaden and deepen a global customer base continuously more cognizant of intensifying cybersecurity threats, the company's CEO tells IBD.The goal is to keep the company on the cutting edge of a business environment permeated with concerns about hackers and data breaches. But as analysts note, whileQualys (  ) boasts its share of success, it operates in a crowded field of technology companies that want a piece of the corporate security spending pie, leaving it with evolving competitive challenges.Qualys, founded in 1999, went public in 2012 and has been on a tear. Despite some volatility, its stock is up 84% over the past 52 weeks and hit an all-time high of 50 on March 5. That punctuated a run that followed Qualys' latest -- and strongest -- quarterly results.Fourth-quarter 2014 revenue of $36.6 million was up 26% from a year earlier, Qualys reported in February. The company tripled earnings per share with 15 cents, beating the consensus view of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters by 6 cents.For 2014, Qualys produced revenue of $133.6 million, up by 24% year over year, and EPS rose 130% to 46 cents. It added more than 1,000 customers in 2014 to reach about 7,700 active customers in more than 100 countries.Qualys forecasts top-line growth of 25% to 27% for 2015 and EPS of 50 cents to 55 cents.CEO Philippe Courtot says about two-thirds of revenue is generated in the U.S. and that likely will continue to be the case this year, as domestic companies are on the forefront of tech security investments. But he said Qualys is ""totally global"" and its reach extends deep into Europe and parts of Asia, where the company anticipates long-term growth. It counts most of the Fortune 100 as customers.""Cybersecurity has clearly become front and center. It's on the minds of boards and CEOs as well as security people, because it needs to be,"" Courtot said. ""We are extremely well-positioned to help them.""Qualys, part of IBD's Computer Software-Security industry group, has a best-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99.Symantec (  ),Check Point Software (  ) andPalo Alto Networks (  ) are the group's largest by market cap.Infiltrations of major companies such asJPMorgan Chase (  ),Home Depot (HD),Sony (SNE) andTarget (TGT) have amplified worries about data breaches and drawn heightened attention to services provided by the likes of Qualys. A survey by Bank Director in January found that 82% of 149 bank executives and directors think cybersecurity is the chief risk that their institutions face this year. ""Cybersecurity remains an emerging, nuanced and constantly evolving issue,"" Bank Director President Al Dominick said in an emailed statement.Courtot says cybercriminals are active across industries from retail to high-tech to health care. Health insurer Premera Blue Cross said this month that it had been infiltrated by cyberattackers who might have gained access to medical and financial data of 11 million customers.""We are living in an interconnected world, and this has opened the door for the bad guys to try to penetrate our defenses,"" Courtot said. ""The problem has become acute.""Increasingly sophisticated and frequent cybercrimes are expected to motivate steady investment in online safeguards over the next five years, according to a March report from Ireland-based Research and Markets. It predicts that the global security and vulnerability management market will grow about 10% annually between 2014 and 2019.All of that is scary for business executives, but it amounts to expanding opportunity for Qualys. In terms of the need for security services, ""it's a great space that they are in,"" analyst Richard Williams of Summit Research told IBD.The flagship Qualys Cloud Platform is a service that, according to Courtot, capitalizes on the speed and flexibility of the Internet to provide faster and more thorough security checks and responses than services not in the cloud. The platform and integrated applications serve a range of functions, from attack monitoring and web application scanning, to policy compliance and website security testing, to firewalls and malware detection.Unlike traditional in-house enterprise software security, Qualys says its Internet-based service can provide security intelligence on demand, via constantly updated data, while also automating auditing, compliance and protection for IT systems and web applications.This, Courtot said, makes Qualys unique and explains why its customer base is continually expanding. Its cloud-based services are both more comprehensive and faster than most in-house security systems, he added, enabling high-end service at a lower cost than what most companies can create by themselves.While cost-efficient, as the scale of the problems that the company is combating swells, Qualys is selling more applications and boosting the amount of revenue it generates per client. A few years ago, Courtot said, a $100,000 annual subscription would have been big for the company, but now Qualys has several multimillion-dollar deals.It has eight of the 10 largest global banks as customers, also tech powers such asAmazon (AMZN) andMicrosoft (MSFT). And it has partnerships with managed-service providers and consulting firms such asIBM (IBM),Verizon (VZ) and Symantec.Courtot says Qualys steadily enhances and expands its products and services to keep pace with customer needs. This year it rolled out a more comprehensive web-application-scanning product and soon will debut a new malware protection offering, among others, he said.""We are continuing to expand our reach,"" he said, adding that the increasing demand and its advancing suite of products and services should fuel top-line growth.While most analysts polled by Thomson Reuters call Qualys stock a hold, views are generally optimistic on the company for this year. ""They are very fortunate that their core vertical"" -- the cloud platform -- ""is still growing at a pretty good clip,"" Williams said.There are some concerns about competition and its impact on future earnings, he said, as well as the valuation of the stock, given its climb over the past year.While unique in what it provides, Williams said, Qualys is competing in a world saturated with tech companies trying to win IT dollars, with security only one piece of the pie. And while many companies are increasing tech spending, most firms are very careful about committing to new expenses. ""It's tough to differentiate yourself in such a highly competitive space,"" he said.In a March research note, Williams wrote: ""There's much to like about Qualys,"" emphasizing that its vulnerability assessment scanning solution has proved very accurate at detecting security issues.""Customers clearly like this technology and execution, based on renewal rates of virtually 100% over several years,"" he said.But, he noted, with the broader security market projected to grow around 10% over the next several years, and with new competition popping up regularly and making it challenging to expand market share, ""we believe that market factors may prevent Qualys from growing north of 20%"" beyond 2015. Slowing future growth, he told IBD, would minimize room for the stock to continue to climb.Frederick Ziegel, a Topeka Capital Markets analyst, said in a February report that Qualys ""delivered a spectacular"" fourth quarter, which ""added further evidence that the product portfolio is broadening (and will continue to do so).""

 (  ) reported decent fourth-quarter 2014 results wherein the top line registered significant year-over-year growth while the bottom line declined. The year-over-year decline in earnings per share was mainly due to higher operating expenses as a result of increased investments in research and development and marketing strategies.On a GAAP basis, the company reported earnings of 4 cents per share compared with 7 cents in the year-ago quarter.Fortinet reported fourth-quarter revenues of approximately $224 million, up 26.3% from the year-ago quarter. Revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $209 million as well as the company's guided range of $206-$211 million.The year-over-year improvement was primarily aided by solid yield on sales and marketing strategies and a strong network security market. Moreover, a 58.8% surge in Product revenues and 33.3% increase in Services & other revenues contributed to the year-over-year revenue growth.Geographically, the Americas (41% of total revenue) increased 2% from the year-ago quarter, EMEA (38%) increased 43% year over year, while Asia Pacific (21%) grew 9% from fourth-quarter 2013.Billings increased 35% on a year-over-year basis to $282.7 million and surpassed the company's guidance range of $245-$250 million.

Moreover, gross margin expanded 110 basis points (bps) year over year to 70.7% and came in line with the company's guidance range of 70-71%.Higher-than-expected adjusted operating expenses (up 40.1% year over year) resulted in a decline in operating margin. As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses increased 610 bps to 61.8%, thereby impacting margins. Adjusted operating margin came in at 9%, down from 14.4% in the year-ago quarter.Fortinet exited 2014 with cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $720 million, up from $491.4 million at the end of 2013.

During the year, the company repurchased $44 million shares.For the first quarter of 2015, management expects revenues in the range of $200-$205 million, a 20% year-over-year increase at the mid-point.

The company reported decent fourth quarter results wherein the top line registered a significant year-over-year growth while the bottom line declined. However, the company provided encouraging first-quarter and fiscal 2015 guidance. Also, revenues grew year over year aided by decent performance by the operating segments.Despite the continuing macro uncertainty, Fortinet seems positive on a healthy network security market, its product line-up and investment plans.Margin contraction due to continuous investments in research and development and competition from key network security players such as Cisco Systems Inc. (  ), Check Point (  ), Juniper Networks (  ) and Palo Alto Networks are the concerns.

hares of  (  ) hit a new 52-week high of $80.82 on Dec 24, eventually closing at $80.44. The closing share price represents a one-year return of 26.4% and a year-to-date return of 24.7%. The average trading volume for the last three months aggregated 1,353K shares.Check Point delivered positive earnings surprises in all the last four quarters with an average beat of 1.5%. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has a market cap of $15.35 billion with long-term earnings growth expectations of 8.9%.Notably, the company has also gained momentum from its strong fundamentals and better-than-expected third quarter fiscal 2014 results released on Oct 23, 2014.The recent price appreciation can be attributed to Check Point's rapid adoption of data center appliances and the continuous enhancements in data center product lines. Moreover, recent strategic acquisitions, strong client adoption and buyback strategies are some of the catalysts driving the stock.Check Point's top line increased 7.6% year over year and also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, primarily due to growth in its Products & Software Blades, Software Updates and maintenance revenues. Another factor that contributed to the overall growth scenario was the increasing number of large deal signings. During the quarter, Check Point recorded 10% year-over-year increase in customers who signed deals worth $1.0 million or more.Earnings also came in strong at 84 cents, up from 80 cents reported in the comparable quarter last year and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate.The company also provided encouraging fourth-quarter guidance. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, Check Point expects non-GAAP earnings per share (excluding stock based compensation expenses) to be in the range of 99 cents and $1.09 per share, well above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 98 cents per share.Also, the company expects its revenues in the range of $395 million to $430 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $415 million. The company's encouraging guidance was primarily due to higher adoption of its Application Control, Anti-Bot and URL Filtering blades coupled with higher demand for its data center and high-end appliances.Per IDC's new report, corporate spending on threat intelligence security services will reach $1.4 billion in 2018 from an estimated $905.5 million in 2014. These predictions bode well for Check Point which has launched ThreatCloud IntelliStore, a threat intelligence marketplace enabling enterprises to choose from different customized threat neutralizing solutions.Additionally, Check Point has extended its security offerings to public cloud services by making its security gateways software available on the Microsoft (  ) Azure Marketplace.Moreover, Check Point's 21000, 13000, 41000 and 61000 high-end appliance series (running on blade architecture) have gained traction. Going forward, we believe that Check Point will incrementally benefit from customer upgrades as they deploy the software blade architectures related to Threat Emulation, Application Control and Compliance and their subsequent upgraded versions. As these software blades are cloud based, they are expected to find more takers due to their cost effectiveness and accessibility features.As things stand now, we believe that Check Point's wide experience in the security space and consistent delivery of such solutions will help it to grow its market share. Nevertheless, an uncertain economic environment, competitive pressures, currency headwinds and competition from Juniper Networks (  ), Cisco Systems, Inc. (  ) and Fortinet remain concerns.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

n a nutshell, Network security company  pleased the market  at the top end of expectations. In doing so, it also announced its intent to increase investment in order to accelerate future revenue growth. Of course, more investment usually results in companies suffering an initial drag on earnings before generating higher profits down the line. Indeed, company guidance indicates this dynamic at play in 2015. Let's take a closer look at the results. A brief look at the earnings:Guidance:Earnings and revenue came in at the top end of guidance for a strong fourth quarter. However, first quarter and full-year EPS guidance are below analyst estimates. The reason?On the , Check Point management outlined the intent to increase investment in order to accelerate revenue growth. In particular, management expects to substantially increase sales and marketing hiring, with much of it being front-end loaded.In other words, expect operating expenses to increase in the first half of the year but revenue to start to jump in the second half, as the extra hires start generating sales. Indeed, as you can see above, full-year revenue guidance is 2% more than estimates. For those of you unfamiliar with the company, Check Point is known for being a high-margin, high cash-generating company, albeit with only single-digit revenue growth in recent years. Check Point operates a business model whereby it sells hardware products, which are sometimes bundled with software blades (with various applications), and software updates and subscriptions.Products and licenses generated 34.8% of 2014 revenue and contributed to an 81.6% gross margin. The good news is that revenue growth remains solid, so Check Point should be able to grow future software update and maintenance revenue. The latter contributed 47.5% of 2014 revenue and came with an 89% gross margin.Source: Check Point Software PresentationsHowever, this is not the whole story. Check Point software blade revenue is also growing strongly at 19.5% year-over-year for the fourth quarter, another indication of future software update and maintenance revenue growth.The following chart breaks out the composition of revenue in the last four years. We can how software blade and subscription revenue is growing -- not bad, especially when you consider that it comes with a 97.8% gross margin.Source: Check Point Software PresentationsMeanwhile, its operating margin continues to come in at the 55% to 60% range.Source: Check Point Software Presentations All told, this looks like a good report. The midpoint of full-year 2015 revenue guidance implies a year-over-year growth rate of 8.6%. Furthermore, the higher-margin parts of its business (software blades and subscriptions and software updates and maintenance) are growing faster than its products and licenses, increasing the potential for margin expansion. Going forward, investors should monitor the success of its growth plans.Apple forgot to show you something at their recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat though; There's a small company that's powering Apple's brand-new gadgets.

 (  ) is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2014 results on Jan 29. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 1.2%. It is worth noting that Check Point has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the four preceding quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 1.5%. Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Check Point delivered better-than-expected third-quarter results. Also, both earnings and revenues compared favorably on a year-over-year basis, primarily due to an increase in revenues from Products & Software Blades and improvement in Software Updates and maintenance revenues.Check Point also witnessed higher adoption of its Application Control, Anti-Bot and URL Filtering blades coupled with higher demand for its data center and high-end appliances. Another factor that contributed to the overall growth was the increasing number of large deal signings.Furthermore, the rapid adoption of Check Point's data center appliances and the continuous enhancements in data center product lines are expected to provide adequate support to revenue growth.Moreover, Check Point's settlement with the Israeli tax authorities is a long-term positive. The company's continuous share buybacks bode well for investors.However, competition from Cisco Systems Inc., Juniper Networks Inc. and Fortinet Inc.; an uncertain economic environment, competitive pressure, currency headwinds and Check Point's significant European exposure are concerns.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Check Point will beat earnings estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 98 cents. Hence, the difference is 0.00%. Check Point's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) when combined with a 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some other companies, which you may want to consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Expedia Inc.

eyond a reasonable doubt, it's been a good year for the U.S. markets. Bolstered by a firm domestic recovery, indexes have ignored international headwinds for most part of the year. An improvement in the employment situation led to the Fed ending its third round of bond buying. Further, expectations of a sooner-than-expected rate hike are gaining strength.However, it is quite a different story when it comes to international markets. The rest of the world has faced troublesome economic conditions. This includes such dependable growth stories such as China and India. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's stimulus measures are being tested in Japan. Despite these factors, stocks in China and Japan have gained recently. However, overall gains still lag the performance clocked in by the US markets.To put things in perspective, all U.S. indices are set to end the year in the green. Despite a late correction, the Dow, S&P 500 (.INX) and Nasdaq have gained 3.6%, 7.6% and 10.3% respectively, year-to-date. A recovery in GDP has been the primary reason for these gains.GDP shrunk 2.9% in the first quarter of 2014, the worst performance in five years. However, GDP increased by 4.6% in the second quarter and 3.9% in the third quarter, according to the second estimate. Real personal consumption expenditures fueled growth on both occasions.Meanwhile, the economy added the most number of jobs in November since Jan 2012. The economy also added a minimum of 200,000 jobs for 10 straight-months in November. This is the longest stretch in more than 30 years. Unemployment rate remained at a six-year low of 5.8%.However, the rest of the world has faced economic difficulties, particularly, Europe. Benchmarks notched record highs early in June after ECB reduced its key interest rates. The refinancing rate was lowered to 0.15% from 0.25% and the marginal lending facility rate was reduced to 0.40% from 0.75%. ECB also cut the deposit rates to -0.10%; thereby becoming the first central bank to have a negative rate.Additionally, ECB deployed a series of targeted long-term refinancing operations in an effort to boost bank lending to the non-financial private sector in the Eurozone.However, data coming in from this part of the world has been intermittently worrying. For instance, earlier this month, industrial output in Germany expanded 0.2% in October, less than analysts' expectation of a rise by 0.3%. Previous months' data was also revised lower to growth of 1.1% from 1.4%.Even so, the DAX has crossed pre-crisis levels. Being an energy importer, it may benefit from lower  . However, it remains susceptible to Russia related tensions though. In contrast, the FTSE 100 closed at its lowest level in nearly 18 months following a slump in oil prices.Following a recent meeting, the ECB President Mario Draghi indicated that the ECB may consider additional monetary stimulus in the Eurozone to revive the economy. However, he also added that monetary expansion may be provided by early 2015.Moreover, ECB also kept the interest rate unchanged at record level of 0.05%. ECB also lowered its guidance for next year's economic growth in the common currency bloc. The central bank now expects that the economy will grow at a pace of 1%, down from its earlier projection of 1.6%. Draghi stated that the decline in oil prices will increase deflationary pressure in the area.The Ukraine crisis and the standoff with Western countries invited sanctions on key Russian economic sectors and companies belonging to bank, energy and defense.Russia's central bank sees its economy shrinking by 4.5-4.7% if oil continues at around $60 per barrel. Meanwhile, the ruble has tumbled to a record low versus the dollar. Analysts have indicated that the U.S. Congress will contribute funds to help Ukraine combat insurgents.Japan's economy contracted for the second successive quarter, surprising economists and market watchers. GDP declined 1.6% in the Jul-Sep period, following a contraction in the second quarter. Second quarter's contraction was revised from the earlier estimate of 7.1%, to a marginally worse number of 7.3%.This was possibly a result of a hike in consumption tax in April from 5% to 8%. Subsequently, the Bank of Japan announced that it will step up asset purchases to 80 trillion yen on annual basis. This is a significant increase from its earlier announced target range of 60-70 trillion yen.These announcements led to the Japanese Prime Minister's call for a snap election in mid-December, two years ahead of schedule. Following a decisive victory for Abe, the Nikkei declined 1.6% on Monday to close at its lowest level since Nov 17.Meanwhile, China continues to face its own set of challenges. On Nov 21, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) decreased the one-year benchmark lending rate by 40 basis points to 5.6%. This is the first reduction in rates undertaken in more than two years.The move to reduce rates has come after several economic reports indicated weakness in the economy. Dismal manufacturing data and a slump in the real estate sector meant that the GDP growth target looked increasingly unattainable.Over the next week the benchmark gained 9.5%. During the two weeks following the rate cut, a slew of new investor accounts were created to trade on the Shanghai stock exchange. The outlook for China stocks continues to be strong despite recent volatility and subsequent control measures taken by the market regulator. Most analysts expect the benchmark index to consolidate around the 3,000 mark.Given the struggles of markets across the world, it may seem only the U.S. markets have emerged unscathed in 2014. Others have recovered from pre-crisis levels, but have not stabilized around new highs.Additionally, economic fundamentals for the rest of the world remains shaky, raising questions about the sustainability of any gains made. The notable exception is, of course, China, where the benchmark Shanghai Composite has gained 43% year to date.Consequently, it presents several good investment alternatives. We have explored some of them earlier in greater detail. (Read:  ). This is why we offer three alternatives from across the world, each of which has a good Zacks Rank.

"nvestors in Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd. (Symbol: CHKP) saw new options become available this week, for the December 20th expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CHKP options chain for the new December 20th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $75.00 strike price has a current bid of 10 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $75.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $74.90 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CHKP, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $76.98/share today.Because the $75.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 84%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of CHKP stock at the current price level of $76.98/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $77.50. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 1.33% if the stock gets called away at the December 20th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CHKP shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd. , as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing CHKP's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $77.50 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $77.50 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

Also, better-than-expected growth across all its geographic theater positively impacted quarterly revenues.Product revenues increased 34.4% and came in at $101.5 million, primarily driven by growth in high end appliances (including the PA-7050). Also, a 72.5% increase in service revenues on a year-over-year basis positively impacted revenues in the quarter.Notably, Palo Alto Networks is also seeing more customer wins and increasing spending at existing ones.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $195 million. The company expects non-GAAP earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2015 to be in the range of 16 to 17 cents, well above the Zacks Consensus Estimate loss of 10 cents per share.Palo Alto Networks offers a network security platform that enables firms, service providers and government bodies to secure their networks. The company reported wider-than-expected loss in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 while revenues came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

 (  ) reported adjusted earnings (excluding amortization, restructuring and other one-time items but including stock-based compensation) of 43 cents in the second quarter of fiscal 2015, comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 37 cents.Symantec reported revenues on a non-GAAP basis of $1.617 billion, which not only lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.623 billion but were also down 1.2% year over year. Lower revenues from Content, Subscription and Maintenance segment (down 3.6%) more than offset the 24.6% increase in revenues from the License segment.Now coming to the company's realigned business segments - Consumer Security, Enterprise Security and Information Management.Symantec's Consumer Security segment revenues were down 6% year over year primarily due to the exit of certain OEM contracts which were not profitable as well as rearrangement of certain retail channels.Revenues from Enterprise Security were also down 1% from the year-ago quarter due to the continued softness in Endpoint Management, which more than offset the increase from Endpoint Protection and DLP products.Information Management revenues increased 3% year over year, primarily due to improvement in the Enterprise Backup business.Symantec's adjusted gross margin (excluding amortization, restructuring and other one-time items but including stock-based compensation) in the quarter were up 16 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 83.6%, while in dollar terms, gross profit of $1.352 billion were down 1%, primarily due to lower revenue base.Adjusted operating margin (excluding amortization, restructuring and other one-time items but including stock-based compensation) expanded 68 bps to 25.9% from the year-ago quarter, primarily due to lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues (down 52 bps year over year). Adjusted operating expenses decreased 2.1% to $934 million.Symantec reported adjusted net income (excluding amortization, restructuring and other one-time items but including stock-based compensation) of $297.1 million or 43 cents compared with $336.8 million or 47 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.Symantec exited the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $3.79 billion compared with $4.05 billion in the previous quarter. Long-term debt remained flat at $2.09 billion. Cash flow from operating activities was $173 million.During the quarter, Symantec spent $125 million to repurchase 5.26 million shares at a price of $23.75. The company has nearly $408 million remaining under the current stock repurchase plan. The company also paid dividends worth $104 million.For the third quarter of fiscal 2015, the company expects revenues in the range of $1.65 to $1.69 billion (mid-point $1.67 billion), up sequentially. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.704 billion.Moreover, operating margins are expected in the range of 28.3% to 29.3%. Management expects non-GAAP earnings per share between 47 cents and 50 cents (mid-point 48.5 cents), up on a sequential basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at 46 cents.Symantec raised the fiscal 2015 revenue guidance to a range of $6.715 to $6.795 billion from $6.63 to $6.77 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $6.714 billion.For fiscal 2015, management expects an increase in operating margins owing to its operational efficiency. The company now expects operating margin within 28.3% to 28.6% (earlier forecast of 27.7% to 28.2%). Moreover, non-GAAP earnings per share are now expected in the range of $1.94 to $1.99 (earlier forecast $1.84 to $1.92). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.69.Owing to Symantec's proposed split of its business into two parts, the company expects to incur separation cost of approximately $80 million and $100 million over the coming five quarters. The company also expects the restructuring initiatives undertaken will reduce its headcount by approximately 10%.Symantec has delivered tepid second-quarter results as year-over-year comparisons of both the top and bottom-line figures were unfavorable. However, the company's fiscal 2015 outlook remains encouraging.Continued investments to launch new and innovative products could also impact margins in the near term. Nonetheless, investing in growth areas such as Enterprise backup, Storage Management and Security businesses are expected to drive the company's long-term prospects.Moreover, Symantec's restructuring initiatives and share buyback plans are expected to support the bottom line.However, smaller companies like Kaspersky are consistently launching comparable products. These, along with competition from Intel (  ) and Microsoft (  ), remain the headwinds. The uncertainty over PC sales further adds to the woes.Currently, Symantec carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). A better-ranked stock in the technology sector is Check Point Software (  ) with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"ith the stock market constantly hovering near all-time highs, investors might be wondering if popular growth stocks near 52-week highs still have any room left to run. Let's take a look at three stocks that have defied fundamental gravity over the past year, and whether or not their growth stories remain intact. is an online discount marketplace in China best known for its flash sales strategy. Its stock has soared more than 220% over the past 12 months, and it currently trades at a whopping 1,400 times trailing earnings. However, it also trades at 41.6 times forward earnings with a five-year PEG ratio of 0.71, which suggests that its stock price could stabilize as its earnings growth reconciles with its trailing multiples.Wall Street is fairly bullish on Vipshop's growth prospects. The consensus estimate calls for Vipshop's full-year earnings and revenue to rise 73% and 64% between fiscal 2014 and 2015, respectively. Analyst price targets from Thomson Reuters/First Call fall between $200 to $302, suggesting that the stock has more upside than downside from current price levels.While those numbers look great, Vipshop is still a small fish in the massive Chinese marketplace (business to consumers) industry. China Internet Watch reports that Vipshop only controlled 2.8% of this market in the second quarter of 2014, up from 1.9% a year earlier but down from 3% in the first quarter.  controlled 21.2% of the market during the second quarter. Therefore, fierce competition could force Vipshop to increase marketing costs and accept lower profits per transaction, which could make it tough to prevent its slim net profit margin of 3.6% from declining. , which sells its network security platform to service providers, businesses, and government sectors, has rallied nearly 150% over the past 12 months for two simple reasons: massive revenue growth and an unfortunate surge in data breaches worldwide.The company's bottom line has remained in the red ever since going public in July 2012, but its full-year revenue soared 51% year over year to $598 million in fiscal 2014. Palo Alto doesn't expect that top-line growth to slow down anytime soon. It expects its first quarter revenue, which will be reported on Nov. 24, to rise 39% to 42% year over year to a range between $178 million and $182 million. Non-GAAP diluted net income is expected to come in at $0.12 per share, a 50% improvement over the $0.08 per share it posted on the same basis in the first quarter of 2014.Although Palo Alto only controlled about 4% of the $10 billion network security market last year, its top line is growing faster than its larger rival  and market leader  , which controlled roughly 15% of the market:
  
Source: NASDAQ, company earnings reportsWhile Palo Alto is certainly the most lucrative choice of the three, investors should note that all three stocks are currently trading near 52-week highs on strong investor demand for pure play network security firms. Shares of  have soared 55% over the past twelve months, giving it a trailing P/E ratio of 86. The world's largest social network repeatedly surprised investors with strong year-over-year advertising revenue growth and its smooth transition to mobile devices. During the second quarter, Facebook's advertising revenue soared 67% year-over-year to $2.68 billion, with 62% of that revenue coming from mobile platforms -- up from 41% a year earlier.The bears often highlight two flaws in Facebook's long-term plan -- its slowing year-over-year user growth and  . Between the second quarters of 2012 and 2013, Facebook's monthly active users (MAUs) rose 21%. But between the corresponding quarters of 2013 and 2014, MAUs only climbed 14%. A recent Piper Jaffray survey also revealed that only 45% of 13-to-19-year-olds still used the site, down from 72% a year earlier.But investors should remember that Facebook also owns two other rapidly growing platforms, Instagram and WhatsApp. Instagram, which Piper Jaffray notes that the majority of teens use instead of Facebook, saw its active users double from 100 million to 200 million between February 2013 and March 2014. WhatsApp's user base also doubled from  between August 2013 and August 2014.And although teen use of Facebook is dropping, a recent survey from iStrategy Labs found that use among adults 25 years and older is still soaring by the double digits. This means that older users, who have comparably more spending power (and thus more advertising appeal) than younger ones can easily offset lower teen engagement numbers on the network.

" is one of the most interesting names in the tech sector, but the decision over buying or selling the stock isn't as easy as you might think. Investors often buy or sell stocks based on their relative valuation within their peer group, but with the network security sector it isn't quite so easy. Why is this so? Furthermore, is Palo Alto Networks a buy or sell? It's tricky to compare valuations in the network security sector, because the leading players are at different stages of their development, and this makes them attractive to a different type of investor. For example, a value investor might look at a  , stock like  at conclude that it's the best in class. Meanwhile, growth at reasonable price,or GARP, investor will like the look of  mix of mid-teens revenue growth and solid free-cash flow generation, while a growth investor will favor Palo Alto's 30% plus growth rates, even if its free-cash flow yield is low.I'm going to graphically introduce some of these ideas for you, and then get into the numbers. First, a quick look at revenue growth for these three companies in the last four years and the analyst forecast for the fifth year, reveals that they really are at different stages of development.Moreover, for argument's sake I have merged their revenue growth rates together in one continuous chart, so readers can imagine these three as being one continuous company.Source: Morningstar ResearchOf course, there is no reason for Palo Alto's or Fortinet's growth rates to follow the trajectory in the graph, but it's a useful exercise in understanding the concept outlined above.Source: Morningstar Research Essentially, most companies (biotech and oil & gas exploration companies aside) follow a pattern of high growth/low-cash flow generation in their early stages. After which growth slows and free-cash flow generation starts to increase, and finally the company matures into a low-growth cash cow. In other words, the expectation is that Check Point's (a mature company) free-cash flow generation should be above Fortinet's and then Palo Alto's.Free-cash flow is important, because it's what the company actually has to distribute to shareholders via buybacks and dividends, to pay off debt and to make acquisitions.However, the following graph of the last five years reveals that Palo Alto's free-cash flow generation as a percentage of sales is currently on a par with Fortinet's.Source: Morningstar Research, *Palo Alto figures include an adjustment for a $75 million payment to Juniper NetworksThe conclusion of the chart above is that Palo Alto should trade on a higher multiple of sales than Fortinet does, because they are generating similar amounts of free-cash flow from sales and Palo Alto has a much higher revenue growth rate. The discussion above should lead to an appreciation that a company's free-cash flow generation will vary depending on where it is in its cycle. In addition, the price that investors are willing to pay for the current free-cash flow should vary too. In other words, there is no point taking a snapshot of these three companies and comparing their valuations on a like-for-like basis.With that said, here is a table of some current valuations. All the current year metrics are on a trailing four-quarter basis. The sales estimates for next year are analyst forecasts, and free-cash flow conversion rates are the author's assumptions. Enterprise Value, or EV, is simply current market cap plus net debt.
  
Source: Nasdaq.com, author's assumptionsAgain, it's clear that comparing the three on a like-for-like basis is not a sound approach. Moreover, the assumptions in the table-especially for Fortinet and Palo Alto-regarding free-cash flow conversion are conservative. For example, as companies grow they are likely to generate economies of scale and find ways to increase free-cash flow conversion. With that said, there is a case for all three stocks being a good long-term value! Check Point Software is forecast to generate a lot of free-cash flow in future years and the FCF/EV ratio forecast of 7.4% is significantly above the 2.3% that the US 10 Year Treasury note is yield. Meanwhile, Fortinet's valuation is arguably a good value for its mid-teens revenue growth rates, and even Palo Alto 's FCF/EV ratio next year looks like it could be close to the what 10 Year Treasury yield is right now.All told, Palo Alto isn't screamingly cheap right now, and the other two look a better relative value.One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World-Wide-Web to bed.

"ften times, young and middle-aged investors tend to focus on growth stocks, or stocks that focus on capital appreciation and tend to have low dividends. This is due to the logical reasoning that prevails in the minds of many that despite the fact that most growth stocks are 'overvalued', and usually do not pay dividends, the stock's earnings are to grow faster relative to market indices like the S&P 500, or the DJIA.This makes a lot of sense, and I agree with the idea behind investing in growth stocks; however when it comes to diversifying one's portfolio, value stocks should not be overlooked. Most technology and computer companies are growth stocks, however, we are going to examine four small companies in that sector, or industry, and we are going to look at their prospects, financials, and outlook for the upcoming year.The stocks we are going to examine include: ACI Worldwide Inc. (  ), Advent Software Inc. (  ), Aspen Technology Inc. (  ), and finally, Check Point Software Technologies Inc. (  ). These companies are all relatively small, but they could be interesting choices for investors looking for a bit more diversity in their technology holdings with a slightly more of a value approach:ACIW develops a line of software products and services, mostly zeroed in on facilitating electronic payments. In addition to its own products, it distributes, or acts as a sales agent for software developed by third parties.These products and services are used principally by financial institutions, retailers, and electronic payment processors, both in domestic and international markets. Its products are sold and supported through distribution networks covering three geographic regions: the Americas, Europe/Middle East/Africa (EMEA), and Asia/Pacific.ACIW maintains a solid growing financial track record as can be seen from the charts below, and it currently retains an enterprise value that is a lot higher than the company's market capitalization. ACIW's forward P/E ratio is also lower than the industry's average of 36.40, and the company's PEG ratio is also far lower than the industry's average of 2.29. These figures demonstrate why ACIW is a great value stock to hold onto, as ACIW's stock holds more value than many others in the industry, while also giving the investor the most bang for his or her buck, at least on a growth basis.Revenue, gross margins, profit, and EPS have all slowly increased, and ACIW just reported its earnings on October 30 th before the market opened, and the company beat the Zacks EPS Consensus Estimate by $0.05, as well as revenue estimates, which were up 16.7% on a year/year basis.

Revenues and gross margins have considerably increased, however, ADVS is ostensibly struggling to increase its profit and annual EPS. On the bright side, ADVS is the only stock out of these 4 value stocks to issue and pay dividends regularly, $0.13/share to be exact.This may not be a lot, but a yield of 1.5% isn't too shabby.

CHKP is an Israeli company that develops technologies to communications and transactions over the internet by enterprises and consumers. CHKP develops, markets, and supports a range of software, as well as combined hardware and software products and services for information technology (IT) security.The firm offers its customers a portfolio of network and gateway security solutions, data and endpoint security solutions, and management solutions. Its solutions operate under unified security architecture. In 2011, CHKP introduced software blades, such as Application Control, URL Filtering, and an anti-bot software blade. CHKP derives its revenues mainly from products, licenses, combined hardware and software products, software updates and maintenance, and subscriptions.CHKP maintains a solid growing financial record as can be seen from the charts below, and it currently retains an enterprise value a lot lower than the company's market capitalization, which like AZPN, may be a sign of overvaluation. CHKP's forward P/E ratio is where the company really shines. It is so much lower than the industry's average of 36.40, while revenues, gross margins, profits, and EPS have considerably increased.A graph showing how the company has been faring against Zacks EPS Consensus Estimates has also been provided below, and we can see how the company has managed to beat EPS estimates. CHKP will be expected to report its earnings on the 27 th of January, 2015.
  

  
It is hard to tell which one is the ultimate value stock, however CHKP seems to be carrying the lowest forward price-to-earnings ratio despite the fact that it is the only company out of all four to be sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), whilst all others are ranked #1 (Strong Buy). It also seems that CHKP is far larger than the other companies in terms of size and output, so it might be a safer choice.Still, it is always up to the investor to choose which one to stock up on, or if he chooses to diversify and stock on all four, however for dividend focused investors, ADVS seems like a solid choice from a yield look. Below is a comparison between how these stocks stack up against one another and against the S&P 500 index, as well.Looking at the comparison, it seems that ADVS has had very strong growth, and the stock looks to be ripping higher heading in to 2015, while CHKP looks the most stable, and without too many fluctuations it is likely to continue its slow rise. AZPN and ACIW have seen lots of fluctuations, and perhaps it would be wise to stay away from them, and opt for ADVS (given the dividends), or CHKP as a true value stock for long-term value growth.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

 (  ) reported third-quarter 2014 adjusted earnings per share of 3 cents, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents. The quarter's earnings, which exclude the effect of amortization of intangibles but include stock-based compensation expenses, were also down from 7 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.Nonetheless, shares of Fortinet went up 1% yesterday, primarily due to a strong year-over-year increase in revenues and a positive guidance that indicate enhanced growth prospects for all the segments.Fortinet reported third-quarter revenues of $193.3 million, up 24.9% from the year-ago quarter. Revenues were above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $184 million and the company's guided range of $182-$185 million.The year-over-year improvement was primarily aided by solid yield on sales and marketing strategies and a strong network security market. Moreover, a 25.9% increase in Product revenues and a 24.2% increase in Services & other revenues also supported year-over-year growth in revenues.Geographically, Americas (43% of total revenue) increased 26% from the year-ago quarter, EMEA (34% of total revenue) increased 29% from the year-ago quarter while Asia Pacific (constituting the remaining 23% of revenues) grew 19% on a year-over-year basis.Billings during the quarter increased 29% on a year-over-year basis to $231.2 million. Number of deals worth over $100K was 276, up from 187 in the year-ago quarter. Deals over $250K increased to 90 from 61 in the year-ago period while deals over $500K were 35, up from 19 in the year-ago quarter.Adjusted gross profit increased 23.2% from the year-ago quarter to $136.5 million. However, gross margin contracted 102 basis points year over year to 70.6%, primarily due to higher cost of services.Higher-than-expected adjusted operating expenses (up 30.8% year over year) resulted in a decline in operating margin. Moreover, as a percentage of revenues, operating expenses increased 280 basis points, thereby impacting margins. Adjusted operating margin came in at 8.1%, down from 12.1% in the year-ago quarter.Fortinet posted adjusted net income (excluding the effect of amortization of intangibles but include stock-based compensation expenses) on a proportionate tax basis of $5.3 million or 3 cents per share compared with $11.4 million or 7 cents in the year-ago quarter.Fortinet exited the third-quarter with cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $660.6 million, up from $558.1 million in the previous quarter. Accounts receivable were $116.4 compared with $127.8 million in the year-ago quarter.Cash from operating activities was $56.5 million, down from $104.7 million in the previous quarter. Free cash flow in the third-quarter was $50.7 million. During the third quarter of 2014, the company repurchased $10.7 million worth of shares.For the fourth quarter of 2014, management expects revenues in the range of $206-$211 million, an 18% year-over-year increase at the mid-point. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $208 million. Billings are expected in the range of $245 million to $250 million, up approximately 18% year over year.Gross margin is expected in the range of 70%-71%. The company expects operating margin to be approximately 16%, diluted share count to be approximately 170 million to 172 million and earnings per share to be in the range of 13 cents to 14 cents, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 9 cents.Management raised its fiscal 2014 revenue guidance. For fiscal 2014, management now expects revenues in the range of $752-$757 million, a 23% year-over-year increase at the mid-point. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $753 million. Billings are expected in the range of $859 million to $864 million, up approximately 26% year over year.Gross margin and operating margin for fiscal 2014 are expected to be approximately 71% and 16%, respectively. The company expects diluted share count to be approximately 169 million to 170 million and earnings per share to be in the range of 47 cents to 48 cents, much higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 26 cents.Fortinet provides network security solutions, which include firewall, VPN, application control, antivirus, intrusion prevention, web filtering, anti-spam, and WAN acceleration. Fortinet reported mixed third-quarter results, wherein the top line came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate while the bottom line missed the same. However, the company provided an encouraging fourth-quarter and fiscal 2014 guidance. Also, revenues increased year over year aided by an increase in its operating segments.Despite the continuing macro uncertainty, Fortinet seems positive on a healthy network security market, its product lineup and investment plans.Margin contraction due to continuous investments in research and development and competition from key network security players such as Cisco Systems Inc. (  ), Check Point (  ), Juniper Networks (  ) and Palo Alto Networks are concerns. But we believe that product ramps, deal wins, continuous growth of the network security market and expected benefits from the ongoing investments are positives.Currently, Fortinet has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"Shutterstock photoEvery time the news media report a major cyberattack, two things tend to happen: People get panicky, and firms like Palo Alto Networks see their stock prices zip higher as investors bet that security technology will sell well.Palo Alto (  ) provides network security infrastructure products for enterprises, service providers and government entities.The company boasts more than 19,000 customers in over 120 countries across numerous industries and regularly trots out double-digit earnings growth.Palo Alto's next-generation network firewall platform lets companies see and control what's happening with applications in use. The firm offers centralized security management solutions, virtual system upgrades, subscription services such as threat detection and prevention, URL filtering, laptop and mobile device security and other protections from malware.Palo Alto designs its products and services to help clients protect their networks from hackers, cybercrooks and other online thugs.When a major threat makes the headlines, investors tend to flock to cybersecurity stocks.That's what happened after the market close on Oct. 2, when news hit that banking giantJPMorgan Chase (  ) was the victim of a cyberattack that compromised some 83 million accounts.The next day, shares of Palo Alto rose more than 6% to a record closing high of 104.70. Notable gains also were seen among several other stocks in IBD's Computer Software-Security group, includingCheck Point Software (  ),Fortinet (  ),Proofpoint (  ),Qualys (QLYS),Verint Systems (VRNT) andVasco Data Security (VDSI).JPMorgan said that hackers gained access to the records of 76 million U.S. households and 7 million small businesses. It was later reported that nine other financial institutions may have been breached and that Russian hackers might have been behind the attack.A  said that users' contact information and internal JPMorgan Chase information relating to the users was compromised, though the company saw no evidence that account information was compromised.While the initial reaction from Wall Street drove up shares of Palo Alto and other cybersecurity stocks, the momentum didn't last long. The group sagged lower in the next two trading sessions as investors remembered that cyberattacks happen an awful lot these days, and not every cybersecurity stock will see an uptick in business because of them.""The reality is, these organizations are getting hacked and have been getting hacked for a long time. Major banks, retailers, fast-food chains -- they're all getting hacked,"" said Rob Owens, analyst at Pacific Crest Securities.These and other groups are ""underprotected,"" Owens told IBD. ""They need next-generation technologies, and not everyone can provide it. Palo Alto is one that can.""Palo Alto is one of the cybersecurity market's leaders because of the superior functionality of its next-generation products, he says.""In a lot of ways they redefined the firewall category,"" Owens said.Analyst Bill Choi of Janney Montgomery Scott has a similarly bullish view, writing in a recent report that Palo Alto ""has simply built a better mouse trap in a large and growing market for network security. The company's next-generation firewall has a sustainable technology advantage and sufficient runway to capture 20% of the $11 billion network security market, up from 5% today.""Palo Alto's firewall platform includes the new PA-7050 security appliance, a fast next-generation security firewall optimized for corporate data centers.The PA-7050 protects data centers and high-speed networks with firewall throughput speeds up to 120 gigabits per second (Gbps) and full-threat prevention at up to 100 Gbps, according to the company.Introduced earlier this year, the PA-7050 should help Palo Alto expand in the enterprise market, analysts say. That market includes large corporations, government and educational institutions.""They are moving more broadly into data centers with higher throughput boxes to replace an older generation of technology,"" Owens said. ""The corporate piece of this could be a multibillion (dollar) addressable market.""Although Palo Alto does not break down sales by product, Citigroup analyst Walter Pritchard noted that sales of the PA-7050 ""accelerated"" after launch during Palo Alto's fiscal 2014 third quarter, which ended in April.The PA-7050 ""is likely benefiting from strength in data center security, as customers continue to use Palo Alto Networks' capabilities to consolidate onto one platform, especially in the data center,"" he said.Palo Alto executives did not respond to interview requests for this story, but CEO Mark McLaughlin said on the company's Q4 conference call in September that customers ""continue to make larger and larger commitments to us as they remove legacy technologies and point products in favor of our next-generation security platform.""This week Palo Alto, a partner to virtualization software makerVMware (VMW), debuted a new edition in its virtual firewall series. Early this year Palo Alto noted ""an extremely high level of interest"" in the series, McLaughlin said on the call.""From the VMware perspective, my understanding is that within the next 45 days, this solution will be on their price list with a SKU, as well,"" he said on the call. ""So the entire VM sales force will have the ability to bring this to market, as well.""Palo Alto has used buyouts to further expand its product lineup and customer base. In January, it acquired Morta Security, a provider of ""military-grade technology"" to battle network security threats, which brought the company what it calls ""a team experienced at protecting national infrastructure.""A couple of months later, Palo Alto bought Israeli cybersecurity firm Cyvera for about $200 million in cash and stock.Cyvera brought aboard technology that protects enterprise users from known or previously unknown, or ""zero day,"" attacks and threats on any device and across any network. Analysts expect it to expand Palo Alto's addressable market by $4 billion to $5 billion.Financially, Palo Alto rolls out double-digit sales and profit growth regularly. Last month, it reported earnings of 11 cents a share for its fiscal 2014 fourth quarter, which ended in July. That was up from 7 cents a year earlier and a penny above estimates.Fourth-quarter revenue climbed 59% to $178.2 million -- the biggest gain in five quarters. Product revenue climbed 52% to $99.7 million, topping Citigroup estimates. Services revenue also beat expectations, rising 67% to $78.5 million.Total billings for the quarter, an indicator of future revenue, came in at $232.9 million, topping consensus for $206.8 million.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Palo Alto to post a 73% earnings gain for the current fiscal year, followed by a 100% increase in fiscal 2016.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Palo Alto Networks A Stock Pick: Crime-Fighting Pays@2014-10-16@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/palo-alto-networks-stock-pick-crime-fighting-pays-2014-10-16
"he information-technology network security sector is unusual in the sense that its leading companies offer markedly different maturity levels . If  and  are the new kids on the block, and  is the maturing teenager, then  is very much the mature old uncle. With that said, Fools shouldn't dismiss the stock as unexciting. On the contrary, there was a lot to like about Check Point's recent third-quarter earnings, and the numbers confirm that the company's business strategy is working. Time for a look.Highlights of its earnings and guidance for the upcoming fourth quarter:Third-quarter revenue of $370.4 million vs. analyst estimate of $367.1 millionThird-quarter earnings per share of $0.93 vs. analyst estimates of $0.91Fourth-quarter revenue guidance of $395 million-$430 million vs. analyst estimate of $410.3 millionFourth-quarter EPS guidance of $0.99-$1.09 vs. analyst estimate of $1.03In summary, revenue and EPS beat analyst expectations and guidance was ahead of what the market projected. This is obviously good news, particularly because Check Point's management is known for giving conservative guidance. The earnings were also good from the perspective of the company's ongoing business development. As noted, Check Point is a relatively mature company, and it has grown revenue at a single-digit rate for the last 10 consecutive quarters. It is largely known for being a high-margin network security company with relatively sophisticated and high-ticket solutions.Its business typically involves selling hardware (product revenue) and then software blades (sometimes bundled with hardware) and subscriptions. As is usual with subscriptions, their introduction tends to reduce initial revenue in favor of longer-term revenue generation. However, the good news is that companies can generate a higher lifetime value from the client via this strategy, even if initial revenue is less. Finally, Check Point Software sells software updates and maintenance.The revenue generation from these three activities, in the last three years, can be seen below. Each activity has an incredibly high gross margin. For example, in 2013, they generated gross margin of 82.1%, 97.5% and 90.1%, respectively.Source: Check Point Software PresentationsReaders will note that software blades and subscriptions are growing much faster than software updates and maintenance, while products and licenses have declined in the period.A breakout of quarterly revenue demonstrates the underlying trends. The chart below is a bit ""busy,"" but bear with me. Software blades and subscription growth is indexed on the right side, and growth remains strong. However, the key point is that Check Point has started growing its product and license revenue again. This is important, because if Check Point can't grow its installed base through product sales it is likely to struggle with software blade and update revenue growth in futureIn fact, after five negative quarters of growth in product and licenses revenue (from the third quarter of 2012 to the third quarter of 2013), growth has been positive in the last four quarters.Source: Check Point Software PresentationsAll told, this was a strong earnings report. The headline revenue and earnings numbers came in better than expected, as did guidance. Moreover, its product revenue growth continues to strengthen, while software update and maintenance revenue also continues to grow. Finally, investors should note that the strong growth in software blades and subscriptions implies growth down the line from ongoing subscription revenue and software updates. There is a lot to like about Check Point's earnings report.One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World-Wide-Web to bed. And if you act right away, it could make you wildly rich. Experts are calling it the single largest business opportunity in the history of capitalism...  is calling it ""transformative""... But you'll probably just call it ""how I made my millions.""

hares of  (  ) were up 5.37% in Thursday's trade after the company's third-quarter top- and bottom-line figures beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and increased year over year.Check Point's third-quarter revenues of $370.4 million increased 7.6% from the year-ago quarter and also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $366 million. Reported revenues came in at the higher end of management's guided range of $355 to $375 million.The year-over-year revenue growth was aided by 10.6% increase in revenues from Products & Software Blades and 4.5% improvement in Software Updates and maintenance revenues. The company reported 22% year-over-year growth in revenues from Software Blades subscription.Check Point witnessed higher adoption of its Application Control, Anti-Bot and URL Filtering blades coupled with higher demand for its data center and high-end appliances. Another factor that contributed to the overall growth was the increasing number of large deal signings. During the quarter, Check Point recorded 10% year-over-year increase in customers who signed deals worth $1 million or more.On a year-over-year basis, adjusted gross profit (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets) increased 7.1% to $325.7 million, while margins came in at 87.9% compared with 88.4% in the year-ago quarter.Adjusted operating expenses (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets) increased 9.3% year over year to $127.8 million as the company continued to invest in the business. As a percentage of revenues, it increased 54 basis points (bps).Adjusted operating income (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets) came in at $197.9 million, up 5.7% year over year. However, margins contracted 95 bps primarily due to higher expenses.Adjusted net income (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets calculated on a proportionate tax basis) was $161.8 million or 84 cents, up from $160.1 million or 80 cents reported in the comparable quarter last year.Check Point exited the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $1.24 billion compared with $1.23 billion in the previous quarter. Cash flow from operations was $202.5 million compared with $167.9 million in the previous quarter. During the quarter, Check Point repurchased 2.8 million shares for $192.4 million.Check Point expects its revenues in the range of $395 to $430 million, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $413 million at the mid-point. The company expects non-GAAP earnings per share between 99 cents and $1.09, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 95 cents.The company expects the fiscal 2014 revenues in the range of $1.470 to $1.505 billion and earnings between $3.64 and $3.74 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.48 billion, in line with the mid-point of the revenue guidance range and earnings are likely to be $3.38 per share, lower than management's guidance.Check Point delivered better-than-expected third-quarter results. The company also provided modest fourth-quarter and fiscal 2014 guidance.Nonetheless, the rapid adoption of Check Point's data center appliances and the continuous enhancements in data center product lines are expected to provide adequate support to revenue growth.Moreover, Check Point's settlement with the Israeli Tax Authorities is a long-term positive. The company's continuous share buybacks bode well for investors.However, stiff competition from Cisco Systems Inc. (  ), Juniper Networks Inc. (  ) and Fortinet Inc. (  ); an uncertain economic environment, competitive pressures, currency headwinds and Check Point's significant European exposure are the concerns.Currently, Check Point carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

n Sep 4, 2014, we issued an updated research report on  (  ).Check Point is a well-known provider of information technology (IT) security solutions globally. Sophisticated cyber threats significantly affect financials, brands and reputation of enterprises. Consequently, cyber security is becoming a mission-critical, high-profile requirement. Check Point's wide experience in the security space and consistent delivery of such solutions will help it maintain and grow its market share.Check Point's market share (12.8%) is only second to Cisco (17.5%) in the networking security market, per IDC. Another report from Technavio suggests that Global Network Security market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.2% in the 2013-2018 period. The report also mentioned Check Point along with Cisco (  ) and Fortinet (  ) as the key vendors that are well positioned to capitalize on this opportunity.Also, Check Point serves almost every Fortune 500 company and has a huge user base. This vast customer base presents the company an opportunity to upsell products within its installed user base. Moreover, any product refresh brings in additional dollars as every enterprise tries to remain up-to-date in their threat management techniques to guard against impending security threat to their IT system.It is worth noting that Check Point is winning new customer accounts, as seen from the 20% year-over-year increase in business from these accounts in the last reported quarter. Moreover, while the company reported a 35% increase in deals worth $ 1 million or more, growth rates were even stronger for deals worth more than $50K. The growing percentage of large deals in the mix is a positive because it increases deferred revenues and visibility.To serve its clients in a more convenient manner and provide them with best-in-class cyber security solutions, Check Point launched ThreatCloud IntelliStore. It is a threat intelligence marketplace enabling enterprises to choose from different customized threat neutralizing solutions. Check Point has also partnered with iSIGHT Partners, CrowdStrike, IID, NetClean, PhishLabs, SenseCy and ThreatGRI for this offering. Thus, leveraging its own expertise and its partners' solutions Check Point is determined to offer best-in-class cyber security solutions.However, despite being in the number two position in the security market, Check Point's market share contracted on a year-over-year basis (down from 12.9% in first-quarter 2013 to 12.8% in first-quarter 2014) and recorded the lowest year-over-year revenue growth (7.7%). Incidentally, Cisco reported an 11.7% increase in revenues while its market share expanded from 16.9% in first-quarter 2013 to 17.5% in first-quarter 2014. Fortinet's market share expanded from 6.2% to 7.1% year over year and revenues increased 23.7% during the comparable year-ago period.Moreover, we believe that Check Point's dominance could be challenged by new entrants. This could lead the company to resort to competitive pricing to maintain and capture further market share.Additionally, Check Point is largely dependent on indirect channels for selling its products. The company derives a significant portion of the total sales from the 10 biggest distributors. We believe that this level of dependence increases concentration risk. If these distributors reduce their purchases due to supply chain or competitive issues (focusing on sales of the products of competitors), Check Point's business would be adversely affected.Currently, Check Point has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Investors may consider a better-ranked stock like Micron Technology (  ) sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The company's next-generation firewall has a sustainable technology advantage and sufficient runway to capture 20% of the $11 billion network security market, up from 5% today.""Palo Alto's firewall platform includes the new PA-7050 security appliance, a fast next-generation security firewall optimized for corporate data centers.The PA-7050 protects data centers and high-speed networks with firewall throughput speeds up to 120 gigabits per second (Gbps) and full-threat prevention at up to 100 Gbps, according to the company.Introduced earlier this year, the PA-7050 should help Palo Alto expand in the enterprise market, analysts say. That market includes large corporations, government and educational institutions.""They are moving more broadly into data centers with higher throughput boxes to replace an older generation of technology,"" Owens said. ""The corporate piece of this could be a multibillion (dollar) addressable market.""Although Palo Alto does not break down sales by product, Citigroup analyst Walter Pritchard noted that sales of the PA-7050 ""accelerated"" after launch during Palo Alto's fiscal 2014 third quarter, which ended in April.The PA-7050 ""is likely benefiting from strength in data center security, as customers continue to use Palo Alto Networks' capabilities to consolidate onto one platform, especially in the data center,"" he said.Palo Alto executives did not respond to interview requests for this story, but CEO Mark McLaughlin said on the company's Q4 conference call in September that customers ""continue to make larger and larger commitments to us as they remove legacy technologies and point products in favor of our next-generation security platform.""This week Palo Alto, a partner to virtualization software makerVMware (VMW), debuted a new edition in its virtual firewall series. Early this year Palo Alto noted ""an extremely high level of interest"" in the series, McLaughlin said on the call.""From the VMware perspective, my understanding is that within the next 45 days, this solution will be on their price list with a SKU, as well,"" he said on the call. ""So the entire VM sales force will have the ability to bring this to market, as well.""Palo Alto has used buyouts to further expand its product lineup and customer base. In January, it acquired Morta Security, a provider of ""military-grade technology"" to battle network security threats, which brought the company what it calls ""a team experienced at protecting national infrastructure.""A couple of months later, Palo Alto bought Israeli cybersecurity firm Cyvera for about $200 million in cash and stock.Cyvera brought aboard technology that protects enterprise users from known or previously unknown, or ""zero day,"" attacks and threats on any device and across any network. Analysts expect it to expand Palo Alto's addressable market by $4 billion to $5 billion.Financially, Palo Alto rolls out double-digit sales and profit growth regularly. Last month, it reported earnings of 11 cents a share for its fiscal 2014 fourth quarter, which ended in July. That was up from 7 cents a year earlier and a penny above estimates.Fourth-quarter revenue climbed 59% to $178.2 million -- the biggest gain in five quarters. Product revenue climbed 52% to $99.7 million, topping Citigroup estimates. Services revenue also beat expectations, rising 67% to $78.5 million.Total billings for the quarter, an indicator of future revenue, came in at $232.9 million, topping consensus for $206.8 million.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Palo Alto to post a 73% earnings gain for the current fiscal year, followed by a 100% increase in fiscal 2016.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Palo Alto Networks A Stock Pick: Crime-Fighting Pays@2014-10-16@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/palo-alto-networks-stock-pick-crime-fighting-pays-2014-10-16

However, gross margin contracted172 basis points year over year to 68.6%, primarily due to higher cost of services.Higher-than-expected adjusted operating expenses (up 28.1% year over year) led to a decline in operating margin. Moreover, as a percentage of revenues, operating expenses increased 156 basis points, thereby impacting margins. Adjusted operating margin came in at 7.6%, down from 9.6% in the year-ago quarter.Fortinet posted adjusted net income (excluding the effect of amortization and Impairment of intangibles but include stock-based compensation expenses) on a proportionate tax basis of $8.1 million or 5 cents per share compared with $9.2 million or 5 cents in the year-ago quarter.Fortinet exited the second-quarter with cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $558.1 million, down from $561.1 million in the previous quarter.

Moreover, revenues increased year over year aided by an increase in its operating segments.Despite the continuing macro uncertainty, Fortinet seems positive on a healthy network security market, its product lineup and investment plans.Margin contraction due to continuous investments in research and development and competition from key network security players such as  (  ),  (  ),  (  ) and Palo Alto Networks are concerns. But we believe that product ramps, deal wins, continuous growth of the network security market and expected benefits from the ongoing investments are positives.Currently, Fortinet has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"Shutterstock photoPalo Alto Networks, a leading stock pick, has vaulted higher as it puts a patent dispute to bed and as analysts see its security products in demand at data centers.Known for network firewalls and other corporate security offerings,Palo Alto Networks (  ) makes the  list of high-potential stocks. On Monday, it pushed up more than 3% to 83.85.""PANW remains a top pick for 2014, our favorite play on the secular trend toward consolidated network-security functionality,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss wrote in an early-Monday research note boosting his price target to 105.Weiss says several factors, including corporate security purchasing plans, bolster his confidence that the company can sustain 30% or better billings growth in fiscal 2015. He also notes that the company will see slower growth in capital expenditures and a reduction in litigation expenses.Palo Alto Networks offers a next-generation network-security platform used by enterprises, service providers and government entities to protect their networks from viruses, malware and other threats. Its lineup includes network firewall software and hardware. It also sells subscription services for threat detection and prevention, web filtering and mobile device security.Palo Alto Networks stock is up 46% this year and 21% since the firm announced the end of a legal saga May 28 and released third-quarter fiscal 2014 results. They topped estimates with 49% year-over-year revenue growth to $150.7 million, and 57% earnings growth to 11 cents a share.""These results were driven by continued strong product demand, robust service growth and a rapid market-share gain in the large and growing strategic enterprise security market,"" CEO Mark McLaughlin said on a call with analysts at the time, noting the firm had ""settled all existing litigation with Juniper.""Palo Alto Networks paid $175 million to settle a suit in whichJuniper Networks (  ) claimed that Palo Alto Networks products infringed on six of its patents. Under terms of the deal, Palo Alto Networks agreed to make a one-time payment of $75 million in cash and pay $100 million in shares of common stock and warrants to buy common stock.Juniper Networks filed the suit in December 2011. Palo Alto Networks later accused the company of infringing on three of its patents. As part of the settlement, the two firms agreed to license the patents at issue to each other and not file infringement suits for the next eight years.""As we said from the beginning of this case, we do not believe that we infringed on any Juniper patents, and we still believe this to be the case,"" McLaughlin said on the Q3 call. ""However, over the course of the last 2-1/2 years, we've spent a large amount of time, money and other resources on this litigation. ... We believe that this outcome will allow us to continue to focus our efforts in what we do best: innovating and developing new products, servicing our customers and the growth that results from that.""Although $175 million is a hefty sum for a company with less than $400 million in revenue as recently as its last fiscal year, the settlement did remove ""a key overhang"" on Palo Alto Networks stock, says FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi.With the overhang gone, Palo Alto Networks stock, which debuted in an  , hit a record high of 82.27 on June 17 and then passed that by almost 2% Monday.The settlement is also seen resolving hesitancy on the part of some customers to do business with Palo Alto Networks as long as the lawsuit was up in the air.""With this removal, we think Palo Alto can experience incrementally more sales,"" Seyrafi noted.Palo Alto Networks seeks to continue expanding an operation that already includes 16,000-plus customers in more than 120 countries across multiple industries. One potential growth area is in the enterprise market, where it looks to win business with a next-generation security firewall designed for corporate data centers. will help it gain market share in the enterprise market, analysts predict. The product, launched in February, provides up to 120 gigabits per second of throughput speed to analyze threats to corporate data centers.""Palo Alto has plenty of room left to take share in enterprise network security,"" Pacific Crest Securities analyst Rob Owens wrote in a report. ""Data-center deployments account for over 30% of Palo Alto's product revenue, and the release of the PA-7050 appliance expands the opportunity into even higher-performance environments.""Meanwhile, analysts praise Palo Alto Networks' ability to win new business in a competitive field that includes pure plays such as Juniper,Symantec (  ) andCheck Point Software Technologies (  ), plus broader hardware and software firms such asCisco Systems (  ).""Palo Alto is the clear market leader and is defining the market in the next-generation firewall space,"" Citi  analyst Walter Pritchard noted. ""With clear differentiation and technology leadership, we see continued share gains ahead for Palo Alto.""Among factors working for Palo Alto Networks' potential, Morgan Stanley analyst Weiss notes that 43% of corporate security executives polled plan a firewall refresh (upgrades and replacements) this year vs. 23% last year. And with only 10% using Palo Alto for their primary firewall and/or unified threat-management needs now, he sees room for market share gains.Weiss says the company has strong positioning and an improving margin trend past fiscal 2015.As Palo Alto Networks gains size, it may also eye more buyouts as a way to expand its piece of the pie, analysts say. The firm has not made a huge number of deals through the years, though it has made a couple in 2014. In January, it acquired Morta Security, a Silicon Valley-based cybersecurity company, for an undisclosed sum. In April, it completed its $200 million buyout of Cyvera, a privately held cybersecurity company in Tel Aviv, Israel.Palo Alto Networks might be set for more acquisitions after its recent decision to issue $500 million of convertible senior notes due in 2019. In a research note, William Blair analyst Jonathan Ho said Palo Alto intends to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, which include working capital, capital expenditures, potential acquisitions and strategic transactions.""We believe the funds from the convertible offering would provide the company with significant latitude to further broaden its technology and next-generation security-solution suite, as it did with its recent acquisition of Cyvera to enter the endpoint-protection space in what we view to be a very positive fashion,"" Ho said.A Palo Alto Networks spokeswoman said no company officials were available to speak for this story.Financially, Palo Alto Networks continues showing robust growth, notching year-over-year revenue gains of at least 46% each quarter since going public. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect EPS of 40 cents for fiscal 2014, which ends in July, up from 21 cents last year. Fiscal 2015 earnings are seen rising 65% to 66 cents a share.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Palo Alto Networks Grabs Gains In Stock And Security@2014-06-30@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/palo-alto-networks-grabs-gains-stock-and-security-2014-06-30

"t The Motley Fool, we believe in a buy-and-hold strategy and trying to achieve steady market-beating returns over time. However, sometimes investments just turn out to be home runs. We asked three of our analysts to share a little bit about the single best investment they ever made. Here is what they had to say.Source: 401kcalculator.org via .Source: 401kcalculator.org via  . My greatest hit was e-security firm  , which I bought just before the explosion of dot-com stocks at the turn of the millennium. The company's financials were to die for; its balance sheet was squeaky clean, its revenues were growing fast, and its net margins (typically 40%-50%) were monstrous. And on a price-to-earnings basis, the shares were impossibly cheap.It was blindingly obvious to me that there was no way a stock with that sort of profile could stay at its bargain-basement level. So I bought in at a little under $20 a pop. The market, once it was done feasting piranha-like on dot-com shares, soon discovered the better value of a company that served the entire e-industry and had actual profits, in contrast to many Internet darlings of the time.Check Point stock skyrocketed, and I sold my position at more than four times what I paid for it.I still think highly of the company. Cyber security is even more of a concern these days than it was then. Check Point continues to grow its revenues, and those margins are as fat as ever. It continues to be a standout in its industry. My best investment of all time was  . After a few less-than-stellar quarters, as well as intense speculation about the effects of the company's K-cup patents expiring, shares dropped by more than 80% between mid-2011 and mid-2012. The shares hit bottom at around $17, and I got in a little early, when they were trading for around $24.This investment taught me an excellent lesson -- investing is not always about the numbers. The main reason I bought shares, other than the fact that I thought they were ridiculously cheap, was because, around the same time period, Keurig coffee makers seemed to be appearing in the homes of every single one of my friends and relatives.Analysts were very negative about the stock at the time, but I saw the potential of the company's product with my own eyes. And, as soon as the patents expired, some imitation ""K-cups"" did appear, but they weren't of the same quality.Shares trade at around $140 today; however I decided to get out when the stock hit $80. The patent expirations didn't really matter in the long run, and the rapidly growing popularity of the Keurig coffee makers sent profits skyrocketing. And, I figured that more than tripling my original investment in less than a year-and-a-half was good enough. I still love the company today. I have my father to thank for the best investment I ever made. In 1998, I was the beneficiary of a modest legal settlement. Acting on my behalf, he invested the funds in a recently established agricultural bank -- it's not publicly traded.Generally, that would be a horrible idea, as only a small percentage of new companies ultimately go on to be successful. However, three generations of my family had previously banked and partnered with the family behind the new company. As a result, we were intimately familiar with their ability to grow and operate successful businesses.The value of my principal has since gone on to increase fivefold, and the annual dividends are now equal to 12% of the original investment.I've learned two things from watching this bank slowly, but consistently, grow. The first is the importance of deal flow. Like his father, the president of the bank is a pillar of the community. He knows everyone and is highly respected. As a result, he's always attracted an outsized share of the banking business in the area.The second thing is the importance of behaving counter-cyclically -- that is, of tempering one's emotions when times are good, and then doubling down when times are tough.I can't emphasize enough how critical of a trait this is for bankers to possess. It's far too easy to write loans based on cash flow projections at the height of a business cycle only to later watch those projections -- and thus the underlying loans -- driven asunder when the economy stumbles. The smartest investors know that  simply crush their non-dividend paying counterparts over the long term. That's beyond dispute. They also know that a well-constructed dividend portfolio creates wealth steadily, while still allowing you to sleep like a baby. Knowing how valuable such a portfolio might be, our top analysts put together a report on a group of high-yielding stocks that should be in any income investor's portfolio.

"he information-technology network security sector is unusual in the sense that its leading companies offer markedly different maturity levels . If  and  are the new kids on the block, and  is the maturing teenager, then  is very much the mature old uncle. With that said, Fools shouldn't dismiss the stock as unexciting. On the contrary, there was a lot to like about Check Point's recent third-quarter earnings, and the numbers confirm that the company's business strategy is working. Time for a look.Highlights of its earnings and guidance for the upcoming fourth quarter:Third-quarter revenue of $370.4 million vs. analyst estimate of $367.1 millionThird-quarter earnings per share of $0.93 vs. analyst estimates of $0.91Fourth-quarter revenue guidance of $395 million-$430 million vs. analyst estimate of $410.3 millionFourth-quarter EPS guidance of $0.99-$1.09 vs. analyst estimate of $1.03In summary, revenue and EPS beat analyst expectations and guidance was ahead of what the market projected. This is obviously good news, particularly because Check Point's management is known for giving conservative guidance. The earnings were also good from the perspective of the company's ongoing business development. As noted, Check Point is a relatively mature company, and it has grown revenue at a single-digit rate for the last 10 consecutive quarters. It is largely known for being a high-margin network security company with relatively sophisticated and high-ticket solutions.Its business typically involves selling hardware (product revenue) and then software blades (sometimes bundled with hardware) and subscriptions. As is usual with subscriptions, their introduction tends to reduce initial revenue in favor of longer-term revenue generation. However, the good news is that companies can generate a higher lifetime value from the client via this strategy, even if initial revenue is less. Finally, Check Point Software sells software updates and maintenance.The revenue generation from these three activities, in the last three years, can be seen below. Each activity has an incredibly high gross margin. For example, in 2013, they generated gross margin of 82.1%, 97.5% and 90.1%, respectively.Source: Check Point Software PresentationsReaders will note that software blades and subscriptions are growing much faster than software updates and maintenance, while products and licenses have declined in the period.A breakout of quarterly revenue demonstrates the underlying trends. The chart below is a bit ""busy,"" but bear with me. Software blades and subscription growth is indexed on the right side, and growth remains strong. However, the key point is that Check Point has started growing its product and license revenue again. This is important, because if Check Point can't grow its installed base through product sales it is likely to struggle with software blade and update revenue growth in futureIn fact, after five negative quarters of growth in product and licenses revenue (from the third quarter of 2012 to the third quarter of 2013), growth has been positive in the last four quarters.Source: Check Point Software PresentationsAll told, this was a strong earnings report. The headline revenue and earnings numbers came in better than expected, as did guidance. Moreover, its product revenue growth continues to strengthen, while software update and maintenance revenue also continues to grow. Finally, investors should note that the strong growth in software blades and subscriptions implies growth down the line from ongoing subscription revenue and software updates. There is a lot to like about Check Point's earnings report.One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World-Wide-Web to bed. And if you act right away, it could make you wildly rich. Experts are calling it the single largest business opportunity in the history of capitalism...  is calling it ""transformative""... But you'll probably just call it ""how I made my millions.""

hares of  (  ) were up 2.13% on Wednesday's trade after the company's second-quarter top and bottom lines not only beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate but were also up year over year.Check Point's second-quarter revenues of $362.6 million increased 6.6% from the year-ago quarter and also came marginally ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $360.0 million. Reported revenues came in at the higher end of management's guided range of $340.0 to $375.0 million.The year-over-year revenue growth was aided by 9.6% increase in revenues from Products & Software Blades and 3.5% improvement in Software Updates and maintenance revenues. The company reported 21.8% year-over-year growth in revenues from Software Blades subscription.Check Point witnessed higher adoption of its Application Control, Anti-Bot and URL Filtering blades coupled with higher demand for its data center and high-end appliances. Another factor that contributed to the overall growth scenario was the increasing number of large deal signings. During the quarter, Check Point witnessed 35.0% year-over-year increase in customers who signed deals worth $1.0 million or more.Geographically, the Americas contributed 49.0% of the total revenue while 35.0% was derived from Europe. The remaining 16.0% was contributed by Asia Pacific, Japan, Middle East and Africa region.On a year-over-year basis, adjusted gross profit (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets) increased 6.8% to $321.6 million, while margins came in at 88.7% compared with 88.5% reported in the year-ago quarter.Adjusted operating expenses (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets) increased 12.2% year over year to $131.2 million as the company continued to invest in the business and hire for research and development, sales and marketing and technological support. As a percentage of revenues, it increased 180 basis points (bps).Adjusted operating income (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets) came in at $149.4 million, up 3.2% year over year. However, margins contracted 135 bps primarily due to higher expenses.Adjusted net income (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets calculated on a proportionate tax basis) was $160.0 million or 82 cents, up from $151.8 million or 76 cents reported in the comparable quarter last year.Check Point exited the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $1.23 billion compared with $1.21 billion in the previous quarter. Cash flow from operations was $167.9 million compared with $172.1 million in the previous quarter. During the quarter, Check Point repurchased 3.0 million shares for $194 million.Check Point expects its revenues in the range of $355.0 to $375.0 million, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $365 million at the mid-point. The company also expects non-GAAP earnings per share to be between 88 cents and 92 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 82 cents.Check Point delivered better-than-expected second-quarter results. The company also reported modest third-quarter revenue guidance.Nonetheless, the rapid adoption of Check Point's data center appliances and the continuous enhancements in data center product lines are expected to provide adequate support to revenue growth.Moreover, Check Point's settlement with the Israeli Tax Authorities is a long-term positive. The company's continuous share buybacks also bode well with the investors.However, stiff competition from  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ); an uncertain economic environment, competitive pressures, currency headwinds and Check Point's significant European exposure are the concerns.Currently, Check Point carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The company reported 26% year-over-year growth in revenues from software blades subscription.The company witnessed higher adoption of its threat emulation blade and higher renewal rates in Application Control. Moreover, strong demand for Check Point's data center products -- the 13000, the 21000, the 600 and the 1100 -- drove revenues for the quarter. Moreover, Check Point sealed deals worth over $1 million with 36 customers.Geographically, the Americas contributed 48% of the total revenue while 36% was derived from Europe. The remaining 16% was contributed by Asia Pacific, Japan, Middle East and Africa region.On a year-over-year basis, adjusted gross profit (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets) increased 6.1% to $303.4 million, while margins remained flat at 88.6%.Adjusted operating expenses (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets) increased 9.5% year over year to $118.4 million as the company continued to invest in the business and hire for research and development, sales and marketing and technological support. As a percentage of revenues, it increased 109 basis points (bps).Adjusted operating income (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets) came in at $185.0 million, up 3.9% year over year. However, margins contracted 106 bps primarily due to higher expenses.Adjusted net income (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets) was $153.5 million or 78 cents per share, up from $148.6 million or 73 cents in the comparable quarter last year.Check Point exited the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $1.21 billion compared with $1.17 billion in the previous quarter.

During the quarter, Check Point repurchased 2.8 million shares for $183 million.Check Point expects its revenues in the range of $340 to $375 million (mid-point $357.5 million), lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $360 million at the mid-point.

Moreover, the revenue guidance range was wider, reflecting challenges in the international markets, particularly in Asia.Nonetheless, the rapid adoption of Check Point's data center appliances and the continuous enhancements in data center product lines are expected to provide adequate support to revenue growth.Moreover, Check Point's settlement with the Israeli Tax Authorities is a long-term positive. The company's additional share buyback plan should also bode well with the investors.However, stiff competition from  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ); an uncertain economic environment, competitive pressures, currency headwinds and Check Point's significant European exposure are concerns.Currently, Check Point carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Check Point Reports In-Line Q1 Earnings - Analyst Blog@2014-04-30@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/check-point-reports-in-line-q1-earnings-analyst-blog-2014-04-30
 (  ) is slated to report its first-quarter 2014 results, before the opening bell, on Apr 29, 2014.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive 3.37% earnings surprise. Let's see how things are shaping up for the company prior to the announcement.Check Point delivered better-than-expected fourth-quarter results, which topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both counts primarily driven by growth across its software and data center applications.We remain encouraged by rapid adoption of Check Point's data center appliances and threat detecting solutions. Moreover, the recent partnership with  (  ), to make the cloud-computing environment more secure and efficient, bodes well for the company. Additionally, the company's share buy pack plan will supports the bottom line.However, stiff competition from peers and an uncertain economic environment remain the concerns.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Check Point Software is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. However, this is not the case here as elaborated below. Earnings ESP represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The Most Accurate estimate stands at 76 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is higher at 78 cents resulting in an ESP of -2.56%. Check Point's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) when combined with a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum. (  ) has an Earnings ESP of +6.67% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). (  ) has an Earnings ESP of +10.71% and a Zacks Rank #1.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Will Check Point Software (CHKP) Miss Earnings Estimates? - Analyst Blog@2014-04-28@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/will-check-point-software-chkp-miss-earnings-estimates-analyst-blog-2014-04-28

 (  ) reported first-quarter 2014 earnings per share of 5 cents, which came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. The quarter's earnings, which exclude the effect of amortization of intangibles but include stock-based compensation expenses, were however 29.4% lower than 7 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.Fortinet reported first-quarter revenues of $168.9 million, up 24.4% from the year-ago quarter. Revenues were above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $158.0 million and the company's guided range of $155.0-$159.0 million.The year-over-year improvement was aided by a 32.5% increase in Product revenues and an 18.4% increase in Services & other revenues.Geographically, Americas (43.0% of total revenue) grew 38.0% from the year-ago quarter, EMEA (33.0% of total revenue) increased 20.0% from the year-ago quarter while Asia Pacific (constituting the remaining 24.0% of revenues) grew 11.0%on a year-over-year basis.Billings during the quarter grew 26.4% on a year-over-year basis to $187.6 million. Number of deals worth over $100K was 247, up from 170 in the year-ago quarter. Deals over $250k increased to 78 from 55 in the year-ago period while deals over $500k were 32, up from 13 in the year-ago quarter.Adjusted gross profit increased 22.3% from the year-ago quarter to $118.2 million. However, gross margin contracted 122 basis points year over year to 69.9%, primarily due to higher cost of services.Higher-than-expected adjusted operating expenses (up 29.6% year over year) led to a decline in operating margin. Moreover, as a percentage of revenues, operating expenses increased 252 basis points, thereby impacting margins. Adjusted operating margin came in at 7.9%, down from 11.5% in the year-ago quarter.Fortinet posted adjusted net income (excluding the effect of amortization of intangibles but include stock-based compensation expenses) on a proportionate tax basis of $8.8 million or 5 cents per share compared with $12.4 million or 7 cents in the year-ago quarter.Fortinet exited the first-quarter with cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $561.1 million, up from $491.4 million in the previous quarter. Accounts receivable were $111.5 compared with $130.5 million in the year-ago quarter.Cash from operating activities was $60.9 million, up from $46.7 million in the previous quarter. Free cash flow in the first-quarter was $49.6 million.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $168.0 million. Billings are expected in the range of $185.0 million to $190.0 million, up approximately 17.0% year over year.Gross margin is expected in the range of 70.0%-71.0%.

Fortinet reported better-than-expected first-quarter results, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both counts, and provided an encouraging second-quarter guidance. Moreover, revenues increased year over year aided by an increase in its operating segments.Despite the continuing macro uncertainty, Fortinet seems positive on a healthy network security market, its product lineup and investment plans.Margin contraction due to continuous investments and competition from key network security players such as  (  ),  (  ),  (  ) and Palo Alto Networks are concerns. But we think that product ramps, deal momentum, share gains from competitors, continuous growth of the network security market and expected benefits arising out of ongoing investments are positives.Currently, Fortinet has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Fortinet Beats on Q1 Earnings & Rev - Analyst Blog@2014-04-24@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/fortinet-beats-on-q1-earnings-rev-analyst-blog-2014-04-24

n Jun 27, 2014, we issued an updated research report on  (  ).Check Point is a well-known provider of information technology (IT) security solutions globally. Sophisticated cyber threats significantly affect financials, brands and reputation of enterprises. Consequently, cyber security is becoming a mission-critical, high-profile requirement. Check Point's wide experience in the security space and consistent delivery of such solutions will help it to maintain and grow its market share.Per a new report from the market research firm IDC, corporate spending on threat intelligence security services will reach $1.4 billion in 2018 from an estimated $905.5 million in 2014. These predictions bode well for Check Point which recently launched ThreatCloud IntelliStore, a threat intelligence marketplace enabling enterprises to choose from various customized threat neutralizing solutions. The company has also partnered with the likes of iSIGHT Partners, CrowdStrike and IID to provide best-in-class cyber security solutions by leveraging its own expertise and its partners' solutions.Check Point's timely product launches as well as product refreshes also validate its endeavor to provide new and improved solutions. The company has witnessed a growing demand for its data center applications such as the new 21700 Appliances and the 13500. Moreover, the 21000, 13000 and 61000 high-end appliance series (running on blade architecture) have gained traction. Going forward, we believe that Check Point will incrementally benefit as customers upgrade to the software blade architecture related to Threat Emulation, Application Control and Compliance, and the subsequent updated versions.Among other factors, Check Point's revision of its share buyback plan to $200 million per quarter (aggregate of $1.0 billion) from $135 million per quarter will also bode well for its earnings.Nonetheless, Check Point competes with numerous big and small companies in the security application market. According to IDC, Check Point secured the second position in the worldwide security appliance revenues in the first quarter of 2014. Check Point trailed industry leader  (  ) and was followed by  (  ).However, among the top three vendors, only Check Point's market share contracted on a year-over-year basis (from 12.9% in first-quarter 2013 to 12.8% in first-quarter 2014) and recorded the lowest year-over-year revenue growth (7.7% year-over-year growth).Moreover, we believe that Check Point's dominance could be challenged by new entrants. This could lead the company to resort to competitive pricing to maintain and capture further market share.Additionally, Check Point is largely dependent on indirect channels for selling its products. The company derives a significant portion of the total sales from the 10 biggest distributors. We believe that this level of dependence increases concentration risk. If these distributors reduce their purchases due to supply chain or competitive issues (focusing on sales of the products of competitors), Check Point's business would be adversely affected.Currently, Check Point has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Investors may consider a better-ranked stock like  (  ) sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

With this partnership, Check Point will enrich its virtualization, automation and cloud-based portfolios.Through this collaboration, Check Point will combine its security solution Virtual Edition (VE) with VMware's vSphere or the new VMware NSX network virtualization platform that provides private cloud-based service to make the cloud-computing environment more secure, simple, flexible and efficient.The partnership will better equip organizations to handle private cloud technology and control business applications securely. As VMware remains one of the leading companies in the virtualization and cloud computing space, we believe Check Point will gain significantly from this collaboration.Due to the rapid adoption of cloud computing technologies, security and prevention of data loss have become the top priorities for enterprises in recent times. According to Gartner, the cloud-based security services market will rise from $2.1 billion in 2013 to $3.1 billion in 2015.Check Point's innovative product portfolio is well positioned to benefit from this significant growth going forward. We believe the interoperability of Check Point VE and the VMware vCloud Suite will help customers accelerate their transition to the cloud.Furthermore, Check Point has teamed up with the largest online retailer  (  ) and its security offering can be easily downloaded through Amazon Web Services. We believe this integration will enable secure connectivity in dynamic cloud computing environments, which in turn would help Check Point to spur growth in the competitive market and accelerate product adoption.However, competition from  (  ) and Juniper Networks Inc., an uncertain economic environment, competitive pressures, currency headwinds and Check Point's significant European exposure are concerns.Currently, Check Point carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Check Point Partners VMware - Analyst Blog@2014-03-13@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/check-point-partners-vmware-analyst-blog-2014-03-13

 (  ) reported fourth-quarter 2013 earnings per share of 7 cents, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 9 cents. The quarter's earnings, which exclude the effect of a patent settlement, amortization and impairment of intangibles but include stock-based compensation expenses, were 39.0% lower than the 13 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.Fortinet reported fourth-quarter revenues of $177.3 million, up 17.3% from the year-ago quarter. The quarter's results were above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $166.0 million and the company's guided range of $162.0-$167.0 million.The year-over-year improvement was aided by an 18.1% increase in Product revenues and 17.7% increase in Services revenues. However, this was partially offset by a 6.9% decline in Ratable and other revenues.Geographically, Americas (42.0% of total revenue) grew 21.0% from the year-ago quarter, EMEA (34.0% of total revenue) increased 10.0% from the year-ago quarter while Asia Pacific (constituting the remaining 24.0% of revenues) grew 21.0% on a year-over-year basis.Billings during the quarter grew 20.4% on a year-over-year basis to $209.8 million. Number of deals worth over $100K was 260, up from 229 in the year-ago quarter. Deals over $250k increased to 96 from 78 in the year-ago period while deals over $500k were 37, up from 27 on a year-over-year basis.Adjusted gross profit increased 12.5% from the year-ago quarter to $123.5 million. However, gross margin contracted 296 basis points year over year to 69.6%, primarily due to higher mix of low-margin entry-level products and lower service margin.Higher-than-expected adjusted operating expenses (up 32.3% year over year) led to a decline in operating margin. Moreover, as a percentage of revenues, operating expenses increased 633 basis points, thereby impacting margins. Adjusted operating margin came in at 14.2%, down from 23.0% in the year-ago quarter.Fortinet posted adjusted net income (excluding the effect of a patent settlement, amortization and impairment of intangibles but include stock-based compensation expenses) of $13.3 million or 7 cents per share compared with $21.5 million or 13 cents in the year-ago quarter.Fortinet exited the fourth-quarter with cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $491.4.0 million, down from $513.0 million in the previous quarter. Accounts receivable were $130.5 compared with $107.8 million in the year-ago quarter.Cash from operating activities was $46.7 million, up from $25.4 million in the previous quarter. Free cash flow in the fourth-quarter was $39.5 million. During the fourth quarter of 2013, the company repurchased $38.9 million worth of shares.For the first quarter of 2014, management expects revenues in the range of $155.0-$159.0 million, a 16.0% year-over-year increase at the mid-point. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $155.0 million. Billings are expected in the range of $168.0 million to $176.0 million, up approximately 15.0% year over year.Gross margin is expected in the range of 70.0%-71.0%. The company expects operating margin to be approximately 12.0%, diluted share count of approximately 167 million to 169 million and earnings per share to be approximately 8 cents.Fortinet provides network security solutions, which include firewall, VPN, application control, antivirus, intrusion prevention, web filtering, anti-spam, and WAN acceleration. Fortinet reported mixed fourth-quarter results and provided encouraging first-quarter guidance.The company's top line increased year over year and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate, whereas the bottom line was down year over year and also fell short of the consensus mark. Despite the continuing macro uncertainty, Fortinet seems positive on a healthy network security market, its product lineup and investment plans.Margin contraction due to continuous investments and competition from key network security players such as  (  ),  (  ),  (  ) and Palo Alto Networks are concerns. But we think that product ramps, deal momentum, share gains from competitors, continuous growth of the network security market and expected benefits arising out of ongoing investments are catalysts.Currently, Fortinet has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Fortinet's Q4 Earnings Lag, Rev Beats - Analyst Blog@2014-01-30@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/fortinets-q4-earnings-lag-rev-beats-analyst-blog-2014-01-30

" (  ) reported first-quarter fiscal 2014 non-GAAP earnings (excluding one-time items) of 21 cents per share compared with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of net loss of 9 cents per share. However, earnings declined 30% year over year.On GAAP basis, the company's pre-tax income came in at $24.2 million or 43 cents per share, which was almost flat on a year-over-year basis.Growth in the company's core business primarily drove the non-GAAP earnings. Moreover, Concur signed more than 1,000 new customers in the first quarter. The increase was primarily attributable to the company's ongoing ""Perfect Trip"" innovation, which led to expansion of several new services. This apart, the company witnessed a strong momentum in its open platform initiatives as customers, travelers, developers and partners embraced TripLink™ and the Concur T&E Cloud.Concur reported total revenue of $160.3 million, up 31% year over year and 4% sequentially. Increase in revenues was driven by strong performance of the company's travel business, in turn attributable to the Perfect Trip Initiative. Revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $156 million by 2.8%.Operating loss for the quarter was $19.1 million compared with a loss of $8.3 million in the prior-year quarter. Consequently, margins also fell to 9.6% from 15.4% in the prior-year quarter.

yber security has emerged as one of the hottest growth sectors over the last 12 months. As enterprises, government agencies, banks and video game companies continue to be plagued by cyber attacks, online security has become a major concern for all.According to a recent report from cyber security firm Trustwave, since Oct 21, 2013 till date, hackers have gained access to data of almost 1.6 million accounts from different websites globally.The affected sites include  (  ),  (  ),  (  ),  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ). It is significant to note that most of the attacks were targeted toward social media websites which generally maintain a huge database of user details.Per the Trustwave report, Facebook was the worst affected website, with thefts of 318,121 passwords. Although ADP was the least affected (7.978 passwords stolen), the firm noted that the theft of payroll services accounts detail can have serious financial implications.In response to the breach, Facebook has already advised its users to activate login approvals and login notifications in their security settings. However, the recent breach has not only put current cyber security solutions under scanner, but also the habit of using a simplistic password that can be easily guessed.We believe that strict vigilance from all sectors is the need of the hour. Efforts to improve coordination within the private sector are also increasing. Additionally, training and education on security matters are equally important to develop a preventive mechanism against cyber attacks.Amid the growing number of cyber attacks, corporations and companies are looking for stricter and more stringent cyber security measures to plug the loopholes in the system. While new security solutions may not be the permanent answer to the hacking problem, it will serve as a first step to solving this complex problem.Most significantly, spending on developing cyber security solutions is expected to continue to rise. According to ABI Research, global cyber security spending in critical infrastructure areas is expected to increase $4.25 billion over 2012 to $46.0 billion in 2013.Further, as per a research conducted by ReportsnReports.com, global cyber security spending is expected to reach $165.0 million by 2023. We believe that this increasing spending will encourage companies such as EMC Corp,  (  ) and  (  ) to develop new solutions, in turn driving their top-line growth, going forward.Both, Akamai and CheckPoint carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Cyber Security: A Top Concern - Analyst Blog@2013-12-06@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/cyber-security%3A-a-top-concern-analyst-blog-2013-12-06
"FireEye's (  ) rising stock price brings back vivid memories of my tenure at Goldman Sachs during the Internet bubble. A stock would be deemed ""cheap"", because it was trading at  30x revenue (while its peers were trading at 40x). I thought those days were over. Yet, FEYE (a fairly recent IPO) now trades at roughly 30x 2014 revenue (at the time of publication in PTT). As a former portfolio manager, I can't justify this on any metric. In my recollection, investors have never been able to make money on established companies trading at 30+ times projected revenue.FireEye has the leading security solution to prevent Advanced Persistent Threats ((APTs)), the latest buzzword in security circles. APTs are nothing more than sophisticated attacks that sneak into an organization, locate valuable information (e.g. credit card info) and send that info back to the perpetrator undetected. Existing security solutions like anti-virus and firewalls cannot effectively prevent APTs.With the front page news that Target was hacked leaving tens of millions of credit cards exposed, the call for a solution was loud. FireEye quickly emerged as the best solution on the market. Unfortunately, APT prevention is only a part of a corporation's security platform. FireEye's appliance does not mean a customer can forego endpoint protection, firewall, secure web gateway, or intrusion prevention. Target (  ) had plenty of FireEye appliances but it did not prevent the APT as the appliances flash warnings but you need many highly trained security professionals to respond with the proper remediation. Having FireEye appliances is like having a fire alarm, it will likely warn you (including false positives) but you still need the fire fighters to put out the fire. (No pun intended). According to Gartner- ""  "".The target customer for APT appliances is high end enterprise, early technology adopters and government entities who want the latest and greatest security gadgets and have dedicated budget ready to deploy. Clearly over the last two years, we have seen these buyers gobble up APT appliances aggressively in order to prevent themselves from being the next victim. As a result FireEye has seen its revenue skyrocket from $33 million in 2011 when APTs started gaining notoriety to $162 million in 2013, a CAGR of 169%.However, as is the case with most high growth companies, the law of large numbers, customer saturation, and increased competition starts to slow growth. Most recently, FireEye's product and revenue growth decelerated to 59%/81% y/y vs. 79%/95% and 73%/108% in the June and September quarters, respectively. Of course, 70% growth is great, but putting it into context versus prior quarters of 100%+ shows a marked deceleration.In fact, FireEye has been growing its sales force by 150% y/y to achieve much lower revenue (and decelerating) growth rates. That is not a recipe for success. Further, now that most large enterprises have deployed APT solutions to some extent, buyers are starting to show some buyer's remorse. According to Gartner FireEye purchasers, ""  .""FireEye currently has the best APT appliance on the market but competition is picking up. Worse yet, that competition is coming strong from big industry stalwarts like Cisco (  ), Check Point (  ), Fortinet (  ), and Palo Alto Networks (PANW).Timing is important when it comes to shorts. In my experience, the best time to initiate a short position is when all the shorts have given up (also known as capitulation). In this case, a recent short squeeze has run its course, precipitated by a secondary offering of 14 million shares. The secondary nearly doubles the float to 31.5 from 17.5 million post the IPO.As it turns out, 8.4 million of those shares were sold by existing shareholders, including the founder. To make matters worse, FEYE priced the offering at $82, an  to its previous day's closing price (2-5% is the norm). In my opinion, management realized that an 8.5% discount still represented a great price at which to cash out.Investors seemingly caught on to this the following day. The stock ""broke"" the $82 deal price, closing at $81.04.  . It indicates massive selling pressure that even the underwriters (in this case Morgan Stanley, Barclays, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs) cannot handle.Another sign that timing is on our side is the large acquisition of Mandiant. FireEye acquired Mandiant for $1 billion, roughly 10x revenue, in a mostly stock deal ($106.5 million cash and 21.5 million shares). Mandiant was a high profile leader in the incident response space. The problem with acquiring Mandiant instead of continuing the partnership is that there are few obvious synergies. Mandiant and FireEye target different buyers, end point protection and network operations, respectively. Acquiring Mandiant instead of continuing the partnership tells me FireEye realizes that their growth is decelerating and competition is heating up and the only way to ward it off is by buying growth.Acquiring a company so shortly after going public is very rare and should cause one to ask ""if growth is so spectacular in your core business, why are you taking on additional risk and management's attention to pursue adjacent areas?"" Of course, it's not overpaying when you use overvalued shares that trade at 30x revenue to buy a ""less overpriced"" target for 10x. Using mostly equity, CEO Dave Dewalt must realize his valuation is absurd and wants to use his inflated currency to buy the many missing pieces of security that FireEye is missing.Don't be surprised if Dewalt does more and more acquisitions using his overinflated currency. The key question becomes ""what companies are naïve enough to take an extremely overvalued currency like FEYE?""At today's market cap of $13 billion,  According to Gartner in 2013 the total security market revenue was $13.5 billion, broken down as follows: Firewall ($7.5 billion), Intrusion Prevention ($1.2 billion), Endpoint Protection ($3.4 billion), and Secure Web Gateway ($1.4 billion). FEYE's assertion that Mandiant triples its total addressable market to $30-40 billion is laughable.Morgan Stanley's software analyst Keith Weiss (who I think is the best software analyst on the Street) estimates a bull case of $3.2 billion revenue (up from $162 million today), operating margins of 25% (from -72% today) to arrive at a  free cash flow margin of 21% and discounting it back at 12.5% discount rate arriving at the ultra-bull case scenario of $94. In other words, if FireEye executes flawlessly for the next 5 years, the stock is worth $94 today. I am short FEYE. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.See also  on seekingalpha.comThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Don't Fiddle While FireEye Burns...@2014-03-24@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/dont-fiddle-while-fireeye-burns-2014-03-24

"Check Point delivered better-than-expected second-quarter results. While the third-quarter revenue guidance was unexciting, we expect Check Point's strong position in the network security market and the rapid adoption of its new products to support revenue growth. Moreover, Check Point's settlement with the Israeli Tax Authorities is a long-term positive. The company's continuous share buybacks also bode well for investors. However, stiff competition, an uncertain economic environment, competitive pressures and currency fluctuations remain the headwinds. Thus, we reiterate our Neutral recommendation on Check Point shares.Founded in 1993, Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. has evolved into a well-known provider of information technology (IT) security solutions across the world. The company is headquartered in Tel Aviv, Israel and offers a comprehensive range of software and combined hardware and software products aimed at IT security. Attached either to an operating system, a computer device, a server or a virtual desktop, the solutions cover network and gateway security, data security and management needs. Though the company is incorporated in Israel, consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with the United States generally accepted accounting principles.Check Point entered the industry with its breakthrough product, FireWall-1, equipped with the stateful packet inspection technology. A firewall is a device or a set of devices designed to protect networks from unauthorized access, while permitting legitimate communications. Stateful Inspection technology, invented and patented by Check Point, runs on a firewall or a PC and helps to extract and maintain extensive data for providing a framework for future screening decisions, from relevant communication layers. It also expedites network traffic inspection. However, Check Point has expanded its footprint from ""firewall"" to include a full enterprise security offering with endpoint security, remote access and network security.The company's network security gateways protect customer data, reduce security complexities and lower the total cost of ownership. Customers are able to implement their security policies on traffic between internal networks and the Internet, as well as between internal and private networks that are shared with partners.Check Point's solutions are deployed in nearly all Fortune 100 and Global 100 companies and in over 98% of the Fortune 500 and Global 500 companies across enterprises, service providers, small and medium sized businesses, and consumers. Its products and services are sold through a network of channel partners, including distributors, resellers, value-added resellers, system integrators and managed service providers.The company operates one reportable segment and its revenues are mainly derived from the sales of its network and data security products and related software updates, maintenance, support and other services. Check Point has its operations in different geographic regions including the Americas, Europe and the Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa.The market for Internet security solutions is intensely competitive, with well-capitalized players, such as Cisco Systems Inc., Juniper Networks Inc., Symantec Corp. and Microsoft Corp. Although Check Point has been a leader in critical network security markets through its VPN products, it is now coming out with complete end-to-end security solutions. Check Point faces tough competition as it moves into appliances against Cisco and Juniper, and into endpoint (PC) against Symantec and McAfee (acquired by Intel Corp.). Besides threats from large software companies like Cisco, Juniper and Dell, Check Point also vies against smaller, but more nimble security companies like Sourcefire.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"Here is a small sampling of the 120+ posts seen on the Buzz & Banter this week:As the end of the year draws near, I start looking at who can finish strongly. Here is a quick list of four that I think can take off from here into year end, and one that I think you can still have buried in the backyard. (  ) -- It had a perfect 50-day moving average touch after a golden cross. This is one you can buy and put away for a while too. It looks to be taking off on a momentum run as fracking becomes the new internet. No lump of coal in my stocking. I just want natural gas! (  ) -- Yes, I was early, and there was a reason I only bought half of a position in this one. I am rounding it out to a full position now. It had a perfectly controlled pull into the 200-day moving average. Now, it's time to see if this one can rocket back. I am in it for the long haul, and this is the second pillar of my natural gas thesis. (  ) -- Minyan Mike brought this one to my attention a while back, and I have been watching it ever since. I am considering a position very soon as the moving averages finally caught up after a monster move that punished the shorts. This looks to be setting up to go higher too. Watch the downward-sloping resistance, as it should break the wedge and shoot for new highs. (  ) -- Bouncing off the long-term trend line and the 50-day moving average, this continues to be a momentum move in a growth-oriented and still undervalued stock. It looks like it is about to break the wedge up here and shoot for new highs soon. - I have mentioned  (  ) several times on the Buzz. I said that I wasn't going to sell it into that last pop, and this is why: It is breaking out again. This business is the fastest growing business you have never heard of. I will continue to hold it and see if it can hold higher once again. This stock has officially entered beast mode as it loves to keep defying gravity.The  (INDEXSP:.INX) out-performance of the  (INDEXNASDAQ:NDX) continues post-Fed, with the latter matter struggling to hold the flat-line. An old school trader would opine that the inability (of tech) to follow through to the upside is a bearish tell, and I would agree, particularly as I watch the price action in  (LNKD) and  (AAPL). We must balance that against the price action in gold (now flattish) as we edge toward the close.The talking heads are discussing the ""rate taper"" vs. the ""money taper"" as an important distinction. Eh, maybe -- I still think that by the time the dust settles on this puppy, the Federal Reserve will no longer be able to control interest rates. That, to me, is when the clothes will fall from the Emperor.R.P.The curve is taking on a dramatically flatter tone today. Roll adjusted the 5/30 is 8.5bps flatter, hitting a narrow of 10.5bps. The 10/30 trade, which I think is the ""QE off"" trade, continues to scream tighter, blowing through 100bps again. Bottom line, the takeaway I have from the Fed is that QE in the form of asset purchases is coming to an end. You can interpret that however you want for whatever asset class, but the signal came through for me.Judging by all of that action, my honest guess is that this is all an unwinding or squaring of positions. The Street owns a disproportionate amount of the five-year from yesterday, and that seems to be the hardest-hit sector with what looked like panic selling. I also think that the significant weakness in MBS today is playing a role in the overall higher rates. This morning, 30-year FN 3's hit the widest options-adjusted spread since they went into production in 2011. Keep in mind, though, that the Fed owns the majority of these notes. I'm keeping an eye on how these act because I want to see what it's like when there isn't such a large uneconomic buyer present every day.Since I was breaking down the trade for a Minyan earlier this morning, I'll share the analysis here. There are a number of trades that stand to benefit over the coming six months as interest rates get more normal. Most involve being short the three-year or the five-year vs. the long end of the curve -- 10-year or 30-year, take your pick. Both will remain more or less anchored in 2014. On a notional, duration-weighted basis, shorting $3.75 of five-year futures vs. long $1of the ultras (30-year) would give you an equal-weighted position. From there, reducing the long position or adding to the short would position you for the spread to tighten or widen.If you are able, I think an interesting trade into the new year would be to be long or ""pay"" the five-year swap (same thing as being short the note) vs. long the 10-year or 30-year cash Treasury. The five-year swap spread reached a record tight this morning, even adjusting for the roll, which means that at face value, hedging for interest rate risk - or any risk - in that sector is at its lowest. If what we think happens in 2014 with the short end and intermediate duration bearing the brunt of the sell-off, logically you would imagine that this spread will widen. So, the trade would essentially be a juiced up flattener.For those who follow the space, mortgage REIT  (AGNC) lowered its dividend yesterday for its fourth-quarter payment to $0.65 from $0.80 in the third quarter.  (NLY) reports its fourth-quarter dividend after the close today, and I would expect a $0.05 cut to its quarterly dividend to $0.30. If that annual dividend keeps up, which it should, it implies a fair value price between $8.57 and $9.23 with a 13%-14% dividend. If you're looking for a beat-up sector to explore in 2014, this seems like a decent area for a trade. My vehicle of choice would be  (EARN).Treasuries continue to leak post-FOMC. We are back to 2.92% on the 10-year. I like it here and don't think we are going to breach the 3% support. Eurodollar futures are somewhat surprisingly lower after yesterday.Stocks obviously had the best reaction yesterday. The sell-off was incredibly short lived, and every stop got taken out.Credit did only okay. CDX was a couple tighter, and high yield bonds were up a touch (in spite of treasuries being lower).This morning, we are seeing a strong rally in Europe. The MAIN index is back to levels before PIIGS became a word (early 2010).The SNR FIN index continues to outperform and is now only 14 bps wider than MAIN. We are thinking about calling that trade off. While we still like the big-money center banks, particularly in the US, there are some sketchy names in SNR FIN.We think as the dust settles, we will see bonds and credit spreads perform extremely well over the next few weeks as investors try to chase yield again.There are really only four ways to increase your yields.1. You can extend duration. But this seems particularly dangerous. In the treasury space, the 10-year is closely watched by the Fed due to its impact on the mortgage market, and it is far more easily controlled than the long bond. In credit spreads, the 30-year bonds are always very technical as they remain the domain of pension funds and insurance companies. I could see taking some longer dated spread risk, but I would be cautious there.2. You can decrease credit quality. You can move further down the credit curve. Pick credits that six months ago you would have made a disgusted face at. This usually ends badly, and much of this has already gone on. Everyone has drifted a bit lower in credit quality already, so the value isn't obvious, and mistakes will be very costly.3. You can move into less liquid assets: private placements, small deals, and middle markets. This is more difficult for hedge funds, but it will become part of everyone's process. There is value in this space because everyone has been so focused on liquidity. The problem is that some of the spaces are pretty small, and it won't take much capital to drive out the value.4. You can increase the structured risk you take. CLOs were the first to return. We are now seeing more synthetic CDOs. The reality is that we are in the early stages of a new cycle of structured credit. There will be value there because the ""building blocks"" are still relatively cheap. CDS spreads for example are still much wider than they were in 2006 and in the first half of 2007. That makes it easy to create real value. Many investors will initially refuse to participate in structured credit. Many investors are no longer well-positioned to analyze the risk in structured trades. That is where the value is and why we think we will see real growth.So we don't like the idea of extending duration, moving to worse credits is too dangerous (and this from the firm that liked European Financials and Spanish and Italian bonds). We like the idea of moving to less liquid assets for a portion of the portfolio. We just aren't sure how much of it there is to be had, and can be less helpful there. We really like the idea of moving aggressively into structured risk here.If you think back to the strangest most exotic product in the pre-crisis era, whether it was CPDO, CDO^2, LSS, ABX, TABX, or some other acronym, you can assume someone is trying to resurrect the product. Probably not in the exact form, but the ideas worked for a reason, and the conditions are being set for them to work again.Overall, the return of structured credit will force spreads tighter. So just being long is good but finding the right trade here will be a key to driving performance.We like Mezz Bespoke, Mezz tranches, and super senior if you can do it.Tomorrow we will go through another round of reasons why we think those offer so much value and why they can tighten quickly.So we survived the taper announcement, just like we survived the debt ceiling debate, the continuing resolution, the shutdown, the NSA scandal, Benghazi, tax increases, etc. In fact, it looks to me as if all of the bad stuff has already happened, leaving the door open for a dearth of bad news in the months ahead. And maybe that is what Wednesday's stock market leap was all about. I must admit, I was not only surprised by the size of the move, but also by the number of large ""block trade stock sales"" on the tape; as well as the fact that a +300-point session failed to qualify as a 90% upside day (meaning 90% of total volume and total points traded did not come in on the upside). I don't recall the statistical history of that, but my sense is that it is pretty unusual. Accordingly, I thought the day was indeed stock constructive, although hereto, there were some weird things going on in Wednesday's win. For example, there was absolutely no buying-power pressure recorded by my models but rather marginal selling pressure. Moreover, I continue to have mixed signals from most of my short-term indicators, and the advance/decline is not confirming the upside. Yet,  of my longer-term indicators remain exceedingly bullish. One event that went largely unreported yesterday, which should have helped the US markets but didn't, was the People's Bank of China's decision to inject liquidity into the economy to alleviate the current money market's cash crunch. Speaking of China, I have long believed China was not going to implode. It does have $2 trillion of US dollars, but my hunch is it will use $1 trillion of that money to ""plug"" the holes in its banks' balance sheets. That leaves $1 trillion to drive China's economy forward, which is definitely enough cash. Sure growth is going to slow in China, but its 5% - 7% GDP growth path is simple and sustainable.While the media was replete with ""oohhs"" and ""aahhs"" about the magnitude of the Dow's Wednesday point gain, the really important chart of the past few sessions is the 10-year T-note chart, whose yield has risen to 2.95% on an intraday basis, while the five-year T-note is faring even worse (see chart). I had this discussion with Pioneer's iconic bond fund manager Ken Taubes yesterday. Ken thinks the real interest rates problems will come from the ""front end"" of the curve (read: five-year T-notes and shorter). Unsurprisingly, given the attempted pullback since the November 29 high, the stock market's internal energy, at least by my models, has a full charge of energy, implying there is the potential for another upside equity burst leading to the fabled Santa rally.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Buzz on the Street: Heaven Is a Taper on Earth@2013-12-20@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/buzz-street-heaven-taper-earth-2013-12-20
 (  ) reported fourth-quarter 2013 adjusted earnings (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets) of 91 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents.Check Point's fourth-quarter revenues of $387.1 million not only increased 5.0% from the year-ago quarter but also came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $383.0 million.The year-over-year revenue growth was aided by a 6.1% increase in Software Updates, Maintenance and Services revenues and a 3.5% year-over-year increase in revenues from Products and Licenses. The company witnessed higher adoption of its threat prevention blades and Application Control.

 (  ) is set to report third-quarter 2013 results on Oct 21. Last quarter, the company posted in-line earnings. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Check Point delivered decent second-quarter results with the bottom line matching the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the top line surpassing the same. However, year-over-year comparisons were modest.The year-over-year revenue growth was aided by an increase in Software Updates, Maintenance and Services revenues, partially offset by weak Product and Licenses revenues. However, lower sales of high-end appliances impacted Product revenues.Geographical contributions were good and growing acceptance of Check Point's high-end products was encouraging. Despite expectations of an increase in sales volume during the second half, the company provided cautious third-quarter guidance, reflecting macro uncertainty in the European region and capped spending by customers.We are positive on strong support from the acceptance of data center appliances and believe that continuous enhancements in the data center product lines will adequately support revenue growth in the near term. However, an uncertain economic environment, competitive pressures, currency headwinds and Check Point's significant European exposure are the possible headwinds, going forward.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Check Point will beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 78 cents. Hence, the difference is 0.00%.Zacks Rank: Check Point's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) when combined with a 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter: (  ), with Earnings ESP of +1.99% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). (  ), with Earnings ESP of +1.49% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). (  ), with Earnings ESP of +2.29 and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Can Check Point (CHKP) Surprise This Earnings Season? - Analyst Blog@2013-10-18@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/can-check-point-chkp-surprise-this-earnings-season-analyst-blog-2013-10-18

 (  ) has agreed to acquire Munich-based Computerlinks for $300 million. The acquisition, expected to close in the fourth quarter of the current fiscal year, will add approximately 20 cents to 25 cents (excluding the impact of amortization of related intangible assets) to Arrow's earnings per share for the year.Computerlinks, a distributor of value-added IT services and solutions, has operations all over the world. The company provides IT security and Internet Technology solutions and services to hardware and software manufacturers. Furthermore, the company has been expanding into cloud-based services. The acquisition is expected to synergize with Arrow's value-added services portfolio.Arrow Electronics provides a wide range of value-added services to help customers reduce their time to market, lower their total cost of ownership, introduce innovative products through demand creation opportunities and enhance their overall competitiveness.The acquisition would also help Arrow gain traction in the emerging data center market. Additionally, the product portfolio of Computerlinks will enhance Arrows Enterprise computing solutions (ECS) offerings. Arrow's ECS has partnerships with many companies such as  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ), which provides varied products and services related to security and networking to its clients.Arrow has been very active on the acquisition front, having purchased seven companies in 2012 alone. These acquisitions were intended to enable Arrow to enter new markets, diversify and broaden its product portfolio and maintain its leading position in the world. Moreover, the company's continued acquisitions are expected to be a robust contributor to its revenue stream, going forward.Moreover, the company's prospects are dependent on IT spending. As per the U.S. research firm Gartner, overall IT spending is expected to grow 4.1% in 2013. The improvement in spending will be mostly driven by enterprise software and IT services.Arrow's Global Enterprise Computing Solutions segment deals in the enterprise software and IT services areas and generates roughly 50.0% of the company's annual billings. Thus, the acquisition should bode well for the company.Its positive commentary about enhanced productivity, annual cost savings and successful ERP implementation across Europe is encouraging. We believe that Arrow could get better contribution from Europe after the ERP program becomes operational.Currently, Arrow has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Arrow to Buy Computerlinks for $300M - Analyst Blog@2013-08-29@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/arrow-to-buy-computerlinks-for-%24300m-analyst-blog-2013-08-29

"Here is a small sampling of this week's activity in the Buzz.Vadim PokhlebkinOn Friday, the UK's  (INDEXFTSE:UKX) index dropped from a seven-week high. Shares of HSBC got downgraded that day, and that was said to be the culprit.However, from an Elliott wave perspective, the real reason was the fact that the index is likely nearing a top of its corrective rally.On June 27, we wrote on these pages that the FTSE had finished a 5-wave decline for a larger-degree wave 1,  .Since then, the FTSE rose 380 points, a 6% gain. And looking at the wave patterns today, prices appear to be grinding into a short-term high now.For one, the May-June decline was a clean five-wave move; those define the trend in Elliott wave analysis. Prices are losing momentum now, as evidenced by the bearish RSI divergence shown on the daily chart below (red dot).Next we need to see a downside acceleration soon to justify a bearish outlook on UK equities. Today's close of 12 points lower might be the start. Only a push above 6700 on the FTSE 100 will have us reviewing alternate scenarios.For those who wish to try and take advantage of this potential near-term opportunity, there is a multitude of  with European exposure to consider.(Adapted from Elliott Wave International's July 19  , edited by Chris Carolan.)Michael GayedThe unrelenting rise in U.S. stocks continues as the Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO) propels investors into what may now be a very crowded U.S-centric trade. Meanwhile, homebuilders (NYSEARCA:XHB), which I have discussed several times before, continue to lag on the realization that spiking mortgage yields don't actually bode well for the biggest source of reflation the economy has. Counter-balancing this is strong movement in emerging markets, which we continue to track closely for an allocation in our mutual fund and separate accounts.Euphoria can easily continue for domestic markets, but I'd rather play mean reversion from the bottom than the top. Further momentum in emerging market equities, should it hold, could be a beautiful trade. What's coinciding with this? A continued breakdown in the dollar, which has a trend that seems to favor near-term.Marc EckelberryAn interesting story hit the wires Saturday, which commodities markets, in their usual complacency, have failed to react to so far. Basically, the Feds are sending signals that they intend on reviewing the 2003 decision  .Then this morning, we get the story that a US HFT oil trader was  . Are the US and UK joining forces and preparing an attack on oil speculators, who have driven the price up to such dangerous levels, levels which analysts cannot justify? That would certainly put an interesting twist on matters as we approach the critical mass 110 level. Moves above 110 have coincided with heavy drawdowns in equities the past two years, -20% in 2011 and -10% in 2012 (see chart).Jeff SautYesterday's headline read, ""Dealbreaker reports that an unnamed BMO analyst is leaving the firm for the opportunity of a lifetime. Dear Colleagues (he writes), it is with sadness that I am emailing you to say farewell on my final day here at BMO. However, it is with great pride and excitement that I am able to announce my future plans. Just this week, I was informed that I was selected from among tens of thousands of applicants to participate in a highly experimental civilian travel program coordinated by NASA and the U.S. government. In September I will pack my bags for Florida where I will begin a one-year training program, which will culminate in a six-month trip to the International Space Station."" ""To the Moon, Alice,"" to quote that great American economist Jackie Gleason; and that is what yesterday's trading action felt like - that everyone had gone to the moon.Obviously, there isn't much to say about Monday's trading other than the only way to make money was to erect a ""toll gate"" at last Friday's closing price (1692.09) and collect a toll every time the  (INDEXSP:.INX) (SPX/1695.53) crossed that flat-line because it crossed it a baker's dozen of some 13 times. The session was punctuated by the revelation that more money flowed into equity centric ETFs this month than in any month in the past five years. That caused Jason Goepfert, of the must have Sentimentrader.com organization, to write, ""The Liquidity Premium for the S&P 500 (10-day average) just entered extreme territory, suggesting that investors have become more comfortable holding individual stocks instead of the 'safety' of the exchange-traded fund. Past corrections have usually seen the 5-day average hit an extreme, then the 10-day, then finally the 21-day. The latter isn't yet at an extreme, so it's something to watch for in the coming weeks (see chart).""That news caused my phone/email to light up with the question, ""With all the money flowing into the equity markets, don't you think you are wrong about a pullback?"" My response, ""Well, markets can clearly do anything, but in this business you have to play the odds; and such headlines are what you tend to see clustered near trading tops."" In addition, to all the reasons given over the last few weeks for my short/intermediate ""topping call"" in and around July 19, it's worth noting that over the past 10 years, nine of the 10 macro S&P sectors have declined from here into the first week of August. Manifestly, in this business you play the odds or they carry you out in a ""box."" Moreover, while certain indices are breaking out to the upside, others are breaking down. Meanwhile, the entire equity market is WAY overbought.Michael SedaccaThe weekly JPMorgan Treasury client survey was released this morning and remains relatively long.-Longs up to 23% from 21%-Neutrals down to 64% from 66%-Shorts unchanged at %13-Net long up to %10 from %8This is the most aggressive net long positioning since November 2012 and is a cautionary reading for pressing any bond longs here.The positive side is that if this long positioning is sustained over the coming weeks, it will be a much better medium-term bullish signal. Over the last two weeks, active positions have covered their very aggressive shorts and remain more neutral.Regional banks remain for sale from the open with the  (NYSEARCA:KRE) peeking into negative territory, despite a 10-year yield that is ~4 bps higher.  (  ) was weaker than expected and last night  (  ) seemed to do decently enough. Could it be that the miss by RF after a slew of strong financial earnings (vs consensus/expectations) is causing the weakness? So ya see it.The Richmond Regional Manufacturing figure is quite bad, but it is strikingly different from the manufacturing data we've received thus far in July. Overall, it looks like activity slowed down markedly. My guess is that we'll see strong manufacturing activity continue into August before peaking before the fiscal debates that begin in October.NYSE all-securities breadth was 1.5:1 at 10:10 this morning, with the A/D line at +433. Volume yesterday was quite low with only 583.79 million shares changing hands on the NYSE. For perspective, the July 5 quasi-vacation day saw 625.38 million shares trade and 428.04 million on July 3.Going off the reservation a little bit here... this morning, the Turkish central bank hiked overnight rates by 5bps to 7.25% and said they have the scope to hike a lot more in an attempt to stem the mass of outflows from the country. I've been keeping a wary eye on Turkey to see what's going on and the research I have read suggests that there is another 1.5%-2% of hikes possible. This is a problem in and of itself because the Turkish yield curve is inverted from the 2yr point and out with bill rates not far behind from being inverted with any rate hikes.Additionally, Indian yield curves are also inverted or flat from 3-month bills out to the 30-year rate. I bring this up because India has been tightening monetary conditions and draining currency reserves from the market. A -1bps spread between 3-month bill rates (8.6%) and 30-year bond rates (8.59%) is highly negative and bad for emerging markets.Brazil is probably next with their 2-year rate at 9.83% and 9-year rates at 10.59%, narrowing from a 107bp spread a month ago.What does all of the above mean? Either monetary conditions are too tight or the market is discounting contraction in both of these economies. As it pertains to India, it means that the Indian central bank has tightened too far - either way the country is screwed - because the capital outflows will continue at a frightening rate, which jeopardizes future growth should they start to ease. If the central bank tightens further, it will choke off further domestic growth.I gather the hikes in Turkey and other emerging market problems are behind the alarming underperformance in TIPS over the last couple days as real rates rise. This is the second day in a row that I've noticed the outsized underperformance, which is a negative for risk taking into the near-future. Longer-term (5-year and 10-year) rates are coming down, but at a slower pace.I have my bid out for the muni CEF I'll be looking to add to today. I'm keeping an eye on the  (  ) earnings call; I'll be back with any gleanings shortly.Michael Comeau (  ) just made itself the star of earnings season, putting in a huge beat.EPS came in at $0.19, $0.04 ahead of consensus. Revenues were $1.81 billion, smashing the $1.61 billion consensus.Mobile advertising was an amazing 41% of ad revenues, up from 30% last quarter. That is just plain crazy growth.The stock is up about 16% in extended trading to $30.74.Brandon PerrySome stocks just run then flag, run then flag, etc... I found a new one while looking around for some additions TO the technology side of my portfolio. Now, while I am not as plugged in as Sean Udall, I do like to pick apart balance sheets and carve up an income statement. Lets look at  (  ). It is an interesting stock that has had a very nice move.From a fundamental perspective, it still looks cheap. it is increasing free cash flows consistently, up 10% this year, while total current assets are about 20% of the current market cap! Plus, the company is looking to expand its network security business with additional add on features. Net margins are 46%, that's not a typo... seriously 46% and only trading at a 14 forward P/E.OK, fundamentals are solid, how is it technically? In a sentence, I wished I had seen it mid-June when it showed my favorite pattern, a 50-day tap after a golden cross. It is still good now. It put in a nice flag, then broke out on earnings. It retested and filled the earnings gap as well as the flag breakout. That looks like healthy back and fill for continuation higher to me. I'm adding it today and will look to continue building a position over the coming weeks on pull-ins. It should stay above 53, to keep the momentum going, and I will use that prior resistance area as a stop out.Scott RedlerI've been trying to ride this trend at key points, but I find myself with the least exposure I've had in a whileAll three of these charts are flashing some short-term ""warning signs"" that are noteworthy.It never hurts acknowledging them, especially for the super-active trader.Sean UdallIt looks to me like  (BRCM) put in a bottom earlier today. This doesn't mean I'm going to get silly long, but as I sell down other winners, this will be a place for fresh money.In my view, the stock shouldn't have fallen below $30, but that is what stocks do sometimes. As I said yesterday, I think the worst case scenario is that I'll be selling shares between $31-33. But there could/should be future catalysts which push the stock to something much closer to a peer-group valuation, which would be 30-40% higher from current prices.Minyanville StaffFor today's chart of the day, we decided to look at the relationship between homebuilders (NYSEARCA: XHB) and the S&P Regional Banking ETF the  (INDEXDJX:BKX).Over the past year, you can see that all three basically trading in-line with each other. (chart 1)However, over the past few days, the homebuilders have been getting smashed as industry data has gotten a bit shaky and homebuilder earnings reports have been weak. (chart 2)For those concerned with housing's impact on the financials, the action in the space is worth nothingDebashish BoseOur April argument had been that if Abenomics succeeded in making Japan more competitive and hence effectively exporting its deflation to the remaining world, then classic inflation hedges like gold and TIPS (which had been bid up over the past few years) should be sells.As this theory played out in practice, the sell-off in the overbought TIPS markets caused real bond yields to spike while inflation printed lower, thereby causing real rates to move from negative to positive territory. Reflexivity caused this panic to feed of itself worsening the situation in global fixed income markets.In our May 24 Quant Crystal Gazer note on the Mexican Connection, we argued that it suited the purpose of the Japanese government as well as the Fed To let some air out of the ""yield chasing"" behavior in the bond and equity markets. For this purpose, we saw the Mexican market correction as a classic placeholder for other markets.With the breather becoming a painful gasp -- the Fed needs to reduce real yields. Reversing the above sequence of events should then be the logical solution.Ideally, the Fed would like to re-engineer moderate inflation expectations while keeping the fixed income risk premiums in check with the continued or enhanced Bernanke put.Appreciation in the Japnese Yen should reverse the Japanese-exported global deflationary trend and enable the Fed to purchase moderate inflation expectations.A calmer bond market convinced about the sustainability of the Bernanke put would in turn flatten the yield curve and enable real rates to reduce.The Chinese maybe tracking this dynamic rather closely as they have possibly been the most severely affected by the Japanese strategy which caused the CNY-JPY to appreciate to decade highs.A consequently weaker dollar could also revive the dollar carry trade and theoretically benefit global equitiesAhead of the consumer confidence number at 9:55 a.m. ET (consensus = 84), we are a bit off the lows but definitely in risk-off mode.In a turnaround from recent action, the  (INDEXRUSSELL:RUT) is underperforming the S&P 500, crude oil is down, and yields are down. Housing also had a nasty start, moving down about 1% before recovering a quarter of the loss.This is healthy as the market needs some cooling off time since the run off the 6/24 low, during which we've seen what's been a mediocre earnings season and mixed economic data.I posted a chart of the SPX versus the  (INDEXCBOE:VIX) below. Note that the VIX is just about the levels we saw during the May high while the SPX has actually exceeded those levels and is still near the all-time high set on Tuesday.There seems to be a slight change in patterns today, and my guess it's related to the  (INDEXNIKKEI:NI225) overnight drop. Noticeable flight to bonds/treasuries is still holding as I type even after the sentiment beat. This is an early diagnosis, so it's subject to a complete reversal. Nevertheless, this was the tape overnight and at the open and should be noted.  (INDEXCBOE:TNX) 2.569% back in the spotlight. ZN resistance is 126'230, 126'280 and 127'0115. Support s 126'180 and 126'140.-H.L Mencken, American journalist, essayist, editor, satirist, critic of American life, and scholarAnd yesterday, the only ""error"" was my call for a trading top as of last Friday. Of course, my window of opportunity for a downside feint remains from mid-July through mid-August, but so far the equity markets have remained resilient. Nevertheless, the expected weakness occurred Wednesday night with the S&P 500 (SPX/1690.25) printing lower yesterday morning by about 12 points. Subsequently, the SPX opened down by 5 points, rallied into the 10:00 hour, stumbled into the 11:30 a.m. ""pivot point,"" before rallying back to the ""flat line"" at noon. As a sidebar, there are two ""pivot points"" during the trading day; one is around 11:30 a.m., before the pros go to lunch, the other is at 2:30 p.m. as the pros ""square"" trading positions for the ""close."" Yesterday was a perfect example of that sequence with the session's low arriving at 11:30 a.m., with a rally peaking at ~2:00 p.m., followed by the pullback that bottomed between 2:30 and 3:00 p.m. The resulting rally lifted the senior index into the closing bell. While that action has not deterred my cautious stance, it did surprise me.Whatever the outcome in the short term, I remain bullish over the longer term embolden by my sense we are into a new secular bull market. One of the drivers for that stance is next week's release from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), which is rejiggering all the GDP figures since 1926. The reason is my long-standing belief about the benefits of ""intangible capital,"" which previously have not been reflected in the official figures. When Intangible Capital is included in the economic figures, our economic reports change; and, they change profoundly! It is shown that we are saving more, investing more in the future, generating more cash flows, growing GDP faster, etc.And, that was the point of a conference call with my friend Steve Vannelli yesterday afternoon, whose fund I own [see the attendant chart of the  (GAVAX)]. In said call, Steve talked about the world's most innovative companies that are accruing ""intangible capital,"" which is not being recorded by our accounting metrics. That is about to change, and the change is going to be impactful not only for the GDP figures, but for individual companies. To be sure, the moving of ""intangible capital"" into the ""dedicated economics of activity/output unto itself"" will raise the level of GDP growth, raise the level of corporate profitability, reduce debt ratios, increase net margins, etc. This morning, however, the markets seem worried about next week's Fed meeting, leaving the S&P 500 futures lower by 5 points.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Buzz on the Street: Investors Become Cautious After Earnings Reports, GDP Estimate Cuts@2013-07-26@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/buzz-street-investors-become-cautious-after-earnings-reports-gdp-estimate-cuts-2013-07-26
"Israel has one of the most dynamic, innovative and resilient economies in the world: it's home to some of the world's largest healthcare and industrial companies, a well-capitalized financial sector; leading companies in high-tech, bio-tech, defense-tech, and agri-tech and the largest natural gas discovery in the past decade.The country's strong economic prospects and the performance of its world-class companies resulted in Israeli equities outperforming U.S. equities more than five-fold over the past two decades. Yet many foreign investors are significantly under allocated to Israeli stocks. Israel presents an attractive investment opportunity for individual and institutional investors alike, but unfortunately, there are major structural problems facing the Israeli capital markets which make a portfolio allocation decision toward Israeli equities complex and challenging for foreign investors. These challenges include: liquidity and regulatory issues with the local exchange, substantial cross-holdings amongst Israeli corporate 'pyramids,' and Israel's small weight in developed market indexes.Compounding these challenges, the most prominent Israeli equity benchmarks and the investment vehicles that track them fail to represent the complete universe of Israeli stocks. They don't capture the full dynamism of Israel's global economy and are thus suboptimal benchmarks. Mellanox's (  ) impending delisting from the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange - and its removal from the local TA-25 benchmark this coming Sunday -- highlights this issue. But the problem has long been evident-- some of the most successful Israeli companies -- including Check Point Software (  ), SodaStream International (  ), VeriFone (  ), Amdocs (  ), CaesarStone (CSTE), Verint Systems (VRNT), and many more -- are missing from the major Israel equity benchmarks, whether calculated by the TASE, MSCI or FTSE. The resulting lower index market capitalization reduces Israel's weight in global benchmarks like MSCI EAFE and FTSE All-World, reducing the country's visibility to foreign investors.Thus, investors using established benchmarks to guide their allocation to Israeli equities are left with choices unrepresentative of the true size and scope of the Israeli equity universe, making Israeli equities look like a less attractive investment than they really are. But a solution to this market dissonance is relatively straightforward: the adoption of a ""better benchmark"" for Israel, namely the  (""  ""). BlueStar developed BIGI two years ago in consultation with sophisticated US endowments & foundations, and will be licensing it for a US-listed ETF later this month.What follows is background on the challenges of properly defining and benchmarking Israeli equities and the ""BlueStar solution,"" along with some observations about Israeli equity performance. I also provide technical analysis of Israeli Global Equities using the BIGI benchmark, based on the monthly research done by BlueStar Global Investors and available on  .Portfolio managers who want to make the proper allocation to Israeli stocks in the context of a developed market equity portfolio have limited choices of how to execute. Most Israeli equity indexes, including the local TA-25 and TA-100 benchmarks, and the MSCI Israel and (the MSCI Israel Capped Index is tracked by EIS (EIS)) and FTSE Israel indexes used by foreign investors, all have a high weighting in TEVA and a relatively high concentration in the top ten constituents. If a fund manager wants to implement an Israel allocation within their portfolio, they can do so by simply buying shares of Teva (TEVA), Israel Chemicals, Bank Hapoalim, Bank Leumi, Bezeq, NICE Systems (NICE), and Mellanox. And now that Mellanox will no longer qualify for inclusion in most Israel equity indexes, the options for investing in an Israel index-tracking fund are even less enticing; why pay management fees when you can simply buy and hold the shares of just a handful of the biggest companies and achieve barely decreased diversification risk but acceptable correlation to the benchmark?Comparative Index ConcentrationSOURCE: BlueStar Global Investors, LLC.May 31, 2013The other problem in the aforementioned indexes is encapsulated by this evolving fact: Mellanox's foregoing absence in the most prominent Israeli Indexes makes the company  Israeli and  linked to the Israeli economy. The removal of Mellanox from the most prominent Israeli equity benchmarks is a classic example of how these indexes fail to represent the complete Israeli Equity Universe - - which the  has been designed to achieve. resolves the fundamental flaws in existing Israeli equity indexes: diversification and completeness. BIGI's diversification parameters cap the highest weighted constituent at 12.5% and the combined weight of all components with a weight of 5% or more do not comprise more than 50% of the index. More importantly, the BlueStar index includes all eligible Israeli companies regardless of their listing venue. If one believes the exclusion of Mellanox (market capitalization just over $2 billion) in TA-25 and TA-100 Indexes and the MSCI Israel Index is a big deal, try multiplying that by a factor of fifteen! The combined market capitalization of Israeli companies excluded from other Israel indexes due to their listing venue totals over $30 billion in the top ten constituents of BIGI alone. To put that figure in perspective, compare BIGI with the index market capitalizations in the table below.""Missing Market-Cap""Comparative Index Market CapitalizationAn additional result of this  approach to benchmarking Israeli equities is that the BlueStar Israel Global Index appropriately weights Israel's robust technology sector. Ironically, the benchmarks used for the ""Start-Up Nation"" by the vast majority of domestic Israeli asset managers and global investors dramatically  -weight the tech sector. Many of Israel's world-renowned technology companies list their shares exclusively in the U.S. (NASDAQ or the NYSE and not the TASE) and are therefore rendered ineligible for inclusion in most currently-used indexes such as the TA-25 and MSCI-Israel. The Mellanox delisting highlights the need for a truly  approach for benchmarking Israeli stocks and/or implementing an index-based Israel equity allocation.Israeli Equity Benchmark ComparisonSOURCE: BlueStar Global Investors, LLC.May 31, 2013The generally lower level of institutional coverage of some of the constituents of the BlueStar Israel Global Index presents inefficiencies which are exploitable. Although Mellanox does not lack in institutional coverage it provides an instructive case study: The stock price began falling (again) in June, this time mostly for structural rather than fundamental reasons. Therefore, we believe that, eventually, analysts and investors who know the company well --and perhaps the company itself -- will be willing to buy the shares at substantially lower prices. In my next column we'll delve a bit deeper into specific stock and sector opportunities.Just as lower levels of institutional coverage create fundamentals-based stock opportunities, so too does technical analysis on a well-designed, comprehensive index for Israeli global equities. The patterns and chart levels I describe below have guided our firm's tactical and strategic outlook for Israeli equities over the past several months and quarters (and thus I use the term 'we' below). Past months' analyses are available at Israeli Global Equities began to rebound (led by the financials and energy sectors) after putting in three-year lows in mid/late 2012. After breaking important trend lines in November 2012 - during  rebound from the sharp drop at the beginning of  in Gaza - BIGI consolidated in December and resumed its upward movement in January and February. The market sell-off during Operation Pillar of Defense to the 200 index level for BIGI confirmed that this is a significant medium and long-term level of support for the index.BIGI is now consolidating (see chart 1A) following the rebound from mid-2012 just described. The range is depicted by the dotted green and red lines and for now, the range is occurring within the context of an upward trend. The 100-day SMA (simple moving average) in chart 1B seems to be quite significant as indicated on the chart below.  At this point,  at the lower end of the above-described range.Chart 1ASource: BlueStar Global Investors LLC(Jan 1, 2010- May 31, 2013)Chart 1BChart 2AChart 2BIf the lower end of the range is broken we would look for the lower band of the upward channel, just above the 220 level, to be the first level of support and a soft stop-loss level, followed by the 200 level being our hard ""stop-loss"" level.The longer-term outlook for Israeli equities continues to be firmly bullish as the index has re-entered the channel connecting the 2008/2009 lows (see chart 2A which spans the entire 2008-2009 global financial crisis). On that chart, the 50-day SMA may have gotten too far ahead of the 200 day SMA; it is perfectly normal to see consolidation or even a pull-back in the short term. The longer-term outlook will become even more bullish if Israeli Global Equities decisively breaks through the upper band of this channel which has crept up to the 240 level: For the longer-term investor, if the 230 and 220 levels are breached and then confirmed with a  of BIGI below 195, the longer-term outlook will shift dramatically, any rallies should be sold. In that case we would project a major decline to around 135.

he iShares MSCI Israel Capped ETF (NYSE:  ) and the Market Vectors Israel ETF (  ) both languished as tensions in Syria escalated.Amid speculation the U.S. could launch a military offensive against Syria, EIS fell nearly six percent from August 12 through September 3 while ISRA, the newer of the two Israel ETFs, lost 3.5 percent.Related:  .Those declines, while underscoring the risks associated with any ETF with significant exposure to the Middle East, should not obfuscate the fact that Israeli stocks have recently been solid performers, a story that is not getting much attention.Tel Aviv's benchmark TA-25 Index rose again today, extending its winning streak to nine days. While stocks in Tel Aviv trade at the highest levels in over two years, they are not richly valued. The TA-25 trades at 11.7 estimated earnings, or 29 percent lower than the average for the MSCI World Index of developed markets,  .ISRA debuted  and since that debut, the new Israel ETF has gained 7.3 percent. EIS, with $75 million in assets under management, has not been a slouch over that 90-day period, either, returning 5.3 percent.Recent strength in Israel ETFs might be attributable to the central bank's Federal Reserve-esque ultra loose monetary policy. In May, Bank of Israel  , taking rates to 1.25 percent in an effort to guard against a strong shekel. The moves make sense because exports account for 40 percent of Israeli GDP.Both ETFs feature significant allocations to Teva Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:  ), the generic drug giant. EIS has a weight of 22.3 percent to the stock, making ISRA's 12.8 percent weight to Teva look small by comparison. There are, however,  for investors to consider.While Israeli stocks are cheap, foreign investors should consider opting for increased exposure to Israel's booming tech sector, one that accounts for a quarter of the country's exports. ISRA devotes 32.5 percent of its weight to tech, nearly five times the weight EIS allocates to the sector. That is an important factor because if the recent rate cuts have the desired impact of weakening the shekel, Israeli tech exporters will be more profitable and that should translate into higher prices for ISRA.U.S.-listed tech names in ISRA's lineup include Check Point Software (NASDAQ:  ), Amdocs (NYSE:  ) and Mellanox Technologies (NASDAQ:  ).At the end of August, ISRA had P/E ratio of 15.3 compared to 27.25 for EIS,  .

"Shutterstock photoHackers have been out in full force on their search-and-destroy missions in recent months.In February, for example,Burger King 's (  )Twitter account reportedly was hacked to look likeMcDonald's (  ). The hacker tweeted that Burger King had been sold to McDonald's, and the account had been taken over by Burger King employees.With attacks like this one on the rise, so too has demand been rising for better network security from companies likePalo Alto Networks (  ).Palo Alto, which went public in July, has staked its claim in a network security market long led by outfits such asCheck Point Software Technologies (  ) andJuniper Networks (  ).Founded in 2005, the relative newcomer to the field has taken on its big-shot rivals by coming to market with a key point of differentiation: It pioneered the next-generation firewall technology.The firewall serves as the barrier between an organization's internal network and the Internet. Palo Alto's next-gen platform allows businesses, service providers and government to secure their networks and safely enable the increasingly complex and fast-growing number of applications running on their networks.Its approach focuses security on applications and users vs. traditional firewalls, which focus security on the network port and protocols of the data network traffic. Its next-generation firewall delivers application, user and content visibility and control integrated within the firewall through proprietary hardware and software.Palo Alto's platform has caught on in a big way. Revenue has grown by at least 50% since its market debut. In the most recent second quarter, sales soared 70% to $96.5 million. Profit surged 40% to 5 cents a share. It added more than 1,000 new customers for the fifth straight quarter. At the end of the quarter, it had more than 11,000 customers in over 100 countries.What's the big draw?""Its next-generation firewall can block specific Web apps such as Dropbox,"" said Northland Capital Markets analyst Catharine Trebnick. ""Its solution enables the enterprise to specify down to the application level which ones should be allowed to be used by the enterprise.""At a time when there's such a large and growing number of targeted threats, such as the Burger King breach, she says, the next-generation firewall is in ""huge demand.""""And Palo Alto is going after these large enterprises with legacy solutions in place and saying 'you need to get rid of that and get the new one.' They were the first to market. So they have first-mover advantage. They have pretty good performance from what I understand.""The traditional firewall approach worked well for basic email and Web browsing applications, which behaved in a predictable fashion and adhered to standard network ports and protocols, according to a company filing with the SEC. But a growing number of applications, such as Web 2.0 and social media, allow users to collaborate and share information on the Internet in ways that weren't possible in the past. These applications, says the filing, have become increasingly more complex and unpredictable and more challenging to the legacy firewall.That's where Palo Alto's approach comes in: ""What Palo Alto has driven is the idea that it's no longer good enough to look at ports and protocols,"" said Stifel Nicolaus analyst Todd Weller. ""You have to look at the application coming in and who's using this application and whether to let it in.""Incumbents, which include network security companies like Check Point and Juniper, have added application control capabilities, Weller says.But Palo Alto, having that first-mover advantage, also now has a brand advantage.""The question comes down to whether that's sustainable or not,"" he adds. ""We spend time trying to figure it out. It's a big point of debate in the market.""Meanwhile, says Weller, the market environment for network security is ""healthy"" amid an increasing number of attacks and more devices accessing the network. All the pure-play network security vendors are benefiting from that.Palo Alto gave some telling signs of its progress in the market at its March 21 analyst day. Palo Alto said 500 companies out of the Forbes Global 2000 are customers, said Trebnick in a note after attending the meeting. Another good sign: 60% of new customers are using Palo Alto as a primary firewall vs. 50% a year ago.Palo Alto estimates the total addressable market for security will be roughly $13.4 billion in 2016, up from $10 billion in 2012. It pegs its market share at 5%. The company plans to boost share by expanding its major account team lineup to 40 teams from two.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect the company's full-year profit to grow 50% to 21 cents a share. They see a 110% rise in 2014 and a 68% gain in 2015.Trebnick says she's heard the demand is there for Palo Alto.""They're replacing a lot of the legacy firewalls in the Forbes 2000 at the expense ofCisco Systems (CSCO),"" she said.Its customers include JD Williams & Co. Ltd., the United Kingdom's leading home shopping company; Farm Credit Financial Partners, the top provider of technology services to farm credit associations; and wireless telecommunications company Qualcomm (QCOM).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Palo Alto Takes On Big Rivals With Firewall Approach@2013-04-04@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/palo-alto-takes-big-rivals-firewall-approach-2013-04-04
 (  ) reported first quarter 2013 adjusted earnings of 73 cents per share, which matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Check Point reported revenues of $322.7 million in the first quarter, up 3.1% from $313.1 million in the year-ago period. The quarter revenues were below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $330.0 million and at the lower end of the company's guidance range of $320.0-$332.0 million. The year-over-year revenue growth was aided by the increase in Software Updates, Maintenance and Services revenues, partially offset by weak Product and Licenses revenues.Improvement in Software Updates, Maintenance and Services revenues was mainly due to higher subscription for its annuity blade solutions (threat prevention blades). However, lower sales of high-end appliances doomed Product revenues.

"Shutterstock photoLast year, security software bySymantec (  ) blocked more than 5.5 billion malicious attacks on computers, up 81% from the prior year.These cyberattacks have targeted groups ranging from governments and financial firms to businesses large and small. All manner of computer and software tools are available to resist the onslaught. One primary line of defense is the computer firewall, a combination of hardware and software used to help keep a business network from unwanted intrusion.Among the providers of firewall gear isPalo Alto Networks (  ), a relative newcomer to the field that has disrupted longtime leaders such asCisco (  ),Check Point Software (  ) andJuniper Networks (  ). The reason for that is Palo Alto Networks pioneered a new method of security protection, known as next-generation firewall technology.The need for next-generation firewall technology is due to newer methods of computing. Businesses and their employees have increasingly used external software applications available through the Web, including cloud computing platforms. This has greatly increased the number of ways cyberattacks gain entry into a business network.""So much more traffic is coming in through the Web and the threats have gotten far more complex,"" said Greg Young, a research analyst at Gartner.Last year, about $7 billion was spent on firewall technology, according to Gartner. When other elements of security are added in, the estimated market is $10 billion in 2012, growing to $13.4 billion in 2016, according to IDC.In times past -- thinking of a business like a city -- security experts might have to check only the traffic on freeways and highways. Now, they also have to closely monitor boulevards and side streets. The challenge comes in knowing who to let in and what to keep out.This is where Palo Alto Networks comes in.""Until the arrival of Palo Alto Networks' next generation of network security, companies were forced to either allow the use of these applications and suffer the security consequences or block the applications and suffer the productivity consequences,"" said Mark McLaughlin, chairman, president and CEO, in a conference call with analysts after the company posted quarterly results Sept. 10, its fiscal fourth quarter.""We are at the confluence of a major technology trend that makes our offerings timely, relevant, defensible and highly differentiated,"" he said.Executives of Palo Alto Networks declined to comment for this article due to an imposed ""quite period"" resulting from plans for a secondary offering. On Wednesday, Palo Alto announced the pricing of 4.8 million shares at 63.Its technology platform monitors and enables the increasingly complex and rapidly growing number of applications running on computer networks. Companies can continue to use these applications with confidence as Palo Alto Networks provides the ability to inspect all content for all threats in real time across a multitude of software applications, according to the company.""They've crushed the traditional firewall market with their disruptive technology,"" said Jonathan Ho, an analyst with William Blair. ""It has changed the thinking and caused the other major players to adopt this approach, but from our view Palo Alto Networks has a sustainable edge.""Just like all other technology transitions, competitors must adapt or wither. In the case of next-generation firewall technology, it's not an easy thing to do. Businesses have spent millions installing security gear over the years. Swapping that out for a new platform is not as simple as upgrading software.""For a lot of legacy products, it's not a natural migration to rip out those products,"" said Ho. ""It's a paradigm shift.""But the change is coming. Gartner estimates 10% of business enterprises have next-generation firewall technology in place. It sees that growing to 38% in 2016.Palo Alto Networks became a publicly traded company July 20 in a highly successful offering.The IPO priced at $42 a share, above the expected range of $34 to $37. It began trading at 55, peaked above 62 and finished at 53.13, up 26.5%. It currently trades near 62, about 17% above its first-day close.The advantage of its early lead in next-generation firewall networks is evident in the revenue growth.Revenue has grown per quarter at triple-digit rates for most of the last four years. In the September quarter, though, sales growth decelerated to double-digit growth of 88%, to $75.6 million. It posted an EPS loss, minus items, of 7 cents, reversing three prior quarters of profitability. And though Palo Alto exceeded Wall Street estimates, shares fell nearly 6%, though it has since recovered from that drop.""Investors likely expected stronger guidance to sustain the company's rise in valuation,"" Ho said in comments at the time.For the current quarter, its fiscal first quarter, Palo Alto Networks guided revenue in the range of $80 million to $84 million. The midpoint of $82 million would be a 44% increase from a year ago. It expects a profit of 3 cents per share. In the last three quarters it has added more than 1,000 customers per quarter and has more than 9,000 customers overall in about 100 countries.Asked in the conference call if Palo Alto Networks was seeing any competitive threat coming from Cisco, Check Point or Juniper, McLaughlin said no. ""We haven't seen any new releases or introductions by anybody that indicates they're closing the gap.""But it's not that Palo Alto Networks is waltzing through a garden of roses. All the major players are working on the technology transition, includingSourcefire (FIRE). Palo Alto Networks is also facing a patent infringement lawsuit filed last December by Juniper Networks.""Prior to Palo Alto Networks, the competitors in this field were in a walking race,"" said Young. ""There was not a lot of innovation. They have since lit a fire, and vendors are moving in this direction.""The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Palo Alto Networks Advances Next-Generation Security@2012-10-18@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/palo-alto-networks-advances-next-generation-security-2012-10-18

 (  ) reported fourth quarter 2012 with adjusted earnings of 85 cents per share beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 83 cents.Check Point reported revenues of $368.6 million in the fourth quarter, up 3.3% from $356.8 million in the year-ago period and within the company's guidance range of $355.0-$387.0 million. The year-over-year revenue growth was aided by the increase in Software Updates, Maintenance and Services revenues, partially offset by lower Product and Licenses revenue.Geographic contributions also remained stable with Americas contributing 45% of revenues; Europe 37%; and Asia-Pacific and Japan, Middle East and Africa region contributing the remaining 18%.Reported gross profit increased 5.9% year over year to $324.1 million. Gross margin increased 210 basis points from the year-ago quarter to 87.9%. Cost control measures primarily led to the margin expansion.Operating income came in at $210.5 million, up 9.3% year over year. Operating margin increased 311 basis points year over year to 57.1%. Total operating expenses increased 0.2% year over year as the company continued to invest in business and hiring for research and development, sales and marketing and technological support.Reported net income was $173.9 million or 85 cents per share, up from $159.8 million or 75 cents in the comparable quarter last year. Excluding special items but including stock-based compensation expense, non-GAAP net income was $173.9 million or 85 cents a share compared with $160.7 million or 79 cents in the year-earlier quarter.Check Point exited the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $1.50 billion, up from $1.45 billion in the prior quarter. Trade receivables were $373.8 million. Cash flow from operations was $202.5 million, up from $180.4 million in the previous quarter.Management forecasts first quarter2013 revenue in a range of in the range of $320 million to $332 million, while the non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of 74 to 80 cents per share. GAAP earnings per share are expected to be approximately 6 cents less than the estimated range.For 2013, the company expects revenue in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.45 billion while the non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $3.30 to $3.50. Moreover, the GAAP EPS is expected to be approximately $0.26 less than that.Check Point delivered good fourth quarter results with the bottom line exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results were also decent in terms of year-over-year comps. The company delivered a decent operating performance with a modest revenue growth and a maximum revenue contribution from America. Results are affected to a certain extent by the slowdown in growth in the European region and spending by the company as well as fresh competition from  (  ) in the new target markets of Check Point.The company is also deriving some benefits from strength at the high end of the market and increased demand for its blade solutions.

 (  ) is scheduled to announce its third quarter 2012 results on October 17, before market opens but no estimate revisions at this point could be noticed.Check Point delivered an impressive second quarter in terms of year-over-year comps, but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimates both in terms of top and bottom lines. Earnings per share (EPS) of 71 cents missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. But the quarter's results increased 18.3% from a year ago. Revenue saw a 9.3% year-over-year increase, aided by strong performances by Product & Licenses as well as Software Updates, Maintenance and Services segments.The overall improvement was mainly aided by the growing demand for the company's security products and strong geographic contributions. The growth in demand was largely due to a general customer pattern of upgrading security levels. Also, cost reductions helped in margin expansion. However, currency fluctuations had a slight negative impact on the results.For the third quarter, management sees revenue in the range of $316.0 million to $345.0 million. The guidance reflects some concern about the macroeconomic environment and Europe. But at the same time, the company assures that it is ready to face the challenges with renewed strength buoyed by new product launches and increase in market share. The company expects EPS of 74-81 cents for the third quarter. GAAP EPS would be 7 cents less than the non-GAAP figure due to prevalence of some one-time items.(Detailed earnings results can be viewed in the blog titled: Check Point Misses 2Q Estimates.)Recently, Check Point received recognition from IT research firm Gartner, which positions it as the leading vendor for mobile data protection solutions. Another research firm IDC also finds Check Point to be the top supplier of Firewall and UTM appliance in the world.Industry experts are of the opinion that network security spending has been consistent in the technology sector due to surge in demand for big data protection against encryption and leakage.Analysts are positive on the growth of Check Point's security software portfolio and believe that it could be a significant revenue driver, leveraging the market opportunity.On the other hand, some analysts believe that revenue can be under pressure due to weakening macroeconomic variables, increased pricing pressure, slowdown in growth, billing and spending by the company as well as fresh competition from  (  ) in the new target markets of Check Point; challenges in penetrating new high-end customers, low number of suppliers and distribution partners.None of the 12 and 13 estimates for the third quarter and fiscal 2012, respectively were revised in the past 30 days. The unanimity could be due to Euro and macro concerns, which are expected to get neutralized by the company's confidence to fight it back with new product launches and market share gains.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter and fiscal 2012 remained unchanged at 73 cents and $3.00, respectively, over the past 30 days. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2013 stayed unmoved at $3.33 in the past 30 days. However, all the estimates moved a penny down in the past 90 days reflecting the company's cautious guidance.We think that investor sentiment will be in Check Point's favor as shareholders remain encouraged by its market share gains from the tech giant  (  ) and  (  ). Check Point continues to benefit from strength at the high end of the market, and increased demand for its blade solutions. Moreover, the company's continuous product launches are encouraging. Considering all these, we believe that the third quarter and fiscal guidance are quite conservative.However, limited margin expansion potential (over dependence on indirect sales model), an uncertain economic environment, competitive pressures and Check Point's significant European exposure are concerns.Currently, Check Point has a Zacks #3 Rank, implying a short-term Hold rating.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Earnings Preview: Check Point - Analyst Blog@2012-10-16@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/earnings-preview%3A-check-point-analyst-blog-2012-10-16
 (  ) reported first-quarter 2013 earnings per share of 7 cents, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The quarter's earnings, which exclude the effect of a patent settlement, were 15.1% lower than 8 cents reported in the year-earlier quarter.Fortinet's first-quarter revenues of $135.8 million increased 15.8% from $117.2 million in the year-ago quarter and were slightly below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $136.0 million. The year-over-year improvement was aided by 22.1% growth in Services revenues, 8.9% in Product revenues and 3.6% in Ratable and other revenues.Fortinet performed well in the Asia-Pacific and U.S. Enterprise sectors. However, the revenue growth was adversely affected by macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges in Latin America and Europe, the Middle East & Africa, a shortfall in U.S service provider business, inventory shortages and product transition issues.Gross profit increased 12.2% from the year-ago quarter to $96.7 million. However, gross margin dropped 230 basis points year over year to 71.2%. The margin contraction was due to higher mix of low-margin entry-level products and lower service margin.Total operating expenses surged 20.5% year over year. Operating margin was 11.3% compared with 16.0% in the year-ago period. Continued investments resulted in operating margin decline.Fortinet reported adjusted net income of $12.0 million or 7 cents per share compared with $13.9 million or 8 cents in the year-ago quarter.Fortinet exited the first quarter with cash and marketable securities of $460.4 million, up from $413.7 million in the previous quarter. Accounts receivable decreased 4.9% sequentially to $102.4 million.Cash from operating activities was $37.7 million, down from $48.5 million in the year-ago quarter. Capital expenditure in the first quarter was $1.5 million versus $1.6 million in the year-ago quarter.Despite the continuing macro uncertainty, Fortinet seems positive on healthy network security market and its product line-ups.For second quarter of 2013, Fortinet expects revenues in the range of $141.0-$144.0 million, reflecting 11.0% year-over-year growth. Gross margin is expected to be approximately 72.0%. The company also expects non-GAAP operating margin of 17.0%, pro forma tax rate of 33.0%, diluted share count in the range of 169 million to 171 million and non-GAAP earnings per share of 9 cents.For fiscal 2013, total revenue is expected in the range of $595 million to $605 million, up approximately 12% year over year at the midpoint. The company also expects gross margin of 72.0%, non-GAAP operating margin of 20%, diluted share count of approximately 170 million to 172 million and earnings per share of 49 cents.Fortinet provides network security solutions, which includes firewall, VPN, application control, antivirus, intrusion prevention, Web filtering, anti-spam, and WAN acceleration. Fortinet's first-quarter results were disappointing with the top line missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate, while the bottom line matched the same. Though second quarter guidance was a bit cautious, we are encouraged by a better visibility into fiscal 2013.However, we prefer to have a bearish view given margin contraction due to continuous investments and stiff competition from the key network security players such as  (  ),  (  ),  (  ) and Palo Alto Networks.Currently, Fortinet has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Fortinet's 1Q Earnings In Line, Rev Misses - Analyst Blog@2013-05-02@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/fortinets-1q-earnings-in-line-rev-misses-analyst-blog-2013-05-02
 (  ) exited third quarter 2012 with adjusted earnings of 73 cents per share, matching the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Adjusted earnings per share exclude one-time items, but include stock-based compensation expense. The miss was due to a feeble macroeconomic environment, which prompted customers to tighten their budgets. Currency fluctuation in Europe also had a negative impact on the overall results. Shares closed at $41.15, down 13.22% from the previous day's price. Shares also fell 0.66% in the after-hours. The share price depreciation reflected investor concern as the guidance failed to meet their expectations and Euro concerns.Check Point reported revenue of $332.4 million in the third quarter, up 7.8% from $308.3 million in the year-ago period. The quarter's result was within the company's guidance range of $316.0-$345.0 million and came slightly below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $333.0 million. The year-over-year revenue growth was supported by 12.6% increase in Software Updates, Maintenance and Services revenues, partially offset by roughly flat Product and Licenses revenue.Geographic contributions also remained stable with Americas contributing 45% of revenues, Europe 37%, and Asia-Pacific and Japan, Middle East and Africa region contributing the remaining 18%. North America continued to deliver good results with double-digit growth in product and service revenues. Nevertheless, the quarter was a bit affected by Euro headwinds.Overall, revenue improvement was driven by the growing demand for Check Point's enterprise appliance units and software blades. Management also reported decent performance in terms of the number of large deals.Reported gross profit increased 10.7% year over year to $294.1 million. Gross margin increased 230 basis points from the year-ago quarter to 88.5%. Cost control measures led to improved margin expansion.Operating income came in at $182.6 million, up 15.5% year over year. Operating margin increased 370 basis points year over year to 55.0%. Total operating expenses increased 3.7% year over year as Check Point continued to invest in business and hirings for research and development, sales and marketing and technological support. However, this was partially offset by the strengthening of the dollar.Reported net income was $152.4 million or 73 cents per share, up from $134.1 million or 63 cents in the comparable quarter last year. Excluding special items but including stock-based compensation expense, non-GAAP net income was $153.2 million or 73 cents a share compared with $143.3 million or 67 cents in the year-earlier quarter.Check Point exited the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $1.45 million, down from $1.37 million in the prior quarter. Trade receivables were $240.9 million. Cash flow from operations was $180.4 million, up from $157.5 million in the previous quarter. Capital expenditure decreased to $1.18 million from $1.28 million in the prior quarter.During the quarter, Check Point repurchased 3.2 million shares for a total consideration of $156.1 million.Management sees revenue in a range of $355.0 million to $387.0 million, and earnings (excluding one-time items) in the range of 83 cents to 91 cents per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimates for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2012 are pegged at 85 cents and $3.01 per share, respectively. GAAP earnings per share would be 7 cents less than the non-GAAP figure.Concurrent with fourth quarter outlook, Check Point cautioned that the quarter could be somewhat challenging due to the persisting economic backdrop. But at the same time, the company assures that it is ready to face the challenges with renewed strength buoyed by new product launches and increase in market share. This justifies such wide revenue and earnings per share projections.Check Point delivered a modest third quarter with the bottom line matching the Zacks Consensus Estimate and top line coming slightly below. But the results were decent in terms of year-over-year comps.

The adjusted earnings per share exclude one-time items, but include stock-based compensation expense. Check Point received healthy subscription from the increased adoption of annuity software blades. Shares closed at $48.75, up 6.86% from the previous day's price. The share price appreciation indicates a decent quarter as well as the expanded share repurchase program announced.Check Point reported revenue of $328.6 million in the second quarter, up 9.3% from $300.6 million in the year-ago period. The quarter's result was at the lower end of company's guidance range of $324.0-$336.0 million and was below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $332.0 million.

t goes without saying that the revenue and earnings of a company are very important for investors. But don't overlook a company's  . They can tell an interesting story.The gross profit margin, which is simply a company's revenue minus the cost of producing its goods or services, divided by its revenue, can tell you a lot about a company's pricing power. In periods of rapidly rising commodity costs, companies with strong pricing power can raise their prices to offset higher costs. Those without it cannot, and margins suffer.Additionally, companies might be able to show rather solid revenue growth on its income statement, but if its gross profit margin is declining in the process, it's likely that the company is discounting heavily to move its merchandise off the shelves. That could be a red flag for investors.Another important profit margin to consider is operating profit. Operating profit takes gross profit and subtracts operating expenses such as selling, general and administrative costs. This, too, is expressed as a percentage of revenue.The operating margin lets investors know how efficiently a company is being run. If its operating expenses are growing significantly faster than revenue, for instance, then this could be a signal that management isn't keeping a close eye on its costs.Keep in mind that corporate profit margins depend heavily on the industry they're in, so it's important to compare them with their peers for an apples-to-apples analysis. Tech companies will tend to have much higher margins than retailers, for instance.Expanding profit margins have been a big reason why the S&P 500 has more than doubled since bottoming in March 2009. Revenue growth has certainly helped, but expanding margins have led to substantial bottom line growth, and higher stock prices. But after more than 3 years, further expansion is unlikely.While profit margins usually expand and contract along with the overall economy, some companies manage to consistently produce wide profit margins. More often than not, these businesses will have at least one of four types of competitive advantages: These competitive advantages must be constantly monitored and maintained in order to fend off competition. And if a company continually generates wide margins and fat profits, you can bet it will attract competitors.Usually high-margin, wide-moat businesses will also generate strong free cash flow for its shareholders (if a company routinely reports high profits but low cash flow, then look out). This frees it up for things like share buybacks, dividends, debt extinguishment or acquisitions. But these high margin companies usually trade at premium valuations too.There are, however, companies with fat, and expanding, profit margins and strong growth prospects trading at reasonable prices. For the long-term investor, these could be great buying opportunities.I ran a screen for companies with 5-year average operating margins greater than 30% and net margins above 25%, along with the criteria that current margins must be greater than their 5-year averages (i.e., margins must be expanding). The stocks must also have a forward price/earnings ratio below 20.Here are 4 names from the list: (  )Operating Margin (5-yr average): 44.9%Net Margin (5-yr average): 40.9%Forward P/E: 15.3Check Point is a leader in securing the Internet. It's best known for its firewall and VPN products. Check Point generates over 60% of its revenue from high margin software updates, maintenance and subscription fees.The company retains a remarkable 45 cents for every dollar of revenue it earns. And with strong cash flow and very little capital expenditures, Check Point generates very strong free cash flow, which it has been using to buyback its own stock. (  )Operating Margin (5-yr average): 34.2%Net Margin (5-yr average): 32.7%Forward P/E: 8.1Bladex is a unique company. It was created by the central banks of Latin America and the Caribbean as a supranational bank to promote foreign trade throughout Latin America. The bank primarily provides trade financing to selected commercial banks, middle-market companies and corporations in the region.This has proven to be a very profitable niche for the company. And thanks to its fat profit margins, Bladex is able to pay a dividend that yields a juicy 4.8%. (  )Operating Margin (5-yr average): 38.4%Net Margin (5-yr average): 36.9%Forward P/E: 16.2IntercontinentalExchange, or ICE, operates global futures exchanges, over-the-counter (OTC) markets, derivatives clearing houses and post-trade services. Most of its trading is done electronically on three regulated exchanges and an OTC marketplace.Because of its transaction-based revenues, ICE actually benefits from volatility in the marketplace. As you can see from its margins, it is a very profitable business. During the first six months of 2012, ICE's operating margin was an incredible 61.5%, up from 58.7% over the same period last year. (  )Operating Margin (5-yr average): 31.2%Net Margin (5-yr average): 28.9%Forward P/E: 17.0Grupo Aeroportuario del Sureste, S.A.B. de C.V., or  , is a Mexican airport operator with concessions to operate, maintain and develop the airports in tourist-heavy southeast Mexico, including Cancún, Veracruz and Cozumel.The company was formed in 1998 after the Mexican government decided to privatize some of its airports. Southeast Airport Group has experienced strong and relatively steady revenue and wide profit margins since then as it essentially has a monopoly on the airports in southeast Mexico.Investors should look beyond just the top and bottom lines of the income statement and consider what's in between: the gross and operating margins. For the long-term investor concerned with competitive advantages, look for wide, and expanding, margins.

 (  ) is scheduled to announce its second quarter 2012 results on July 18, before market opens and we see some estimate revisions at this point.Check Point delivered a decent first quarter, with earnings per share (EPS) of 68 cents beating the Zacks Consensus Estimates by a penny. The quarter's results increased 19.3% from a year ago. Revenue saw an 11.3% year-over-year increase, aided by strong performances by Product & Licenses as well as Software Updates, Maintenance and Services segments.The overall improvement was mainly aided by the growing demand for the company's security products and strong geographic contributions. The growth in demand was largely due to a general customer pattern of upgrading security levels.For the second quarter, management sees revenue in the range of $324.0 million to $336.0 million. The guidance reflects some concern about the macroeconomic environment and Europe. For fiscal 2012, Check Point reiterated its revenue expectations between $1.345 billion and $1.395 billion. The company also continues to expect services and subscription revenue to grow faster than product revenue, based on the product mix shift toward annuity blades and increasing adoption of premium support contracts.The company expects EPS of 74-77 cents for the second quarter and $3.10-$3.20 for the fiscal 2012. GAAP EPS would be 7 cents less than the non-GAAP figure due to prevalence of some one-time items.(Detailed earnings results can be viewed in the blog titled: Product Demand Aids Check Point 1Q)As cyber-attacks and security risks reach new levels of sophistication, customer expectations for security infrastructure are also increasing. Given Check Point's ability to innovate and deliver new and improved security products and technologies, it can be assumed that popularity of the company's products will keep growing. Hence, a continuous legacy firewall refresh cycle and a broadening product portfolio could fetch a steady revenue stream.Analysts are positive on product growth as CHKP has launched a new appliance series as well as new operating system (OS). They think that 50.0% of Nokia's customer will upgrade to its new OS system as it is packed with new features.Analysts are positive on management's transformation from a largely single-product, software-focused company to a broader provider of appliance-based network security solutions. They believe that the company's transition to its blade architecture provides a continuous growth avenue for the company, in terms of both up-sell opportunities and new applications.On the other hand, some analysts believe that revenue can be under pressure due to weakening macroeconomic variables, increased pricing pressure, slowdown in growth, billing and spending by the company as well as fresh competition in the new target markets of Check Point, challenges in penetrating new high-end customers, low number of suppliers and distribution partners.Out of the 9 and 11 estimates for the second quarter and fiscal 2012, one and two estimates, respectively, were revised downwards in the past 30 days. However, one estimate was raised for the second quarter in the past 30 days. Despite the positive momentum, we think that the downward revision could be due to the strained macroeconomic condition and ongoing debt problems in Europe, which could put a lid over IT spending budgets.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter remained unchanged at 72 cents for the past 30 days. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2012 decreased 2 cents to $3.02 over the past 30 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2013 also dropped 2 cents to $3.34 in the past 30 days. The reason for the downward movement could be reflective of analyst concerns.We think that investor sentiment will be in Check Point's favor as shareholders remain encouraged by its market share gains from the tech giant  (  ) and  (  ). Check Point continues to benefit from strength at the high end of the market, and increased demand for its blade solutions. Moreover, the company's continuous product launches are encouraging. Considering all these, we believe that the second quarter and fiscal guidance are quite conservative.However, limited margin expansion potential (over dependence on indirect sales model), an uncertain economic environment, competitive pressures and Check Point's significant European exposure are concerns.Currently, Check Point has a Zacks #3 Rank, implying a short-term Sell recommendation.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Earnings Preview: Check Point - Analyst Blog@2012-07-17@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/earnings-preview%3A-check-point-analyst-blog-2012-07-17
 (  ) exited fourth quarter 2011 with flying colors. Earnings of 80 cents per share handily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 77 cents. The adjusted earnings per share exclude one-time items, but include stock-based compensation expense. Check Point witnessed strong network security product sales across all geographical regions. Shares surged 7.82% in the after-hour trade.Check Point reported revenue of $356.8 million in the fourth quarter, up 12.0% from $318.5 million in the year-ago period. The quarter's result was much better than the company's expectation. The improvement can be attributed to a 10.6% year-over-year growth in Product and Licenses revenue. Moreover, Check Point witnessed a total 13.2% year-over-year growth in its Software Updates, Maintenance and Services revenues.Overall, revenue improvement was driven by the growing demand for Check Point's security solutions and Application Control software blades, as well as product launches. The growth in demand was largely due to a general customer pattern of upgrading security levels. Management also reported strong performance regarding the number of large deals, which doubled from the year-ago quarter.Reported gross profit increased 12.8% year over year to $306.0 million. Gross margin increased 30 basis points from the year-ago quarter to 85.8%.Operating income came in at $192.6 million, up 18.9% year over year. Operating margin increased 310 basis points year over year to 54.0%. The improvement in operating results was driven by strong revenue growth that outpaced the 3.6% increase in operating expenses. Cost control was also noticed with the year-over-year drop in R&D expenses.The quarter's GAAP net income was $159.8 million or 75 cents per share, up from $137.4 million or 64 cents in the comparable quarter last year. Excluding special items but including stock-based compensation expense, non-GAAP net income was $169.2 million or 80 cents a share compared with $149.1 million or 70 cents in the year-earlier quarter.Check Point exited the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $1.36 billion, up from $1.21 billion in the prior quarter. Trade receivables were $357.4 million. Cash flow from operations was $173.2 million, up from $154.5 million in the previous quarter. Capital expenditure decreased to $1.72 million from $1.98 million in the prior quarter. During the quarter, Check Point repurchased 1.32 million shares for a total consideration of $75.0 million.Management sees revenue in a range of $305 million to $315 million, and EPS (excluding one-time items) in the range of 69 cents to 73 cents. For fiscal 2012, Check Point expects revenue of $1.345-$1.395 billion and EPS ex-items of $3.10-$3.20. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter and fiscal 2012 are pegged at 67 cents and $2.69, respectively.Check Point delivered an impressive fourth quarter, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate with respect to earnings per share.

The trade accounted for most of the options activity in the company on Friday, and pushed total volume to 8 times greater than average.The transaction represents a long-term bet that the tech stock will hold its ground or push higher over the next 22 months. If it does, the puts will expire worthless and the investor will keep the $2.75 credit. Otherwise, they'll have to buy shares for the strike price.He or she may think such a drop is unlikely because CHKP has a major support area in place between $48 and $51. The stock bounced around that level several times since last June, and it marked a key peak from early 2002.CHKP rose 1 percent to $62.62 on Friday and is up 19 percent so far this year. The company has beaten earnings forecasts for at least the last four quarters amid a secular boom in demand for its Internet-security services.The date of the next quarterly report hasn't yet been announced, but it will probably occur in mid-April based on last year's calendar.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Trade sees no going back for Check Point@2012-03-26@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/trade-sees-no-going-back-check-point-2012-03-26
ow do you create a watchlist for the upcoming earnings season? One idea is to find which reporting companies are carrying the highest amounts of cash – those with higher cash holdings may be financially healthier and better positioned for a lower-than-expected earnings report.Among the companies reporting earnings this week, we found 12 with high levered free cashflow relative to market cap. We report this percentage, as well as other interesting data on these companies.Levered free cash flow is the free cash flow available after paying interest to bondholders and re-paying any principal as it comes due. From this cash flow, the Board can decide to pay all or some in dividends to shareholders, or re-invest the money back into the firm to support growth. Because both dividends and firm growth are valuable to shareholders, levered free cash flow is a particularly relevant measure to consider.What will you be looking for this earnings season?

"There is no magic formula (contrary to popular belief) when it comes to generating new ideas. I like to attend a few conferences per year to open my eyes to previous unknowns. They can be quite tedious, but every once in a while you pick up an idea or theme worthy of exploring further. I recently attended a Street Tech Conference where Checkpoint (  ) presented and answered questions regarding the industry landscape. The Q&A quickly turned to Imperva (  ) having  competition in their particular security niche. I became more interested when I found out that the co-founder of Checkpoint started Imperva, so I started exploring.Imperva is an independent platform solution that works with multiple databases to protect high-value business data. The idea is that enterprises can segment data in either traditional or virtual data centers.From the  : is its product. However, the last line of its description from the filing had me intrigued.Imperva hasn't been picked up by the research arms of the IPO underwriters yet (i.e. it's not on the generalists' radar yet). JPM, DB, RBC, PacCrest, and Lazard will all likely initiate with Buy/Hold recommendations and targets above the last trade. It seems likely that $35 becomes the consensus target, but as we know, this is largely irrelevant. The market cap is small here - less than $600M, and I believe there may be runway.Again from the filing:The answer is that it's hard to quantify at this point. An investor has to take a stance on whether or not the security spending going forward will be more or less than it is today, and if this could be an emerging segment or not. I find it hard to take the under on either of these in today's environment, given the focus of IT managers on security. There is a  dollar market here. Assuming 0.5 % of today's $27B security spend is allocated to high-value data, it could be a $1B+ opportunity already. Not to mention IMPV doesn't have any serious open source competition.The competition in security is clearly formidable. However, it's hard to believe that a co-founder of Checkpoint would set out to build a company that could easily be replicated. IMPV has a niche business, but this could clearly change.IMPV's revenue has grown at a CAGR of 46% over the last 3 years and they maintain gross margins of 77%. However, I look at Imperva from a Market Cap standpoint for the time being. The company is not profitable, but given that SuccessFactors (SFSF) was just purchased at 10x's revenue by SAP - I don't think a $600M Market Cap on LTM revenue of $70+M is unreasonable. SFSF wasn't growing at 46% over a 3 year period. This is one to watch.Imperva has been added to our Watch List - look for follow up
after the Street initiates.Imperva has been added to our Watch List - look for follow up after the Street initiates.

 (  ) is scheduled to announce its fourth quarter 2011 results on January 17, 2012 before market opens and we see limited estimate revisions at this point.Check Point delivered a decent third quarter, with earnings per share of 67 cents beating the Zacks Consensus Estimates by a penny. The quarter's results increased 13.6% from a year ago. Revenue saw a 12.8% year-over-year increase, aided by strong performances by the Product & Licenses as well as Software Updates, Maintenance and Services segments. However, the overall improvement was mainly aided by the growing demand for its security products.Check Point has earned a reputation among customers and analysts for providing simple, all-in-one security solutions that provide the highest level of protection to small and mid-sized businesses and remote/branch offices. Hence, we believe new product ramp up will better serve the growing demand for Check Point's security products.Management raised its full-year 2011 outlook and provided fourth quarter 2011 guidance. Top-line growth of 11.1% is expected for the fourth quarter and 13.3% for the full year (up from 12.7% previously). Regarding non-GAAP earnings per share, management expects 79-82 cents in the fourth quarter, representing a 10.5% growth at the midpoint, and $2.83-$2.86 for the full year, implying 14.7% growth (up from 13.1% previously).(Detailed earnings results can be viewed in the blog titled:  )Given the company's broader suite of offerings and its steadily growing annuity blade content, growing network security spending and continuous share gains, some analysts believe its projected growth rate should exceed the guidance. Also, the analysts are encouraged by the company's ongoing appliance upgrade adoption cycle and momentum on the software blade architecture front.The analysts are also confident about Check Point's market share gain versus tech giant  (  ) based on strong demand for its high-end (Power-1) and mid-range (UTM-1) appliances. The analysts are also optimistic about the improved enterprise information technology spending environment.Out of the 11 and 12 analysts providing estimates for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2011, respectively, none revised their estimates upward in the past 30 days. But there was only one downward revision for the fiscal 2011 and 2012 in the past 30 days. Despite the positive momentum, we think that the downward revision could be due to strained macroeconomic condition and ongoing debt problems in Europe, which could put a lid over IT spending budgets.There was no change to the Zacks Consensus Estimates for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2011 over the past 30 days. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2011 increased 2 cents to $2.69 over the past 90 days. The reason for the uptick could be the growing demand for Check Point's security products. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2012 grew a penny to $2.99 in the past 90 days.We remain encouraged by the steady traction of Software Blade architecture (security solution) that will likely lead to a solid fourth quarter. We believe this would result in considerable upside to the shares.In order to address the growing security needs of customers, attain operational excellence and expand market share, Check Point continues to invest in R&D. Apart from security, Check Point is also focusing on the mobile Internet and cloud computing space. According to the analysts, these strategic initiatives to expand its operational footprint from its core network firewall market to adjacent network security will not only enhance its market position, but will also provide the company with a competitive advantage over its peers Cisco Systems and  (  ). But these investments could rationalize its margin performance in the near term.However, competitive pressures and Check Point's significant European exposure are concerns.Currently, Check Point has a Zacks #4 Rank, implying a short-term Sell recommendation. ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis ReportThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Earnings Preview: Check Point - Analyst Blog@2012-01-16@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/earnings-preview%3A-check-point-analyst-blog-2012-01-16
 (  ) exited first quarter 2012 with flying colors. Adjusted earnings of 69 cents per share marginally surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 68 cents. The adjusted earnings per share exclude one-time items, but include stock-based compensation expense. Check Point witnessed strong network security product sales across all geographical regions.Shares closed at $60.76, down 5.14% from the previous day's price. Despite a modest beat, the share price deceleration indicates investors' unhappiness about a weak revenue and earnings guidance for the upcoming quarter. Investor sentiments were also hurt by the company's decision to leave the fiscal outlook unchanged.Check Point reported revenue of $313.1 million in the first quarter, up 11.3% from $281.3 million in the year-ago period. The quarter's result was at the higher end of company's guidance range of $305.0-$315.0 million and was roughly in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $313.0 million. The improvement can be attributed to a 4.7% year-over-year growth in Product and Licenses revenue. Moreover, Check Point witnessed a total 15.3% year-over-year growth in its Software Updates, Maintenance and Services revenues.Overall, revenue improvement was driven by the growing demand for Check Point's network security appliances and annuity software blades, as well as new product launches. The growth in demand was largely due to a general customer pattern of upgrading security levels. Management also reported strong performance regarding the number of large deals, which doubled from the year-ago quarter.Reported gross profit increased 3.7% year over year to $274.6 million. Gross margin increased 180 basis points from the year-ago quarter to 87.7%. Cost control measures led to improved margin expansion.Operating income came in at $172.9 million, up 22.3% year over year. Operating margin increased 500 basis points year over year to 55.2%. The improvement in operating results was driven by strong revenue growth that blew past the 1.6% rise in operating expenses. Cost control was also noticed with the year-over-year drop in R&D expenses.The quarter's GAAP net income was $143.6 million or 68 cents per share, up from $122.1 million or 57 cents in the comparable quarter last year. Excluding special items but including stock-based compensation expense, non-GAAP net income was $147.5 million or 69 cents a share compared with $130.2 million or 61 cents in the year-earlier quarter. Apart from cost control measures, strength in dollar value also supported the profit boost.Check Point exited the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $1.40 billion, up from $1.36 billion in the prior quarter. Trade receivables were $243.4 million. Cash flow from operations was $275.3 million, up from $173.2 million in the previous quarter. Capital expenditure increased to $2.42 million from $1.72 million in the prior quarter. During the quarter, Check Point repurchased 1.29 million shares for a total consideration of $75.0 million.Management sees revenue in a range of $324.0 million to $336.0 million, and earnings (excluding one-time items) in the range of 74 cents to 77 cents per share. For fiscal 2012, Check Point still expects revenue of $1.345-$1.395 billion and earnings per share ex-items of $3.10-$3.20. The Zacks Consensus Estimates for the second quarter and fiscal 2012 are pegged at 72 cents and $3.01, respectively. GAAP earnings per share would be 7 cents less than the non-GAAP figure.Check Point delivered an impressive first quarter, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate with respect to bottom line and matching with respect to top line. We think that investor sentiment will be in Check Point's favor as shareholders remain encouraged by its market share gains from the tech giant  (  ) and  (  ). Check Point continues to benefit from strength at the high end of the market, and increased demand for its blade solutions. Moreover, the company's continuous product launches are encouraging. Considering all these, we believe that the second quarter and fiscal guidance are quite conservative.However, limited margin expansion potential (over dependence on indirect sales model), an uncertain economic environment competitive pressures and Check Point's significant European exposure are concerns.Currently, Check Point has a Zacks #3 Rank, implying a short-term Hold recommendation. ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis ReportThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Product Demand Aids Check Point 1Q - Analyst Blog@2012-04-25@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/product-demand-aids-check-point-1q-analyst-blog-2012-04-25
"Around two months ago,  wrote about the prospects of cyber security firms amidst the ongoing onslaught of cyber-attacks from groups like “Anonymous."" The article concludes with a suggestion that cyber security firms might benefit from an increase in cyber defense spending by both private corporations and government organizations.Several new hacks and numerous arrests later, the outlook on the industry is more complicated than it seemed initially. In the past two weeks alone, the arrest of an eighteen year old “” hacker in the remote Shetland Islands and a  probe into a successful five-year, 70+ organization hacking operation, dubbed “Operation Shady RAT,” have exposed the serious flaws of the current cyber defense regime.One of the big hurdles for the cyber police and the justice system is the movement’s grassroots guise, in large part because many of those that have been apprehended have been idealistic youths.Although many of the hacks have been of large private corporations, like Sony and Citibank, the arrested culprits have often attempted to  on the grounds of political intentions and the individuals’ right to protest.Diplomacy could also be strained as American firms and government officials have hesitated to identify foreign government cyber espionage units, despite evidence in multiple hacking cases leading to  in China. Western governments might be hesitant to pursue any allegations against Chinese spies or  saboteurs because of outstanding rumors that Western governments have conducted their own cyber espionage programs, including a rumor that the  attack on an Iranian nuclear facility was the product of a joint American and Israeli operation.Two articles recently published by the Economist reveal the paradoxical state of the cyber security industry. posits that the recent arrests and attacks “suggest change is coming to computer security,” while the  technology column asserts that the real problem is the fact that “Firms, governments and other organisations remain complacent…”The latter point is corroborated by William Maclean’s analysis on , wherein he argues that many companies are still unwilling to report security breaches because of the surrounding stigma and resulting loss of faith in the integrity of a firm’s digital systems.As a matter of course, the cyber security industry will have to adapt in order to survive this unrelenting wave of cyber-attacks. Unfortunately, the largest security firms are stuck in the “Security 1.0” paradigm, which managed to secure “fixed devices” but has failed to protect the data that has proliferated on mobile devices and the cloud, according to Brent Bracelin of Pacific Crest Securities (via ).Instead, smaller firms, including start-ups, have been at the cutting edge of next-generation security, and have eaten into the worldwide market share of the top five providers, including Symantec and McAfee, report Dina Bass and Zachary Tracer of . These smaller companies could become takeover targets in the near future as the bigger firms seek to bolster their current technologies, add Bass and Tracer.To help you contextualize the ongoing evolution of this industry, here is a list of its biggest players.

e are initiating coverage on  (  ) with a Neutral recommendation and a target price of $56.00.Tel Aviv, Israel-based Check Point was founded in 1993 and entered the information technology (  ) security market with its breakthrough product, FireWall-1. The company also offers a comprehensive range of software and combined hardware and software products aimed at IT security.Check Point operates in different geographic regions including the Americas, Europe, Middle East and Africa, and Asia-Pacific. The company generates revenues from the sales of its network and data security products and related software updates, maintenance, support and other services.A broad portfolio of appliances has made Check Point the market leader in network security. Enterprises face continued threats to their financial well being, brands and reputation from sophisticated cyber attacks. Consequently, cyber-security is becoming a mission-critical, high-profile requirement. Check Point's rich experience in the security space and continuous delivery of mission-critical solutions has helped it to maintain and grow its market share.Check Point has supplemented its growth through strategic acquisitions. The latest acquisition was Israel-based GRC (Governance, Risk Management and Compliance) solution provider Dynasec Ltd. that strengthened its 3D Security portfolio. The acquisition was completed this month.Despite Check Point's growth prospects, there are some major concerns that could rationalize its market share. The market for Internet security solutions is intensely competitive, with well-capitalized players such as  (  ),  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ). Moreover, the entry of Sourcefire into the firewall market, which is now headed by Check Point, is another concern. Sourcefire will now give direct competition to Check Point, apart from another rival Fortinet.Overall, we remained impressed by Check Point's third quarter results, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate on the bottom line. We think that investor sentiment will be in Check Point's favor based on its market share gains against the tech giants Cisco Systems and Juniper Networks. Check Point continues to benefit from its strength at the high end of the market, and growing demand for its blade solutions. Moreover, we are encouraged by the company's continuous product launches. However, limited margin expansion scope (over dependence on indirect sales model), an uncertain economic environment and its European exposure are concerns.Currently, Check Point has a Zacks #3 Rank, implying a short-term Hold recommendation. ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis ReportThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Check Point Initiated at Neutral - Analyst Blog@2011-12-30@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/check-point-initiated-at-neutral-analyst-blog-2011-12-30
he bulls are coming back to Check Point Software Technologies, which has enjoyed one of the steadiest uptrends in the market.The maker of Internet-security systems began its rally even before the dust settled from the 2008 mortgage crisis. After an initial crash in October 2008, it made consistently higher lows while the S&P 500 continued to fall. It spent about two months in late 2009 pushing against a major long-term resistance level, and has been unstoppable ever since.CHKP hit a 10-year high of $61.46 last month, and then pulled back along with the rest of the market. Shares rose 4.39 percent to $53.05 yesterday as investors returned to the name.The options activity was skewed in favor of calls by a 10-to-1 ratio, which is highly bullish. There was heavy buying in the October 50 contracts for $4.60, the January 50s for $6.50 and the October 52.50s for $3.20. More than 2,000 traded in each.It's noteworthy that the investors went in the money. While the strategy costs more, it reflects a strong desire to own the stock. In-the-money calls provide greater leverage to the upside and will result in them buying shares at expiration even if CHKP doesn't rally.

isco's (  ) revenues from sales of network security products like Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) and firewalls have risen from an estimated $1.1 billion in 2005 to around $1.9 billion in 2009.Though Cisco is not as dominant in this area as the routers and switches business, it still commands a respectable 35-40% market share. Cisco's primary competitors like Juniper (  ), HP (  ), Check Point (  ) and McAfee (  ) are also seeing revenue growth, contributing to the overall growth of network security market.While we expect Cisco will continue with its gradual growth trend in network security sales, the Trefis member community predicts a slight decline. We currently have a  , about 24% above the current market price of $19.44.Cisco's revenues in network security products are tied to its network routers and switches business. Customers generally tend to buy an entire solution to meet their network infrastructure requirements, and Cisco has capitalized on its ability to deliver both - core network equipment and security products.The network security market slowed in 2009 mainly due to restricted spending by companies due to the recession but is now beginning to pick up. According to  , network security appliance and software revenue increased 7% worldwide between Q1 and Q2 2010, totaling $1.4 billion.The three top vendors saw firm sales growth in the most recent quarter: Juniper (+12%), Check Point (+9%) and Cisco (+8%). Cisco was held back in recent quarters by supply constraints on some of its components that are fixed now. This will allow it make up for lost ground vs. its competitors.The Trefis community forecasts that the network security revenues will increase from $1.8 billion in 2010 to $2 billion by 2016 while Trefis estimates an increase from $2.1 billion to $3.1 billion during the same period. The lower community forecast corresponds with a slight decrease in price estimate.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Cisco in the Thick of the Security Business@2010-11-19@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/cisco-thick-security-business-2010-11-19

heck Point Software has been climbing steadily for more than two years, and the bulls still like it.optionMONSTER's Heat Seeker tracking system detected a surge of call activity in the company, whose software and devices are used throughout the business world to manage data security. It's up more than 60 percent in the last 12 months, fueled by steady growth and widening profit margins.Two large trades accounted for most of the volume. One was a two-part strategy in the May 50 calls, which were bought for $4.10, and the July 52.50s, sold for $2.95. Volume was below open interest in May but not in July, indicating an existing short position was rolled forward by two months.It was likely the work of an investor who owns CHKP shares and had previously written the calls. Tuesday's adjustment to that position cost $1.15 up front, but will let him or her collect an additional $2.50 of upside in the stock.CHKP ended the session down 0.75 percent at $53.93. Rolling in-the-money calls lets investors earn income to their reduce capital at risk while limiting potential gains. Such strategies often appear with stocks in steady uptrends, such as chemical companies last month.The other trade was the outright purchase of 1,650 October 60 calls for $1.45, apparently a simple bullish bet. CHKP hasn't traded for $60 since the dot-com bubble was imploding in 2001.Overall option volume in the name was 8 times greater than average, with calls accounting for a bullish 92 percent of the activity.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Check Point Software call action surges@2011-05-18@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/check-point-software-call-action-surges-2011-05-18
