to live and work. For the last 25 years, we have worked to fulfill our vision of
making the Internet secure, reliable, and available for corporations and
consumers.
Early on, we pioneered the first commercially available firewall, followed by a
steady stream of industry-first cyber security solutions. As an example, our
technology provides protection against both known and unknown cyber security
threats across a wide range of environments: physical and virtual networks,
cloud and mobile surroundings, critical infrastructures, and the `Internet of
Things' (IoT). In November 2019, we acquired Cymplify to create a consolidated
security solution to harden and protect firmware of IoT devices. Check Point has
identified the evolving different generations of both cyber-attacks and security
products.&nbsp;&nbsp;... <a href=""http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/edgar_conv_html%2f2020%2f04%2f02%2f0001193125-20-095941.html#FIS_COMPANY_INFORMATION"" target=""_blank"">More</a> ...&nbsp;&nbsp;
