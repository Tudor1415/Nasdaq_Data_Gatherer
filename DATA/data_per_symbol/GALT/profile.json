Our drug candidates are based on our method of targeting galectin\r\nproteins, which are key mediators of biologic and pathologic functions. We use\r\nnaturally occurring, readily-available plant products as starting material in\r\nmanufacturing processes to create proprietary, patented complex carbohydrates\r\nwith specific molecular weights and other pharmaceutical properties. These\r\ncomplex carbohydrate molecules are appropriately formulated into acceptable\r\npharmaceutical formulations. Using these unique carbohydrate-based candidate\r\ncompounds that largely bind and inhibit galectin proteins, particularly\r\ngalectin-3, we are undertaking the focused pursuit of therapies for indications\r\nwhere galectins have a demonstrated role in the pathogenesis of a given disease.&nbsp;&nbsp;... <a href=\"http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/edgar_conv_html%2f2020%2f03%2f16%2f0001193125-20-073907.html#FIS_BUSINESS\" target=\"_blank\">More</a> ...&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n", "KeyExecutives": [{"name": "Adam E.
