(\"U.S. Energy\", the \"Company\", \"we\" or \"us\") is a Wyoming\r\ncorporation organized in 1966. We are an independent energy company focused on\r\nthe acquisition and development of oil and natural gas producing properties in\r\nthe continental United States. Our business activities are currently focused in\r\nSouth Texas and the Williston Basin in North Dakota.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe have historically explored for and produced oil and natural gas through a\r\nnon-operator business model. As a non-operator, we rely on our operating\r\npartners to propose, permit, drill, complete and produce oil and natural gas\r\nwells. Before a well is drilled, the operator provides all oil and natural gas\r\ninterest owners in the designated well the opportunity to participate in the\r\ndrilling and completion costs and revenues of the well on a pro-rata basis. Our\r\noperating partners also produce, transport, market and account for all oil and\r\nnatural gas production.&nbsp;&nbsp;... <a href=\"http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/edgar_conv_html%2f2020%2f03%2f30%2f0001493152-20-005194.html#FIS_BUSINESS\" target=\"_blank\">More</a> ...&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n", "KeyExecutives": [{"name": "Ryan L.
