Thousands of\r\ninformation gathering and/or power systems are deployed in the oceans today to\r\nincrease our understanding of weather, climate change, biological processes, and\r\nmarine mammal patterns as well as supporting exploration and operations for\r\nindustries such as oil and gas. Most of these systems are powered by battery,\r\nsolar, wind, fuel cell, or fossil fuel generators that may be unreliable and\r\nexpensive to operate while they also may be limited in their ability to deliver\r\nample electric power. These current systems often necessitate significant\r\ntradeoffs in sensor accuracy, data processing and communications bandwidth and\r\nfrequency in order to operate given limited available power. More persistent\r\npower systems requiring less maintenance, such as our products, may have the\r\nability to save costs over these current systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;... <a href=\"http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/edgar_conv_html%2f2019%2f07%2f22%2f0001493152-19-010930.html#FIS_BUSINESS\" target=\"_blank\">More</a> ...&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n", "KeyExecutives": [{"name": "George H.
