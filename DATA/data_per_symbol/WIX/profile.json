In April 2008, we\r\nlaunched our Wix Editor, which enabled the creation of a digital presence in\r\nFlash format, and in October 2008, we launched our premium subscription\r\noffering. By April 2012, a month after we released our advanced HTML5 Editor,\r\nwhich greatly improved our service offering and support for mobile devices, we\r\nhad reached 20 million registered users. In October 2013, we launched a further\r\nenhanced mobile product. In October 2015, we launched our new redesigned Wix\r\nEditor, which is based on a complete restructuring of the platform's codebase,\r\ndeveloped using Facebook's React Technology. This newly designed editor offers a\r\nsignificantly leaner codebase, better modularization and improved testability.\r\nIn 2016, we launched Wix Artificial Design Intelligence, or Wix ADI.\r\n", "KeyExecutives": [{"name": "Avishai Abrahami", "title": "Honorary Chairman & Chief Executive Officer"}, {"name": "Menashe Lior Shemesh", "title": "Chief Financial Officer"}, {"name": "Nir Zohar", "title": "President & Chief Operating Officer"}, {"name": "Yaniv Even-Haim", "title": "Vice President-Research & Development"}], "Number_of_employees": ["3,000"], "Subsidiaries": []}
