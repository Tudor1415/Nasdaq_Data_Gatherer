Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''.  These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand.  Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).  Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

The United States is in the midst of a historic energy transition away from fossil fuels to low- and zero-carbon electric power. In 2020 alone, the nation could add 20,400 megawatts of onshore wind capacity and 12,700 megawatts of utility-scale solar capacity, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). That would be a record volume of additions (assuming the coronavirus pandemic doesn't delay construction timelines), but it creates one significant challenge for future renewable energy growth: transmission capacity. It's often overlooked in the discussion of , but transmission is one of the largest sources of planned capital investment for many power generators through 2035. Considering transmission is accounting for an increasing share of revenue and earnings growth for many electric utilities, it's something investors need to begin paying closer attention to.Image source: Getty Images.Unlike thermal power plants, the location of . That can create challenges when assets are erected in rural areas far away from roads, major population centers, and existing power lines. Unfortunately, much of the country's best geography for wind and solar power production is located in areas that historically haven't been an integral part of the nation's grid infrastructure.That has created local and regional problems in clean energy distribution. Take Texas as an illustrative example. The state is home to over 29,000 megawatts of onshore wind power capacity, which represents 27% of the total in the United States and is more than all but four countries. By 2010, Texas had installed more than 14,000 megawatts of wind power capacity. Half of that came online from 2006 to 2009 and was primarily located in West Texas, which lacked adequate transmission lines at the time to transport electricity to the state's population centers to the east. That led to some wonky market dynamics. In the first half of 2011, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) -- the regional grid operator -- was routinely curtailing 2,000 megawatts of wind power per hour. Electricity prices averaged  $10 per megawatt-hour during that span. By 2014, Texas installed more than 3,500 miles of new transmission lines to ease congestion and reduce curtailments in the ERCOT system. In fact, the new transmission lines in the state helped to raise the national average utilization rate for wind power from less than 30% in 2010 (reflecting curtailments) to 34% in 2014. That might be an extreme example -- or not. Similar congestion and curtailment challenges have cropped up in California and the Midwest in recent years as the build out of new wind and solar power capacity infrastructure outpaces transmission capacity. With a record 33,000 megawatts of utility-scale renewables slated to begin operations in 2020, investors might expect more curtailments in the near future. Luckily, the industry has big plans to install tens of thousands of miles of new transmission in the coming years and invest heavily in another under-the-radar technology.Image source: Getty Images.An electric utility generates revenue and earnings from its rate base, which is the total value of generation, transmission, and distribution assets. Each type of infrastructure has a unique regulatory mechanism to recover invested capital. When a company invests to maintain or upgrade its infrastructure, then it can earn a rate increase (meaning the prices charged to customers) from state regulators. A larger rate base is generally more valuable. That's important because transmission assets are likely to become the largest part of the rate base for many companies in the near future.   expects its rate base to grow from $30 billion in 2019 to $42 billion in 2024. Transmission assets will grow from 25% to 27% of that total, which suggests the total value of transmission assets will grow 51% in that five-year span. The roughly $4 billion capital investment in transmission infrastructure through 2024 will be dwarfed by the next major build out. Xcel Energy estimates it could invest $15 billion to $20 billion in transmission assets from 2025 to 2035. The plan would enable more renewable energy assets to be built in the regions in which its four electric utilities operate and replace aging and less efficient assets. In fact, Xcel Energy's transmission build out is one of four strategic priorities through 2035. The other three receive more attention among investors, such as , deploying energy storage technologies, and preparing for electric vehicle growth. Xcel Energy can justify up to $15 billion of capital investment in transmission infrastructure because it operates in the American wind corridor and sun-soaked West, which has plenty of untapped potential for new renewable energy assets. Transmission will be important to companies in other geographies, but there are other ways to address congestion and curtailment challenges. Image source: Getty Images.  operates primarily in New England. The region has less favorable renewable energy potential compared to other parts of the country, lacks pipelines for natural gas, barely relies on coal-fired power plants, and has several nuclear retirements scheduled. If any region requires a retooling of transmission infrastructure relative to population density, then New England is a good bet. The company has responded with $9.3 billion in capital investment in transmission infrastructure from 2001 to 2018. That has driven transmission-related earnings from just $28 million in 2004 to $427 million in 2018. That was roughly 41% of total earnings in that year. The business has another trick up its sleeve: . Closely tied to updating transmission infrastructure, energy efficiency has allowed many power generators across the country to retire coal-fired power plants without needing to replace them with additional power assets. Eversource currently spends 5% to 7% of total revenue on energy efficiency alone -- easily the most in the nation. That has earned the company and its subsidiaries several accolades, including most energy efficient utility in the United States (Eversource Massachusetts) and top energy efficiency provider in the United States (overall company average). The investments in transmission infrastructure and energy efficiency have fortuitously positioned Eversource to capture a major opportunity somewhat unique to New England: . Today, the United States operates only 30 megawatts of offshore wind capacity, but an opening of permits and new partnerships has pushed the country's current project pipeline to over 23,000 megawatts. Much of that could be built by 2030.Although more expensive to build, offshore wind power has a handful of advantages. It can operate at a relatively high utilization rate (matching or besting fossil fuel plants), can be positioned close to major population centers (many cities are on located on coasts, including on the Great Lakes or major seas), and doesn't displace land from other uses (fishing aside). Eversource is forging ahead with up to 4,000 megawatts of offshore wind power projects. Image source: Getty Images.While the United States has some of the best geography for wind and solar power on the planet, power generators and electric utilities can't just throw up some wind turbines and start raking in money. Adequate transmission and distribution infrastructure needs to be in place, but that often lags behind the initial build out of generation infrastructure.Luckily, even though it may not be on the radar of many investors, companies such as Xcel Energy and Eversource are taking the challenge seriously. The pair have committed tens of billions of dollars in capital investment in transmission infrastructure for the regions in which they operate. Many of their peers have or will soon follow. Simply put, as renewable energy power capacity grows by record volumes in the 2020s, investors will need to begin paying closer attention to transmission infrastructure. Without it, wind and solar farms might be significantly less valuable. When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The world was a radically different place in 1880. The United States was only 15 years removed from the Civil War. The professional baseball organization known as the National League, which survives to this day as half of Major League Baseball, had existed for only four years. Light bulbs were used outside for the first time. The first patent was issued for a cash register. It was also the last time energy consumption from renewable energy topped coal, according to historical data compiled by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Well, that was until 2019, when the United States accomplished the feat again. Due to various market factors, the country will never again consume more energy from coal than renewables. Here's how the United States achieved the energy milestone, why there's no turning back, and what it means for individual investors.Image source: Getty Images.The last time the United States consumed more energy from renewable energy than coal was around 1880. To that point, biomass (primarily wood) was the primary energy source for the nation. But that changed as the first coal-fired power plants began producing electricity in the 1880s. While the first hydroelectric dams also entered operations that decade, coal proved much more scalable and distributable. By 1885, coal generated more total energy than renewable energy (still comprising only wood in that year) and held onto the edge for roughly 139 years. That all changed in 2019, although a healthy dose of nuance is needed. Energy consumption from renewable energy topped coal last year, but  when all energy sources are counted. In other words, the math only works when electricity production, transportation, and consumption from industrial, residential, and commercial markets are combined. Similarly, renewable energy is a broad category that includes wind, solar, hydro, biofuels, other biomass, and several smaller contributors.In 2019, energy consumption from renewable energy totaled 11.5 quadrillion British thermal units, or quads, according to the EIA. Coal was used to generate only 11.3 quads of energy last year. But the  in the electric power sector means there's no going back. A combination of mild winter weather, natural gas prices that are at the lowest levels since 1995, the addition of nearly 33,000 megawatts of utility-scale wind and solar power, and the consumption-sapping effects of the coronavirus pandemic will combine to deliver a record blow to coal and a record bump to renewables in 2020.In 2019, the United States generated 966 terawatt-hours of electricity from coal-fired power plants and 720 terawatt-hours from all utility-scale renewable energy power sources. That was the lowest output from the nation's coal fleet since the 1970s and the highest ever for renewables.In 2020, the United States might only generate 627 terawatt-hours to 724 terawatt-hours of electricity from coal (a 25% to 35% decline from the previous year), compared to 792 terawatt-hours from renewable energy sources (a 10% increase from the previous year). Adding small-scale solar bumps up the latter number to a projected output of 832 terawatt-hours, which would surpass the annual output from nuclear power for the first time since the 1980s. Image source: Getty Images.The rapid growth of renewable energy is quite the feat. It was made possible by significant government policies, better wind turbine and photovoltaic panel technologies, and bountiful . The value extended to renewable energy sources from the combination of those factors will likely compound in the next decade, which suggests natural gas-fired power plants could be the next assets to feel economic pressure from renewables starting in the 2030s. But individual investors don't have to sit out the next decade to benefit from the trend. Here are some investment ideas that contributed to renewable energy's toppling of coal in 2019. Investors should absolutely stay away from coal stocks. Coal-fired power plants are unlikely to regain much, if any, market share lost in 2020 due to factors described above. Investors can expect a wave of  in the coming years as power generators chase the enhanced economics from cleaner power sources. If your portfolio is exposed to companies such as coal-heavy  that are , then that could be putting your capital at risk. Aside from the electric power sector, renewable transportation fuels are the second-largest source of renewable energy in the United States. The country mandates 10% ethanol blends in the gasoline supply and relies heavily on biodiesel and renewable diesel each year.Unlike electric power, biofuels have generally been a poor investment for individual investors. For instance,   can produce 1.1 billion gallons of ethanol each year, but has struggled to overcome the weak margin environment of the industry. Ethanol prices in 2020 could be the lowest of the century. Green Plains has ambitious plans to increase operating efficiency and sell . If the strategy works, then the  could lift off multiyear lows for good. But it's still too early to gauge progress.Meanwhile,   has been a rare biofuels stock with . But it, too, faces headwinds. It's not profitable without generous government subsidies, although those are now in place through the end of 2022 for biomass-based diesel fuels. If the business can invest its cash hoard into high-value renewable diesel and retail sales, then it might be on sustainable footing in a few years. Image source: Getty Images. The EIA estimates the United States could add up to 20,400 megawatts of onshore wind power capacity in 2020. That could be affected by the coronavirus pandemic, but as of early May many power generators reported being on track with projects slated for completion this year.  is leading the way. The company, which owns four electric utilities in the American wind corridor, is bringing 1,692 megawatts of new wind power projects into service in 2020. It recently placed the 200-megawatt Blazing Star 1 project into operation, has another 300 megawatts slated for completion in 2021, and expects to have over 4,300 megawatts of owned wind capacity in service when the dust settles.  The EIA estimates the United States could add up to 12,700 megawatts of utility-scale solar power capacity in 2020.   is one of the companies leading the way. Through its Florida Power & Light subsidiary, the company plans to build 10,000 megawatts of solar power by 2030. That includes 1,200 megawatts that have or will enter service in 2020. The low operation costs of solar farms are expected to allow the electric utility to keep customer bills low and shareholder value trekking higher. The United States consumed more total energy from renewable energy than coal in 2019 for the first time in about 139 years. That's an impressive feat, but the trend is still getting started.Renewable energy accounted for only 11% of the nation's total energy consumption last year. There are major growth opportunities in stealing the rest of coal's market share (which would double total renewable energy consumption) in the 2020s, beginning to pressure natural gas in the 2030s, and powering cars and trucks as the transportation sector moves toward electric mobility. That suggests individual investors have many more opportunities to pounce on the energy transition -- and certainly won't have to wait another 139 years for the next big milestone.

"Investors in Xcel Energy Inc (Symbol: XEL) saw new options begin trading this week, for the July 17th expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the XEL options chain for the new July 17th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $50.00 strike price has a current bid of 95 cents.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $50.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $49.05 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of XEL, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $57.16/share today.

Because the $50.00 strike represents an approximate 13% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 82%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.90% return on the cash commitment, or 11.01% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.


Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Xcel Energy Inc, and highlighting in green where the $50.00 strike is located relative to that history:


   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $60.00 strike price has a current bid of 80 cents.  If an investor was to purchase shares of XEL stock at the current price level of $57.16/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $60.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 6.37% if the stock gets called away at the July 17th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if XEL shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Xcel Energy Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing XEL's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $60.00 strike highlighted in red:



   
Considering the fact that the $60.00 strike represents an approximate 5% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 60%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.40% boost of extra return to the investor, or 8.11% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.


The implied volatility in the put contract example is 44%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 47%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $57.16) to be 38%.

"Image source: The Motley Fool. Q1 2020 , Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Xcel Energy First Quarter 2020 Earning Conference call. Questions will only be taken from institutional investors. Reporters can contact Media Relations for inquiries and individual investors and others can reach out to Investor Relations. Thank you. Today's conference is being recorded.At this time, I will turn the conference over to Paul Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. -- Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2020 first quarter . Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Bob Frenzel, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Brian Van Abel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This morning, we will review our 2020 first quarter results, share business developments and regulatory developments, discuss how we're managing through uncertainty around coronavirus. There is an expanded list of slides today that accompany our call on our website.As a reminder, some of the comments during today's conference call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are designated in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC. On today's call, we will discuss certain metrics that are non-GAAP measures, including ongoing earnings in electric and natural gas margins. Information on the comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations are included in our earnings release.I'll now turn the call over to Ben. -- Well, thank you Paul, and good morning, everyone. As I report back on the past few months, my heart really goes out to the individuals and families impacted by the coronavirus, the devoted healthcare professionals so bravely serving our communities and the businesses across all sectors experiencing tremendous economic challenges. At Xcel Energy, we understand how critical our work is to the health and safety of our communities and local businesses. I'm so pleased with how our employees and industry have responded during this unprecedented time, working to keep people safe, delivering reliable service to customers and providing support to those in need as we've done for over 100 years. I also want to thank our employees for their dedication, spirits and creativity and find ways to support our communities and stimulate local economic growth.Now turning to the quarter. We've gotten off to a solid start booking $0.56 per share for the first quarter of 2020 compared with $0.61 per share last year. We believe we can take actions that will allow us to weather the impact of COVID-19 and as a result, we are reaffirming our 2020 guidance. Brian will discuss the financial results in more detail.At Xcel Energy, we're taking significant strides to help our customers and protect our employees, while continuing to deliver critical energy services. Some of our actions include; we're committing to not disconnecting residential customer service and arranging payment plans that they are having difficulty in paying those. In Minnesota, we are proposing to reduce our approved fuel forecast by $25 million to give immediate relief to our customers. We stepped up our charitable giving and are helping our communities during this time of need and we are working closely with our regulators and state and local leadership, identifying constructive solutions to support our communities and customers. We're keeping our employees safe by implementing work from home policies, providing personal protection equipment and following CDC social distancing guidelines and enhancing cleaning practices, conducting temperature checks at critical facilities, segregating crews and staggering work times.To ensure continued reliability, we've implemented business continuity plans, which allows us to prioritize work and are prepared to sequester critical employees on-site if necessary. From a financial standpoint, we've enhanced our liquidity and developed contingency plans to mitigate the impact of COVID-19. Finally, we expect to be part of the solution to help get the economy back on its feet by continuing to invest in our communities through our capital expenditure programs that create jobs and drive demand for equipment and supply. While this is a fluid situation with considerable uncertainty, Xcel Energy has always shown a remarkable dedication to serving our customers during difficult times and this set of challenges is no exception.Moving on to business development, we recently announced the opportunistic sale of the Mankato natural gas plant for $680 million. If you recall, we originally proposed this acquisition as a fully regulated asset. However, when the Minnesota Commission rejected this proposal, we acquired Mankato as a non-regulated asset and stepped into the power purchase agreement. While we thought Mankato would provide significant long-term value, especially as we shutdown coal assets, we heard from several investors that having a non-regulated asset cloud at Xcel Energy story. As a result, several potential buyers express interest in acquiring the plant, we decided to sell it and preserve our status as one of the very few fully regulated pure play utility. And since the earnings were back-end loaded, we don't expect to materially impact our projections. And while it was not part of the rationale for the sale, the transaction will improve our liquidity in these uncertain times. We will use the proceeds to reduce funding needs and improve our credit metrics. In addition, we will book a gain, which we will use to fund charitable giving efforts, including supporting COVID-19 relief efforts throughout our communities.Finally, we recently announced some important promotions as part of our succession planning. Bob Frenzel was named President and Chief Operating Officer and Brian Van Abel was named Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Bob has been our CFO for the past four years and has extensive experience in the industry prior to joining Xcel Energy. While Brian has that increasing roles in finance, including Treasurer, Financial Planning and Analysis and Corporate Development. Both Bob and Brian are extremely intelligent and talented employees who have been instrumental in developing and executing our strategy and delivering our consistently strong financial results. And while I don't plan to retire anytime soon, these promotions reflect the deep bench strength and thoughtful plan we have at Xcel Energy.So with that, let me turn the call over to Brian, who will provide more detail on our financial results and outlook, along with our actions to mitigate coronavirus impacts. Brian? -- Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. We achieved solid results, recording $0.56 per share for the first quarter of 2020 compared to $0.61 per share last year. Majority of the quarterly deviation is driven by weather. We experienced warmer than normal winter weather this year compared with cooler than normal weather last year, which results in a $0.04 per share unfavorable comparison.The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter include, lower O&M expenses increased earnings by $0.03 per share, our lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.03 per share. However, majority of the lower ETR is due to an increase in production tax credits, which flow back to customers through electric margin and tax reform impacts, both of which are largely earnings neutral. Offsetting these positive drivers were lower margins due largely to unfavorable weather, which reduced earnings by $0.03 per share and which offsets riders and regulatory outcomes. Increased depreciation and interest expense reflecting our capital investment program reduced earnings by $0.05 per share and other items combined decreased earnings by $0.03 per share.Next, I wanted to discuss the potential impact of COVID-19 and the actions we're taking to mitigate a range of outcomes. Starting with sales, our first quarter weather and leap year adjusted electric sales declined by 1.1%. Our natural gas sales increased by 0.4%. The coronavirus crisis had a minor impact on first quarter sales. The economic shutdown started in mid-March, so we did not experience the full monthly impact. For March, our total residential sales increased slightly while C&I sales declined 4%, resulting in a total retail electric sales decline of 3% on a weather-adjusted basis. However, a better reference point on the monthly COVID-19 impact is what we saw in our preliminary April numbers and which almost all of our states were under relatively strict shelter-in-place orders.Residential sales increased 3.2%, while C&I sales declined 13.7% and total retail electric sales declined 9.6% on a weather-adjusted basis. And keep in mind, we have a sales true-up mechanism for all electric classes in Minnesota and decoupling for the electric residential and non-demand small C&I classes in Colorado. This covers about 45% of our total retail electric sales.And to help us prepare financially for the pandemic, we developed three sales scenarios as outlined in our presentation. The mild scenario assumed a severe impact through May followed by a relatively quick recovery in the third quarter. This results in a sales decline of approximately 2% compared to 2019. Our base case and the case in which we are reaffirming our earnings guidance around assumes a severe impact through the second quarter with the slower U type shape recovery with lingering effects for the rest of 2020. This results in the sales decline of approximately 4% on a year-over-year basis. And lastly, the severe scenario assumes a severe impact last through the third quarter followed by a protracted L type shape recovery. This is a challenging scenario with the deeper and longer bottom in our base case resulting in a sales decline of approximately 8% for the year.We use these scenarios as we develop our contingency plans. We view the mild and severe case scenarios is having a low probability of occurring. We think the base case scenario is the most likely outcome or at least within the [Indecipherable] sales impact we've outlined, we have incorporated a base case into our guidance assumptions. There is considerable uncertainty on what will actually occur, purchase in the duration of the downturn where lingering effects [Technical Issues] feel confident in our ability to mitigate what we view as the most likely scenario. And the April sales results came in slightly better than our forecast giving us greater confidence.We're also closely monitoring our bad debt expense and working with our customers on payment plans, they are having difficulty paying their bills difficult to project. While it is difficult to project [Indecipherable], bad debt expense increased approximately $20 million in the 2008 to 2009 time period as a reference point. Additionally, our commission to Wisconsin, Texas and Michigan have issued orders to tracking deferral pandemic-related expenses. We've also filed for deferred accounting treatment of incremental COVID-19 related expenses, including bad debt in Minnesota, Colorado, New Mexico, North Dakota and South Dakota.We are implementing contingency plans to reduce our overall cost structure and mitigate the impacts of COVID-19. Some of these actions include cost reductions related employee expenses, consulting, variable compensation, deferral of certain work activities and the implementation of a hiring freeze. Based on our contingency plans, we now expect annual O&M expenses will decline 4% to 5% in 2020, which will offset the impacts of COVID-19 in the base scenario. We also have plans in place to ensure that we can implement additional contingency plans with the negative impact of COVID-19 exceed our base case scenario. However, there are limitations to what we can offset. We will focus on providing strong customer service and reliability and we will not make short term decisions that have a negative long-term impact on our customers and shareholders.Turning to supply chain, the situation is fluid, but we have not had any material impact to our supply chain with the exception of our wind farms. In mid-April, we were of supply chain disruptions, which will likely result in delays in the completion of two of our wind farms into 2021. We are monitoring the situation closely and are striving to complete the project this year. However, we have fully documented our activities since 2016 and have maintained continuous efforts since then. So we are confident these wind farms will qualify for a 100% PTC benefit even if they are completed in 2021.And the last topic I want to cover on COVID-19 is liquidity. We are in a very strong position after enhancing liquidity in March by entering into a $700 million term loan with attractive terms and we issued a $600 million 10-year holding company bond. We now have available liquidity of approximately $3.1 billion. In addition, the sales proceeds from the Mankato plant will increase liquidity by approximately $650 million. And finally, we issued an equity forward last year, which we expect to settle later this year and will provide another, approximately $740 million in cash. In total, this will provide liquidity of nearly $4.5 billion. We also plan to issue $1.9 billion of operating company debt throughout the year. As a result of our enhanced liquidity, we have the flexibility on issuance timing to ensure the capital markets are accessible at attractive terms. For more detail on liquidity, please see our earnings release.Next, let me provide a quick regulatory update. We have three rate cases pending and the coronavirus has not resulted in any material delays in regulatory proceedings. In New Mexico, we reached a constructive unanimous settlement that reflects a rate increase of approximately $31 million, ROE of 9.45% and equity ratio of 54.8% and acceleration of depreciation on the Tolk coal plant to reflect an earlier retirement. We're awaiting a hearing examiner recommendation and commission decision. In Texas, SPS and intervening parties have reached an unopposed constructive settlement agreement in principle. We are working with parties to document and file the settlement, which we expect to occur shortly and we anticipate a commission decision in the third quarter.In February 2020, we filed a natural gas case is Colorado, seeking a net rate increase of $127 million based on a ROE of 9.95% and an equity ratio of 55.8%. This is fairly early in the process, so there is not much to report, but the procedural schedule has been set with new rates expected to become effective in November based on statutory requirements.In terms of earnings, there is considerable uncertainty around the coronavirus impacts. Therefore, we have implemented contingency plans to manage our cost structure and made regulatory filings that will help to offset the impact of COVID-19. As a result, we still expect to deliver 2020 earnings within our original guidance range of $2.73 to $2.83 per share based on our base case scenario, which we think is the most likely scenario. In addition, we can implement additional O&M contingency plans if the COVID-19 impacts exceed the base case. However, there are limitations to what we can offset as we balance the short-term and long-term for both our customers and investors. Our contingency plan did not offset the severe scenario, which would likely result in earnings below our guidance range, but we feel the severe scenario has a low probability of occurring.With that, I will wrap-up. We have implemented steps to mitigate the impact of COVID-19. We sold the Mankato facility for a modest gain. We increased our dividend to 6.2%. We reached constructive rate case settlements in the Mexico and Texas. We remain committed to delivering on our 2020 guidance in our long-term earnings and dividend growth within our 5% to 7% objective range. We continue to provide reliable energy service to our customers while ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees and communities.Despite the near-term economic challenges, we are executing our strategy extremely well and we remain positive about the opportunities in front of us for the benefit our customers, communities and shareholders. And finally, we believe we can help rejuvenate our local economies and work with our regulators and state leadership to help our communities and customers recover from the crisis. We're looking forward to being part of the solution.This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions.Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. -- Hey, good morning. I hope you all are doing well. -- Thank you. You too. -- Good morning. -- I wanted to just get an update at a high level in terms of the opportunity for additional PPA buyout, just -- what are you seeing in terms of the opportunity, or is that sort of a little bit on pause just given the COVID-19 dynamics? I'm just curious, at a high level, what your views are on that opportunity? -- Great question, Stephen, because we're all focused on COVID-19, but we're still running a business and still looking for opportunities. Brian, do you want to give a little more detail? -- Yeah, good question. So as we think about it, now we are in regular contact with our counterparties. Obviously, there could be potential here as you see what's happening, if any of them have an interest of selling, we're certainly in regular contact. We have our proceeding of the Mankato acquisition in front of commission and we hopefully see a decision that in Q2 or Q3. But then we're also looking at how the ERP and our IRP processing to help jump-start some of that too. Now some of the discussions around our acquisitions in Minnesota, as you know, how can we be better improve the process with the department, our stakeholders to ensure that we're bringing forward and have a comprehensive discussion. So we're certainly active on that stage. And we've talked about how it continues to be part of our plan, but we don't include any of that in our base capital plan. -- Understood. And just maybe at a high level, in terms of resource planning, how do you think about the opportunity for further acceleration of renewables. I guess on the positive side, renewable cost keep dropping, we may -- there is always a potential for tax credits to get extended, the wind credit got extended again last year. On the negative side, I guess, we have demand uncertainty from COVID. In Texas, we had uncertainty around the status of the energy sector overall. But how do you think about the potential for additional sort of renewables growth, additional shutdowns of some of your coal assets? Do you feel about the same as you felt before or the reasons to be more bullish or more cautious? How would you think about that? -- Probably, I guess, the short answer is probably a little more bullish. The cost, as you mentioned, Stephen, continue to come down and so our steel for fuel strategy continues to be, I think, obviously, economically attractive. And I think the test of that was the ability to get our renewables improved in Texas and New Mexico and basically on economic terms. I think the other element too, Stephen, which makes me bullish is that -- and this is where I think we can partner with our states and our commissions and state administrations to be part of the solution, we're getting people back to work and that's potentially accelerating some of our capital opportunities. And using that to bring on more renewables at a great price point that actually help save customers money and employees jobs, good jobs. So, not unlike what -- when we had the great recession and I can you tell you many times that'll have -- people [Indecipherable], people are typically work in our labor unions and actually thank myself and really the company for continuing to go forward with projects, because that was the only job in town. And that's something that we're really proud of. And I think we can replicate that again. -- That's helpful. I'll pass it on. Thank you. -- Thank you.We'll take our next question from David Peters with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. -- Yeah. Hey, good morning. guys. -- Good morning. -- I was wondering if you could just give a view of where you guys see yourself within your guidance range during this base scenario? -- Did you say where we are in the guidance range? -- Yeah. -- Let me just -- I guess I would say, take a look at our track record over the last 15 years, I think we've demonstrated that we can deliver within the earnings guidance range, typically that's been at the middle or above. So we're quite proud of that and we expect we'll be able to do that this year. But if you look at what we've done in the past and our track record, on the first quarter earnings call, we don't give any additional guidance whether it'd be the bottom or top or whatever. So for the first quarter, we're confident under the base case scenario it will be in the earnings guidance range and if the months and quarters have roll-on as we've done in the past, we'll potentially get more color on it. -- Okay. And then just on the preliminary sales data for April, give a sense of which states are seeing more weakness than others just the understanding that you have [Indecipherable] some protection to Colorado as well? -- David, is the question about the states were affected? What is the divergence in the states for April, is that basically you're asking? You are kind of breaking up on the line. -- Yeah. That's right. -- Yeah, I'm happy to provide a little bit of color on that. I think, as we look at it, we saw the most resiliency on the C&I side in SPS, and probably the biggest impact on the C&I side in Minnesota and Wisconsin and in the Northern territories. So I think that's [Indecipherable] something we'll watch it as we go over-time. A part of what we saw in Minnesota is we did have a combined heat and power plant, as we've talked about in our call before, go online in May of last year. So that's part of what we see and we look at month-over-month. But overall, in our commentary, you know, greatest weakness in C&I side in Minnesota and Wisconsin and less so in SPS in Colorado is roughly in the middle of those two. -- Okay. And then last question I had is just -- I think, you said the equity forward you expect to settle around year-end. But just on the Mankato sale, does that impact the equity plans at all either for this year or next, just kind of what you guys laid out last year? -- No, it doesn't, we'll say no. We will use it for this our financing cost for this year. We don't expect to not sell our equity forward. This year, we do plan to sell it. What Mankato does is, regularly it's an infusion of cash of $650 million, provide some additional headroom on capital investment if we have an opportunity to potentially accelerate investments and really help our communities and customers and the regulators accelerate some of this rebound from this crisis. So I think it gives us just an additional capital headroom. As we think about longer term, we think about our five-year plans, we will reevaluate that in overall financing plans as we get to Q3 and lay out a new five-year capital plan. -- Great. And actually the final question is the two renewable projects that you mentioned that could slip in '21, which ones were that? -- Those are the two Minnesota farms that we're looking at. But I would say we've done as you would expect from us, right. They're going to be very conservative approach and then make sure we've got all the documentation since 2016 and we've maintained continuous efforts since then. So we're highly confident even if they do slip a month or two into 2021, that will qualify for homes [Phonetic] and PTCs. -- Great. Thanks, guys. Take care. -- Other questions? -- Operator, can you advance to next question please? I know we have some people on the queue, so maybe we're having some technical difficulties or somebody on mute for us. Bear with us. Meanwhile, Paul Johnson will sing a song. -- If you can hear me, you will be thankful that I won't do that.I apologize for the delay. We'll take our next question from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. -- Hi Jeremy. -- Hi, good morning. Thanks very much. -- Good morning. -- Thanks for having me. Thanks for all the color this morning, really helpful. Just wanted to start off, I guess, do you have any regulatory obligation for guarantees associated with the wind that could impact earnings because of the project delay into '21. Here I just want to touch basically on that point. -- Can you take that one too Brian? -- Yeah, no, I mean, in terms of -- we have no obligations in terms of getting in service in 2020 and we're certainly working toward that and that's our goal to get them completed in 2020. But in terms of obligations, in terms of timing, we don't. There are obligations in terms of an overall cost-cap. But we're certainly working to mitigate any impacts on that as you start to see a delay in schedule. We're certainly working with our suppliers in our -- plant contractors get those to ensure that we bring them under the original order PUC cost-cap. -- Yeah. So we're pretty comfortable with that, Jeremy. -- In addition to the SPS wind projects, do you have a 100% PTC guarantee, but again, we think that those will get into construction by the end of the year and we're very confident on 100% PTC. -- That's great to hear. Thanks. And just a cleanup question. Slide 17, it seems like AFUDC equity ticked up a bit there. Just wondering if you pay back. Give a little bit more color on that. -- Yeah. From our original guidance, it did as you start to see some delays in some project and part of that was our Blazing Star 1 wind farm that we just put in service in April. As we are in the winter time it took a little bit longer, so that's part of it. So just kind of across the board as you see part of it wind farms and part of it some other investments that we're making. And there's also a little bit higher as we took steps to improve our liquidity, also a little bit higher AFUDC rates. -- Got it. That's helpful. That's it from me. Thanks.We'll take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead. -- This is Alex Morgan calling in for Julien. Good morning. Can you hear me? -- We can Alex. How you're doing? -- Yes, good morning. -- I'm doing well. How are you? Thanks so much for taking my question. -- Well, if we were to know it is you, of course we will answer your questions. -- Thank you. My first question is about your rate case filings that you have for this year. I was wondering if you have any updates on whether or not you could potentially push out Minnesota again or potentially push out Colorado and maybe how you're thinking about using existing trackers to track that rate base instead. -- Hey, Alex, good morning. It's Bob. Thanks for the question. We recognize that these are challenging times, and we do like to work with our regulators in advance in both Colorado and Minnesota. We have been investing in infrastructure and assets that our customers value in our regulated support. But like in the past, we do think there are mechanisms that will allow us to not file those rate cases and you can be assured that those conversations are happening with the staff and the commissions as applicable in the respective states. We'd like to not file those cases and we'll probably have more information for you on the second quarter call later this year. -- Okay. Thank you. Understandable. My second question and my last question, it's just about your CAGR over-time. I was wondering if you're still anticipating the potential in the upper end of that long-term guidance. And thank you again. -- Yeah. I think it's a great question. Again, and I talk a little bit about it with an earlier question, but you look at what drives our 5% to 7% growth and it's investing in projects and opportunities that are very much aligned with our states, our communities, our regulators, our legislators. So I don't see that changing and I don't see changes to our capital -- capex forecast unless to the upside going forward. So that's what drives our growth and that's what we'll get it from. You had mentioned two -- we don't have -- -- Thank you so much. -- I think we have -- one of the things I think we've done as a company is on sunny days prepare for the storming days and we've got great dry powder on our balance sheet. And Brian mentioned the other things we did. We also continue to invest in our system, keeping it strong and reliable. And so that allows you to weather situations like that and potentially come back stronger and a partner with our state as we look to jump-start the economy when we all get through this. -- Thank you very much. -- Thank you.We'll take our next question from Travis Miller with Morningstar. Please go ahead. -- Good morning. -- Hi, good morning, Travis. -- Good morning. Thank you. And the question on the contingency plans. I think you might have entered this real quickly. But on the O&M side, how much of these contingency plans have you been able to accomplish so far when we're talking about first in the four, five months of the year. And then, any change in the capex plan within those contingency plans? I think you just answered, no. But just want to clarify, the O&M side and then the capex side. -- Yeah. Travis, thanks for the question. And Ben did answer the capital question. We really see no plans in our capex for this year. On the O&M side, no, this crisis is relatively recently, so we are working through all those plans and we have a plan for balance of the year in terms of implementing them. I mean, Ben said it pretty well, you often hear Ben and Bob talk about dry powder and that's been used in the context of our financial dry powder with our strong balance sheet, they are conservative dividend payout ratio. But we also have operational dry powder and we've invested in the system and then as in the good days. And as the time of crisis here we're able to weather it and we look at -- we think about the O&M contingency plans we're putting in place, whether it's -- we've implemented a hiring freeze. We're looking at reducing employee expenses and that will happen over-time. We're reducing consulting spend in our other programs. And as we think about it right, we're targeting. As I talked about targeting 4% to 5% truly mitigate that base case scenario, but we do have the ability to flex up a little bit in cases a little bit worse. -- Okay. So evenly spread more or less throughout the year. -- That's a fair assumption. -- Okay. And then on the renewable development, how much are those delays project specific and how much are you seeing just across the entire industry supply chain issues or other financing delays or construction delays, stuff like that. Industrywide versus the couple of projects, you mentioned. -- Hey, Travis, it's Bob. I'll just comment. We work with our OEM vendors as well as our balance of plant providers to execute the schedules. We have seen some supply chain disruptions started when China shutdown for a while. We've had mild disruptions from other plants where we get some of our components. We think that's an industrywide phenomenon. I think just Brian mentioned, we've been exceptionally diligent in tracking our costs. We are really comfortable with our ability to meet the Safe Harbor provisions for achieving 100% PTC. These are projects that were originally scheduled to be later in this year anyway. And so while we're trying actively to get them completed in 2020, there is a potential they do slip into '21. But I do think it's stuff we're seeing around the industry and also not only is that our vendors, but there is a logistics and the supply chain issue with ports and parts of transport that we're seeing. It's not -- I wouldn't say it's catastrophic by any stretch. It's just mild. We just happen to have these related dated projects for us. -- Yeah, and again it's Brain. We're very, very confident that we work with upside [Indecipherable] to know that we will pass the continuous efforts test. -- Okay. Any difference you're seeing between solar and wind in terms of what you just talked about with supply chain and other logistics? -- Right now, Travis, we're only building wind farms on our own balance sheet. I haven't seen or heard a lot of solar delays, there's been a couple of public force majeure filings and some solar farms around the country. But I don't think we could speak with any authority on the solar side. -- Okay, great. I appreciate it. Thank you.We'll take our next question from Sophie Karp with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. -- Hi, good morning. Thanks for having me. -- Good morning. -- I was curious if you could provide a little bit more color on the supply chain disruptions that we've been talking about, particularly with this two wind farms, what you guys have seen in the supply chain? And also, do you expect that the issues may, in fact, sort of other here is maybe traditional power generation, transmission and distribution businesses, so where it might affect the availability of parts and things like that as we move forward in the lockdown [Indecipherable] continue. Thank you. -- Yeah, sure. Sophie, we haven't seen any supply chain disruptions on any of our other components other than maybe toilet paper and hand sanitizer and face masks. But on the wind farms themselves, a lot of the components are manufactured in overseas and assembled here. And so depending on the progress of the pandemic and which country gets hit and which factories has caused two, three, four week delays in various places, which compounded equals maybe a six or seven or eight-week delay on our projects. And that was enough to potentially push them across the goal line. We're seeing not just constraints on the OEM side, but we do see logistics constraints around ports and air travel and shipping as well, and so that's caused some of the problems. I can't say that we've seen in the other disruptions on any of our other components, we just haven't. But those discrete items are [Indecipherable] watching closely. As Ben and Brian have said, we feel very confident in our ability to qualify for the PTC that are 100%. And we're working diligently with our vendors and our transportation providers to get all the components here and get them constructed by the end of the year. -- Okay. Thank you. This is all from me.Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I like to turn the conference back to Brian Van Abel for any additional or closing remarks. -- Yes, thank you. And thank you for all participating in our earnings call this morning. Please contact our Investor Relations team with any follow-up questions and have a good day. Thank you. -- Thank you, everyone.[Operator Closing Remarks] --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --

Airplanes are grounded. Businesses have closed. Cars are off the roads. The coronavirus pandemic and the early efforts to mitigate the health crisis have driven a precipitous fall in demand for transportation fuels and electric power. Lower energy consumption means lower carbon dioxide emissions. In this case, the year-over-year decline is expected to be a record.The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects energy-related carbon dioxide emissions to decrease 11% in 2020 compared with last year. While some analysts have warned that the climate progress will be short-lived and that emissions could rise significantly when the economy picks up again, a closer look at the consequences of the coronavirus pandemic suggests a surprising amount of economic decarbonization will be locked in permanently. Here's what it means for . Image source: Getty Images.Factors such as weather, economic activity, energy prices, and fuel mix affect energy-related carbon emissions, which primarily comprise electricity generation and transportation fuels. Knowing that, it makes sense for emissions  that occur primarily due to an economic slowdown would be followed by emissions  during an economic recovery.In the EIA's most recent forecast, the 11% decline in energy-related carbon emissions in 2020 will be driven by reduced energy consumption. Demand for electricity is expected to fall 5% compared to last year -- a record year-over-year tumble equivalent to turning off the country's power supply for 18 days -- driven by both a mild winter and stay-at-home orders. Consumption of motor gasoline is expected to decrease 11% compared to last year, while demand for jet fuel and diesel fuel are expected to fall 25% and 10%, respectively. However, the EIA expects energy-related carbon emissions to increase 5% in 2021 as economic activity rebounds. There's a fair amount of uncertainty hanging over current events right now, so these projections could change as analysts accumulate more data. That said, despite the expected increase in 2021, current estimates suggest most of the carbon reductions will stick around. If the EIA's current short-term projections come true, then U.S. carbon emissions from energy consumption will decline by 345 million metric tons from 2019 to 2021. That would keep annual energy-related carbon emissions below 5 billion metric tons for two consecutive years, which hasn't happened since the 1980s. Whereas increasing demand for transportation fuels will drive increases in carbon emissions in 2021, increasing demand for electricity is much more likely to be met -- perhaps entirely -- by low- and zero-carbon power sources.Image source: Getty Images.All of the primary factors that determine energy-related carbon emissions -- weather, economic activity, energy prices, and fuel mix -- are pointing in the direction of a . Simply put, there are unprecedented headwinds facing coal-fired power plants and historic tailwinds for renewable energy sources. The emissions reductions in the power sector will be permanent because the market-share loss of coal-fired power plants will be permanent. Power generators are increasingly idling those assets (utilization rates have fallen from 67% in 2010 to below 40% in early 2020) or sending them to an . Coal-fired power plants won't recover once the economy rebounds from the upcoming recession, especially not after the country adds over 33,000 megawatts of renewable energy capacity in regions where coal currently dominates. That's likely to accelerate the energy transition. Take   as one guiding example. The company's consolidated power mix leaned on coal for 56% of electricity generation in 2005, but that fell to 26% in 2019 and is expected to fall to 15% in 2030. Renewable energy could generate 60% of the company's electricity by then. However, depending on the strength of the economic headwinds facing coal in a post-pandemic world, investors might wonder if the timeline will be accelerated. Xcel Energy has an estimated 2,085 megawatts of coal-fired generating capacity scheduled to retire between 2025 and 2030. Could it apply to regulators for an even earlier wind down of those assets? An accelerated energy transition suggests a bleak future for coal producers such as  . A mild winter and the coronavirus pandemic forced the company to slash full-year 2020 coal production guidance by 25% compared to original expectations. The partnership was also forced to suspend distribution payments -- previously sporting a double-digit annual yield -- to preserve its balance sheet. If coal is incapable of regaining market share when the economy begins to recover, then investors might need to rethink their long-term projections for Alliance Resource Partners and its peers.The EIA expects energy-related carbon emissions to fall by double digits in 2020 compared to last year. While the historic year-over-year decline will be driven primarily by reduced consumption and economic activity caused by the coronavirus pandemic, multiple other factors would have driven a relatively sharp decline without the health crisis. The country is bound to see an uptick in emissions as consumption and the economy recover, but a significant amount of the decarbonization taking place in the power sector is likely to be permanent. Therefore, investors should begin planning for the energy transition to accelerate -- and contemplate the opportunities and challenges ahead.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Investors might have wondered why stock markets have performed relatively well in recent weeks despite the release of increasingly gloomy economic data. In my opinion, it's part wishful thinking on Wall Street, and part timing. States didn't begin issuing stay-at-home orders until mid-March -- almost exactly  most companies last provided quarterly updates to shareholders. That'll change starting this week as companies start providing updates for the first quarter of 2020 and their outlooks for the new operating environment. One gauge of economic activity suggests investors should brace for more bad news: electricity consumption. In early April, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) issued its first projection of domestic energy market performance since the coronavirus pandemic started. The report expects 2020 will see the worst year-over-year decline in electricity demand since the Great Recession.Image source: Getty Images.The EIA publishes a short-term energy outlook (STEO) each month with projections for liquid fuels, natural gas, electricity, and emissions in the current year. A major policy shift or international trade spat can inject a little variability from month-to-month, but the projections typically don't experience much change throughout the year. After all, the United States wields a massive, stable, and diverse electricity supply. But these aren't typical times. According to the April STEO, the EIA expects total U.S. utility-scale electricity generation to decline by 3% in 2020 compared to last year. That might seem insignificant, but it's the equivalent of completely shutting off the nation's electricity for 11 days.The largest declines in consumption are expected to occur among commercial and industrial customers (with drops from last year of 4.7% and 4.2%, respectively), which account for roughly 60% of electricity sales in a typical year. Surprisingly, the EIA forecasts residential electricity demand will  0.8% from last year, with milder winter and summer temperatures offsetting increases from stay-at-home orders. That matches data from January 2020 (the only month available as of this writing), which saw a 5% year-over-year decline due to milder temperatures this year.Given the uncertainty and unprecedented nature of the situation, these projections could change with each monthly report. It's worth noting that American electricity consumption is always lowest in April, which just so happens to perfectly line up with stay-at-home orders. The timing of the coronavirus pandemic likely  its impact on the power sector, at least so far -- and the health crisis is still projected to drive the worst year-over-year decline in electricity demand since the Great Recession triggered a 4.1% decline in 2009.If stay-at-home orders are extended into May or June, then the EIA may need to revise its forecast lower. Similarly, it's impossible to know how economic activity will change when stay-at-home orders are lifted. Will parts of the economy open in piecemeal fashion? Will consumers venture out with the same confidence as before? Will different regions rebound more quickly than others? Broadly speaking, electricity demand is a reasonable gauge of economic activity. If these projections prove true, then investors can expect a significant economic slowdown in 2020. But energy investors might find a relative safe haven in . Image source: Getty Images.The EIA projects total U.S. electricity demand will decline 3% in 2020, but renewable energy is expected to  11% compared to last year. Why is there such a discrepancy? First, power generators added a significant amount of onshore wind and utility-scale solar in 2019, and are expected to add record amounts in 2020. The nation's second-largest producer of energy from wind,  , could bring over 2,300 megawatts of new wind capacity online from late 2019 to the end of 2020. That includes 1,822 megawatts this year.The EIA projects the United States will add 19,400 megawatts of onshore wind capacity (easily a record) and 12,600 megawatts of utility-scale solar capacity in 2020 -- and that's  factoring in construction delays caused by the coronavirus pandemic. While much of the new capacity will come online at the end of the year, several gigawatts will begin making significant contributions well before December.Second, renewable energy is the least likely power source to be curtailed in response to lower electricity demand. Onshore wind and utility-scale solar boast some of the lowest operating costs in many regions, primarily because they don't require fuel.  produces more energy from the wind and sun than any other company on the planet. Its power generation subsidiary, NextEra Energy Resources, is one of the largest capital investors in the United States, and would rank seventh among countries by installed wind power capacity. The renewable energy leader expects onshore wind and utility-scale solar to cost no more than $30 per megawatt-hour and $40 per megawatt-hour, respectively, by around 2024. That would make them the lowest sources of new electricity -- even after factoring in energy storage costs. Wind and solar aren't that inexpensive today, but they're very competitive economically.Indeed, the EIA projects coal-fired power plants to produce 20% less electricity in 2020 than last year. Natural-gas power plants will see a 1% increase in output, but no-fuel-required renewable energy sources will grow 11%. That bodes well for electric utilities and power generators like Xcel Energy and NextEra Energy that are heavily reliant on renewable energy. Of course, investors shouldn't expect them to be completely insulated from negative impacts of the coronavirus pandemic, but it could go a long way to mitigating risks.The stock market might be surprisingly resilient now, but that could change when companies begin reporting first-quarter 2020 operating results in the coming weeks. Businesses may not have been severely impacted in the first three months of the year, especially considering stay-at-home orders didn't go into effect until mid-March. But expectations for weak electricity demand suggests investors shouldn't be surprised if companies issue weak second-quarter and full-year 2020 guidance. As for energy investors, the power sector is projected to have a relatively bad year. That said, renewable energy is expected to have a banner year of production, while stealing record market share from coal and making gains on natural gas. Investors shouldn't expect renewable energy to be completely spared from the coming economic downturn, but it could become a relative safe haven.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The coronavirus pandemic has disrupted everyday life, altered the trajectory of the global economy, and reminded all of us not to be tricked by the thin veneer of civilization. For all of humanity's advanced technology, our best weapon against a fast-moving virus is to simply stay indoors and keep contact with others to a minimum. While low-tech solutions can be pretty powerful against uncertainty, investors will gradually begin to chip away at the information gaps of the coronavirus pandemic. Can science provide answers and solutions before the end of 2020? How badly has the economy been damaged? How long will the economic recession last? Partial answers to those questions will begin to emerge in April. That's why investors might want to keep a closer eye on electric utility holding company   and research and development collaborator  . Image source: Getty Images.Xcel Energy operates four electric utilities serving customers in the middle of the United States, from the Dakotas in the northern Midwest all the way through Colorado and down to West Texas. Assessing the health of the company's operations might prove useful for investors gauging electricity demand and industrial activity during the pandemic. Consider that efforts to slow community transmission rates of the new coronavirus began in mid-March when cities, counties, and states began ordering Americans to stay indoors. As of the beginning of April, the great majority of Americans are under such decrees, which will last through the end of the month and likely into May (at the least). It's all bound to reshuffle electricity demand profiles.Commercial (especially) and industrial activity has been significantly reduced, while residential energy usage has likely significantly increased. But investors don't have much reliable data yet describing the trend. Electricity sales might provide some of the first real insight.In 2019, Xcel Energy generated 31% of its revenue from residential customers and another 53% from commercial and industrial customers. Those percentages are unlikely to hold in March, April, and May of 2020. What will that mean for other electric utilities? Can increased residential sales make up for decreased sales to other customers? The company's usefulness to investors extends beyond eyeing differences in residential electricity use. Xcel Energy is the most prolific electricity supplier to oil and gas producers in the Permian Basin of West Texas, which is one of the most prolific oil patches on the planet. Investors already know that crude oil markets are cratering, but the company's next earnings report could shine more light on the severity of the downturn. The business is scheduled to report first-quarter 2020 operating results in the first week of May -- days or weeks before many oil and gas producers in the region.The West Texas region has recently been one of the most important sources of earnings growth for Xcel Energy. Will oil production cuts hurt the  more than investors are expecting?  Image source: Getty Images.If Twist Bioscience is ever going to burst onto the scene and showcase the power of its technology platform to the world, the coronavirus pandemic might be the right time. The company is a leading provider of synthetic genetic materials. Another way to wrap your head around that: If   DNA with its sequencing platform, then Twist Bioscience  DNA with its synthesis platform. To date, Twist Bioscience has sold synthetic DNA mostly to academic, biopharma, and industrial customers who use it in genetic engineering experiments and living technologies. The company's greatest success has actually come in an unrelated area: selling high-quality next-generation sequencing (NGS) tools to healthcare companies looking for more precision in their workflows. This technology platform could prove an important tool in the race to understand the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and the acute respiratory disease it causes. For example, every diagnostic test used to confirm that an individual is infected with coronavirus requires a positive control sample -- usually a chunk of viral genetic material, or RNA -- to compare with patient samples. Doctors know the positive control is, well, positive for the virus, so if the patient sample provides a similar signal, then the patient is confirmed to have the virus. Twist Bioscience offers multiple SARS-CoV-2 RNA controls for such tests, and they are listed on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website as reference materials. Twist Bioscience has also created NGS tools for scientists studying the new coronavirus outside of emergency medical settings; has partnered with Vanderbilt University to identify possible antibody therapeutics that could be used to treat COVID-19; and supplies genetic materials used in the DNA vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 being developed by  .  That said, investors should be cautious. Twist Bioscience has seen its  in recent quarters. It's not immediately clear that the company's synthetic DNA sales are profitable, or that the coronavirus pandemic is lifting up the business (or making up for reduced business from other customers). But investors shouldn't be surprised if they hear more about Twist Bioscience in the coming weeks and months as a stealthy collaborator for the scientists and companies leading the charge against SARS-CoV-2.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"Investors in Xcel Energy Inc (Symbol: XEL) saw new options become available this week, for the May 15th expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the XEL options chain for the new May 15th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $55.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.80.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $55.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $52.20 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of XEL, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $57.51/share today.

Because the $55.00 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 66%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.09% return on the cash commitment, or 37.92% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.


Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Xcel Energy Inc, and highlighting in green where the $55.00 strike is located relative to that history:


   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $60.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.50.  If an investor was to purchase shares of XEL stock at the current price level of $57.51/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $60.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 8.68% if the stock gets called away at the May 15th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if XEL shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Xcel Energy Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing XEL's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $60.00 strike highlighted in red:



   
Considering the fact that the $60.00 strike represents an approximate 4% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 62%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.35% boost of extra return to the investor, or 32.38% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.


The implied volatility in the put contract example is 67%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 55%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $57.51) to be 33%.

"Legendary investor Warren Buffett advises to be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful.  One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100.  A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.

In trading on Monday, shares of Xcel Energy Inc (Symbol: XEL) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 29.9, after changing hands as low as $46.58 per share.  By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) is 29.0.  A bullish investor could look at XEL's 29.9 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.    The chart below shows the one year performance of XEL shares:
   
   

Looking at the chart above, XEL's low point in its 52 week range is $46.58 per share, with $72.14 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $47.86.

There are 9 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Xcel Energy Inc, but the average is just that — a mathematical average.  There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $54.00.  And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $77.00.  The standard deviation is $6.098.


But the whole reason to look at the average XEL price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes.  And so with XEL crossing above that average target price of $65.78/share, investors in XEL have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $65.78 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

"Looking at the universe of stocks we cover at , on 3/12/20, Xcel Energy Inc (Symbol: XEL), Northwestern Corp. (Symbol: NWE), and Chesapeake Utilities Corp. (Symbol: CPK) will all trade ex-dividend for their respective upcoming dividends.  Xcel Energy Inc will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.43 on 4/20/20, Northwestern Corp. will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.60 on 3/31/20, and Chesapeake Utilities Corp. will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.405 on 4/6/20.  

As a percentage of XEL's recent stock price of $69.43, this dividend works out to approximately 0.62%, so look for shares of Xcel Energy Inc to trade 0.62% lower — all else being equal — when XEL shares open for trading on 3/12/20.  Similarly, investors should look for NWE to open 0.81% lower in price and for CPK to open 0.43% lower, all else being equal.





Below are dividend history charts for XEL, NWE, and CPK, showing historical dividends prior to the most recent ones declared.

Xcel Energy Inc (Symbol: XEL):
   Northwestern Corp. (Symbol: NWE):Chesapeake Utilities Corp. (Symbol: CPK):
In general, dividends are not always predictable, following the ups and downs of company profits over time.  Therefore, a good first due diligence step in forming an expectation of annual yield going forward, is looking at the history above, for a sense of stability over time.  This can help in judging whether the most recent dividends from these companies are likely to continue.  If they do continue, the current estimated yields on annualized basis would be 2.48% for Xcel Energy Inc, 3.25% for Northwestern Corp., and 1.73% for Chesapeake Utilities Corp..  



		

In Tuesday trading, Xcel Energy Inc shares are currently up about 2.1%, Northwestern Corp. shares are up about 0.7%, and Chesapeake Utilities Corp. shares are up about 1.2% on the day.

"There's an old saying on Wall Street about insider buying: there are many possible reasons to sell a stock, but only one reason to buy.  Back on March 6, Xcel Energy Inc's SVP, Strategy, Planning & Ext., Frank P. Prager, invested $486,128.50 into 7,150 shares of XEL, for a cost per share of $67.99.  Bargain hunters tend to pay particular attention to insider buys like this one, because presumably the only reason an insider would take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock of their company in the open market, is that they expect to make money.

In trading on Thursday, bargain hunters could buy shares of Xcel Energy Inc (Symbol: XEL) and achieve a cost basis 9.2% cheaper than Prager, with shares changing hands as low as $61.76 per share.  Xcel Energy Inc shares are currently trading off about 6.7% on the day.  The chart below shows the one year performance of XEL shares, versus its 200 day moving average:

"Looking at the universe of stocks we cover at , in trading on Friday, shares of Xcel Energy Inc (Symbol: XEL) were yielding above the 3% mark based on its quarterly dividend (annualized to $1.72), with the stock changing hands as low as $55.28 on the day.  Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return.  To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) back on 12/31/1999 — you would have paid $146.88 per share.  Fast forward to 12/31/2012 and each share was worth $142.41 on that date, a decrease of $4.67/share over all those years.  But now consider that you collected a whopping $25.98 per share in dividends over the same period, for a positive total return of 23.36%.  Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.6%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 3% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable.  Xcel Energy Inc (Symbol: XEL) is an S&P 500 company, giving it special status as one of the large-cap companies making up the S&P 500 Index.



In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company.  In the case of Xcel Energy Inc, looking at the history chart for XEL below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 3% annual yield.

"In 2007, the U.S. generated a record amount of electricity from coal-fired power plants at an estimated 2,016 terawatt-hours, according to data compiled by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Last year, the nation's fleet generated an estimated 966 terawatt-hours. That's less than half the all-time peak from just 12 years ago and the lowest output since the late 1970s. The overnight abandonment of coal-fired power plants has created an opportunity for other power sources to gain market share while decarbonizing the country's power sector. In 2019, the United States generated record amounts of electricity from each natural gas, nuclear, wind, and solar. Here's what the latest numbers from the country's ongoing energy transition mean for investors.Image source: Getty Images.The sudden collapse of coal-fired electricity production is unprecedented. No energy source (including power, heating, and transportation) has experienced a 50% decline in output in a 12-year period dating back to the country's founding in 1776, according to the EIA. Power generators are  primarily due to economic factors. Coal-fired power plants have become more expensive to fuel and maintain than newer natural gas-fired power plants in much of the country. Onshore wind farms in the Midwest and West Texas have also forced many . A comparison of the nation's power mix in 2007 and 2019 clearly shows a transition to less expensive, lower-carbon energy sources. The numbers are even more impressive considering total electricity consumption has changed by less than 1% in that span, which makes each power source's changing share a direct reflection of changing electrical output. Power SourceShare of Total U.S. Electricity Consumption, 2019Share of Total U.S. Electricity Consumption, 2007Coal23.5%48.5%Natural gas38.4%21.6%Nuclear19.7%19.4%Hydro6.6%6%Onshore wind7.3%0.8%Utility-scale solar 1.8%0%Data source: EIA.The transition away from coal is expected to continue. Here are a few other highlights from the latest numbers compiled by the EIA:The latest numbers contain two major takeaways for investors. First, power generators are rapidly reducing their exposure to coal assets. That doesn't bode well for coal producers such as  . Investors might be drawn to the stock for its eye-popping distribution yield of 22.8%, but the reality is the stock has been a downright terrible investment. With dividends included, the stock has lost 61% in the last year, lost 70% in the last five years, and lost 26% in the last 10 years. Alliance Resource Partners has invested in oil and gas assets to decrease its reliance on coal, but coal assets were responsible for . Considering the EIA expects the share of electricity generated from coal-fired power plants to fall to 21% in 2020 and for coal production to slip 14% year over year, investors cannot be very confident in the business.Second, power generators are increasingly relying on natural gas and renewable energy. Utilities in the mid-Atlantic and Southeast have relatively , which makes them more dependent on natural gas-fired power plants.   generates 55% of its income from electric utility operations in Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina, but a lack of wind resources hasn't stopped its decarbonization efforts. The proportion of electricity generation from coal-fired power plants has fallen from 52% of the company's total output in 2005 to just 12% in 2019. The business is positioning itself to continue benefiting from the energy transition. Natural gas distribution, transmission, and storage operations will be responsible for roughly 40% of earnings in 2020. Meanwhile, solar assets spread across the U.S. are expected to contribute at least 5% of earnings this year and grow in the future. More impressive, Dominion Energy expects to achieve net zero carbon dioxide and methane emissions across its electricity and gas operations by 2050. Image source: Getty Images.Other companies aren't nearly as constrained by geography.y  has ambitious plans to build record amounts of onshore wind and utility-scale solar capacity across the U.S. through its power generation subsidiary NextEra Energy Resources (NEER). The subsidiary was responsible for 48% of the parent company's total net income in 2019. The company thinks the U.S. could generate between 30% and 40% of its electricity from . It's by far the most optimistic projection published, but the business has been right for the last 20 years and presumably has the best insight into the trend thanks to NEER.   will bring 1,922 megawatts of onshore wind capacity on line in 2020. Including both owned and contracted assets, the company expects to lean on 11,000 megawatts of wind capacity by the end of 2021. That will make up roughly 10% of the nation's total installed wind power capacity that year.It's part of the company's ""steel for fuel"" program that replaces coal-fired generation (the fuel) with wind farms (the steel). The benefits to ratepayers and shareholders have been impressive. The share of an average customer bill dedicated to fuel expenses is expected to fall from 47% in 2010 to just 28% by 2024. That frees up more capital to  which can help Xcel Energy grow both earnings and dividend per-share payouts 5% to 7% per year for the foreseeable future.The latest numbers from the EIA show that coal-fired power plants continue to fall out of favor in the country's electrical grid. The driving force is economics. Natural gas and onshore wind power are simply lower-cost power sources in a growing number of markets. That trend shouldn't reverse itself anytime soon. In fact, costs for onshore wind and utility-scale solar (and batteries) are projected to continue falling in the next five years, even when phased-out federal subsidies are included in the calculations. In other words, if your portfolio isn't positioned to benefit from the ongoing energy transition, it's not too late.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''.  These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand.  Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).  Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

"Buy-and-hold investing is the best way to build your wealth and enjoy all the awesome benefits of compound interest. Even if you haven't been very good at maintaining a long-term mindset to this point, there's no time like the present. As one Chinese proverb goes: ""The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now.""If you're willing to plant a tree or two in your portfolio today and watch the growth for the next 20 years, then consider buying great businesses with solid cash flows and long-term growth prospects. Here's why lithium producer   and renewable energy leader   are worth a closer look.Image source: Getty Images.The electrification of ground-based transportation and the proliferation of energy storage in the power grid will drive incredible increases in demand for battery-grade lithium materials this decade. But the transition got off to a rocky start, as investors learned the hard way in 2018 and 2019. Slowing demand in China, which is responsible for over half of global lithium consumption, crashed selling prices and weighed on lithium stocks. The rough start probably won't matter much in a few years. Every major automaker is launching an electric lineup within the next several years. Meanwhile, the price of energy-storage products used in the power sector is expected to fall from a range of $9 to $16 per megawatt-hour in 2018 to just $4 to $9 per megawatt-hour in 2022. That should help onshore wind and utility-scale solar to be the lowest-cost sources of electricity in the United States by 2023 even when batteries are included in a project's cost. And although investors couldn't tell just by looking at stock charts, major lithium producers have maintained comfortable profit margins throughout the lithium market's downturn. In the first nine months of 2019, Albemarle reported an adjusted  margin of 40.6% for its lithium segment. This financial strength should remain firmly in place. In Albemarle's latest five-year plan, the business stated it expects the lithium segment to average an adjusted EBITDA margin of 40% to 45% through 2024. The company estimates that its total production capacity will increase from 85,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) in 2019 to at least 225,000 metric tons of LCE in 2024. That suggests the company will own at least 20% of the global lithium market five years from now. And that's just the lithium segment. Albemarle generates a significant amount of revenue and earnings from its  today. By 2024, the business estimates it will grow total net revenue to at least $4.7 billion and adjusted EBITDA margin to at least $1.5 billion, representing growth of 27% and 36%, respectively, compared with 2019 levels. Free cash flow is expected to grow to at least $800 million by 2024, up from an expected outflow of $100 million last year. When investors consider the stock's 1.7% dividend yield and likely growth in the lithium market in the back half of this decade, Albemarle becomes a pretty attractive stock for the long haul.Image source: Getty Images.In 2018, Xcel Energy became the first electric utility (it's technically a holding company comprising four electric utilities) in the United States to publicly commit to generating 100% of its power from zero-carbon sources by 2050. That's the definition of long-term thinking -- and investors have gobbled up the certainty provided by the commitment: Shares have reached new all-time highs in 2020.Xcel is well on its way to achieving its goal. Through 2019, the company had reduced carbon emissions 40% from 2005 levels. If an ambitious carbon reduction plan in Minnesota is approved by regulators, then operations will achieve carbon emissions reductions of 80% by 2030 from the same benchmark. Up to 60% of its energy mix could come from renewable sources by 2030, which would be . Going all-in on , too. That's because a wind turbine doesn't require fuel once constructed, which can drive significant cost savings versus fossil fuel power plants. Xcel Energy's ""steel for fuel"" program has driven the share of fuel expenses from 47% of an average customer's bill in 2010 to just 40% in 2018. That's expected to fall to 28% by 2024. The cost savings from lower overall fuel expenses frees up more cash to invest in new renewable energy capacity, transmission network decongestion, and future growth opportunities such as electric vehicle charging infrastructure.For example, Xcel is currently embarking on the largest multistate wind investment in the country. It will more than double the amount of owned wind capacity in its portfolio when 2,192 megawatts of projects enter service in 2020 and 2021. Management has also announced that discussions are underway to build a consortium of industry stakeholders to plow tens of billions of dollars into transmission lines beginning in the back half of this decade. Investors don't have to wait to reap the benefits of the company's long-term plans. Xcel Energy expects to grow both the dividend per share and earnings per share by 5% to 7% per year for the foreseeable future. It's targeting a total shareholder return of 8% to 10% per year. Simply put, this dividend stock certainly should be considered by investors with a long-term mindset. When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC. On today's call, we will discuss certain metrics that are non-GAAP measures, including ongoing earnings in electric and natural gas margins. Information on the comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations are included in our earnings release.I'll now turn the call over to Ben. -- Well, thank you, Paul, and good morning, everyone. 2019 was an excellent year with a long and impressive list of accomplishments. Let me share a few. We delivered EPS of $2.64 in 2019, which is the 15th consecutive year of meeting or exceeding our earnings guidance.We raised our annual divided by $0.10 per share, which is the 16th straight year we've increased our dividend. Our stock hit an all-time high of $66.05 in September and subsequently hit all-time new high of $67.69 this week. We achieved a total shareholder return of just over 32%. Our O&M declined almost 1% even while making incremental investments in our system. The Minnesota Commission approved our purchase of a Longroad Wind asset, and finally we resolved multiple rate cases.We also had a strong year operationally. We continue to achieve important milestones in our nation-leading wind expansion program with the completion of our Foxtail, Lake Benton and Hale projects. These three projects represent over 700 megawatts and were completed under budget. In addition, we have almost 2,000 megawatts of wind projects under construction, which are expected to be completed in 2020. We're very excited to continue our clean energy transition, which will result in significant customer savings and carbon reductions.Our nuclear team continues to make great strides in transforming performance, while reducing cost. The fleet achieved the capacity factor of 92.6% in 2019 even with two refueling outages. We have one of the top performing nuclear fleets in the country as rated by the NRC and INPO. And in addition to strong performance, we have continued to lower our cost structure with O&M costs declining a little over 2% in 2019, and this is the fourth straight year of declining O&M in our nuclear operations. I'm extremely proud of the effort and results of our nuclear employees and their leadership in our industry.Moving to the wire side of our business, our advanced grid efforts have progressed well and will enable increased reliability and security, faster storm restoration, better efficiency and new offerings for our customers. In 2019, we implemented foundational software and completed our initial meter deployment in Colorado as planned with full scale implementation to follow. In November, we requested approval to expand our advanced grid program to benefit our Minnesota customers, and we expect a commission decision later this year.Beyond our strong financial and operational performance, I'm also very proud of our ESG leadership. In 2009, we estimate we've reduced carbon emissions by more than 40% from 2005 levels, and we remain on track to achieve an 80% carbon reduction by 2030. In recognition of our carbon-free vision, S&P Global gave us their Award of Excellence. And we continue to proactively mitigate the impacts of our clean energy transition on our employees and our communities. We provided assistance to impacted employees, offering retraining and relocation opportunities, and we're levering natural attrition.As a result, we've managed to transition with no layoffs from coal plant retirements. We've also partnered with our communities impacted by the closing of coal plants to build new generation at existing sites. And we've worked hard to attract new businesses to those communities as well. In Minnesota, there's continued progress to build a Google data center and relocate a metal recycling plant next to our closing charcoal coal plant. In Colorado, we've worked to develop a solar solution to retain a steel mill, which is our largest customer and a major employer in Pueblo, where we are closing two coal units.Now these collaborative economic development efforts will help sustain local economies in terms of both jobs and tax base. And our results have been recognized by others. We were named as one of Fortune magazine's Most Admired Companies for the seventh consecutive year, one of Corporate Responsibility Magazine's 100 Best Corporate Citizens, and among Newsweek's Most Responsible Companies. We earned another perfect score on the Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index and remain among the best places to work for LGBTQ Equality.In addition, various publications continue to recognize our strong leadership as a veteran employer. All of this adds up to an outstanding ESG record, which is becoming increasingly important to investors. So I'm really pleased with our accomplishments and, looking forward, I'm excited about the opportunities we have in 2020 and beyond. We will continue executing on our multi-state wind investment program, which will provide clean affordable energy to our customers. Longer-term, we'll add more universal solar storage and firm capacity to our system as part of our plan to reduce carbon emissions by 80% by 2030. We'll deliver on our planned transmission projects while collaborating with others to solve congestion issues over the next decade. This work is critical to maintaining reliability as more renewables are added to the system, and it also creates significant investment opportunities well into the future.Implementation of our Advanced Grid program will also keep the grid reliable, secure and efficient and allow for the integration of more renewables, while enabling new offerings for our customers. We will continue working with our customers, policymakers and other stakeholders to build nation-leading EV programs, which will improve the customer experience and reduce emissions across the transportation sector.So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob, who'll provide more detail on our financial results and outlook as well as a regulatory update. Bob? -- Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. My comments today will focus on full year 2019 results. For details on our fourth quarter results, please see our earnings release.We achieved another year of strong operational and financial results. We delivered 2019 ongoing earnings of $2.64 per share, which is a 6.9% increase compared with $2.47 per share in 2018. This result represents the top end of our original guidance range of $2.55 to $2.65 per share. Similar to last year, weather was a positive factor contributing almost $0.07 per share compared to normal. However, we also incurred additional O&M expense, including approximately $0.03 per share due to storms, partially offsetting the weather benefit.The most significant earnings drivers for the year include higher electric and natural gas margins, which increased earnings by $0.37 per share, including rate increases in riders to recover capital investments. Lower O&M expenses increased earnings by $0.02 per share, and our lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.15 per share. However, the majority of the lower EPR is due to an increase in production tax credits, which flow back to customers through electric margin and tax reform impacts, both of which are largely earnings neutral. Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation and interest expense reflecting our capital investment program, which reduced earnings by $0.29 per share, and lower AFUDC, due to project timing, decreased earnings by $0.08 per share.Turning to sales, our weather-adjusted electric sales declined by 0.3% in 2019. We saw positive residential sales across almost all of our jurisdictions with continued customer growth, partially offset by lower use per customer. And in the C&I space, we experienced discrete declines in certain large customer usage due to co-generation and lower frac sand mining sales, which cause sales to be unfavorable. Weather adjusted natural gas sales increased 2.7% in 2019 as a result of strong customer growth and higher use per customer, partially offset by the declines in the frac sand mining demand in Wisconsin. For 2020, we anticipate electric and natural gas sales growth of approximately 1%, which includes the impact of leap year.Turning to expenses, O&M costs were almost 1% lower than last year, driven by continued efficiency gains in transmission and in our fossil and nuclear generation fleet, partially offset by unexpected storm costs and incremental spending on strategic areas to enhance the customer experience and further reduce risk in our operations. We remain committed to improving operating efficiency and taking costs out of the business for the benefit of our customers as we have for the past five years.And as a result, our consolidated base O&M forecast is essentially flat. However, we do expect incremental O&M from adding new wind generation in 2020 and 2021, which is largely rider recoverable, as well as continuing to invest in strategic areas of cybersecurity, wildfire mitigation and enhancing the customer experience. As a result, we expect total O&M expense will increase approximately 1% to 2% in 2020.Next, let me provide a quick regulatory update. In December, the Minnesota Commission approved our rate case stay out proposal, including the extension of the sales, capital and property tax true up mechanisms, along with the deferral of increases in nuclear decommissioning costs. We view this as a constructive outcome as it will allow us to concentrate on other strategic Minnesota activities, including our integrated resource plan, our Advanced Grid initiative and electric vehicle expansion efforts.In January, the Minnesota Commission approved our affiliate filing for the Mankato natural gas plant and the assumption of the existing PPA. We closed on the acquisition earlier this month and believe the Mankato asset will bring substantial value and reliability to the upper Midwest system and to our customers, especially as we retire additional coal plants.As we discussed in the past, we anticipate this asset will generate utility-like returns over its life. However, we expect the non-regulated returns will be slightly lower in the near-term and more robust toward the back end of the forecast. We continue to progress -- we continue to progress on our PPA acquisition strategy, and we are working with stakeholders to improve the process to ensure better regulatory alignment. We do not expect to propose future asset acquisitions into the unregulated company.Moving to Colorado, the commission held deliberations in our electric rate case in December and verbally approved an ROE of 9.3% at current test year ended August 2019, and an equity ratio of 55.6% along with other decisions. We view this report for a strong capital structure and progress in improving more current test year as positives, particularly for the credit support that they provide.But we're disappointed in the low ROE, which does not reflect our outstanding operational performance and leadership on the clean energy transition. We are waiting on a written commission order, which we need to calculate the final revenue impacts. However, we expect to seek reconsideration on certain issues. We expect new rates to be effective in February 2020. We also have electric rate cases in New Mexico and Texas. In New Mexico, we recently reached a constructive settlement that reflects a rate increase of approximately $31 million, an ROE of 9.45%, an equity ratio of 54.8% and an acceleration in depreciation in the top coal plant to reflect an early retirement. Hearings are scheduled in February with the commission decision to follow.In Texas, we're seeking an increase of $136 million based on a historic test year, an equity ratio of 54.7% and an ROE of 10.35%. The request largely reflects investment for the Hale Wind project as well as other capital to support strong regional growth. Intervener testimony will be filed in February. And as in the past, we'll work to see if we can reach a settlement with the various parties. We anticipate a commission decision in the second quarter of 2020.We're planning to file several cases next year. In February, we will file a natural gas rate case in Colorado with new rates expected to be effective in November. We'll also consider filing a Colorado electric case in the summer. We intend to file a Minnesota electric case in November. And finally, we'll likely file rate cases in both Texas and New Mexico to recover the costs for the Sagamore Wind project in the first quarter of 2021. With a strong year behind us, we are reaffirming our 2020 earnings guidance range of $2.73 to $2.83 per share, which is consistent with the long-term EPS growth objective of 5% to 7%.With that, I'll wrap up. In summary, 2019 was another great year for Xcel Energy. We delivered earnings within or above our guidance range for the 15th consecutive year. We increased our dividend for the 16th straight year. We issued $750 million of equity, representing the majority of our equity needs over the next five years. Our stock hit an all-time high in September and more recently in January. We achieved a total shareholder return of just over 32%, eclipsing that TSR of the S&P 500 for yet another year.The Minnesota Commission approved our acquisition of the long road assets into rate base, and we put in service three wind projects, largely on time and under budget. We resolved multiple rate cases and we continue to demonstrate leadership in environmental, social and governance arenas. We remain well positioned to deliver on our 2020 earnings guidance range and our long-term earnings and dividend growth objectives of 5% to 7%.This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we'll now take questions.Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Greg Gordon of Evercore ISI. -- Good morning, Greg. -- Thanks. Good morning, everybody. -- Hey, Greg. -- So, it doesn't look like there were any real substantive changes to your medium to long-term outlook from your last disclosures. Your capex budget is the same, but you did slightly tweak some of your guidance drivers for '20, including a modest reduction in expected O&M growth. Yes, I'm wondering as you look this year and then you look out over like a five-year planning horizon, you guys have done a great job as you say it bending the cost curve and controlling costs to reduce regulatory lag. And we're just wondering, yeah, in general, I wonder about the industry, but also specifically with regard to Xcel, as you circle back around and look at your organization, how much leaner do you think you can get given improvements in technology and the cost of deploying renewables, etc? -- Thanks, Greg. It's Bob. It's a great question. As we give guidance, we do expect modest increases in O&M over the next year or two as we bring the wind on to the system and we spend some money in very strategic areas like cyber and wildfire risk mitigation. Over the longer term, we expect to keep O&M flat probably beyond the '21 period. And that includes substantial cost curve bending as we absorb increases in salaries and bargaining unit increases and increases from suppliers looking for upticks in our contracts and things like that. So it's a continuous effort, but I think the guidance for us is flat in '22 and beyond to what is '21. -- Great. Second and last question, I think, tomorrow we're expecting unless things have changed rate decisions in Texas for two of your competitors, CenterPoint than AEP. I know that you've got a pending case in that -- where a decision is not expected until later this year. There has been concern about regulatory risk both lower equity ratios and lower ROEs in that state. CentrePoint looks like they're coming out a little bit better than where they otherwise would have landed, but it's still not a great outcome relative to industry average. How do you think you guys differentiate? -- Well. Hi, Greg, it's Ben. I think historically there has been a lot of differences in the pure T&D utility with no customers in ERCOT, like CenterPoint, and a vertically integrated company like SPS outside of ERCOT. And you see that, we've been in front of the regulator numerous times in the last five years and the equity ratios are what they are as well as the ROE. So, I think the more relevant case that I look to as I think about how Texas might get resolved is actually the settlement we had in New Mexico. As you know, Greg, many of the same interveners in Mexico -- excuse me -- are going be the same ones in Texas. So, we'll obviously look at those cases, but we're cautiously optimistic that we'll have some opportunities to potentially settle the Texas case in the March timeframe of this year. -- Fantastic. Thank you, guys.Thank you. We'll take our next question from Insoo Kim, Goldman Sachs. -- Thank you. My first question is on the -- good morning -- on the 2020 outlook for whether-adjusted low growth. Thank you for the color that you gave on what impacted especially on the electric side, whether it just a load, as you look out toward this year and just having gone through just a month of this year. Does it still give you confidence that you could achieve the 1% increase in load, including the leap year impact? -- Yeah. Insoo, it's Bob. Thanks for the question, and I appreciate you are on the call. I think our sales forecast is reasonably conservative. We did have some discrete declines in our large C&I customers in 2019 that we don't expect to continue in '20. And underlying those discrete items, we do have strong customer growth, which is slightly moderated by use per customer. But I think our forecast is as expected, and we don't expect to adjust that from guidance. -- Got it. Thank you. And my second question. In Minnesota, with the ongoing discussions on the Clean Energy First potential legislation, how did those -- how did the latest discussions fit in with your overall timing and shape of fleet transformation that you've laid on the RP? And do see -- and if there are changes do you see potential opportunities or challenges relative to their original plan? -- Well, it's a really good question. I think Clean Energy First basically clarifies what we're already planning to do. And so, this would be the second time that it was -- the state is looking to legislate that Clean Energy First, legislation, and I think there will be some opportunities that come out of it. For us, it's important that we make sure we do this in the most efficient way possible. We recognized the very strong importance of our nuclear energy. And we recognize the fact that as we close and shut coal plants on a voluntary basis to achieve that 80% carbon reduction that our investors have some opportunities to be rewarded as well. So, we'll see where it goes. We're going to move forward. We're plowing our IRP plan. And that's -- as you know, that's we filed it rather and that will be discussed throughout the year. And it's -- I think it's pretty extraordinary plan, which has a lot of renewables, some gas at the continuation of our nuclear plants. So, I think we are well positioned. -- Got it. Thank you very much.Thank you. We'll take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America. -- Hey, Julien -- Hey. Can you hear me? -- Yeah. Good morning. -- We can hear you. -- Hey, good morning. Thank you for the time. So perhaps just to follow up a little bit on the tax extenders bill and some of the developments on the PTC. I know you guys are always vocal about your opportunities in the wind side. Can you elaborate your latest thinking on repowering specifically, given the extension? And I know it's a little early, but just altogether how do you think about the repowering opportunity and the PPA buyout strategy at large given the extension? -- Well, I think it's helpful. I mean that's the short answer. The 60% PTC expansion allows you to lock in technology through 2024 with a 60% PTC, so I think that will potentially create some more opportunities to your point for repowering, Julien. As you know, we don't have those opportunities embedded in our forecast, but we are certainly going to be looking for those opportunities. -- Got it. Excellent. And then, as you think toward the rate case in Minnesota, do you want to give any kind of premise as to how you think about that again obviously being pushed out, but at any premise you think about in setting expectations going forward in that case specifically, I know you just alluded to some potentially on the last question here, but maybe just to start to open up that conversation? -- Well, I mean, we pushed it out a year and I think the terms were constructive. We -- unless we can figure out a way to push it out another year, we'll file in November with interim rates to go into effect in January of like I said would be '21. So I don't really have much more details than that. We were pleased to work with the staff and stay out. I think that allows us to focus on the resource plan. And it's nice to be able to take a little burden off the staff too, as they've got quite a workload. So, could we stay out another year? Well, I don't know. But I guess I can't add much more color than that, Julien, that's where we are. -- That is fair. All right. Excellent. Thank you, guys.Thank you. We'll take our next question from Travis Miller of Morningstar. -- Thank you. Good morning. -- Good morning, Travis. -- Hi. As you're looking in the industry, obviously you're quite active both solar and wind, 2020 and 2021 as you're negotiating contracts both regulated and possibly the PPAs outside of those, what are you seeing just in terms of cost comparisons, where costs are going both wind and solar or are they still going down or they're changing terms, I just wonder if you could characterize what you're seeing going 2020 and 2021 in wind and solar? -- Well, I think you're still seeing the technology's fall in price. The -- you then have to match that up with the -- where we are with PTCs and ITC's. But as we just talked about that 60% extension I think is going to be helpful. Without that 60% PTC extension, Travis, I would have told you that perhaps we'll see some bump up in wind and we still might, which is why I'm really pleased we locked down 100%. I think that's a no regrets strategy in every sense of the word. But I think that technology is still going to compete head on with fossil alternatives even in a low natural gas environment.Of course, the key that I think is important to that is that we will put more renewables on the big grid that we're all connected to than anybody else, but we're going to need more than just renewables and battery storage. Renewables will be our biggest source of energy by the mid-'20s. But as you see in our IRP in Minnesota, we'll address this in Colorado next year, we're also going to need to back up that wind with natural gas and then ultimately we're going to need to start developing technologies -- carbon-free dispatchable technologies that will allow us to achieve our goal of a 0% carbon system by 2050. So maybe that's a little bit long winded, but I thought I'd throw that out there for you, Travis. That's the plan. I will also... -- Yeah. Don't... -- Our industry is really, really stepping up to the challenge of carbon reduction. I mean, we're proud to have been the first to establish the goal. But if you go down the line and add up what utilities are doing, it is really significant. And I'm quite proud of this industry. -- I'll add up real quick. Our year-over-year fuel cost decline was about $325 million. And while half of that was just lower commodity prices, natural gas and coal, the rest of that is our Steel for Fuel program coming home to roost to the benefit of our customers. And while we are investing steel in the ground and have capital cases for recovery, you're seeing the real benefit on the fuel line. And that does attribute -- that does accrete to the customers and that provides some headroom in the bill for us for continued investment in the distribution and transmission grids, which we know we need. -- Yeah, great. Thank you. And then, did I hear you correctly, you do not plan on any unregulated renewable energy acquisitions, but you would possibly keep doing the PPA-type acquisitions, just to make sure there is not a change there from what you said? -- Our goal is to look for PPA buyout opportunities or repowering opportunities with the benefits flowing to the customers. So that means putting them in regulated operations and into rate base. That's always been the plan. Of course, we offer that as well for a gas fired plant in Mankato, and commission decided the benefits which were primarily back-end loaded weren't sufficient enough to go forward. So we made the decision that we would -- the asset was important enough and we thought -- valuable enough that we would hold it in our portfolio, but as a non-reg selling into the utility under long-term power purchase agreement. But I try to say you that more is an anomaly than anything else and I would challenge anybody to find a utility that is more focused and has more of their growth -- 100% of their growth coming from regulated operations. There's nobody that's more pure play and vertically integrated than Xcel Energy, and that's the way we mean to keep it. -- Okay, great. Thank you very much.Thank you. We'll take our next question from Ali Agha of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. -- Hey, Ali. -- Thank you. Hi, good morning. First question, in 2019, as you noted in the slides, at the OpCo level you earned a 9.06% ROE. Can you just remind us what earned ROE is embedded in your 2020 guidance at the OpCo level? -- Yeah. Ali, its Bob. Our weighted average regulated ROE is about 9.4% across all of our jurisdictions and we still have approximately 50 basis points of leakage and lag in that. So high-8%s is probably a good number right now. -- Bob, you'd expect a little bit of leakage or a reduction from what '19 ended up earning? -- I do mostly driven by a lower ROE in Colorado electric case. We're still working on trying to close that ROE gap, and we think we have some opportunity over the longer term to do that. -- Ali, I think it's important to note though that we are -- I will tell you, we are disappointed in the ROE we received in Colorado. But as Bob mentioned, there were some positive things there too. But as you -- as we're into the end of January and we see the puts and takes that we've had so far, I would tell you that we're solidly positioned to be in the middle of our earnings guidance range. -- Okay. And secondly, I know your current 2020 through 2024 capex five year is roughly around $22 billion. And Ben, you alluded to looking at additional opportunities, whether it's renewables, etc, if they do arise. Just from a constrained perspective, in terms of whether it's a rate case, I mean rate impact of customers or balance sheet, etc, how much can you stretch that $22 billion if there were opportunities or do you not see any constraints if the right opportunities are there. -- All right. The right opportunities are there. There are no constraints, and we're focused on capex that helps reduce total bills for our customers. And where we can find those opportunities and if it's a PPA buyout, well that's great. If it's trading O&M for capital, that's great. If it's more Steel for Fuel that saves customer's money on their fuel bill more than offsets the capital cost and the associated return, that's great. We're always going to be looking for that. And longer-term, I think we're in the early days of beneficial electrification and saving customers' money on their total energy bill with EVs and other opportunities. So, I'm excited about the capital opportunities we have to invest. And I think we've demonstrated we can grow our regulated rate base. Again that's a 100% of where we get our earnings from, and keep our bills flat for our customers. -- Okay. And last question again, a quick reminder, when you look at this 5% to 7% growth rate target that you laid out, can you remind us -- as you stand here today and you look at the opportunities in the capex, are you comfortable in the upper half of that range, the higher end of that range, can you just remind us where you stand on looking at that growth rate from where we are today? -- Yeah. I think, we're positioned to be on the upper part of the range. I mean... -- Upper part of the range? -- Yeah. Bob, I don't know if you have anything to add? -- I agree with that. -- So higher end is the way we should think about it? -- Yeah. -- I see. Thank you. -- Thanks, Ali.Thank you. We'll take our next question from Sophie Karp of KeyBanc. -- Hi, good morning, and thank you for taking my question. Most of the topics have been discussed, I guess, but I just wanted to circle back on Colorado. -- Sophie, a lot of background noise, we can hardly hear you. -- Can you hear me now? -- Much better. -- Oh, sorry about that. So most of the topics have been discussed, but I just want to circle back quickly on Colorado. Could you discuss where kind of the regulatory environment in this space is going directionally? I guess, with the disappointing rate decision and the initiative of -- in Boulder, like would it be fair to say overall it's -- it's more difficult maybe or is it not a fair statement? Thank you. -- No, I don't, I wouldn't categorize it that way. Boulder's been -- we've been talking about Boulder for 10 years now and probably be talking about at least for another 5 years, and that's more centric I think to Boulder and we continue to, I think, do quite well on a legal basis there with supportive commission decisions as well. As far as the regulatory environment in Colorado, yeah, I mentioned, Bob and I both, that were disappointing in 9.3% ROE. We think we're one of the best performing utilities in the nation and that ROE quite frankly doesn't reflect that. So likely look for reconsideration on that. But longer-term, Sophie, I believe that what we're doing and what we're doing was codified in the law last legislative session, we're highly aligned with what our customers and our stakeholders want to see in Colorado. And when I think about how you achieve long-term success, that's exactly how you do it aligned with stakeholders and then execute on a clear spaces. And that is what Xcel is doing, and I think that bodes well for future success. -- Terrific, thank you.Thank you. We'll take our next question from Andrew Levi of ExodusPoint. -- Andy, how are you' doing? -- Hey, guys. Good. I want to ask you about the growth rate. I guess... -- Disappointing, Andy. -- That's a dividend. -- Then I just wanted really to get your thoughts on this. Obviously you've mentioned ESG and that kind of taking out a big role kind of the industry as far as how people are investing. But I guess another part that didn't been talked about relative to ESG natural gas. And whether it's -- as in the LDC, whether it's midstream, whether it's fracking, whether it's even using it in your power plant as the fuel. Ben, I just wanted to get your thoughts just on natural gas as a commodity and whether you think it's clean or dirty or -- and then in the context of ESG if you kind of agree with some people's view that it's a dirty fuel? -- Yeah. Well, Andy, I think that is a very good question. It's a challenging question, because we're going to need natural gas to achieve that 80% carbon reduction that I mentioned and you know early action is pretty darn important in addressing the risk of climate change. So, we're going to get pushed back on natural gas, but I think the key is to make sure that people understand you shouldn't make perfection be the enemy of a great plan. And we're moving away from coal completely here in the upper Midwest. That's the plan. We're going to need gas to back it up. We had -- this time last year, we were in a polar vortex. Reliability is critical, so I think we've got a really pragmatic plan. Our challenge as an industry, Andy, is going to be making sure that people see that you know 2050 is a long way away. We're going to need different types of innovation. We'll put as much renewables and battery storage on the grid, but experts tell us that the big grid that we're all connected to does get saturated by depending on where you are in the country between 50% and 70%. That's amazing. You know that's the big grid, but that's where we're going -- but after that we're going to need things to back it up, and that's when new technologies.So, as part of the leadership of EI, that's a message I want to get out there. Now as far as the LDC goes and as far as using natural gas, I think our industry needs to be more demanding of upstream methane emissions, I think that's really important and we can do something about that. We need to double down on energy efficiency on the gas side. And then ultimately I think we need to look at potentially using renewable gas or hydrogen made out of carbon-free energy and other things and start blending that in the resource mix. I will also tell you that here in the upper Midwest heat pumps and things like that are pretty tough to make work. At least with today's technology so, we got to keep customers warm. So it's a challenging issue but I think with the right messaging and demonstrating, we've got a great plan. I think we can persevere. -- Thank you Ben. That was actually a great answer. Thank you. -- Thank you.Thank you. We'll take our next question from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates. -- Hey good morning. How are you doing? -- Hey, Paul. -- Hey, Paul. -- Just really quickly on Ali Agha's questions. I just want to follow-up, are you guys indicating that you in general just to make sure I understand this a bit, you don't expect any rate increases when everything is factored into fuel and everything else with respect to your regulatory objectives or your capex objectives -- No, Paul, I hope I didn't give that impression. I mean, our goal is to keep our total bills to customers at or below the CPI index. And if you look back on some of our -- and like in our investor deck, you can see that we've done that over the last five years. Now what -- the other -- you will see increases as well in the kWh rate. But remember that's only one component of a total bill.So we're really focused on keeping bills again, CPI or less as we go through this timeframe. And our analysis says we can with the right deployment of technology and support of public policy. That's really important because you can also make it much more expensive than it needs to be.And that's where we are. -- Okay. And is there any thought of that maybe going to serve a PBR sort of a CPI minus X or something like that if that's sort of the objective maybe and maybe not have all these sort of rate cases and rate proceedings? -- You mean like change the regulatory compact for something around that. -- [Indecipherable] regulatory compact so much as just the regulatory. I mean you guys are going in all the time for rate increases or rate cases if you follow me and they're kind of -- they're -- you're seeing them more about than I do. They can be kind of technical. And what have you in some places around, in some jurisdictions internationally you have something like a CPI minus X -- CPI-X where basically this sort of performance based rate making sort of thing where your rates do, where inflation is taken into account in terms of where your rates are set periodically. -- Yeah. -- I don't know. I just was wondering if there is any thought about something like that or... -- No, I mean, we're always open to new ideas. But I think you have to be pretty cautious when you start addressing those sorts of things, Paul. And we do file a number of cases and we spend a lot of time on calls like this talking about it. But we've got a great track record of managing that. And we got, I think, a very good track record of aligning with policy makers which again on a long-term basis gets you where you need to be. So, my experience some of those mechanisms aren't necessarily good for the companies that have done -- that have those in place. They can be, but they can also be harmful as well. So... Sure. Sure. I was just wondering if there is any thought about that. That's all. I just hearing and I just thought to ask you that, that's all. -- Yeah. Performance based rate making is great, but sometimes it's not symmetrical, I guess. So that's -- so we're pretty pragmatic about that. -- Absolutely. And then, in terms of -- there has been some questions about as you know coal and coal dispatch and you guys major filing in December in Minnesota. I'm just wondering if going forward you see additional activity in that or anything that you guys are looking at in terms of coal plant retirement or any sort of flexibility that might be worked into in terms of potential additional savings that might be enhanced by -- I know you guys are looking at all the time, but in terms of coal plant retirements or dispatch changes that might also drive savings for customers or for you. How should we think about that? I mean, is there anything -- other than what you guys have been doing for some time now, is there any additional sort of things on the horizon? -- Well, I mean, first of all, thank you for recognizing what we do with our coal plants up here. I think -- I mean I think that working with the commission here, I thought that was a great example of partnership. And moving from must run to economic dispatch, I think that was a positive first step. The commission is very interested in understanding how a pause in coal dispatch could work as we start to ready for the day when we don't have any coal in the upper Midwest. So I think it's -- the Midwestern way to kind of be pragmatic about how we approach this going forward. And to your point Paul I think there are opportunities across our system to look at how we dispatch our coal plants particularly when you look at the variable costs of things like steel for fuel and renewable energy. So we're definitely looking at that down in the SPS region. We've got some water issues that we need to address, and that could be solved with some seasonal dispatch. So, again, with economics in mind, so -- yeah, it does look for us -- to look for more opportunities like we're doing here in the upper Midwest. -- Okay, great. Thanks a lot. -- All right. Thank you.Thank you. We have no further questions in queue, I'll turn it back to Bob Frenzel for closing remarks. -- Well, thanks everyone for participating in our call this morning.

"Investors in Xcel Energy Inc (Symbol: XEL) saw new options begin trading this week, for the September 18th expiration.  One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 235 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the XEL options chain for the new September 18th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $65.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.65.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $65.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $62.35 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of XEL, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $66.74/share today.

Because the $65.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 61%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.08% return on the cash commitment, or 6.33% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.


Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Xcel Energy Inc, and highlighting in green where the $65.00 strike is located relative to that history:


   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $70.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.60.  If an investor was to purchase shares of XEL stock at the current price level of $66.74/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $70.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 7.28% if the stock gets called away at the September 18th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if XEL shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Xcel Energy Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing XEL's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $70.00 strike highlighted in red:



   
Considering the fact that the $70.00 strike represents an approximate 5% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 66%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.40% boost of extra return to the investor, or 3.72% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.


The implied volatility in the put contract example is 20%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 16%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $66.74) to be 14%.

"Renewable energy is poised for a decade of epic growth. Utility-scale solar and onshore wind continue to smash through most forecasts from previous years. If favorable economics continue to drive investment in the renewable duo, then utility-scale solar and onshore wind could generate , with all zero-carbon energy sources providing as much as 60%. While many projections expect solar power to eventually become the nation's and the world's top source of electricity, that milestone is still decades away. For now, wind power will continue to dominate the renewable energy landscape. In fact, three factors will make 2020 the biggest year yet for wind power and the  driven by it.Image source: Getty Images.Investors with exposure to renewable energy have come to dread three simple words in recent years: ""lower wind resource."" That phrase has been uttered by electric utilities and power generators since the middle of 2018 to explain why revenue growth stalled compared to the year-ago period in question. The wind drought, as it has come to be called, caused   to miss out on about $18 million in revenue in the first half of 2019. That was equivalent to 6% of total revenue in that span. Meanwhile,   cited lower wind resource as the primary reason it reported a $229 million reduction in first-half revenue for its power generation subsidiary, NextEra Energy Resources, compared with the year-ago period. That was equivalent to roughly 5.5% of the subsidiary's total revenue.Fortunately, the latest numbers suggest the . In the first half of 2019, the United States produced only 1.6% more electricity from onshore wind turbines compared with the same period the previous year. That's despite a 15% surge in installed capacity in that span.  In the second half of 2019 (with data through November), the United States produced 22.4% more electricity from onshore wind turbines compared with the same period in 2018. That outpaced the 17% increase in installed capacity in that span. In other words, a subsiding wind drought and improved technology from newer turbines should allow investors to reap the rewards of wind energy's recent expansion (dating back to capacity growth in 2018) once fourth-quarter and full-year 2019 earnings are released. Then again, the benefits should extend beyond one quarterly report.Image source: Getty Images.The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) expected 12,200 megawatts of wind power to come online in 2019. That would have represented the second-highest level of capacity additions in a single year, behind only the 13,200 megawatts installed in 2012. For comparison, no other year has eclipsed 9,000 megawatts. Most important for investors is the fact that an estimated 6,000 megawatts came online in December 2019. In other words, most of last year's additions weren't reflected in last year's electricity data because they weren't even in operation. When combined with the subsiding wind drought, the new capacity should drive American wind power to significant year-over-year growth in 2020. It's unlikely to be a one-time fluke. Image source: Getty Images.The EIA expects a record 14,300 megawatts of wind power to enter service in 2020. Over 10,000 megawatts is expected to come online from September to December of this year, including 7,200 megawatts in the final month. That four-month figure is enough to increase the nation's total installed capacity by roughly 10%. The growth will be impressive. What might be more impressive is that a handful of companies will be responsible for the lion's share of it. For example,   expects to place 1,922 megawatts of new wind power into service in 2020. That will help the electric utility holding company roughly double the amount of wind it directly owns by the end of 2021. When capacity from power purchase agreements is counted, the company expects to tap into 11,000 megawatts of total wind by the end of 2021. It's all part of the company's ""steel for fuel"" strategy, which aims to replace resource-intensive coal-fired power plants with low-cost wind farms. Xcel Energy expects fuel expenses to represent only 28% of an average customer bill by 2024, down from 47% in 2010. That should also fuel earnings and dividend growth for shareholders, too, to the tune of 5% to 7% per year for the foreseeable future. The extra cash flow should help Xcel Energy divert resources to transmission line investments, which are likely to be the next major obstacle (and opportunity) in renewable energy, since renewables can both cause or relieve grid-level congestion. But those announcements aren't expected until the second half of the decade. For now, and especially in 2020, onshore wind power will continue to dominate the renewable energy landscape.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''.  These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand.  Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).  Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

he federal government was set to run out of funds by Friday, Dec. 20, which injected a rare sense of bipartisan urgency into Congress this week. The legislative branch proposed a new federal budget complete with extensions for a range of tax credits. While many subsidies affect renewable technologies, few stakeholders seem happy with the compromises in the amended federal budget.Individual investors may see things differently. Some renewable energy technologies were surprisingly excluded from the helping hand of tax breaks (for now), but there were clear-cut winners in the proposed budget, too. Here's how it shakes down for several .Image source: Getty Images.The production tax credit (PTC) for wind power projects had been stepping down in value in recent years and was set to roll off the books soon. Under current law, wind farms had to begin construction by the end of 2019 and enter service by the end of 2021 to claim the last available tier of the PTC. Under the new tax extension, projects can begin construction by the end of 2020 -- a full year later -- and be eligible for the PTC. They still must enter service by the end of 2021.Due to the long-term planning and approval process that accompanies electric markets, the one-year extension for construction dates is unlikely to result in any additional power capacity relative to current investment plans. But the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects a whopping 26,500 megawatts of new wind capacity to enter service in 2019 and 2020. Still, the PTC extension could provide a lift to power generators and electric utilities such as , which has 2,022 megawatts of wind power capacity coming on line in 2020 and 2021. It isn't immediately clear how much of that capacity will begin construction in 2020 (and therefore benefit from the PTC extension), but wind farms can begin construction and enter service within the same calendar year if transmission lines are available. Perhaps the extension prompts the company to expedite construction plans. Solar power projects benefit from a different type of subsidy called the investment tax credit (ITC), which allows a portion of the total investment cost to be claimed as a tax benefit. Projects that begin construction by the end of 2019 can claim a 30% deduction. The benefit then steps down to 26% in 2020, drops to 21% in 2021, and finally reduces to 10% in 2022. Under current law, large-scale solar projects can claim the 10% benefit in years after 2022, but the ITC phases out completely for small-scale solar projects. Lawmakers left the phaseout intact. Considering that the ITC provides an average benefit of $5,000 to individual households that invest in rooftop solar, many renewable energy supporters were unhappy that Congress didn't extend the tax credit or remove the phaseout for small-scale projects. That could create headwinds for hardware suppliers such as  . The business is currently the leading global supplier of solar energy inverters and owns over half the residential market in the United States. It plans to expand into energy storage products and smart, integrated inverter solutions to grow its presence in rooftop (small scale), commercial (a mix of small and large scale), and utility (large scale) markets. But with a giant chunk of sales wrapped up in small-scale solar applications, the planned phaseout of the ITC is something investors still need to watch. Image source: Getty Images.The biodiesel industry is one of the single biggest winners in the new federal budget. Congress proposed retroactively reinstating the federal biodiesel excise tax credit (BTC) dating back to the first day of 2018 and extending the subsidy through the end of 2022. The BTC provides a $1 per gallon tax credit to companies that blend biodiesel and renewable diesel into petroleum-based diesel, which are typically the producers of the renewable fuel.  , the nation's largest biodiesel producer, is a clear winner. The business estimates that it will receive a $450 million windfall from renewable fuel production from the start of 2018 through the third quarter of 2019. If production volumes continue to increase in the near future, then the three-year extension could result in an additional $1 billion in total tax credits for the company. The well-run business can use the help. Renewable Energy Group desperately needs to invest in , which is different from biodiesel and chemically similar to petroleum-based diesel. The next-generation fuel also benefits from the lucrative  (LCFS) and appears poised to supplant biodiesel in the long run. With the windfall in hand, the company should be able to finance expansions at its only renewable diesel facility in Louisiana and finalize a proposed joint venture with .Other alternative transportation fuels including natural gas were winners as well, but they comprise a nearly negligible share of the domestic transportation fuels market.   would be a , collecting up to $60 million for production in 2018 and 2019 and additional sums during the three-year extension period.Under current law, automakers are allowed to claim a tax credit of up to $7,500 for each of the first 200,000 electric vehicles (EVs) sold. It's typically passed along to consumers to offset the higher price of such cars.   and   are approaching that ceiling, which prompted them to lobby to raise the cap to 600,000 vehicles. They were unsuccessful, with Bloomberg  that the White House stepped in to squash the effort.Investors will be watching to see if the automaker-specific phaseout of the EV tax credit affects the growth rate of the nascent market. Current plans point to a surge of electrified cars coming out of the industry's pipeline. That's all Tesla makes, of course, but General Motors has 20 battery-powered models launching by 2023 and just invested in a . Essentially every automaker has similar plans to roll out electric lineups in the 2020s. Therefore, without a future tax extension, the growth of the EV market may hinge on automakers accepting lower margins until further technology improvements in battery manufacturing and reliability kick in. Batteries are currently the largest cost of EVs, but if  lives up to its potential, then consumers may be just fine in the long run.The proposed tax credit extensions went to the most mature renewable technologies (wind power and biodiesel) while excluding those that are just getting started and could use a helping hand (small-scale solar and electric vehicles). The extensions also focus on tax credits that directly benefit corporations (electric utilities and renewable fuel producers) instead of consumers (individuals buying rooftop solar arrays or EVs). While few seem to be happy about the results, there are plenty of reasons for optimism when it comes to . Besides, there will be future opportunities to extend tax credits for small-scale solar arrays and EVs.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

As a percentage of XEL's recent stock price of $64.16, this dividend works out to approximately 0.63%, so look for shares of Xcel Energy Inc to trade 0.63% lower — all else being equal — when XEL shares open for trading on 12/24/19.  Similarly, investors should look for POR to open 0.68% lower in price and for HASI to open 1.04% lower, all else being equal.

In general, dividends are not always predictable, following the ups and downs of company profits over time.  Therefore, a good first due diligence step in forming an expectation of annual yield going forward, is looking at the history above, for a sense of stability over time.  This can help in judging whether the most recent dividends from these companies are likely to continue.  If they do continue, the current estimated yields on annualized basis would be 2.52% for Xcel Energy Inc, 2.73% for Portland General Electric Co., and 4.16% for Hannon Armstrong Sustainable Infrastructure Capital Inc.  



		

In Friday trading, Xcel Energy Inc shares are currently up about 0.5%, Portland General Electric Co. shares are up about 0.2%, and Hannon Armstrong Sustainable Infrastructure Capital Inc shares are up about 0.3% on the day.

"he United Nations just issued a report card detailing the effectiveness of the world's collective efforts to reduce emissions in recent years. Judging by the name -- the Emissions Gap Report 2019 -- you can tell that the global economy didn't earn a passing grade.The report details the real-world outcomes of policies, or the lack thereof, from the top emitters of planet-warming gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2). The latest numbers from 2018 reveal that the global economy isn't delivering on obligations under major climate change pacts, such as the Paris Agreement, which means future action will need to be more dramatic, since it will need to deliver steep reductions in a compressed time frame. To be fair, the Emissions Gap Report 2019 noted that there are still paths to meeting the 2030 obligations for limiting global warming by the end of the century. It also noted that China and India are the two countries most responsible for blowing the planet's carbon budget. But that's not what most media outlets reported, many of which singled out the United States. Here's why investors shouldn't panic over the report. Image source: Getty Images.As  wrote about the report, ""Net carbon emissions from the two largest polluters, the United States and China, are expanding."" That's not an accurate portrayal.The United States saw emissions increase from 2017 to 2018, but worrying over a year-to-year increase in emissions for something as complex as the world's largest economy is the equivalent of obsessing over the week-to-week movements of a stock. Those willing to ditch the short-term thinking will see concrete reasons for optimism.Looking back, the United States has cut total annual emissions 14% from 2005 to 2017, which represents a reduction of 862 million tons of annual CO2 output -- by far the most of any country in that span. By comparison, China increased annual emissions by 4.07 billion tons of CO2 in that span -- equivalent to 77% of America's total today. China now emits nearly twice as much planet-warming gases as the United States. Looking forward, specifically at utility-level data that don't appear in the most widely cited projections, the United States is on pace to generate at least 30% of its total electricity from onshore wind and utility-scale solar by 2030. That's up from just 10% today. That's also likely to be a . The total could be as much as 40% -- and that doesn't include zero-carbon contributions from hydropower (another 6% or so), small-scale solar (one-third of the nation's total solar output today), offshore wind (up to an additional 3% by 2030 from nothing today), or nuclear (19% today). With nearly all of the lost market share  (responsible for 1.26 billion tons of CO2 emissions in 2018, or 26% of America's total emissions), the United States is on the cusp of a massive reduction in CO2 emissions in the next decade. Electric utilities, far from being the climate-naive corporations they're often made out to be, are leading the way.Image source: Getty Images.  became the first American utility to commit to delivering 100% zero-carbon energy by 2050. It leaned on wind and solar for 22% of its electricity mix in 2018, although that should increase to 46% in 2027 and . The company's CO2 emissions are on pace to drop 80% from 2005 to 2030.Shareholders can expect the business to grow earnings per share (EPS) and the dividend payout 5% to 7% per year. Xcel Energy expects to maintain a payout ratio of at least 60%, which should become easier as it becomes more reliant on renewable energy generation, since wind and solar don't have refueling expenses once put into service. That makes it a  for long-term investors.   is similarly ambitious, albeit for a different reason. The company's power generation unit, NextEra Energy Resources (NEER), builds wind and solar infrastructure for utilities across the country. That gives it unparalleled insight into the market -- and it thinks an inflection point is near.NextEra Energy projects that, on average, wind and solar energy will generate electricity at a lower cost than natural gas by 2023 -- even when energy storage is included. That's expected to lead to more than 30,000 megawatts of new wind and solar power capacity additions , which could allow the United States to rely on onshore wind and utility-scale solar for up to 40% of its electricity demand by 2030.Similarly, the company's focus on low-carbon and zero-carbon power sources has been great for business. Shareholders are expecting EPS growth of 6% to 8% through 2021 (relative to 2018 levels) and dividend-per-share growth of 12% to 14% through 2020 (relative to 2017). The Emissions Gap Report 2019 from the United Nations rightfully observes that the world's leading economies could be doing more to lock in emissions reductions. That's also true for the United States, which has largely abandoned any concrete climate action at the federal level. The silver lining is that the falling costs of wind and solar energy have the country on pace to meet its former pledges under the Clean Power Plan and Paris Agreement through at least 2025 (and possibly through 2030). Throw in a wave of electric vehicles coming in the 2020s and an abundance of natural gas that can be slung across the planet as liquefied natural gas (LNG), and there are plenty of reasons for optimism when it comes to emission reduction efforts. The reality is that global climate goals come down to whether China and India can find ways to decouple economic growth and middle-class expansion from unchecked CO2 increases. But that doesn't fit neatly in a headline or play well on .When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and NextEra Energy wasn't one of them!

"n trading on Tuesday, shares of Xcel Energy Inc (Symbol: XEL) entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $60.595 per share.  We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.  


In the case of Xcel Energy Inc, the RSI reading has hit 29.8 — by comparison, the universe of energy stocks covered by  currently has an average RSI of 50.9, the RSI of  is at 57.1, the RSI of  is presently 72.2, and the  RSI is 46.8.

A bullish investor could look at XEL's 29.8 reading as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.


Looking at a chart of one year performance (below), XEL's low point in its 52 week range is $47.70 per share, with $66.05 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $60.66.  Xcel Energy Inc shares are currently trading off about 1.6% on the day.

"2019 was a stupendous year for the markets overall, with stocks in ""boring"" sectors like utilities also joining the rally. The , which measures the performances of the 15 largest utility stocks listed in the U.S., rose a solid 23% in 2019. Strong earnings growth was a key driving factor for the sector, even as investors wary of the growing global geopolitical and economic concerns dipped their fingers into dividend-paying defensive .2020 could be another good year for utilities, but if you really want to buy some utility stocks now, you need to look beyond one year and find companies that are positioning themselves for growth in the years to come.  ,  , and   are three such attractive utility stocks.There's one common link -- or, rather, a growth driver -- among these utilities: investments in .Consolidated Edison runs two primary regulated electricity and gas units: Consolidated Edison Company of New York and Orange & Rockland Utilities. Together, the two units supply electricity to nearly 3.6 million customers and gas to roughly 1.2 million customers in and around New York City. But Con Ed isn't just any other utility. Image source: Getty Images.Not many know that Con Ed is now the second-largest solar power producer in North America thanks to its acquisition of solar assets from  last year. While clean energy currently contributes only 6% to the company's earnings (adjusted), Con Ed expects that to double in the next couple of decades. Between 2019 and 2022, the company aims to pump $1 billion into its clean energy business.Investment in clean energy should supplement Con Ed's other growth plans. Overall, the utility aims to invest $12 billion through 2022, with the bulk of it going toward modernizing and expanding its utilities. That's necessary, as regulated utilities are required to spend money on upgrading assets to get any hikes in rates approved by the regulatory authorities. So far, Con Ed has delivered well, as evidenced by the stability in its earnings and  in recent years. data by .With plenty of cash flowing in, Con Ed decided to reward shareholders more richly by increasing dividends at a compound annual rate of 3.3% in the past five years compared to 1.3% between 2010 and 2014. Con Ed, in fact, is a  with an unbeatable 45-year streak of consecutive annual dividend increases. That's among the best in the sector. With a comfortable long-term target dividend payout of 60% to 70% of adjusted earnings, capital expenditure plans in place, and renewed focus on clean energy, Con Ed shouldn't fail patient investors. Dominion Energy has long been one of my , and I still recommend the stock today despite a slowdown in dividend growth.Dominion spooked income investors mid-last year when it announced a  for dividends. So after two consecutive years of 10% hikes in dividends, Dominion increased its dividend by only 2.5% in December 2019 and expects to maintain this rate in the foreseeable future. So why should you still invest in this stock?You see, Dominion still expects its operating earnings per share to grow at an encouraging  (CAGR) of 5% between 2020 and 2023. More importantly, a lower dividend payout is more a near-term pain but a potential long-term gain for shareholders, simply because Dominion is freeing up cash to invest in growth and maintain its . A good rating broadly confirms a manageable debt level and the company's ability to repay debt.Dominion, which currently serves 7.5 million customers across 18 states, projects its base rate to grow at a CAGR of 7% between 2018 and 2023, driven by a 40% rise in the value of total property. The company plans to spend $26 billion across operations between 2019 and 2023, including the Atlantic Coast pipeline. Beyond 2023, its proposed largest offshore wind farm in the country, with more than 200 wind turbines, will be the project to watch. By 2030, Dominion aims to reduce carbon emissions by 55%.In short, Dominion Energy has a lot going for it and remains a top utility stock to own.Xcel Energy was among the top-performing utility stocks last year, powered by strong earnings and cash flows. Xcel supplies electricity to 3.6 million customers and natural gas to 2 million customers through four operating companies across eight Western and Midwestern states, including the Permian oil and gas basin region located in western Texas and southeastern New Mexico. The Permian Basin, in fact, is  for the utility in recent months. Xcel intends to spend $3.8 billion, or 17% of total planned capital spending, on its Southwestern Public Services (SPS) utility through 2024. SPS serves Texas and Mexico. data by .What I like most about Xcel is its clearly outlined goals for the long term. For instance, Xcel expects growth in the next five years to be driven by investments in natural gas, transmission, and grid advancement, and conscious efforts to replace coal with cleaner energy sources to fire up its plants. Xcel, in fact, was the  operations by 2050. The company also foresees opportunity in electric-vehicle infrastructure.Management's medium-term goals look encouraging:A strong base rate growth, combined with its focus on renewables, should help Xcel Energy unlock greater value for shareholders in the years to come.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, , has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Xcel Energy wasn't one of them!

"nvestors in Xcel Energy Inc (Symbol: XEL) saw new options become available this week, for the January 2020 expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the XEL options chain for the new January 2020 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $55.00 strike price has a current bid of 25 cents.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $55.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $54.75 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of XEL, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $61.07/share today.

Because the $55.00 strike represents an approximate 10% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 96%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 0.45% return on the cash commitment, or 2.96% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.


Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Xcel Energy Inc, and highlighting in green where the $55.00 strike is located relative to that history:


   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $65.00 strike price has a current bid of 20 cents.  If an investor was to purchase shares of XEL stock at the current price level of $61.07/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $65.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 6.76% if the stock gets called away at the January 2020 expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if XEL shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Xcel Energy Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing XEL's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $65.00 strike highlighted in red:



   
Considering the fact that the $65.00 strike represents an approximate 6% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 85%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 0.33% boost of extra return to the investor, or 2.13% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.


The implied volatility in the put contract example is 24%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 16%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $61.07) to be 16%.

This outlook suggests that companies focused on the sector have a bright future.Three such companies are  ,  , and  . Here's why they all look like excellent long-term buys right now, especially for investors seeking a lower-risk way to invest in renewables.Image source: Getty Images.Atlantica Yield is a . These are companies focused on generating stable cash flow from operating clean energy assets, the bulk of which they pay out to investors via a high-yielding dividend. Atlantica's payout currently yields 6.4%, which is more than three times that of the .Atlantica has a bit of a broader mandate than some of its peers, as it focuses on operating sustainable infrastructure assets. These include not only renewable energy generating facilities, but also those powered by cleaner-burning natural gas, as well as electricity transmission lines and water desalinization plants. The company sells the capacity of these assets under long-term, fee-based contracts, which enable it to generate predictable cash flow that it uses to pay its dividend.What makes its payout even more attractive for investors is that Atlantica expects to increase it by an 8% to 10% compound annual rate through 2022. Powering its growth plan is the company's ability to invest in expanding its sustainable infrastructure portfolio. Over the past 12 months alone, it has committed to invest $320 million into several high-return opportunities.These have included expanding its existing transmission lines in Peru, acquiring a gas plant in Mexico, and buying a utility-scale wind farm in Uruguay. These investments have the company well on track with its dividend-growth plan, making it an excellent income stock to consider buying for the long haul.Brookfield Renewable Partners is also a renewable yieldco. It has a slightly different focus than Atlantica in that the majority of its portfolio consists of hydroelectric power-generating facilities, though it also owns wind, solar, and energy storage assets. The company sells the power these assets produce under long-term, fixed-price power contracts, enabling it to generate steady cash flow to support its 4.3%-yielding dividend.Brookfield currently expects to grow that payout by 5% to 9% per year through 2024. Powering its plan is the company's efforts to increase the cash flow of its legacy assets, as well as build and buy additional renewable generating facilities. In the company's view, it can grow its cash flow by 9% to 16% annually over that time frame as it invests another $4 billion into expanding its renewable platform. That high-speed growth, when combined with its high-yielding dividend, puts Brookfield in the position to generate .Xcel Energy is a  with operations focused mostly on the Midwest. At the moment, it gets the majority of its power from fossil fuels, as coal supplied 33% last year while natural gas contributed 29% against 13% from nuclear and just 22% from renewables.That mix, however, will shift dramatically in the coming years. The utility has a bold plan to become . One of the key components of that shift is to make renewables a much larger portion of its energy mix, with it aiming to get 46% of its power from alternatives by 2027.Xcel Energy believes that these investments should enable it to grow its earnings per share by 5% to 7% per year through at least 2024. That should allow it to increase its 2.6%-yielding dividend at a similar yearly pace. This forecast could support total annual returns in the 8% to 10% range, which sets it up to potentially outperform the S&P 500. That's something it has done by a wide margin over the last decade.Atlantica Yield, Brookfield Renewable, and Xcel Energy are focusing on the lower risk side of the renewable sector by operating cash-flow generating assets. That approach will give them the funds to invest in expanding their portfolios so that they can keep increasing their above-average dividends. That should enable them to generate market-beating returns with less risk, which makes them excellent renewable energy stocks to buy right now with the long term in mind.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

(RTTNews) - Xcel Energy Inc. (XEL) narrowed its 2019 earnings guidance to $2.60 to $2.65 per share from $2.55 to $2.65 per share. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect the company to report profit per share of $2.62. Analysts' estimates typically exclude special items. Xcel Energy's 2020 ongoing earnings guidance is a range of $2.73 to $2.83 per share. Analysts expect the company to report profit per share of $2.79.For the long-term, the company targets to deliver annual earnings per share growth of 5 percent to 7 percent off of a 2019 base of $2.60 per share, which represents the mid-point of the original 2019 guidance range. Also, the company expects to deliver annual dividend increases of 5 percent to 7 percent over the long-term.For the third-quarter, ongoing earnings was $1.01 per share, compared to $0.96, prior year. On average, nine analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected the company to report profit per share of $1.03, for the quarter. Analysts' estimates typically exclude special items. The company said its third-quarter earnings reflect higher electric margins primarily due to non-fuel riders and regulatory rate outcomes and lower O&M expenses, partially offset by lower AFUDC, increased depreciation and interest expenses.Third-quarter total operating revenues declined to $3.01 billion from $3.05 billion, prior year. Analysts expected revenue of $3.47 billion, for the quarter.

"Image source: The Motley Fool. Q3 2019 , Good day and welcome to the Xcel Energy's Third Quarter 2019 . Questions will only be taken from institutional investors. Reporters can contact media relations with inquiries and individual investors and others can reach out to Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions]At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Paul Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. -- Good morning and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2019 third quarter . Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Frenzel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have other members of the management team available to answer your questions.This morning, we will review our 2019 third quarter results, discuss earnings guidance, update our financial plans and objectives and also update you on recent business and regulatory developments. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our website.As a reminder, some of the comments during today's conference call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC.On today's call, we will discuss certain metrics that are non-GAAP measures including ongoing earnings and electric and natural gas margins. Information on comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations are included in our earnings release.With that, I'll turn the call over to Ben. -- Thank you, Paul, and good morning everyone. Let's start with earnings. Today, we reported third quarter earnings of $1.01 per share compared to $0.96 per share last year. Three quarters of the year behind us, we are on track to deliver earnings in the upper half of our guidance range. Consistent with our third quarter tradition, we've updated our investment plan, which now reflects $22 billion of capital expenditures over the next five years. This represents rate base growth of 6.7% of 2019 base year. Our updated capital forecast is of course driven by our investment in renewables, as we continue the clean energy transition. The forecast also includes investment in our Advanced Grid initiative, expenditures to improve the customer experience, additional investment in the transmission system to maintain asset health and reliability, and a natural gas combined-cycle plant and our Sherco facility to ensure reliability as we retire coal plants.This represents a base capital forecast and we are also confident that there are likely additional upside investment opportunities not included in this base plant. We're also initiating 2020 guidance of $2.73 per share to $2.83 per share, which is consistent with our 5% to 7% long-term EPS growth objective. We are very excited about our plan which provides customer value, delivers attractive returns for investors and keeps customer bills low.Next, let me update you on our PPA buyouts and wind projects. In September, the Minnesota Commission denied our proposal to acquire the Mankato combined-cycle plant as a rate base asset. Over its life, we believe the Mankato asset brings tremendous value and reliability to the system, especially as we retire coal plants. As a result, we have filed to acquire Mankato as a non-regulated asset and assume the existing PPAs with NSP-Minnesota which run through 2026 and 2039. We anticipate the acquisition will generate utility-like returns over the life of the asset.However, we expect the non-regulated returns will be lower in the near term as the benefits are back-end loaded. We've made wholesale generation filings at FERC and affiliate interest filings with the Minnesota Commission and we expect approval in December or January. We believe that our PPA buyout strategy can provide significant customer benefits. As a result, we'll continue to evaluate customer beneficial acquisition opportunities and we'll proactively work with our stakeholders to identify the costs and benefits of the transactions.Please note our capital forecast does not include any incremental PPA acquisitions. Our two proposed wind PPA acquisitions, Longroad and Mower produced significant savings for our customers and these benefits are front-end loaded as the PTCs would flow back to customers in the first 10 years.We expect the Minnesota Commission decision on Longroad by the end of the year and Mower in the first half of 2020. We continue to achieve important milestones in our nation-leading wind expansion. We have completed the development phase of our 522-megawatt Sagamore wind project in New Mexico, with construction slated to begin later this year and commercial operation expected by the end of 2020.In the Upper Midwest, a developer scaled back the Crowned Ridge wind project by 200 megawatts due to increased MISO transmission and interconnection cost. We had planned to own 100 megawatts of Crowned Ridge as a build-own-transfer project. While this has an immaterial impact on our capital forecast, it does highlight the need to expand transmission investment to address congestion and ensure the viability of future renewable projects.As a result, we, like the Blues Brothers, are on a mission to put the band back together again, and we are working with the original capex 2020 utilities which built over $2 billion of transmission projects in the Upper Midwest over the last 10 years. We expect similar constraints and investment opportunities in SPP and Colorado as well. While it's not in our five-year forecast and it will take some time to develop and implement plans, the need for additional transmission highlights the long runway for capital investment for Xcel Energy.With that, let me turn the call over to Bob, who will provide more detail on our financial results and outlook and a regulatory update. Bob? -- Thanks, Ben, and good morning everyone. We recorded third quarter earnings of $1.01 per share compared with $0.96 per share in 2018. Most significant earnings drivers for the quarter include higher electric and natural gas margins, which increased earnings by $0.08 per share, including various regulatory outcomes and riders to recover our capital investments.Lower O&M expenses increased earnings by $0.02 per share. In addition, our lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.03 per share. However, the majority of the lower effective tax rate is due to an increase in production tax credits which flow back to customers through electric margin and tax reform impacts, both of which are largely earnings neutral.Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation, interest and other taxes reflecting our capital investment program, which reduced earnings by $0.04 per share. And lower AFUDC due to projects going into service decreased earnings by $0.04 per share.Turning to sales, our year-to-date weather-adjusted electric sales declined by 0.3%, reflecting continued strong customer growth offset by lower use per customer and expected discrete declines in certain large customer usage due to co-generation.Year-to-date weather-adjusted natural gas sales increased 3.2% as a result of strong customer growth and higher use per customer. For 2019, we anticipate relatively flat electric sales and natural gas sales growth of 2% to 3% growth, reflecting year-to-date performance. Turning to O&M and consistent with our expectations, our quarterly expenses decreased by $13 million, reflecting lower costs in our nuclear and fossil plant operations.Year-to-date O&M expenses are above last year, largely due to expense timing, but also due to higher-than-expected storm costs. We expect lower costs for nuclear operations and fossil plant outages in the fourth quarter. And as a reminder, we increased O&M spending in the second half of 2018 due to the impact of hot weather as well as environmental remediation and business efficiency improvements. Accordingly, we expect our full year 2019 O&M expenses will decline by 1% to 2% from 2018 levels.Let me provide a quick regulatory update. Earlier this month, we filed rebuttal testimony in our Colorado electric rate case and revised our request. We are now seeking an increase of $108 million based on a current test year, with a capital reach forward through June 19 and an equity ratio of 55.7% and an ROE of 10.2%. Intervenors filed testimony and the Commission Staff recommended an ROE of 9% and an equity ratio of 55.6% and a current test year, with a capital reach forward through June 2019 with an average rate base. During start November and we expect the commission decision in December with new rates effective January of 2020. We also have electric rate cases in New Mexico and Texas. SPS is seeking an increase of $51 million in New Mexico based on a historic test year, with a capital reach forward and an equity ratio of 54.8% and an ROE of 10.35%.While in Texas, SPS is seeking an increase of $136 million based on a historic test year and equity ratio of 54.7% and an ROE of 10.35%. The request largely reflects investment for the Hale wind project as well as other capital to support strong growth in the region. Both cases are in the discovery phase with not much to report. As a reminder, both the Texas and New Mexico Commissions previously granted a Certificate of Need and current recovery mechanisms for Hale. We anticipate final rates going into effect in 2020.Turning to earnings guidance, in the fourth quarter, we expect favorability in O&M margin and sales. In addition, depreciation and amortization expense will moderate due to the timing of lower levels of prepaid pension amortization in Colorado. As a result, we are narrowing our 2019 earnings guidance range to $2.60 to $2.65 per share, which represents the upper half of the original guidance range of $2.55 to $2.65 per share. As Ben noted, we are initiating our 2020 earnings guidance range of $2.73 to $2.83 per share, which is consistent with our long-term EPS growth objective of 5% to 7%. Please note that the 2020 EPS guidance is based on several assumptions, which are detailed in our earnings release.I wanted to highlight a couple of items. We assume constructive regulatory outcomes in all proceedings. We expect electric and natural gas sales growth of approximately 1%, which includes the impact of leap year. We anticipate an effective tax rate of approximately 0% largely driven by wind production tax credits, which are credited to customers and have no impact on earnings.Finally, we expect O&M expenses to increase 2%, which reflects increased cost for new wind projects coming online. Please note wind O&M is recovered in riders in most jurisdiction is offset by fuel savings. In our earnings release, you'll find more details about our updated $22 billion five-year capital forecast, which reflects investments to support continued customer growth, improvements in safety and reliability, the enablement of renewable generation and automated metering for our customers.Our capital plan results in annual rate base growth of approximately 6.7% using 2019 as a base. Importantly, the rate base growth rate would be 7.3% if we would maintain 2018 as the base year. Our updated capital investment plan is supportive of our 5% to 7% long-term earnings growth objective, and our goal is to deliver EPS and dividend growth in the upper half of the range.We've also updated our financing plan which reflects a combination of internal cash generation and operating company and holding company debt to finance the majority of our capital expenditures. In addition, we expect to issue $1 billion of incremental market equity over the next three years and $400 million of DRIP and benefits equity to fund our capital plan and support our credit ratings.Our financial plan reflects incremental capital investment of approximately $2.5 billion for the period of 2020 to 2023 as compared with our previous capital forecast. This incremental equity will allow us to fund accretive capital investment opportunities, which benefit our customers while maintaining our solid credit metrics and favorable access to the capital markets.With that, I'll wrap up. We are continuing to make progress in our wind development efforts in our PPA buyout strategy with the recently announced Mower project. We are going forward with the Mankato acquisition due to the strong value the asset provides over the long term. We are well positioned to deliver earnings in the upper half of our 2019 earnings guidance range. We've announced a robust updated capital investment program, which provides strong, transparent rate base growth and customer value.We've initiated 2020 EPS guidance of $2.73 to $2.83, which is consistent with our long-term objective. Finally, we're very confident that we can deliver long-term EPS growth in the upper half of our 5% to 7% objective range. This concludes our prepared remarks. And operator, we'll take a few questions.[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Greg Gordon with Evercore. -- Thanks. Great outlook, guys. Just a couple of questions. You've had a lot of rate cases pending and when you think about the range of potential outcomes in terms of things that might influence financial results like return on equity, how do you sort of flex for that when you think about the guidance range? And do you contemplate with interest rates this low that the direction of travel on ROEs might still be modestly lower than where we are today? -- I think, Greg, that's a great question. I mean, we do recognize that we have some modest risk which we have incorporated into our range, but I think we've got a lot of things going for us. I mean, first of all, we're very much aligned with our commissions on what we're doing with the clean energy transition. It's good to have their support with that. I think second of all, if you think about it, we certainly don't have above market ROEs today. And then finally, if you look at some data points on some of the cases that we have decided recently, they kind of point to a reasonable ROE.So we always know we don't get everything we asked for of course and I think we're very comfortable with the guidance we set forth. -- That was my only question. Thank you. Have a great day. -- Thanks, Greg.Moving on, we'll hear from Christopher Turnure with JP Morgan. -- Good morning, Chris. -- Good morning Ben and Bob. Increasing transmission investment is a little bit of a newer theme for you guys or kind of a return to maybe an older theme. Just wondering if there's higher risk to this plan due to size of projects being larger or regulatory approvals that are needed here and I know your renewable investments really tail off in the next two years or three years, but I guess to the degree that you're successful here, is there kind of upside to those renewables numbers? -- Two parts to the question, I guess, the last part, we don't have any renewables scheduled because we try to sync up that renewable portfolio with our IRP plans. And as you know, Chris, we expect to retire coal plants in the mid 20s [Phonetic] and that's when this next round of renewables, which will be very significant will come through.One of the benefits we've had with our Steel for Fuel program is we've created headroom on consumer bills to do more investment and grid infrastructure, and the investment we're talking about, Chris, isn't really going to require the regulatory approval, because it's not the big transmission line site referred to when I said we're getting the band back together. Again, this is asset health, this is reliability and this is the support some of the renewables that we already have out there. -- Okay, that's good to hear. And then I guess, incremental $1 billion of equity needs are technically over the five-year plan. Can you kind of give us a sense as to the timing and maybe structure of that within the five-year end? -- Yeah, Chris, in my prepared remarks, I mentioned we probably do it over the next three years. And historically, the company has looked at a bunch of different products. We've used ATM programs, we've used block deals in the past, I think we look at a various mix of products, I think they will come in -- obviously more than one offering. And so I just think we will be measured about it and we will execute it in line with our cash needs as we look forward over the next three years. -- Okay, thanks for that guys. -- Thank you.Next up, we'll take a question from Ali Agha with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. -- Thank you. Good morning. -- Hey, good morning. -- Ben, I may have missed this right at the opening, but when you look at the $22 billion five-year capex, obviously you roll forward. So it's not apples to apples with your last five years, but even for the years that are completed in both, what's the main sort of upside to the numbers? And in the past, you've talked about your base plan and then you've laid out, quantified your upside plan, etc.. This time, it looks like everything is in one plan. So, are all of these projects now approved and ready to go, or are there certain placeholders in this $22 billion number? -- I think for the most part this is stuff we know we can execute on. As I had mentioned on the previous call, the transmission and distribution spend, those are things that are really in the normal course of business, and we have a lot of opportunities to invest in our grid. I've always said, as you know that those sorts of investments are always capped at the willingness for the consumer to pay. So to the extent we can do things like Steel for Fuel and our efficiency initiatives and take advantage of falling commodity prices, you create that headroom. So we're quite confident in the $22 billion. And I think your second part was, correct me if I am wrong, you wanted to know about upsides in the capital forecast? -- Yeah, I guess it was kind of two parts as well. One, in your existing $22 billion, what has gone up versus what you were thinking when you had last put out your capex, and then this time you don't have like a base case upside case. So is everything now all in one plan? -- Yeah, this is Bob. I think that's the right way to think about it. We recognize that in the back years of our plan, we may have structurally under forecasted some items and I think we spent a lot of time with the operations in the businesses this year, looking at their asset needs and trying to get everything into a single plan to make it simple and easy for the investor to understand. So I think what you're seeing here is the compilation of probably six months worth of good work by the company trying to identify projects in the back part of the plan that maybe we might not have gotten identified in previous plan.So I think we've melded base and what we may have historically called upside or unidentified, I do think though and I think Ben was going to comment on upside, and I think there are items that aren't embedded in this plan. I think Ben mentioned, one, which is continuation of our PPA buyout strategy. We think we've got 10,000 megawatts to 11,000 megawatts of PPAs that the company procures today from third-party owners and we still think there's opportunities out there to find customer beneficial acquisitions. None of that's included in the $22 billion. -- I got you. -- And it's clear, while renewables that we put into our capital forecast usually come out of the IRP process, we believe there might be some opportunities to add some renewables too, but just not identified yet which is why they're upside. -- Got you. And one other question, when I look at your weather normalized sales trends broken out on a quarterly pattern, third quarter, we saw a pretty big negative. You had been trending positive through the first two quarters on the electric sales side. So anything that has changed that caused the negative run in the third quarter? -- I'll take a stab at it and maybe Bob augment it. First of all, I would never -- when we've had good quarters, we tell you don't take that as a trend. When we have a little bit off, we tell you don't take that as a trend. What we did know as Bob mentioned in his remarks that we did have some C&I customers that we're self-generating through co-gen etc., and that was planned. We knew about it. So that's the big issue there. -- Yeah, the only thing I'd add to it is we have seen some softness in the sand mining industry and fracking in Wisconsin, some of that attributable to competing product around the country and some softness in the gas markets broadly. -- Got you. Thank you. -- Thank you.Next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie. -- Thank you. Okay. So one question, in your prepared remarks, you didn't mention anything about a potential settlement in your Colorado rate case. Should we still expect it? I see that there is an October 30 deadline for filing. Could you comment on that? -- Well, listen, the time that we would get to enter into settlement discussions, Angie, would be after rebuttal. So that's the period now and there has been some outreach and some work being done, but we don't have anything to report to you or we would. And as you know, it's scheduled for hearings, I think, in the first week of November. So maybe something will come up in that time frame, but if we have something to report, we would tell you. -- Okay. And secondly, this Mankato acquisition on an unregulated basis at least caught me by surprise. And you're mentioning those buyouts of existing renewable PPAs, would those be also unregulated or are you talking about basically converting PPAs into rate based renewables? -- Well, our approach is always going to be let's find customer beneficial acquisition opportunities through PPAs and let's offer them to our customers. And so, our plan is always to put them in rate base. In the case of Mankato, the Department and ultimately the Commission decided that the benefits were too back-end loaded, some variances in how we modeled those benefits and they decided that they didn't want it in rate base. However, we still believe it's a very valuable asset and that it belongs in our portfolio. So we went forward with a non-regulated based approach. But Angie, this isn't a change in strategy or anything else, we always want to see this. We wouldn't bring something to our Commission, so we didn't think at a customer benefit. If there are disputes along the way, then we have to adjust to that depending on the situation, but that's always going to be plan B, not plan A. -- Angie, these are all still long-dated PPA contracts from the assets to one of our regulated operating companies, in this case NSPM. So we do like the credit counter party, we do like the optics of the transaction. I think it works for shareholders and customers alike. And so you should expect us to move forward with the Mankato one. On the wind projects, our preference is to own them in rate base. I think they're really beneficial for the customers, but if they don't, we've made a pre-emptive filing at FERC to move those to wholesale as well. But again as Ben said, I don't think this is a strategic shift. It's just a recognition of their good assets that serve our customers and we're willing to own them. -- Yeah, and we still see plenty of opportunities, as Bob previously mentioned, to find those PPA buyout opportunities, and of course, we're in eight states, not just one or two states. So, there are across all of our jurisdictions. -- It's just that -- and I obviously accept your explanation -- it is just that in a sense, you're acting as a financial investor here and typically when we see these types of acquisitions, you know, contract base to what's seemingly similar economics, at least I would take it as a sign that you're running out of growth options in the regulated because that's a superior growth profile at least from a risk perspective, and I understand that Mankato could be a one-off, but you're basically saying that that's not the case here, that was just an exceptional situation here. -- Well, Angie, I have to tell you, I think we have the most transparent growth of our organic system, which is the $22 billion that we put forth, and we think even beyond the forecast period, we'll continue to see excellent opportunities to grow the system. We're creating headroom with things like Steel for Fuel to keep bills low, so that we can make those investments and not overburden customers. I think that's a very important consideration. The PPA buyout strategies which is pure upside to a very robust base capital plan. So, and this is not a strategic change. You're not going to see us look for opportunities to come in as a financial investor. This is a situation where we had some modeling differences on the benefit. Bob mentioned, we had two other wind proposals in front of the Commission. The difference there is these benefits are very much front-end loaded. And I think there is a preference in Minnesota that owned renewables over gas. So we'll see where that goes. But again I think we are quite proud of the pure play vertically integrated regulated utility that we are. -- Awesome, thank you. -- Thanks, Angie.Next we'll hear from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. -- Hey, Steve. -- Hi, good morning. Could you just maybe talk a little bit more on what is happening with the MISO transmission situation renewables and how congested it is and just what is needed in your region to half renewables half, you know, more reasonable cost access? -- Well, you know, the work we did with capex 2020 opened up the door for a lot of renewables, but it's starting, to your point, to get constrained and I do think long term, we're going to need more transmission development in the region to make sure we can continue to see renewables come into the MISO market. That said, Steve, I think we have some opportunities in the interim to squeeze out, if you will, the transmission capacity that is available. And we're looking at those opportunities, and of course some of the transmission that we are building in the next few years will help with that as well. -- Okay. Is this something where you can kind of expand transmission on existing footprints or you need to get access to kind of new areas? -- Well, I think, you certainly there is obviously a lot of work done with the new FERC rules on how that relates to existing transmission and repurposing and there is, I think there'll be some opportunities in the market around that. -- Okay. -- Steve. Longer term, I mean this is a longer-term issue that we're working on and when Ben said we're getting the band back together, capex 2020 was a very successful consortium of transmission owners and MISO that came together and formulated a plan and executed on it very successfully. I think that, that group is back together, put out a press release on it three weeks or four weeks ago trying to come up with solutions and partnership with MISO for longer-term transmission access and this is going to be probably not in our current capital plan, but more like in years five through 15 of where we're going to see much more regional, we expect to see more regional transmission to enable exactly what you're talking about. -- Which does sync up very nicely to our plans to retire coal plants. So, our emphasis particularly in MISO would be more heavily toward solar, which at least the initial tranches of which have a better planning capacity, Steve, if you will, then wind which is by far the best energy type source. -- Okay. And then just on the Colorado case, I know that I think the settlement time line is really in the next like week or two, and it sounds like you can't really talk about whether you're going to be able to settle or not, but if we don't see something by then, should we then assume you're probably not going to be able to settle? -- Well, I think you had the time frame right. The time for settlement is right after rebuttal before hearings. So we've got that week or two window to try to get something done. If I had something to definitive report, I would, but I don't want you to think that we're not interested in pursuing a settlement. -- Steve, there's real benefits with the settlement, but there's also -- from a timing perspective, the hearings are first week in November, Commission decision is expected in December and new rates in January. So time lines are relatively compressed anyway in terms of when we go from hearing to final rates. So the clock itself is not a driver. -- Okay, thank you.Next question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. -- Hey, good morning team. -- Hey Julien. -- Hey, howdy. Perhaps if I can just follow-up on the last set of questions, just real quickly on the MISO transmission piece. You know, Internet connection queue issues have been around and accelerating off late. It sounds like you guys are really working on this. Can you talk a little bit about the time line? You talked about this transmission 2020 effort, MISO's talking about MVP again, we've heard this from other period, so can you elaborate a little bit on what this process would look like, whether at MISO or with your peers and that process again? You talked about the five years to 15-year plan, but even more tangibly in the planning process in the next 12 months, how does this play out? -- I think there is still a bit of uncertainty, Julien, around the MISO transmission planning process. We're obviously a large transmission owner, and MISO, and are participating with them in the process. Our own group, I'll call it the capex 2020 group getting back together, it is still in its early days in terms of identifying time lines for engineering studies and how this might progress. I don't think this is a very quick process. I think this is going to take at least five years through planning before we start getting into real capital plans and construction time frames. And so I don't want to suggest that something is going to change in the next 12 months to 18 months in terms of congestion in the MISO region. And we're seeing similar stuff in SPP as well in terms of just congestion in queue is being backed up and projects being assessed with significant upgrade costs. -- And then, Julien, remember when this does get built, we have some pretty active right of first refusal legislation in some of our key states. So we're excited about the opportunity to build transmission and without getting too specific into details, we do see some opportunities to utilize existing transmission and other existing queue access to not slow down our plans in the meantime. -- Excellent. And if I can go back to the Mankato stuff. Just with respect to the fuel type, I mean I suppose my initial reaction was thinking that this might be more of a gas versus renewables question, can you talk or elaborate a little bit more about the context behind this decision? Obviously, I think, Angie said it before, she was surprised. How would you characterize it? Is there any specific angle here to be focused on in terms of understanding this decision versus the others proposed? -- I mean it's just weighing of the benefits. I think there, I think renewables definitely have a preference with our Commission than gas, but I think it also comes down to the modeling, and we're working with the Department to make sure we have a more consistent modeling approach as we go into the IRP process, I think that's important, Julien. But let me just step back, the IRRs of Mankato are good for shareholders. We think we would have preferred to have Mankato owned by our customers because that's always our first preference, and that's our core strategy. But we didn't want to walk away from this asset, we wanted in the portfolio. And so I think shareholders would benefit and we'll see what -- I'm not going to speculate on what the Commission does with our wind projects, but I will tell you that we're comfortable with ownership [Indecipherable] ownership on a regulated side, but it's not bad in a portfolio either. So -- and remember, when Bob talks about 10,000 megawatts, there are across all eight states. And so we're not just -- it just so happens these initial PPA buyouts came in Minnesota. But remember we had Calpine in Colorado before and there are other opportunities in other states. And I just want to reiterate, and I hope I'm answering your question, we are not having a strategic change. We are definitely focused on the great organic growth opportunities we have as a regulated utility in the Upper Midwest all the way down to Texas. -- Awesome, alright. Thank you guys very much. I appreciate it. -- Thank you.Up next, we'll hear from Travis Miller with Morningstar. -- Good morning. Thank you. -- Hey, Travis. -- Hi. So just to stick on that subject, real quick here on the PPA buyouts and potential growth there, would you do the financing structure any different in terms of parent company versus project versus utility? -- Hey Travis, this is Bob. I think our base plan is to finance at the parent company with a mix of parent company holding company debt and equity. I think our long-term capital structure is the right way to look at any of these assets. So 60:40 debt equity ratio is how we think about financing the business. -- Okay, great. And then, wonder if you could talk, both on a holistic basis across the industry, and then also what you guys are seeing in terms of the PTCs, how those -- and ITC for the solar parts -- in that 2022 to 2024 time period? And how do we fill in those holes and think about those tax credits if the tax policy stays the same for you guys and for the industry broadly? -- That's a great question. It's one of the reasons why we accelerated and really put the pedal down on our Steel for Fuel program and the biggest wind expansion in the country that we've had now because we did want to lock in those PTC credits or they expired at the 100% level and even at the 80% level. You're right. I think the wind industry will take a little time to adjust quite frankly, Travis, when the PTCs roll off, of course there is a chance they won't. Our approach to the solar piece of this is that I think the cost curve on solar continues to decline pretty quickly. And so we think that even the absence -- the roll off of ITC or the most of it anyway, will be more than offset by just gains in the solar itself. And we think that times of very, very nicely to the retirement of our coal plants in the mid 20s [Phonetic] . So we don't see a need to go out and lock anything in because we think the cost curve will more than offset the ITC reduction. And again we'll clearly wait to see if there is legislation, etc., might change that. -- Okay, just real quick follow-up. I know you guys and a lot of other companies have been talking about solar is the next thing, a lot of solar investment. Be a little extreme here, but what saves wind beyond 2022 and 2023? -- Well, first of all, I think when we will recover and we will be attractively priced. And I think wind will always compete very nicely, again solar on an energy basis. And as you -- I think you'll find as more and more solar becomes on the system, the planning capacity might fall off a little bit. So I think wind is always going to be there. We just so happen to want to focus on solar as we are retiring our coal plants. Solar has some advantages from a -- just think about it, I've had farmers come up to me and say, gosh, if we didn't have a wind farm on our land, we might have gone under. So could you install in the land, when you have a wind project on there. Solar, not so much. I mean, you basically, the land is being repurposed. And then of course there are different characteristics with when the wind blows versus when the sun shines and so I think the two will complement each other in our clean energy transition very nicely and I think there is going to be wind indefinitely. -- Okay, great. I appreciate the thoughts. Thanks. -- Just one comment on that too, you got to remember, we are in the wind belt of the United States. So it's one of the reasons why our Steel for Fuel strategy has worked so well. And so we're always going to have that inherent advantage. -- Yeah. Okay, thank you.Our next question will come from Paul Fremont with Mizuho. -- Thanks. -- Good morning, Paul. -- Not to beat a dead horse to death, but when you revised your ask in Colorado, does that improve in your mind the possibility of reaching a settlement in that case? -- Yeah, the short answer is yes. -- Okay. -- I think you know these -- you look at what we're asking for in the case, you look at what we did with rebuttal. I mean we have a distinct possibility, but possibilities versus something I can talk to you about explicitly, we're not there. -- Okay. And then I guess a couple of questions on the capex revisions. I'm assuming for 2019 that the number that you previously had would come down by $650 million for Northern States Power because the Mankato acquisition would be done through sort of a non-regulated entity, is that fair? -- Yeah, Paul, this is Bob. For the rate base assumption, that's correct. But for the capital assumption, we're still going to spend the capital to procure that asset. -- Right. So it would like go into other, right, I would assume. -- Correct. -- Okay. And then it looks like there is a $735 million pickup for Northern States Power Minnesota in 2020. Can you sort of give us what's driving that? -- I think the largest driver of that is sort of wind movements across plan [Phonetic] years. So previously we were going to have a build-own-transfer project with our Cheyenne wind project, we moved a big -- we're going to build that ourselves and we moved a bunch of that capital into 2019 to get it built in time for 100% PTCs. In 2020, some of the wind is moved from 2019 into 2020. That's probably the bigger pickup in the NSPM territory. In total, capital for 2019 is expected to be in line with our original guidance of $5.1 billion. -- And then there is another sort of big pickup of almost $1 billion in your spend in 2022. Can you give us some ideas as to what's driving that? -- I think big picture, Ben talked about, a lot of that and it's a lot of investment in our networks, whether it's transmission, distribution and gas networks. That's a big spend year for us, for our Advanced Grid initiative and that's when we start spending additional dollars in the gas networks as well. So again we spent a lot of money in renewables over the last three years or four years, we've created a significant amount of customer bill headroom and we're starting to look at the networks businesses a little more carefully and we've seen both need and opportunity there. -- Great, I think that's it in terms of questions.And our next question will come from Sophie Karp with KeyBanc Capital Markets. -- Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I was just wondering about Minnesota, and following the Mankato docket, and I think you have a rate case, you don't have a rate case there coming up. Is your regulatory strategy changing in that state, is there any consideration that maybe you would approach differently? -- No, I don't think so. We plan to file for interim rates in the first week of November. Don't see anything too controversial with that, expect the rates to go into place and then we'll process the case. I'm not sure -- we still see the same alignment with our strategy and we expect a constructive outcome. So, does that answer your question? Sophie, I want to make sure I do. -- Yeah. So it sounds like you don't expect your Mankato acquisition that you are now doing as a merchant asset to [Indecipherable] the rate case precedent in anyway? -- No, not at all. I mean there is no strained relationship at all around that. It's just a difference of the Commission deciding. We don't think there is enough benefit. We think there was a lot of benefit and still do, but no reflection upon straining the relationship. -- Alright. Thank you. -- Thank you.Next, we'll hear from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. -- Hey, good morning. How are you doing? -- Good morning. -- So, I wanted to touch base with you on the transmission. As you know, there have been some voices concerned about cost containment and what have you in that area, and we've recently had FERC put out an order and some comments as well, I guess from certain Commissioners about -- that FERC Order 1000 really hasn't worked out as they thought it would in terms of providing the level of competition that they wanted to. And so I was just wondering if you could sort of talk about how you see that issue or those issues related to competition in transmission? And I think it was last week, we had a FERC order as well, sort of associated with touching on this as well. How we should think about what the outlook might be with respect to this reported concern? -- Well, I think that's a really good question. You know, I don't think the barrier to getting transmission done, which is really what we're trying to get accomplished is not about the competitive process. I mean, in fact, if you look at the biggest transmission build, it was done with capex 2020 as I mentioned. And that was utilities of all sizes and municipalities and co-ops coming together to form a plan that works with an idea of how cost would be allocated, because the real barriers to getting transmission build is who pays for it, and then of course the permitting and everything else that goes with that.So I think my personal opinion, Paul, is that FERC 1000 and that whole process really clouds it, and it's not necessary and we'll see where that goes. But as I mentioned, as you know, we've got a right of first refusal in Minnesota. We have in other jurisdictions. We're not in an RTO in Colorado. I think there are some real advantages to that, but we will get this transmission built, and we're being realistic in the time it takes to get it built. -- Okay, great, thanks. -- Thank you.And next, we will hear from Vedula Murti with Avon Capital. -- Hi Vedula. -- Hi, good morning. Just to follow up a little bit on the Mankato discussion, you referenced the strong internal IRRs. How is it competing in terms of just picking more from capital allocation perspective versus other capital opportunities you have across the system in terms of choosing this capital allocation? -- Well, the Mankato project is certainly -- the returns are certainly above our cost of capital and attractive from a shareholder's perspective as a result. Bob, I don't know if you want to add anything to that? -- No, and I think the expectation is over the life of the asset, it looks like our utility-like returns are consolidated corporate returns. We stated that it's a little bit lower on the front end, a little bit higher on the back end just given the structure of the contracts, but otherwise I agree with Ben's comments. -- Let me just add, when we talk about utility-like returns over the life, that is with very, in our opinion, very conservative modeling. I do think that the trend toward anti-gas makes existing gas assets valuable. And we are retiring coal plants and we're keenly focused on reliability. So, Vedula, we really thought it was important to keep it in our portfolio because I think that the value of existing gas assets is only going to grow and this is a CC plant that we've modeled very, very conservatively.So, that's the reason why we did not want to walk away from this one. -- Okay, thank you very much.And there are no further questions, I'll turn the conference back to Bob Frenzel for closing remarks. -- Thank you very much for your participation in our call today. As always, if you have any questions, please follow up with Investor Relations.[Operator Closing Remarks] --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --

ome discussions of climate-change action tend to trick us into thinking there are only two options: Maintain the status quo or . But there are an infinite number of options between those two positions. There are also plenty of reasons for optimism.Case in point: The United States is expected to add 22,000 megawatts of wind power capacity in the 18-month period ending December 2020. Based on the average output of new wind turbines, , the steady rise of solar power, and the  the country could generate more electricity from renewable power sources than it does from coal as soon as 2022.Here's how it could happen -- and which .Image source: Getty Images.According to the  (EIA), coal-fired power plants will account for just 25% of total American electricity production in 2019 and 22% in 2020. That's down from 28% in 2018 and nearly 50% in the early 2000s. The EIA also estimates that all renewable power sources -- primarily hydropower, wind, and solar -- will provide up to 19% of American electricity in 2020.That's a trend that doesn't seem to be getting enough attention. In fact, the EIA's near-term estimates for renewable energy have historically  the . So, how quickly could renewables generate more electricity than coal? Sooner than you may think.The United States counted 97,000 megawatts of installed wind power capacity at the end of June 2019 and is expected to have roughly 120,000 megawatts spinning by the end of 2020. However, an estimated 11,000 megawatts of the expected growth won't come on line until the final four months of 2020, which means it won't provide meaningful contributions until 2021. Considering the average American wind farm operated at 37% of its rated capacity in 2018, the United States could lean on wind power for 10% of its total electricity in 2021. Add in expected contributions from hydropower (7%), solar (4% to 5%), and other renewables (1% to 2%), and the nation could generate at least 22% of its electricity from renewables as soon as 2021. A handful of coal-fired power plant retirements could help renewables top coal in 2021 or 2022 for the first time since the American Civil War. Image source: Getty Images.While the numbers discussed above are at the national level, the reality is that . Case in point: Texas is expected to account for 22% of the country's total non-hydro renewable-electricity generation in 2020. California will chip in another 14% (a  share from 2019), while the Midwest and Central regions will add another 32% combined. Investors should take that into account. For instance,   serves 5.4 million customers in 11 states, but has a heavy presence in Texas and the Midwest for both electricity generation and delivery. It owns a 75% interest, of 227 megawatts, in the Santa Rita East Wind Farm that was placed in service in July 2019 in Texas. It's also investing $2 billion to build 1,485 megawatts of new wind farms in Oklahoma, which are coming on line in late 2020 and late 2021 and are expected to operate at 44% of their rated capacity -- well above the national average. Those projects underscore the company's recent push into renewables, but they're not the only moves being made. American Electric Power also recently acquired  renewables division and its 724 megawatts of renewable power assets, is building 400 megawatts of solar in Ohio by the end of 2021, and expects to bring a total of 8,600 megawatts of wind and solar on line across its territory by 2030 -- a number that could increase in the near future. There are also    and  . The former builds a significant share of the nation's wind and solar power capacity through its power generation subsidiary, NextEra Energy Resources, which also generates more electricity from the wind and sun than any other company on the planet. The latter is shuttering coal-fired power plants and building new wind turbines, aided by its location in the American wind corridor. It expects to generate 46% of its total electricity from wind and solar by 2027 thanks to new wind projects and .Despite the doom-and-gloom tone of most climate change discussions, the reality is that the United States is rapidly decarbonizing and well on its way to 100% zero-carbon electricity by midcentury (the country's former commitment under the Paris climate agreement). Judging from the published plans of power generators and utilities across the country, the near-term surge in wind power will likely be surpassed by a surge in solar power investments beginning in the mid-2020s.Yes, there are some pragmatic government actions that could be taken to speed up the nation's path to zero-carbon energy. But don't let your portfolio fall victim to the pessimism -- you could be missing out on significant growth opportunities.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''.  These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand.  Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).  Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

"nvestors in Xcel Energy Inc (Symbol: XEL) saw new options begin trading this week, for the June 2020 expiration.  One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 241 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the XEL options chain for the new June 2020 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $45.00 strike price has a current bid of 35 cents.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $45.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $44.65 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of XEL, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $64.38/share today.

Because the $45.00 strike represents an approximate 30% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 100%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 0.78% return on the cash commitment, or 1.18% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.


Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Xcel Energy Inc, and highlighting in green where the $45.00 strike is located relative to that history:


   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $65.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.40.  If an investor was to purchase shares of XEL stock at the current price level of $64.38/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $65.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 6.24% if the stock gets called away at the June 2020 expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if XEL shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Xcel Energy Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing XEL's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $65.00 strike highlighted in red:



   
Considering the fact that the $65.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 52%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.28% boost of extra return to the investor, or 8.00% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.


The implied volatility in the put contract example is 32%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 17%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $64.38) to be 16%.

"  has one of the largest footprints of any domestic electric utility, serving more than 5.4 million customers in 11 states from Texas to Ohio. It owns 26,000 megawatts of power-generating capacity, 40,000 miles of transmission lines, and $69 billion in total assets. But there's one blemish on the $45 billion company's report card: It's noticeably behind its peers in renewable energy. To be fair, that's not entirely its fault. While it has the financial wherewithal to throw significant resources at renewable energy opportunities, capitalizing on them would be an uphill battle due to its . Nonetheless, management is now making a long-overdue push into the space. Can its aggressive strategy turn American Electric Power into a renewable energy stock to be reckoned with?Image source: Getty Images.Power generators and electric utilities are increasingly turning to wind and solar due to their favorable economics. Better technology and grid connections have combined to significantly reduce the cost of electricity generated from wind turbines and solar panels in recent years. Couple that with the fact that wind and solar farms don't require constant refueling, and it's easy to grasp how power portfolios that lean heavily on modern renewables can generate significant savings for companies and customers alike.In fact, onshore wind is expected to be the lowest-cost source of energy by 2023, while solar-plus-energy-storage systems will be at least on par with natural gas at that time, price-wise. American Electric Power is eager to capture some of those savings. The company estimates that wind, solar, and hydropower will account for 16% of its total power-generating capacity at the end of 2019. That includes recent acquisitions totaling 951 megawatts of net capacity. It has plans to add over 8,500 megawatts of wind and solar capacity over the next decade, bringing its total to over 13,000 megawatts by the end of 2030. Given the clear financial benefits, investors should certainly praise these efforts. However, the company still must be measured against the yardstick of its peers.   expects to own and operate 9,300 megawatts of wind power alone at the end of 2019, which will represent half of its total power generating capacity. Renewable sources produce 25% of its total electricity (generating capacity and actual electrical output aren't the same thing) today, and Xcel forecasts that percentage will rise to 46% by 2027. Similarly,   owns 18,000 megawatts of wind and solar power capacity through its NextEra Energy Resources (NEER) subsidiary. That represents 75% of NEER's total power capacity, and allows it to generate more electricity from the wind and sun than any other company on the planet. While the parent's Florida utilities are nearly bereft of renewable energy generators (wind isn't a viable option in the Southeast), it has ambitious plans to add about 10,000 megawatts of solar power capacity in the Sunshine State by 2030. With that added context, the drag from American Electric Power's slow transition to renewable energy definitely shows up in the numbers when one compares the total stock returns (share performance plus dividends) of those three companies. Although, to be fair,  have easily beaten the five-year total return of the , which has ""only"" been 78%. Data: Yahoo! Finance, investor presentations.American Electric Power's dividend may offer a higher yield than its peers, but it also hasn't seen delivered nearly as much share price appreciation in the last five years. And that relatively high dividend yield could sap long-term returns by keeping the business in a perpetual state of catch-up when it comes to renewable energy.For example, if the company's annual payout were cut to a level that would yield 2.2% instead, the business would have an extra $330 million per year to invest in renewable energy projects. Considering American Electric Power intends to spend only $2.2 billion on renewable energy over the next half-decade, that hypothetical re-allocation of resources would allow it to increase its strategic wind and solar budget by 75%. American Electric Power is making a push to increase the share of power it generates from low-cost renewable energy, but investors would be justified in questioning whether it's doing enough. The acquisitions it made in 2019 and its plans for capital expenditures through 2023 look comparatively small next to those of its peers. Reflective of that, the company will end this year with coal-fired power plants providing 46% of its total power capacity -- nearly double the average level among utilities nationally. Simply put, it's great to see the business start to invest more capital in renewable energy, but it has a long way to go before investors can take those efforts seriously.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

here's a heavy dose of irony contained within the third-quarter 2019 earnings report from  . The company is one of the largest investors in wind energy in the United States and last year committed its four regional electric utilities to deliver 100% zero-carbon energy by 2050. It's on pace to reduce its carbon emissions 80% from 2005 levels by 2030. It expects to rely on renewables for 48% of its electricity mix by 2027. Yet through the first nine months of 2019, it appears all of the company's year-over-year earnings growth came from oil and gas customers operating in the Permian Basin. In fact, it was the only customer group in any territories served by Xcel Energy to see electricity sales growth in that span compared to the year-ago period. Investors shouldn't get used to it. Xcel Energy expects to earn several rate increases in 2020 on its way to delivering at least 5% to 7% annual growth in  (EPS). Here's what investors need to know about the latest operating results and some important updates for the road ahead.Image source: Getty Images.Xcel Energy owns four electric and gas utilities from the Upper Midwest to Texas. There's Public Service Company of Colorado (PSCo), NSP-Minnesota, NSP-Wisconsin, and Southwestern Public Service (SPS). The last one serves parts of Texas and New Mexico that include the Permian Basin, perhaps the world's most important source of crude oil growth at the moment. Good thing, too, because oil and gas customers in the region have been the only one of eight customer groups served by the company's utilities to grow electricity sales through the first nine months of 2019 compared to the same period of 2018. It certainly shows. SPS contributed diluted earnings of $0.42 per share through the first nine months of 2019, compared to just $0.34 in the year-ago period. Xcel Energy delivered diluted EPS of $2.08 across its operations in the first three quarters of this year, compared to $2.05 in the same period of last year. In other words, SPS has been responsible for keeping the company on track to meet its full-year 2019 guidance.To be fair, electric utilities are at the whim of the weather and whether or not industrial customers generate their own energy from co-generation activities. Xcel Energy CEO Ben Fowke reminded investors of that on the , saying not to interpret quarterly electricity sales increases or declines as trends.The important thing is that the business remains on track. Management narrowed full-year 2019 earnings guidance to the top half of its previous range, expecting $2.60 to $2.65 per share. Xcel Energy also initiated full-year 2020 EPS guidance of $2.73 to $2.83, which would be in line with expectations to grow earnings 5% to 7% per year.The near-term growth will be supported primarily by regulatory approvals for rate increases in Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas -- all of which have passed ambitious state mandates for zero-carbon renewable energy that will support Xcel Energy's growth plans. The company should also receive a boost from the addition of 1,918 megawatts of owned wind power capacity through 2021, which will cement its position as a . Image source: Getty Images.Several additional highlights that investors may only have learned by listening to or reading the transcript of the :Xcel Energy turned in another strong quarter and continues to reap the benefits of its favorable geography. While that's generally been noted when discussing siting for solar and wind energy projects, this year the company has taken advantage of serving customers in the Permian Basin. Of course, the most important characteristic of the business in the minds of investors is that it generates substantially all of its earnings from regulated assets, which guarantees growth and removes risk. That should set the stage for continued growth in 2020.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''.  These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand.  Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).  Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

"nvestors in Xcel Energy Inc (Symbol: XEL) saw new options become available today, for the October 2020 expiration.  One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 375 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the XEL options chain for the new October 2020 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $60.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.00.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $60.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $59.00 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of XEL, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $64.26/share today.

Because the $60.00 strike represents an approximate 7% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 67%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.67% return on the cash commitment, or 1.62% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.


Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Xcel Energy Inc, and highlighting in green where the $60.00 strike is located relative to that history:


   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $65.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.00.  If an investor was to purchase shares of XEL stock at the current price level of $64.26/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $65.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 4.26% if the stock gets called away at the October 2020 expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if XEL shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Xcel Energy Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing XEL's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $65.00 strike highlighted in red:



   
Considering the fact that the $65.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 52%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.11% boost of extra return to the investor, or 3.03% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.


The implied volatility in the put contract example is 33%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 26%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 250 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $64.26) to be 16%.

" provide products and services that consumers not only want but basically need to survive. The list includes electricity, clean water, and natural gas, among other things. But building the systems to make, acquire, process, and/or deliver these vital resources is expensive, which means that size and scale can be a huge benefit.If you are looking at the utility space, you'll want to start by examining the biggest names first. Here's a quick look at the 10 biggest utility stocks, including some that may surprise you.Although most investors think of electricity when the phrase ""utility stock"" comes up, the sector is far more diverse than that. Yes, electric utilities are a big component, but utility stocks also deliver things like clean water and natural gas.Image source: Getty Images.Another word that often comes to mind when defining a utility stock is ""regulation."" Although not all utility stocks are regulated, most are. Because utilities effectively get  in the regions they serve, they have to ask local, state, and federal regulators to approve the rates they charge customers. In fact, if you expand the definition of utility to include energy infrastructure with a notable regulatory component, then you can even add oil and natural gas pipelines into the utility stock mix of potential companies. Many diversified utilities do, in fact, own such  assets.Using such a broad definition of a utility, the core businesses here tend to involve long-lived assets that are stable and reliable, with solid fundamental demand underpinning revenues. Which is one of the key reasons scale is a big benefit to utilities. Getting bigger is the quickest way to grow a company's top and bottom lines. That can be accomplished through acquisitions or new construction, but usually it's a combination of the two. And the bigger a company gets, the easier it usually is for that company to buy and build additional assets. So if you are looking at the utility space, you'll want to get to know these 10 industry giants.There are different ways to look at size when it comes to the utility space, including things like the number of customers served and amount of power generated. That can make comparisons a bit complicated, so this list is being broken down by , or the stock price multiplied by the number of shares outstanding. Other prominent factors that will be considered include  plans, which give an indication of a company's growth plans, and , since generating income is one of the core reasons investors add utilities to their portfolios.Here are the 10 largest U.S. utility stocks:Data source: Yahoo! Finance, company reports. Data is current as of Sept. 9, 2019.NextEra Energy is the biggest utility by market cap, weighing in at a massive $108 billion. It is the  in Florida, a state that continues to see its population expand as people move to its warmer climate. That's a big benefit, as more customers mean more demand for electricity. The company actually expanded its footprint in its home state in January 2019 with the acquisition of Gulf Power from fellow top-10 name The Southern Company. NextEra plans to trim costs at Gulf Power and boost spending, which should enhance the utility's growth prospects over the next few years.Although its regulated Florida electric assets are the core of NextEra, they are not actually the main growth engine. NextEra also happens to be one of the largest  in the country, and possibly the world, via its NextEra Energy Resources division. This business sells power to others under long-term contracts and owns 24 gigawatts of generating capacity, 64% of which is wind, 11% solar, and 13% nuclear (the remainder is carbon based). It has an additional 12 gigawatts or so worth of capacity on the drawing board that it hopes to build over the next few years as well. Each new asset expands its revenue and earnings potential.Across the entire business, NextEra Energy plans to spend as much as $55 billion between 2019 and 2022, with a hefty 55% earmarked for the unregulated renewable power business. That spending, in turn, should support annual earnings growth of 6% to 8% a year and  of as much as 14% (a low  allows for the difference here). The only problem is that investors are well aware of NextEra's past success and future prospects, so it is relatively expensive today, and the yield is just 2.2% or so (the average yield for the industry is around 2.9% using  as the benchmark). But for dividend growth investors, it might be worth the price tag.With a market cap of $68 billion, Duke Energy comes in at a distant No. 2 on the list of largest utilities. Duke's business is broken down into three main parts. The largest is its regulated electric utility division, which provides power in six states. It also owns natural gas distribution assets in five states, a business that it largely acquired in 2016 when . And it has a renewable power division that sells electricity to others under long-term contracts (it controls about 3 gigawatts of solar and wind power).Duke is more of a tortoise to NextEra's hare, with a slow and steady approach to growth and a much higher 4% yield. Between 2019 and 2023, Duke plans to spend around $37.5 billion on growth projects, with roughly 95% of that earmarked for its regulated businesses. The rest will get spent on the renewable power operation, which helps explain why  over the next few years. Dividend growth will continue, too, but likely at a rate no higher than earnings growth. The company's payout ratio isn't worrisome, but it is higher than NextEra's payout and puts a cap on potential dividend increases.Duke is more of a : Investors own it because it mixes a relatively generous yield and a slow and steady approach to its business. It won't excite you, but it shouldn't leave you sleepless, either.The next utility stock is something of an odd duck. Canadian-based Enbridge has a market cap of $67 billion, and you could easily argue that it shouldn't be included on this list because the bulk of its natural gas utility operations (around 15% of ) are located north of the U.S. border. That said, a portion of that business creeps into upstate New York, a material amount of Enbridge's renewable power portfolio (less than 5% of EBITDA) is located in the United States, and its midstream infrastructure investments (80%) span North America (these assets are usually regulated at the federal level). Its size, a notable amount of exposure to the U.S. market, and a big 6.4% yield (backed by a dividend that has been increased annually for 23 consecutive years) suggests that utility-focused  should at least consider the name -- which is why it finds itself on the top-10 list.Enbridge recently worked through a big consolidation, in which it . This move vastly simplified the company's structure but required it to add notable leverage to its balance sheet. It has managed to lower its debt-to-EBITDA ratio from a peak of more than 12 times in 2018 to around 5 times. That's a much more reasonable number, but it is still toward the higher end of the utility space. That said, Enbridge is more midstream focused than utility focused, and 5 times debt to EBITDA is definitely high for a midstream company. This isn't unusual, either, as Enbridge has long made aggressive use of leverage. The extra risk that entails is a factor that investors should keep in mind when considering the high yield. data by .Looking at growth, Enbridge has 19 billion Canadian dollars in capital investments planned through 2022 across its portfolio. Over the longer term, it believes it has the capability to invest CA$5 billion to CA$6 billion annually in its business without seeking outside cash. That, in turn, should translate into annualized distributable  growth of 5% to 7% per share. Dividend growth should roughly mirror that figure, though historically it has been a little over 10% a year. Income-oriented investors might want to put this company on their utility lists even though it isn't strictly a utility.Diversified utility Dominion Energy has been shifting its business over the past 10 years or so, too. The general goal has been to exit more volatile businesses, like oil drilling, and refocus around regulated and fee-based assets that are more predictable, like electricity and pipelines. The change has been material, with the company selling around $25 billion worth of assets since 2007 and buying $20 billion while also continuing to invest in its core utility operations and strategic ground-up construction projects. Today, around 95% of Dominion's earnings come from regulated and fee-based operations, up from just 40% in 2006. It has a market cap of around $63 billion.Its regulated utility business spans five states, it has pipeline operations (regulated at the federal level) in more than a dozen states, and it operates an unregulated renewable power business focused around selling power under long-term contracts. Essentially, it has become a pretty boring utility at this point. That said, it is in the middle of a spending binge and has an  and a relatively .Those last two facts help explain why Dominion's yield, at 4.7%, is toward the high end of the utility peer group. At this point,  to the low single digits to bring down its payout ratio and has been selling assets to help keep leverage in check. It wouldn't be fair to call Dominion high risk, but neither would it be appropriate to describe it as low risk. And for a few years anyway, dividend growth will be weak at best as the utility works through its roughly $26 billion in spending plans through 2023. For income-focused investors, however, the relatively high yield might be worth a closer look.The Southern Company, already mentioned above because of an asset sale to NextEra Energy, has a roughly $63 billion market cap and has also been working through a big capital budget. It hasn't been going all that well, with Southern forced to give up on a clean coal plant () and massive delays and cost overruns on a nuclear build. Although , there's still a long way to go before this costly project is completed in 2022.So Southern still faces material capital spending needs (estimated to be around $38 billion through 2023). Funding this  is complicated by a relatively high payout ratio and elevated leverage. That probably sounds a lot like Dominion's position, which helps explain the roughly 4.3% yield offered up by Southern's stock today. Southern's business is also similar in other ways, operating a diversified collection of assets, including three electric utilities, a natural gas business, and a renewable power company.That said, Southern is capably working through what has been a pretty rough period. The asset sale to NextEra is one example of its efforts to balance spending with its financial situation, with the cash used to help reduce leverage. And management remains committed to increasing the dividend $0.08 per share per year (low single digits percentage-wise), further extending its 71-year streak of dividends at the same or higher level. Earnings are expected to grow in the mid-single-digit space. Once again, this is not a risk-free utility, but it's not a high-risk option, either. Investors looking to maximize the income their portfolio generates would do well to take a look at Southern.Now for a twist of sorts with midstream  Enterprise Products Partners. Enterprise is not technically a utility, but a good portion of its business is fee based and/or regulated at the federal level by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (roughly 85% of its ). That fact, combined with a robust 6.1% yield, helps to get it on this list. But what really seals the deal is the company's massive $62 billion market cap, which easily makes this midstream industry bellwether one of the largest energy companies in North America.To simplify a little bit, Enterprise owns the pipes, processing facilities, storage, ports, and transportation assets that help move natural gas and oil from where they get drilled to where they get processed and eventually consumed. It has a two-decade-plus track record of success behind it, with a long history of increasing its distribution on a quarterly basis. Lately, that payment has grown in the low single digits  plans (it currently has around $6 billion worth of projects under development). data by .Slower near-term distribution growth, however, is a net benefit. For starters, it helps reduce the long-term need to issue  units to fund capital projects. It also increases the strength of the current distribution, which was covered by an impressive 1.7 times in the first half of 2019 (1.2 times is considered strong coverage in the midstream space). Meanwhile, Enterprise has long made modest use of leverage, with its debt-to-EBITDA ratio toward the low end of the peer group (and well below many of the purer utility stocks on this list). If you are looking at utility names for yield, then you should branch out and take a close look at Enterprise and its focus on the same types of assets that many utility stocks own.With roughly $46 billion in market cap, Exelon operates six utilities, providing electric and natural gas services to customers in five states and the District of Columbia. It breaks its business up into power generation, transmission, and a business that sells power directly to end customers. Exelon's yield is roughly 3%, about the average for the utility space, and its payout ratio is a touch below the average.Like many of its peers, the utility is increasingly building renewable power like solar and wind. But the one thing that sets Exelon apart is that it runs the largest fleet of nuclear power plants in the country. Nuclear power is a controversial topic. Since it doesn't emit carbon dioxide, it is technically a clean power source. But the risk of a nuclear accident, a rare but potentially highly dangerous occurrence, . Exelon's heavy exposure to this power source pretty much means that it is always fighting with someone, be it regulators, environmentalists, or even customers. This single fact could be enough to make you pass it over for another utility.The company expects earnings to grow between 6% and 8% a year through 2022. Near-term dividend growth is projected to be around 5%. Driving these projections is capital spending of as much as $23 billion on its utility business. With a reasonable balance sheet, Exelon's plans look attainable. It's not a standout in any way, but it's not a bad utility -- assuming you can get past the nuclear issue.In the No. 8 spot, with a $45 billion market cap, is another midstream-focused company, Kinder Morgan. Unlike Enterprise, Kinder Morgan is structured as a regular company, which avoids some of . Like Enterprise, it owns a massive portfolio of pipeline, processing, port, and storage assets that are often regulated at the federal level. Since the company sports a 4.9% yield, it is likely that income-oriented investors will have seen the name before.The last few years have been very good for Kinder Morgan and its shareholders, particularly those that like dividend growth. The dividend has been increased from a quarterly rate of $0.125 per share in 2016 to a run rate of $0.25 per share in 2019. In other words, Kinder Morgan's dividend has doubled in less than four years.But that requires a little more explanation. In 2016, the dividend was cut 75% versus the ending run rate in 2015. And that cut happened just  of as much as 10% in 2016. The cause of the cut was a tight capital market following the oil market downturn in mid-2014. That left Kinder Morgan to decide between cutting the dividend to free up capital for growth projects and pulling back on growth. It chose to cut the dividend, which, in the end, was probably the right choice for the company -- though investors who were relying on the dividend might not have been too pleased. data by .Kinder Morgan has a material business backed by long-term contracts (roughly 90% of revenues), sizable growth opportunities ($5.7 billion of capital investment plans through 2023), and a 25% dividend increase planned for 2020. However, the dividend cut should give income investors pause. There are other companies in the utility space that have a large yield but haven't cut their dividends after telling investors to expect an increase.Coming in at a virtual tie with Kinder Morgan is American Electric Power, with a $45 billion market cap.  across 11 states, with utility operations juxtaposed against long-haul transmission assets (high-voltage power lines). Like most of its peers, it also has a . One thing that sets this utility apart, however, is that it is focused almost exclusively on electricity.The company is targeting earnings growth of 5% to 7% over the next few years, with dividends expected to grow in line with earnings. Powering those numbers is $33 billion in capital spending plans that should take the company through to 2023. With a reasonable payout ratio and leverage, AES appears to be in a good position to achieve all of these goals. The yield at around 2.9% is smack on the average for the industry.Over the past decade, AEP has worked to balance out its operations, shifting from a heavy weighting on generating assets to one that is more balanced across electricity generation, transmission, and distribution. That said, it is notable that roughly 70% of the business is focused on owning the wires that move electricity. This is an increasingly important segment of the market, since renewable power often gets created far away from where it is used -- and also because regulators are often more willing to grant approval for rate hikes tied to improving the integrity and reach of power lines. It would be hard to say that AEP stands out as an investment (other than its focus on electricity), but it's not a bad utility by any means.The last few years have been pretty active for $38 billion-market-cap Sempra Energy, which rounds out this top-10 list. There's been so much activity, in fact, that most investors would probably be best off taking a wait-and-see approach in this instance because there are so many moving parts. Basically, management is still actively adjusting the portfolio. Add in a 2.7% yield, which is slightly below the industry average, and there's even more reason to stay on the sidelines -- for now.In a very short period of time, Sempra has sold renewable power, natural gas, and midstream pipeline assets while buying multiple electric distribution assets and building a liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminal in Mexico. And that's just the last few years; the last decade has seen even more activity as  to focus on regions (specifically California and Texas on the utility side) and businesses that it believes are going to be long-term winners (on the LNG side).With so much going on, leverage has become a key issue to watch. That said, the debt-to-EBITDA ratio has fallen considerably over the past year or so, though it remains above the levels of five years ago. The reduction in leverage, however, just highlights that Sempra is still a work in progress. And it's not a simple change taking place. A lot of the movement has been on the acquisition and disposition front, with a big construction project thrown in for good measure. Caution is in order at Sempra today.Although you can make a bad  reference about this list ""going to 11,"" the truth is there were a few companies that maybe didn't fit perfectly. Because of that, it's worth quickly mentioning a handful that didn't make the cut. For example, Canadian , formerly known as TransCanada, has a $47 billion market cap (good enough for a seventh-place showing), an attractive 4.5% yield, and is very similar to Enbridge in many ways (including the elevated use of leverage). But TC Energy's power assets are basically all in Canada, and the assets it does have in the U.S. market are pipelines. It was a judgment call, but TC Energy was left off the top-10 list.

The latter is dealing with a big problem of late, because there has been  in the country. In other words, there's a reason for the current high yield.

"ooking at the universe of stocks we cover at , on 9/12/19, Macy's Inc (Symbol: M), Dominos Pizza Inc. (Symbol: DPZ), and Xcel Energy Inc (Symbol: XEL) will all trade ex-dividend for their respective upcoming dividends.  Macy's Inc will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.3775 on 10/1/19, Dominos Pizza Inc. will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.65 on 9/30/19, and Xcel Energy Inc will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.405 on 10/20/19.  

As a percentage of M's recent stock price of $16.84, this dividend works out to approximately 2.24%, so look for shares of Macy's Inc to trade 2.24% lower — all else being equal — when M shares open for trading on 9/12/19.  Similarly, investors should look for DPZ to open 0.27% lower in price and for XEL to open 0.64% lower, all else being equal.





Below are dividend history charts for M, DPZ, and XEL, showing historical dividends prior to the most recent ones declared.

Macy's Inc (Symbol: M):
   Dominos Pizza Inc. (Symbol: DPZ):Xcel Energy Inc (Symbol: XEL):
In general, dividends are not always predictable, following the ups and downs of company profits over time.  Therefore, a good first due diligence step in forming an expectation of annual yield going forward, is looking at the history above, for a sense of stability over time.  This can help in judging whether the most recent dividends from these companies are likely to continue.  If they do continue, the current estimated yields on annualized basis would be 8.97% for Macy's Inc, 1.09% for Dominos Pizza Inc., and 2.57% for Xcel Energy Inc.  



		

In Tuesday trading, Macy's Inc shares are currently up about 4.1%, Dominos Pizza Inc. shares are up about 0.1%, and Xcel Energy Inc shares are off about 0.5% on the day.

 changing of the guard is underway in American renewable energy. The United States is expected to generate more electricity from wind power than hydropower in 2019. It will be the first time something other than hydroelectricity was the country's top renewable energy source since the electric power sector emerged in the late 1800s.Wind power still faces obstacles, but they aren't expected to linger. The United States is currently experiencing a , which has led to flat year-over-year electric output in the first half of 2019 despite a more than 8% increase in installed wind power capacity. Additionally, the production tax credit (PTC) for wind energy expires at the end of the year, which will force the industry to prove it's mature enough to stand on its own.Many industry players are confident it can. In fact, wind energy leaders are looking forward to the PTC phaseout, as they believe it will give them a competitive advantage. That would bode well for   and  , which lean on a combined 25% of the nation's installed wind power capacity. Here's why they're the  to buy in wind energy.Image source: Getty Images.NextEra Energy generated more electricity from the wind and sun than any other company in the world in 2018. Only seven  have more installed wind power capacity than the business. It expects to maintain that dominance through its power generation subsidiary, NextEra Energy Resources (NEER), which owns wind and solar power assets across the United States.NEER thinks it can stuff an additional 16,800 megawatts of wind power projects into its backlog in the next few years. Assuming those projects get built and remain in its portfolio, they will more than double the company's current installed wind capacity of 15,000 megawatts, which represents 15% of the nation's total. Investors might also notice that the company's outlook reflects strong  and America's ongoing decarbonization efforts. NextEra Energy estimates that the United States will build an average of 10,000 megawatts of new wind power each year through 2022. By 2023, the company expects wind-generated electricity will cost just $20 per megawatt-hour -- half the cost of natural gas -- or $30 per megawatt-hour with energy storage included. That price advantage could lead to the country building an average of 12,000 megawatts to 15,000 megawatts of new wind power generation annually from 2023 to 2030. If those economic inflection points are met, conditions will be ripe for NextEra Energy to grow enormously (and those considerations don't even factor in its even larger opportunity in solar energy). That's huge for investors. Consider that NEER generated 28% of the parent company's total revenue and 50% of total net income in the first half of 2019. That profit engine could stay red hot for years to come. Image source: Getty Images.Xcel Energy doesn't directly own nearly as much wind power infrastructure as NEER, but it leans on a mix of power purchase agreements (PPA) and direct ownership to support 9,300 megawatts of installed wind power capacity. It plans to increase that to 11,100 megawatts by the end of 2021. Direct or indirect, the result is the same: lower capital expenditures and lower customer bills. That's primarily because wind farms don't require fuel once built, unlike nuclear or fossil plants, and generally have lower maintenance requirements. Geography certainly smiles on Xcel Energy. The company's four electric utilities are located within the , which runs roughly down the center of the Lower 48 and is home to about 66% of the country's total wind portfolio. That's helped the company become one of the most ambitious in the United States when it comes to decarbonization efforts. In fact, Xcel Energy was the first to publicly commit to generating 100% of its electricity from zero-carbon sources by 2050.It's well on its way. Xcel Energy generated 22% of its electricity from wind and solar in 2018, and expects to increase the percentage to 46% in 2027 and 60% in 2030 as major new renewable energy projects come online. The company estimates it will cut its carbon dioxide emissions by as much as 80% from their 2005 levels by 2030 as a result. Xcel Energy expects to grow both its dividend and earnings per share 5% to 7% annually for the foreseeable future. Considering similar levels of growth have powered its shares to a 144% return over the last five years with dividends included -- far outpacing the 63% total return of the  over that period -- investors should consider Xcel Energy a top wind energy stock to buy for the long haul.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

he world's developed economies need to invest a staggering  to transition from fossil fuels to . That switch won't happen overnight. Because of that, the sector is an ideal spot for investors with a long-term mindset.Most renewable energy companies are plowing all their cash flow back into growth opportunities. Some, however, are returning a growing portion of it to investors via dividends. Because of that, they can be excellent options for those seeking a potentially lifelong income stream. Three that should fit that bill are  ,  , and  .Image source: Getty Images.Atlantica Yield operates a diversified portfolio of infrastructure assets focused on the power and water sectors. Renewable energy (wind, solar, and hydro) currently supplies 66% of its cash flow. The company compliments those assets with efficient natural gas power plants (16% of cash flow), electricity transmission assets (14% of cash flow), and water desalination facilities (4% of cash flow). This portfolio generates very stable and predictable cash flow. That's because Atlantica sells all the power it produces as well as the capacity on its other assets to end-users under long-term, fixed-rate contracts. That gives it plenty of money to pay a dividend that currently yields 6.5%. It uses the funds it doesn't return to shareholders as well as its strong balance sheet to invest in expanding its portfolio. In the company's view, it has enough opportunities to power 8% to 10% annual growth in its dividend through at least 2022. Meanwhile, with a sound financial profile, and excellent long-term growth prospects, Atlantica should have plenty of power to continue paying dividends in the decades ahead.Pattern Energy operates a portfolio of wind and solar power generating facilities in the U.S., Canada, and Japan, though most of its assets are wind farms. Like Atlantica Yield, Pattern sells the bulk of the power it produces to end users like utilities under long-term, fixed-rate contacts. That enables it to generate stable and predictable cash flow. At the moment, Pattern Energy pays out nearly all its cash flow to investors in support of its 6.2%-yielding dividend. However, the company aims to get its payout ratio down to a more comfortable 80% by the end of next year. That will allow it to retain more money to reinvest in expanding its portfolio.Most of that growth will probably come from acquisitions. That's because it invested in a renewable energy development company, which provides it with clearly identified opportunities. That entity, for example, has two facilities under construction and three more in late stages of development. Meanwhile, its improving financial flexibility will enhance its ability to invest in future developments as well as make outside acquisitions. Those factors should give it the power to keep paying dividends for years to come. Xcel Energy is a  with four operating companies focused on distributing electricity and natural gas to customers across America's midsection. Currently, the company uses fossil fuels to generate the bulk of its power with coal supplying 33% and natural gas at 29%. However, it aims to tilt the balance toward renewables in the coming years. By 2030, the company wants renewables to produce 60% of its power, up from 22% last year. Meanwhile, it's targeting to be  by 2050. Xcel Energy's strategy is good not only for the environment but also its shareholders. It plans to invest $20.1 billion through 2023 (18% of which will be on renewables), which should help grow its earnings at a 5% to 7% annual rate. That should give Xcel Energy the power to increase its 2.6%-yielding dividend at a similar yearly pace. This trend should continue in the decades to come, given its increasing focus on investing in renewables to power the shareholder payout.Renewable energy is a multi-decade opportunity for investors, and the sector has the potential to pay dividends for years to come. That's why those looking for a long-term income stream should consider companies like Atlantica Yield, Pattern Energy, and Xcel Energy. They should be able not only to keep paying dividends but also continue growing them in the decades to come.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"nvestors in Xcel Energy Inc (Symbol: XEL) saw new options begin trading this week, for the October 18th expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the XEL options chain for the new October 18th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $60.00 strike price has a current bid of 75 cents.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $60.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $59.25 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of XEL, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $62.95/share today.

Because the $60.00 strike represents an approximate 5% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 79%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.25% return on the cash commitment, or 8.61% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.


Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Xcel Energy Inc, and highlighting in green where the $60.00 strike is located relative to that history:


   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $65.00 strike price has a current bid of 60 cents.  If an investor was to purchase shares of XEL stock at the current price level of $62.95/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $65.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 4.21% if the stock gets called away at the October 18th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if XEL shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Xcel Energy Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing XEL's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $65.00 strike highlighted in red:



   
Considering the fact that the $65.00 strike represents an approximate 3% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 69%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 0.95% boost of extra return to the investor, or 6.56% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.


The implied volatility in the put contract example is 23%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 16%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 250 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $62.95) to be 16%.

"Utility stocks and funds are in a fortuitous position right now. Investors tend to seek them out when recession fears creep (like they are right now), and they also tend to perform well when interest rates decline.Several countries have shown signs of economic weakness, sparking worries about a global recession. The U.S.-Chinese trade war hasn't helped, blunting the growth of the planet's two largest economies. And Derek Horstmeyer, an assistant finance professor at George Mason University, points out what many experts have said about the . Namely, he calls it a ""strong signal that we are in the late stages of economic expansion and may indeed be headed for a recession within the next 18 months."" 

That's a boon to safe-haven sectors such as utilities and consumer staples, as what they produce is always in demand, no matter what the economy is doing. Utility stocks, with their high returns on assets and high dividends, should be considered given that they ""tend to do well in late-cycle periods,"" Horstmeyer says.The utility sector also is attractive as interest rates fall, says Robert Johnson, a finance professor at Creighton University. ""The dividend yield on the utility sector is especially attractive in this abnormally low-interest-rate environment as the yields on utility stocks exceed the yields on long-term U.S. government debt by a substantial margin,"" he says.Here are 11 utility stocks and fund to buy for safety and income. This list includes a few standouts in the sector, as well as several ways to diversify your risk while collecting these stocks' above-average dividends.
Market value: $13.9 billionDividend yield: 4.2%Analysts' opinion: 11 Buy, 0 Overweight, 6 Hold, 0 Underweight, 0 SellHouston-based CenterPoint Energy (, $27.62) has more than 7 million customers in eight states and owns electric transmission and distribution, power generation and natural gas distribution businesses.Utilities, which have outperformed Standard & Poor's 500-stock index so far in 2019, are just off their peak valuation relative to the index. However, Michael Underhill - chief investment officer at Capital Innovations in Pewaukee, Wisconsin - isn't worried. ""On an interest-rate-adjusted basis, the utility group is near levels last seen in early October,"" he says. ""At the current valuation, we (think utility stocks are) at least well-supported at current rates.""He also isn't sweating CNP's recent underperformance (it's off 3% year-to-date versus a nearly 18% gain for the sector). He says CenterPoint is being over-penalized considering the company's robust utility growth profile.Underhill - who has a $32 price target on CNP, implying potential upside of 16% from current levels - says the company should register 6.9% annual earnings per share (EPS) growth between 2018 and 2021.
Market value: $105.9 billionDividend yield: 2.3%Analysts' opinion: 15 Buy, 0 Overweight, 2 Hold, 1 Underweight, 0 SellFlorida-based NextEra Energy (, $221.12), the world's largest utility stock by market value, serves about 5.5 million customers across two Floridian subsidiaries. It's also one of the most exciting utility stocks on the market.Chris Osmond, chief investment officer at Prime Capital Investment, says NextEra is turning heads via its green energy initiatives. NextEra, through subsidiary NextEra Energy Resources and other affiliates, is the world's top renewable-energy generator.Capital Innovations' Underhill adds that some investors are worried about the impact of tax credits expiring in the early 2020s on renewable energy growth. But he emphasizes that renewable technologies continue to drop in cost at a rapid rate.""We have owned and will own a significant position in NEE for the foreseeable future,"" says Underhill, who has a price target of $234 (6% upside).This environmental, social and governance (ESG) pick is more than just a happy story. It's an outperformer. Over the past 10 years, NEE has delivered 440% in total returns (price plus dividends), versus 246% for the S&P 500. Moreover, it has been increasing its dividends annually every year for more than two decades.""NextEra stands out due to its earnings growth and free cash flow,"" Osmond says - good news for the utility stock's ability to continue boosting that payout.
Market value: $44.8 billionDividend yield: 3.0%Analysts' opinion: 9 Buy, 0 Overweight, 8 Hold, 1 Underweight, 0 SellAmerican Electric Power (, $90.72) is an Ohio-based company serving 5.4 million customers in 11 states. It owns or operates 60 generating stations, with a combined capacity of 26,000 megawatts that can power 26 million customers.In 2018, the company reported a 5% year-over-year improvement in revenues to $16.2 billion in revenue, and a 7% bump in operating profits to $3.95 per share. Those don't sound like screaming numbers, but remember: Regulated utilities aren't expected to churn out breakneck growth. They tend to swell slowly over time instead.Underhill says the company's key risks include cost of management, regulation, power demand and financing. He has a conservative $92-per-share price target on the stock right now, in part because AEP has already run 24% higher this year.""We still remain bullish on AEP,"" he says, ""albeit slightly less bullish given its recent outperformance versus the sector index.""
Market value: $33.3 billionDividend yield: 2.5%Analysts' opinion: 4 Buy, 0 Overweight, 9 Hold, 0 Underweight, 1 SellXcel Energy (, $64.60) is a utility holding company based in Minnesota whose stock has been hitting all-time highs on a seemingly daily basis over the past few weeks.Xcel Energy has met or exceeded earnings guidance for 14 consecutive years. That includes ongoing EPS of $2.47 in 2018, which was a healthy 7% better than its year-ago profits. Better still, the company increased its long-term EPS growth target during the third quarter of last year, projecting 5% to 7% annual increases going forward.Xcel also improved its payout by 6.6% in February, to 40.5 cents per share - in line with its target annual dividend increase range of 5% to 7%. The company has raised its every year since 2003.In an Aug. 1 research report, Morningstar strategist Travis Miller writes that two regulatory developments in Colorado and Minnesota, the largest service territories, ""could help hone Xcel's long-term earnings growth outlook."" Xcel asked for a $158 million electric rate increase in Colorado starting in January 2020. Meanwhile, XEL plans to increase wind, solar and peaking generation in Minnesota while retiring two large coal plants there.""Xcel's long-term growth depends on regulatory support for this plan at least in concept,"" Miller writes. ""We think Xcel will receive that support.""
Market value: $67.6 billionDividend yield: 4.1%Analysts' opinion: 4 Buy, 0 Overweight, 12 Hold, 1 Underweight, 1 SellCharlotte-based Duke Energy (, $92.76) is one of the largest utility stocks in the U.S., and highly decorated to boot. It has been named to Fortune's 2019 list of the World's Most Admired Companies and Forbes' 2019 list of America's Best Employers. It's also one of 24 S&P 500 companies run by a female CEO - a case study for .Duke recently reported second-quarter operating earnings of $1.12 per share, up 20% year-over-year and better than analysts' estimates. Its GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) income has varied from year to year, but encouragingly, it has steadily grown its revenues by about 3% annually since 2015.The company's dividend of 94.5 cents per share - reflecting a 2% increase announced in July - comes out to a yield of 4.1%. That's about 77% of Duke's projected 2019 profits, which is just outside its targeted 65% to 75% earnings payout ratio range.Duke also anticipates spending $37.5 billion through 2023 on growth projects. Its goal with these projects is to win government approval for a rate increase, which should lead to 4% to 6% earnings growth within that period, Prime Capital Investment Advisors' Osmond says.Duke Energy, like NextEra, places emphasis on ESG factors. Among other things, it has invested in renewable energy (such as wind, solar and biomass) since 2007.
Market value: $11.0 billionDividend yield: 3.1%*Expenses: 0.13%, or $13 annually for every $10,000 investedElectricity, gas and water are considered the most basic of needs, so they're among the last things people cut even in the worst of economies. Thus, this sector tends to withstand turbulent market environments and can be a good defensive component in an investor's portfolio, says Mike Loewengart, vice president of investment strategy at E*Trade.Investors looking to group several utility stocks together to reduce risk have their choice of funds.First up is the Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (, $62.56), which is the market's biggest utility-stock , at well more than twice the assets of its next-largest competitor.The utility sector isn't a very broad one, so most funds in the space tend to have relatively small portfolios. But XLU is exceptionally tight, holding just the 28 utility stocks within the S&P 500.""The fund dominates its segment with vast assets and volume, but is also concentrated in a handful of large firms,"" Osmond says. Indeed, NextEra Energy accounts for 12.5% of the ETF's assets. Duke Energy is another 8%. The top 10 holdings alone are 40% of the fund's weight. ""Competing utility ETFs offer wider-ranging exposure to the full market-cap spectrum,"" he says.Still, XLU is a cheap, liquid, easy option that gives investors access to the industry's biggest blue-chip names. And its 3.1% dividend yield is far better than the sub-2% payout on the S&P 500, and more than double the 1.5% yield on 10-year Treasury bonds.* Yields represent the trailing 12-month yield, which is a standard measure for equity funds.
Market value: $4.1 billionDividend yield: 2.9%Expenses: 0.10%The Vanguard Utilities ETF (, $138.99) is a bit cheaper and offers a more diversified portfolio than XLU. This ETF holds roughly 70 companies in the business of distributing electricity, gas or water, or operate as independent power producers. Like XLU, it's a simple index fund. In this case, VPU tracks the MSCI US IMI Utilities 25/50 Index - an index of large, midsize and small companies within the utility sector.The good news? You have more holdings, so you're spreading your risk around a bit more than XLU. But it's still concentrated at the top, with NextEra Energy accounting for 10.5% of assets, and Duke another 6.7%. Dominion Energy () and Southern Co. () command 6%-plus weights, too.VPU, like XLU, offers a dividend well ahead of the market and Treasury bonds. It also should provide investors with a smoother ride than the broader market.""The fund is also attractive from a risk standpoint as the beta of the fund is 0.31, much lower than the overall market beta of 1.0,"" Creighton University's Johnson says. ""This indicates that on average this fund is much less volatile than the market, both on the downside and upside.""Osmond also points out a potential risk to some utility funds: namely, if interest rates recover.""In higher-interest-rate environments, the debt on leveraged investments become more expensive,"" Osmond says. ""And while the debt-to-equity ratios on some of XLU's top holdings like DUK (1.38) and NEE (1.20) are not terrible, they're not comforting in higher-interest-rate environments."" VPU would be in a similar boat.
Market value: $897.4 millionDividend yield: 2.7%Expenses: 0.43%""Given the current environment, the offerings of utilities provide the backdrop and potential to earn attractive income and potential for positive gain,"" Osmond says. ""Investors' demand for exposure to utility stocks typically increases for two main reasons: investors are seeking a high level of income and/or investors are fearful of what the future holds and start defensively positioning their portfolio.""Stuart Michelson, a finance professor at Stetson University, agrees, saying that utilities provide a good addition to a diversified portfolio. He also says iShares U.S. Utilities ETF (, $157.50) is one example of an attractive utility investment.IDU is yet another indexed utility ETF - one that splits the difference between XLU and VPU with a 48-stock portfolio of companies that provide electricity, gas and water, as well as a splash of independent power producers.NextEra (11.2%) again rules the roost, at an 11.2% weight, followed by Duke Energy (7.1%) and Dominion (6.6%).
Market value: $243.0 millionDividend yield: 1.7%Expenses: 0.60%Now, something a little different.The Invesco DWA Utilities Momentum ETF (, $34.22) isn't a straightforward index fund like XLU, VPU and IDU, which simply select a group of utilities and rank them by size. Instead, PUI tracks the Dorsey Wright Utilities Technical Leaders Index, which instead selects stocks based on their relative strength (or momentum) - essentially, how a security is performing versus some group of peers. This portfolio of 30 stocks is then weighted by the companies' momentum scores.The result? While you have many of the same names, companies such as Duke Energy and NextEra don't hold nearly the same weight in PUI as they do in the other indices. For instance, while NextEra still is the second-largest holding in PUI, it's only 4.2% of the fund. Top holding WEC Energy Group () is 4.4% of the fund - one to two percentage points higher than its weighting in XLU, VPU and IDU. And third-largest holding CMS Energy (, 4.1%) doesn't even make the top 10 of any of the other three index ETFs.The nature of this strategy also means the fund delivers a much more balanced blend of different-sized utility stocks. Roughly 41% of the fund is invested in large-cap stocks, while almost half are in mid-caps and the rest in smalls.It's a different ETF, but the strategy has worked at times. PUI has outperformed XLU, VPU and IDU by total returns (price plus dividends) over the trailing one- and three-year periods.* Includes a 23-basis-point fee waiver.
Market value: $1.2 billionDividend yield: 1.3%Expenses: 0.78%Investors who prefer a seasoned hand to manage their utility stocks, rather than an index, can look to the Fidelity Select Utilities Portfolio (, $93.09).Douglas Simmons has managed the fund since 2006, and has helped steer it to a four-star Morningstar rating. It has been in the top half of all competing funds over the trailing five-, 10- and 15-year periods, and its 14.0% average annual return over the past three years makes it the top mutual fund in its Morningstar category.This is a decidedly different portfolio than the index funds mentioned above. Yes, it's tight, at 32 holdings, and it's weighted more heavily in larger-cap names. But NextEra doesn't dominate and Duke doesn't even find itself within the top 10 holdings. Instead, Simmons currently favors Dominion, Exelon () and Sempra Energy () as his top three stocks.The one downside to this actively managed portfolio? It's more expensive to own than any of the aforementioned ETFs.
Market value: $6.5 billionDividend yield: 2.3%Expenses: 0.84%*The Franklin Utilities Fund Class A (, $21.85) is another strong actively managed utility-sector mutual fund - one that has been in the top half of its category across all meaningful time periods. It has heated up of late, too, boasting a one-year performance of 21.5% that's second-best in its class.FKUQX is a team effort: It's managed by John Kohli, who has been with the fund since 1998, and Blair Schmicker, who joined in 2009. They invest more than half the fund (55.5%) in electric utilities, with multi-utilities (31.9%) and water utilities (4.7%) making up most of the rest of the fund.Franklin does favor NextEra at the moment, allocating 8.3% of its assets to the utility stock. American Electric Power (5.1%) is high on the team's list, too, as is Dominion (4.9%).* The Class A version is relatively new. Franklin's previous Class A version of the fund () was renamed A1 and closed to new investors in September 2018. The new Class A shares sport a different expense structure, which includes a maximum 3.75% sales charge on initial purchases.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@11 Utility Stocks and Funds to Buy for Safety and Income@2019-08-30@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/11-utility-stocks-and-funds-to-buy-for-safety-and-income-2019-08-30

"ith climate change concerns rising, the global economy has been making an increasing effort to turn away from greenhouse gas-emitting fossil fuels and toward clean, renewable energy sources. From 2012 through 2017, the global economy spent a staggering $1.5 trillion to add 1 million megawatts (MW) of new renewable power capacity. As a result of that investment, there was  to meet 24% of the world's power demand in 2017. That's just the tip of the proverbial renewable energy iceberg. Developed countries will need to spend $11 trillion in the coming decades to become 100% powered by renewables. That's a massive market opportunity for companies operating in the renewable power sector.This guide aims to provide investors with a broad overview of the entire sector. That way, those investors can better understand the different ways to invest in .Image source: Getty Images.The  consists of three sectors: power, heat, and transport.The power sector generates and transmits electricity to end-users, like homes and businesses. It produces this power from a variety of sources in two main categories:In 2017, those renewable sources met 24% of global power demand, though wind and solar contributed less than 10% of the world's electricity supply. The heat sector transmits either the fuel or heated air to warm buildings. Several sources produce heat such as:The transport sector, meanwhile, provides fuels needed to power vehicles. These fuels include:The renewable energy industry aims to displace all non-renewable sources eventually. That's because most non-renewables emit greenhouse gases that are warming the atmosphere and contributing to  that is having an adverse effect on the planet. On top of that, there's only a finite amount of non-renewable resources available, which means that the world will eventually run out. The need to battle climate change as well as reduce the use of these finite resources is driving significant investment in renewable energy sources.Each sector of the market has specialized terms or industry-specific metrics that investors need to know. Here are five of the most important for understanding the renewable energy industry: A megawatt is one million watts of electricity. Renewable energy companies use this metric to demonstrate how much power they could generate if a plant were running at its full capacity. To put this metric into perspective, 1 MW of power can meet the electricity needs of 1,000 homes. While a renewable power plant might have the capacity to produce 1 MW of power, that doesn't mean it will . That's because renewable power sources like the wind and sun aren't always producing energy, which is an issue known as . So, renewable companies use MWh to show how much electricity they generated during a period. This metric measures how much it costs to produce a watt of electricity. While renewable fuel sources (wind, sun, and water) are free, solar panels and wind turbines cost money to build and maintain. Renewable energy companies normalize the cost with this metric, which makes for a better ""apples-to-apples"" comparison with fossil fuel sources like coal. This term refers to how much of the sun's light a solar panel turns into electricity. In 2018, the average solar panel was about 16% efficient while the best ones had . The higher the efficiency rating, the better a solar panel is at generating electricity from the sun.This metric measures how much cash a renewable energy company produced in a period that it could have distributed to investors. That makes it similar to . Renewable energy companies focused on paying  will use this metric so that investors can measure the sustainability of their payout. Image source: Getty Images.One of the biggest headwinds that renewables face is that the sun doesn't always shine, and the wind doesn't move at a steady speed. This issue, known as intermittency, puts renewables at a disadvantage to fossil fuels, which can produce consistent power. During the first six months of 2019, for example, wind resources where leading renewable power generator   operated were only at 92% of their historical average. This  negatively impacted the cash flow of NextEra Energy and its wind power-producing peers. If intermittency issues worsen, it will reduce the  that companies can expect to earn, which could slow the pace of growth. Another problem that renewables face is that they can be more expensive than fossil fuels like natural gas when it comes to producing power. In 2019, a highly efficient natural gas plant could generate electricity for as low as $41 per megawatt-hour (MWh) to as much as $70 an MWh, according to an estimate by financial advisory firm Lazard. The unsubsidized cost for wind, meanwhile, ranged between $29 and $56 per MWh while solar was $40 to $46 per MWh. Those costs, however, don't include the additional expense of battery storage -- which added $4 to $7 per MWh -- to help offset the intermittency issue. While wind and solar can be cheaper than natural gas, that's not always the case, which can hinder renewable development. Governments have played a significant role in helping narrow the gap between fossil fuels and renewables by providing  that incentivize investment in wind and solar projects. Those subsidies aren't as crucial to the industry's growth as they once were due to the significant decline in the cost of installing renewables. However, they're still necessary in many cases, such as installing rooftop solar panels on residential homes. If governments cut those incentives too deeply, it could reduce the growth rate of this part of the industry. Another way that governments can negatively impact the solar industry is through burdensome regulations and policies. In 2019, for example, the U.S.  to put domestic producers on a level playing field with their foreign counterparts. The tariffs ended up increasing the cost of all solar panels, which made them less competitive against other sources of energy such as fossil fuels. If governments implement more policies that are harmful to the renewable energy industry, it could slow its growth rate.Lower energy prices can also impact renewables. If natural gas prices tumble, it can make gas-fired plants cheaper to operate than renewables. Meanwhile, if the economy slows down, it can impact electricity rates, which would hurt renewable development since it needs higher prices to thrive. Finally, slumping oil prices can affect the demand for higher-cost biofuels.Climate change concerns are playing a significant role in driving growth in the renewables sector. According to a Reuters poll in June 2019, nearly 70% of Americans wanted the country to take ""aggressive"" action to combat climate change. That strong support is leading governments to propose solutions that will rapidly transition the economy away from fossil fuels. If climate change concerns continue growing, it could drive more aggressive government incentives to invest in the renewable energy sector. One of the most significant impediments to the development of renewables had been their higher costs compared to fossil fuels. In the early 2000s, for example, the unsubsidized costs to generate wind and solar power were around $70 and $120 per MWh, respectively. Those costs, however, have declined significantly. By 2019, renewables were cheaper than coal and natural gas, in many cases, before adding in the extra costs for battery storage. Storage costs are also declining. Because of that, renewables are on track to be  even after adding in enough battery storage to overcome intermittency. With renewables closing in on that inflection point, the industry's growth rate could accelerate.Image source: Getty Images.Investors considering renewable energy stocks have five ways to potentially benefit from its expansion: These companies build and install the mechanical equipment needed to generate renewable energy. They include:These companies make money by selling a product or service to customers. As such, their revenue has some variability. It can grow as demand expands or contracts due to competition or increased industry headwinds. That makes them a higher risk, but it also could make them a higher reward opportunity. These companies generate power and sell it to end-users. While most utilities still produce a large portion of their electricity from fossil fuels, some are investing heavily in renewables. NextEra Energy, for example, generated more power from the wind and sun than any other company in the world in 2018. Meanwhile,   was the first utility that . Though Xcel Energy doesn't expect to reach that bold goal until 2050. Utilities operate an integrated business as most generate power and also distribute it directly to customers. Some companies, on the other hand, focus solely on operating renewable power assets. They typically sell the electricity these facilities generate under long-term, fixed-rate power purchase agreements (PPAs) to utilities and other end users like industrial plants and data centers. Those contracts supply these companies with predictable cash flow, the bulk of which they pay out to their investors via . Some of the largest yieldcos are , , and . These companies are ideal options for income-focused investors to consider. These companies make renewable fuel products that they sell to customers as a replacement for fossil fuels. For example,   manufactures Redeem, which is a renewable natural gas made from organic waste that comes from landfills and farms. This fuel is as much as 70% cleaner to burn than diesel and gasoline. , in the meantime, is a  () that manufactures utility-grade wood pellets. Utilities can burn these pellets instead of coal, which can help them reduce their carbon footprint by about 80%. Because biofuel and biomass companies make replacements to fossil fuels, they can highly sensitive to changes in commodity prices. That makes them riskier options for investors.  Companies like   are developing and manufacturing all-electric vehicles to replace those powered by gasoline. So, they're taking a different approach from biofuel makers in disrupting the transport-focused segment of the energy market. Tesla offers a potentially fully renewable-powered electric vehicle since it also sells an integrated rooftop solar system that includes the panels and battery storage.Despite the renewable energy industry's fast-paced growth over the years, the sector has struggled to generate above-average returns for investors. One issue that has caused this underperformance is intense competition. While this competition has helped drive down the price of components like solar panels, it has also squeezed the  of companies operating in the sector. Because of that, many companies have struggled to make money in the industry. Several have even filed for , which wiped out their investors in the process.The investment needed to support the growth of the renewable energy industry far outstrips the sector's ability to internally finance its expansion with free cash flow. Because of that, the industry needs to issue  to fund growth. However, given the sector's past financial struggles, investors aren't pouring as much money into it as they had in the past. That's forcing many companies to shift their funding strategies.  like Pattern Energy, for example, used to be able to issue new stock and debt with ease. However, Pattern Energy had to stop increasing its 2017 dividend. That enabled it to retain more of its CAFD to finance growth after it got too expensive to sell more stock. The company aims to get to a more sustainable funding model by 2020 so that it can resume dividend growth. The energy industry is continuously investing in research and development. It's doing so in hopes of finding new forms of energy that will help speed up the world energy producers' ability to reach its goal of one day being carbon-free. These investments have included pursuing advancements that will reduce the cost of existing wind, solar, and battery technologies as well as in developing new commercially viable sources. Some of the more promising renewable energy technologies under development are:If technologies like these advance to the point where they can produce low-cost energy on a commercial scale, they could disrupt companies focused on more traditional renewable resources.Investors can take many different paths to finding potential stocks in the renewable energy sector.One is to focus on companies that build or install renewable energy components or make renewable fuels. These companies offer a higher reward potential since they could grow as fast or faster than the overall sector. The downside, however, is that they're more sensitive to the sector's headwinds and risk factors, which will likely make their stocks much more . As such, they're better options for investors who are seeking high-upside growth opportunities.Another way to invest in renewables is to focus on companies that operate renewable energy-producing assets and sell the electricity they generate under long-term, fixed-rate contracts. This business model helps reduce risk since it enables these companies to produce relatively predictable cash flow. Because of that, most of these renewable energy companies typically pay out a large portion of that money in dividends. That approach makes them ideal options for retirees or other income-seeking investors.Investors can also consider using  (ETFs) that focus on owning renewable energy stocks. ETFs are an ideal way to gain broad exposure to a sector since they typically hold several stocks in an industry. The , for example, held nearly 40 renewable energy stocks as of the middle of 2019. Among its largest holdings at that time were solar component makers SolarEdge and Enphase, solar panel manufacturer SunPower, and renewable energy yieldco TerraForm Power. In addition to that, other ETFs enable investors to target one aspect of the renewable energy sector such as on solar or wind stocks.  Given the enormous growth potential of the renewable energy industry, any of these paths could prove to be highly profitable over the long term. Investors, however, can increase the probability of making money on renewable energy stocks by focusing on companies that have excellent financial profiles. Companies with strong balance sheets will have greater flexibility to navigate the industry's headwinds and risks. That will give them a competitive advantage over weaker rivals in capturing the sector's growth opportunities.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

he spring months weren't good for America's shrinking fleet of coal-fired power plants. The facilities generated just 60,000 gigawatt-hours of electricity in April (20% of the nation's total consumption) and operated at just 35.8% of rated capacity. Both , and the hangover persisted into May. The obvious reason for the dismal performance is that power generators have continued to retire coal-fired power plants without building new coal-fired facilities. While that's true, a closer look at the numbers reveals an important inflection point has been reached: Power generators are now retiring younger, larger assets that were expected to be with us for decades longer.That suggests coal will be jettisoned from the electric grid faster than current projections are taking into account, which will accelerate the transition to renewables and natural gas. Is your portfolio prepared for that?Image source: Getty Images.The power plants typically considered for retirement are decades old and starting to lose the battle with economics. They're less efficient, more costly to operate and maintain, and less capable of adapting to new regulations compared to a newer power plant design.Consider that 60 coal-fired power plants were retired in the United States in 2010 and 2011, according to  by the U.S. Energy Information Administration. At an average age of over 60 years, they were among the very oldest fossil-fuel power plants operating in the country. They were some of the smallest, too, sporting an average power capacity of just 64 megawatts. The average coal-fired power plant in the United States at the time was just 39 years old and had a power capacity of over 250 megawatts. That facilities built before 1970 were rolling off the grid didn't really surprise analysts. It was the relatively newer, much larger facilities built between 1970 and 1985 that were going to be more difficult to retire. If they enjoyed a six-decade lifespan, then they'd be generating electricity until 2045. But youth hasn't saved America's coal-fired power plant fleet. Consider how retirements in 2018 compared to those from 2010-2011 and 2015, when a record 15,000 megawatts of capacity was retired. Data source: EIA.The trend of retiring younger, larger coal-fired power plants reached an inflection point in 2017, when the average power capacity soared past 129 megawatts for the first time. It accelerated in 2018, which marked the third consecutive year-over-year decline in the average age at retirement and the first time the average age fell below 50 years. To put that into perspective, 88% of the country's coal-fired power capacity will be 46 years old in 2036.The stat shows just how uncompetitive coal power has become in the United States. It also suggests that companies stubbornly holding onto such assets will be forced to shift strategies sooner than expected.Image source: Getty Images.As coal continues to cough up market share, natural gas and renewables will keep competing to fill the void. It hasn't been much of a competition to date, with natural gas adding 1.7 gigawatt-hours of electricity for every 1 gigawatt-hour added by renewables in the last decade, although that can . Nearly all of the country's new natural gas-fired power capacity has been added in the Northeast, Southeast, and Mid-Atlantic -- where coal dominates, natural gas pipelines are easily accessible, and wind and solar aren't so plentiful. Eastern Seaboard power generators from   to   have announced plans to rapidly retire or divest coal-fired power capacity, , and explore the potential of offshore wind, which is . Both have also pledged billions of dollars toward an overlooked tool: . It may not seem likely, but power companies actually can retire a coal-fired power plant (or several) and replace it with reduced consumption. Encouraging efficiency is the best way to reduce demand enough to allow utilities to cut a plant, and it's a must-have for East Coast utilities lacking access to wind and solar.By 2030, Duke Energy aims to save 22,000 gigawatt-hours of energy consumption in its network relative to 2017. That's equivalent to roughly 8% of its total generation and over 2% of the expected output of the entire country's coal-fired power plant fleet this year.The smaller PSEG is even more ambitious. In late July, it followed in the footsteps of   and pledged to attain net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. That includes a six-year, $2.8 billion investment in energy efficiency to save 40,600 gigawatt-hours of electricity. That's more electricity than the entire country produced from wind and solar in May 2019.Xcel Energy is finding it easier to jettison coal in favor of renewables thanks to its geographic position in the American wind corridor. It's on pace to generate 45% of its electricity from wind and solar assets by 2027 -- far ahead of peers. And since wind and solar farms don't require fuel once built, they're capable of powering great returns for shareholders:  earnings per share (EPS) to grow 5% to 7% per year through at least 2023. Turns out coal's decline is great news for the environment and shareholders alike.The latest numbers make it abundantly clear that coal-fired power plants are going the way of the dodo much sooner than expected in the United States. In fact, the power source's decline is unprecedented in the history of the grid. Natural gas and renewables (and energy efficiency) have stepped in to claim the abandoned market share, a trend that should only accelerate as coal facilities grow older and alternative energy sources become even more affordable. If your portfolio holds any utilities or coal producers stubbornly resisting the trend, then you may want to consider putting that hard-earned money elsewhere.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"nvestors in Xcel Energy Inc (Symbol: XEL) saw new options become available this week, for the March 2020 expiration.  One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 231 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the XEL options chain for the new March 2020 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $55.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.10.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $55.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $53.90 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of XEL, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $60.62/share today.

Because the $55.00 strike represents an approximate 9% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 80%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.00% return on the cash commitment, or 3.16% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.


Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Xcel Energy Inc, and highlighting in green where the $55.00 strike is located relative to that history:


   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $65.00 strike price has a current bid of 80 cents.  If an investor was to purchase shares of XEL stock at the current price level of $60.62/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $65.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 8.55% if the stock gets called away at the March 2020 expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if XEL shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Xcel Energy Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing XEL's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $65.00 strike highlighted in red:



   
Considering the fact that the $65.00 strike represents an approximate 7% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 70%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.32% boost of extra return to the investor, or 2.09% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.


The implied volatility in the put contract example is 25%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 16%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $60.62) to be 16%.

Please go ahead. -- Good morning and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2019 second quarter earnings release conference call. With me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Frenzel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have other members of the management team available to answer your questions. This morning, we will review our 2019 second quarter results, and update you on recent business and regulatory developments. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our website.As a reminder, some of the comments during today's conference call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC. On today's call, we will discuss certain metrics that are non-GAAP measures, including ongoing earnings, electric margin and natural gas margin. Information on comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations are included in the earnings release.With that, I'll turn the call over to Ben. -- Well, thank you, Paul, and good morning. Today, we reported second-quarter earnings of $0.46 per share compared to $0.52 per share last year. Our year-to-date earnings are on track and we are well positioned to deliver earnings at or above the midpoint of our 2019 guidance range. Bob will walk you through the favorable timing differences in the second half of the year in a few minutes, but we are very confident that we will deliver on our financial objectives as we have in the past.So let me start with some quick highlights from the quarter. In July, we filed our Upper Midwest Resource Plan, which runs through 2034. Our preferred plan, which is supported by a partial settlement with various environmental and labor groups, includes the following key points: the early retirement of coal plants, starting with King in 2028, followed by Sherco 3 in 2030. By the end of 2030, we will have completely exited coal in the upper Midwest.The plan also calls for an extension of the life of the Monticello nuclear plant from 2030 to 2040. It includes the acquisition of the Mankato combined cycle natural gas facility and the construction of a combined cycle natural gas plant at the Sherco site. The plant adds an additional 4,000 megawatts of solar and 1,200 megawatts of wind replacement. Finally, we will also add 1,700 megawatts of firm peaking capacity post the 2030 time frame. Our preferred plan would result in an 80% carbon reduction by 2030 and puts NSP on a path to be 100% carbon free by 2050. We are excited by the opportunity to create a cleaner sustainable energy future for our customers.We also continue to make strong progress on our Steel for Fuel strategy. In June, our 478 megawatt Hale wind farm went into service in Texas. The project was completed on time and under budget. Our customers will see substantial savings over its life. All of our other wind projects are in various stages of permitting and construction, and we expect they will be completed between 2019 and 2021. These projects highlight the excellent planning, construction and project management skills of our employees.The legislative sessions are now completed in our states and there were some important laws that were passed. In Texas, three bills passed, a bill that provides the right of first refusal on new transmission projects, a bill that provides rider recovery for new generation, and a bill that provides rider recovery for AMI investment. These bills point to a more constructive regulatory environment in Texas.In Colorado, legislation passed that codified our plans to achieve 100% carbon-free electricity by 2050 and an 80% carbon reduction by 2030. In addition, the bill provides for voluntary securitization as an option and targets utility ownership of 50% of all generation. Also, in Colorado, a bill passed that allows us to own EV infrastructure.Finally, in New Mexico, the Energy Transition Act was passed. This law targets a 50% renewable portfolio standard by 2030 and 100% carbon-free electricity by 2045. We are well positioned to meet the 2030 milestone. We are proud to be leading the clean energy transition and the bills I discussed are consistent with our carbon reduction objectives and reflect our strong alignment with policy makers in our states.Finally, I'm proud to announce that Xcel Energy has been named to the 2019 Military Times Best for Vets Employers ranking. This is the 6th straight year we've received this honor. In 2013, we set a goal to have 10% of new hires to be veterans and the Company has reached that goal every year, Xcel Energy currently employs more than 1,000 veterans, nearly 10% of our workforce. It's an honor to have these men and women in our workforce. Our veterans brings strong leadership, teamwork and experience to their job. Their dedication and passion for service deliver value for our customers every day.So now I will turn it over to Bob Frenzel, who is a (inaudible) to provide you more detail on the quarterly results and our regulatory plans, Bob. -- Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. We recorded second quarter earnings of $0.46 per share compared with $0.52 per share in 2018. The 2019 results reflect $0.05 of adverse weather impact on the quarterly comparison. Most significant earnings driver for the quarter include higher electric and natural gas margins, which increased earnings by $0.09 per share, including various regulatory outcomes and riders to recover our capital investments, which was partially offset by $0.05 per share of unfavorable weather.In addition, our lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.03 per share. However, the majority of the lower ETR is due to an increase in production tax credits, which flow back to customers through electric margin and tax reform impacts, both of which are largely earnings neutral. Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation, interest and other taxes reflecting our capital investment program, which reduced earnings by $0.12 per share, and higher O&M expenses decreased earnings by $0.01 per share.Turning to sales, our year-to-date weather-adjusted electric sales increased by 0.4%, reflecting continued strong customer growth, partially offset by lower use per customer. Year-to-date weather-adjusted natural gas sales increased 3% as a result of strong customer growth and higher use per customer.For 2019, we anticipate slightly favorable consolidated electric sales, which reflect some of the favorable year-to-date sales and some discrete known declines in large customer usage and expectations of lower use per customer in the residential sector. For natural gas, we've increased our 2019 sales guidance to 2% to 3% growth to reflect strong year-to-date performance.Turning to O&M, our quarterly expenses increased by $8 million, reflecting storm costs, natural gas pipeline maintenance and increased IT spend to modernize our business systems that support our strategy to enhance the customer experience. Our year-to-date O&M expenses are above last year largely due to expense timing, but also due to higher-than-expected storm costs in 2019.We expect lower plant outage and nuclear operation costs in the second half of 2019. And as a reminder, we increased our O&M spending in the second half of 2018. Due to the impact of hot weather, as well as incurring costs for environmental remediation and business efficiency improvements. Accordingly, we reiterate our guidance that full year 2019 O&M expenses will be approximately 2% lower than 2018's levels.Next, let me provide a quick regulatory update. In May of 2019, PSCo filed an unopposed settlement agreement in its Colorado steam rate case. The settlement reflects a rate increase of $6.6 million, an equity ratio of 56%, and ROE of 9.6% for AFUDC purposes and utilization of TCJA benefits. New tax rates would occur in two steps in 2019 and October of 2020. The administrative law judge has recommended approval of this settlement, which is pending a Colorado Commission decision.In May of 2019, PSCo also filed an electric rate case in Colorado seeking an increase of $158 million, or 5.7%, based on a historic test year with a capital reach forward for 2019 capital expenditures, an equity ratio of 56.46%, and an ROE of 10.35%. The request reflects capital investment for our advanced grid initiative and changes in depreciation rates, both of which were previously approved by the Commission. PSCo's requested rate is effective in January of 2020.We also reached a settlement in Wisconsin, which will maintain current electric rates through 2021, and result in a modest natural gas rate decrease. This settlement is pending a Commission decision.In July 2019, SPS filed an electric rate case in New Mexico, seeking an increase of $51 million based on a historic test year with a capital reach forward, an ROE of 10.3% and an equity ratio of 54.8%. The request largely reflects capital investment for the Hale wind project as well as other capital invested to support strong growth in the region. We anticipate rates going into effect in the second half of 2020.In addition, we are planning to file an electric rate case in Texas in August to recover our investment in the Hale wind project, as well as other SPS capital projects. Both the Texas and New Mexico Commissions previously granted a Certificate of Need and recovery mechanisms for the Hale wind farm.Next, I want to give a quick update on our PPA buyout efforts. During the quarter, we reached a partial settlement with various environmental and labor groups that support the Mankato combined cycle acquisition. Last week, the Department of Commerce and the Office of the Attorney General filed comments recommending against the acquisition. However, their recommendations included alternate customer protection mechanisms, if the Commission approves the acquisition.We believe, we've demonstrated the economics of ownership are still compelling, despite the disagreements on modeling highlighted by the comments. We anticipate hearings and a Commission decision in September. We are cautiously optimistic that Commission will approve the acquisition based on the anticipated customer savings and the long-term value to the state that our ownership of the facility would create.Additionally, we are actively working across our four operating companies to identify other customer beneficial asset acquisition opportunities and we'll work proactively with our stakeholders to identify the costs, the environmental and the labor benefits of these transactions and we will share these developments as they progress.With that, I'll wrap up. We had a solid second quarter and are right on our budget for first half earnings. Weather and O&M were slightly unfavorable to our budget, but sales and margin were slightly favorable to offset. In the second half of the year, we expect year-over-year favorability in O&M, margin and sales. In addition, depreciation, amortization expense will moderate due to the timing of lower levels of prepaid pension amortization in Colorado. As a result, we're very confident in our ability to deliver earnings at or above the midpoint of our guidance range.In summary, we've filed our preferred plan in the Minnesota resource planning proceeding, which will continue our clean energy transition and if approved, would allow us to reduce carbon emissions by more than 80% by 2030. We completed the Hale wind farm on time and under budget. We reached constructive rate settlements in Wisconsin and our steam case in Colorado. Constructive legislation was passed in Colorado, Texas and New Mexico, and we are well positioned to deliver on our 2019 earnings guidance and our long-term objectives of 5% to 7% earnings and dividend growth.This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we'll now take questions.Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Julien Dumoulin Smith with Bank of America. -- Good morning. This is Alex Morgan calling in for Julien. Thanks so much for taking my call. -- Good morning, Alex. -- Good morning and congratulations on the results and being able to maintain the year-end guidance and maybe on the upper end of the range. I had a few quick questions. And the first one, I was wondering if you could provide any more regulatory environment color, specifically around New Mexico and Colorado? In New Mexico, I know that PNM, for example, is potentially struggling around whether securitization will apply to its future plans. I was wondering if we should interpret that as the Commission looking at different rate cases with a fine tooth comb? And then in Colorado as well I was just hoping for a little more color over there. Thank you. -- Color in Colorado around securitization? -- Just in terms of the regulatory environment and the pending rate cases in both. -- Well, let's start with Colorado. I mean I think we continue to think we have a constructive environment. We're very much aligned with the policymakers in the state. If you look at what we're filing in that rate case, it's really capital oriented, and as Bob mentioned, most of the capital that we're talking about has already been approved. So I think it continues to be very constructive and it helps when you're keeping your total bills very flat. In fact, in Colorado, they are less today than they were four or five years ago. So I think we're in very good position in Colorado.Moving to New Mexico, first of all, SPS, with the overall growth in both Texas and New Mexico, is just really stunning, and it's creating a lot of opportunities for us. And as I mentioned, really pleased with some of the bills that were passed in Texas that supported better regulatory environment. We are aligned in New Mexico. Now, securitization for us in New Mexico is not a very big deal. So I can't give you much more color on that, but I do like the -- I actually think the new administration and some of the changes in the Commission are very positive for New Mexico, and positive for SPS overall. -- One other thing to point out, Alex. We did reach a very constructive settlement with the New Mexico Commission, which allowed for an ROE of just over 9.5%, and an equity ratio of 54% earlier in the first quarter and that was I think a good set of data points for the Commission. -- Thank you so much. That's very helpful. One quick question on the updates around PPAs rolling off. Is there a date by which these need to be announced to take advantage of tax benefits, or is this something that we'll see just rolling into the 2020, whether or not the PTC can be triggered, if there is any wind PPAs rolling off that you might take in half? -- Alex, I don't think there is any deadlines on any of the PPA buyout strategies that we've discussed. And while some of them may be triggered by repowerings of various wind farms. I wouldn't say that's the only trigger for an opportunity for us to potentially buy in one of these assets that we already contract for the benefit of our customers -- Okay. Thank you so much. And last quick question. On Mankato, in terms of the timeline of the Commission decision, when are you thinking about that? -- Well, I think the Commission is scheduled or will most likely take it up in September and probably in the middle of September. So we'll have our answer then. -- Okay. Thank you so much and have a wonderful rest of your day. -- Thank you.And next we will hear from Travis Miller with Morningstar. -- Hi, Travis. -- Good morning. Thank you. Just on Texas, you made some comments there about the positive regulatory environment developments there, especially on the transmission side, would you anticipate potentially putting more capital to work in that state now? -- Well, I mean it's growing pretty significantly and there is a lot of capital that needs to be put in to keep up with that growth. And those rider mechanisms that we have, both for the meter investment, the right of first refusal, and of course, the rider for new gen are very supportive of putting more capital to work at SPS. -- And Travis, this is Bob. We're working through our long-term financial planning process and capital planning process, and we expect to be back with guidance in the third quarter. -- Okay. So, if I recall correctly, it rolls off pretty quickly in Texas, at least, after the wind farms, right? So that could possibly come up in the 2021 type range? -- Yeah. I would say that the wind farms are certainly a large and discrete investment, but our run rate capital in SPS is positive, driven by increased load and increased customer growth there. -- Got it. Yeah. Okay. Thanks. And then very high level. If we look back over the last 10 years, you guys have been right at the forefront of this whole idea of gas-plus-renewables offsetting I think coal retirements. As you look forward in the next 10 years, once coal essentially comes out of the picture for you guys, are we in an environment where it's gas versus renewables, whether that's solar or wind, but is that the offset, is that the competition assuming very flat or little growth on the demand side? -- Thank you. Travis for that. I mean, first of all, let's get to that 80% milestone, which is a big milestone by 2030. I mentioned, we will be completely out of coal in the Midwest. Still have some coal after that on our system, so there'll be more transitioning. I think gas and renewables and the extension of nuclear make all the sense on how we continue on our path to a 100% carbon-free electricity by 2050. I don't think they really compete with each other, they will support each other at that point.Of course, we will also be looking at the role batteries can play on our grid, the role batteries can play with storage. I think it will be even more important to have demand response type programs. And of course, we're very excited about EVs and what that might mean to our system and the new interactions that can create with our customers. -- Okay. And do you still see a role for gas in an 100% type carbon-free environment and how would that -- how do you see that vision? -- Yeah. Very good question. I mean, by 2050, unless those plants are burning renewable gas, which is certainly a possibility, you wouldn't want them on the grid. But that is a number of decades away, and I think it's incredibly important that you take early action. And so I think gases -- how we move away from coal, how we maintain reliability, how we maintain affordability, we get to that 80% mark. And as I've said before, we're going to need to work on those technologies to get that last bit of carbon off of our system. There's a lot of different things it could be, but for now, we need to take early action and gas is the avenue to get us there. -- I know you've got it. Okay. Thanks so much for the thoughts. -- You got it.Our next question will come from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. -- Hey. Good morning. So, in Colorado, there has been some discussion about some wind contractors who have been basically not signing onto the contracts, that have been basically backing out of their deal with you guys because the price has been too low. And I was just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on that and what you're seeing in terms of having to recontract and what you're seeing in the economics out there? -- Paul, are you talking about wind or are you talking about solar? -- I thought it was wind. I think it -- the renewable contracts. -- Well, what I am familiar with and I'd ask David Eves to help out if I'm missing something. But we have some solar contracts, one of which was going to support our deal with the EVRAZ steel mill. That particular vendor pulled out due to economics. They had a change of ownership. The good news is, we've gone out with bids and have received very attractive replacement bid. So I think things remain on track in Colorado, both for the CEP plan, as well as our unique deal to keep EVRAZ right there in Colorado and expanding. David, did I miss anything? Okay. -- Okay. So what I'm reading here about some wind contractors backing out, that articles inaccurate, I guess, is that correct? I can follow up with you guys afterwards. I just saw -- OK. We can talk about it afterwards. -- So, let's follow-up on it. If I'm missing something, we can look at it, but we've had in the past, remember, we have stepped into some wind developer contracts that where they couldn't make it happen, and we've came in and taken over the project and made it happen for the benefit of our customers. I think that probably points to a strong reason why you continue to want to have a mix of PPAs and utility ownership. Because we've demonstrated, we can bring things to the table. And when you do a big solicitation, you're going to have some bids that can't cut the mustard in the end, and you just keep moving to the next bid or you step in and take it over yourself. But I don't see this as anything but business as usual. -- Okay. And so, you don't see any change -- what it sounds like is, yeah, there might be some people dropping out, but for the most part, you haven't seen any change in the economics or anything significant in terms of renewable development and the outlook for the CEP or anything? Is that a good way to summarize it? -- That's absolutely right. Paul. -- Okay. Great. And then also just picking up on the storage discussion that you mentioned. I know that you have 275 megawatts, I believe, you do, under the CEP. And I just was wondering, in general, we're seeing a lot of discussion, different developers talking about combined renewables with battery coming in quite cheap in different RFPs. I'm just wondering, since you guys are sort of big on this stuff, what you're seeing, and how you see the economics of that developing, keep this argument, or cheaper than the peak or that thing? What are you guys seeing practically on the ground and what's your outlook there? -- So, great question. And we are seeing some very attractive bids, and you mentioned the 275 megawatt battery project, that's associated with a solar asset and its associated with a solar asset, Paul, because you want -- because that allows for the 30% ITC to be recognized. And that did put it on parity with peakers. I think batteries will continue to fall in price, just like I think renewables will continue to fall in price and over time, overcome the roll off of the tax benefits.And yes, storage can be the new peakers, but only to a certain degree of penetration and saturation, I mean, because as you know, we need to plan for much more than a four-hour, even an eight-hour event. So I think the initial tranches of batteries are very valuable and planning basis, you give them equal weight as you would with a traditional CT peaker. But the more penetration you have in batteries, the more you shave off that very peak load. You start to lose some of the planning value of batteries. And not to get too technical on you, but we're aware of that. Of course, batteries will have other roles on the grid, including supporting the grid reliability and we're looking at those alternatives. And all of that will be baked into our plans as we move forward, but you cannot replace all peaking needs with batteries. That's very clear. -- Okay. Paul, one thing I would add on just to Ben's comments is, we did do a broad solicitation for the Colorado Energy Plan. We published the results of that solicitation with averages and we published the solar-only and a solar-plus-storage average. I don't have the numbers at my fingertips, but if you want more details on what we saw about 18 months ago in a solicitation, we can share that with you. Obviously, the markets move for both solar and for storage assets, and we continue to see price declines in both of those asset classes, but I think that those midpoints will highlight to you how competitive some of that stuff is becoming over time. -- Okay. Great. Thanks so much guys. -- Thank you.And with no further questions in the queue, I'd like to turn the call back over to Bob Frenzel for any additional or closing remarks. -- Thanks for participating in our second quarter earnings call this morning. We look forward to seeing people on the road in the third quarter. We have quite a few conferences and road shows that we highlight in our investor materials.Lastly, and before we depart, I'd like to introduce our new Director of Investor Relations, [Indecipherable], she joins us from our Internal Corporate Strategy Group. She will be working with Paul and Darin going forward. So, please feel free to reach out to anybody in Investor Relations, if you have any questions or calls. Thank you. -- Thank you.[Operator Closing Remarks] --  --  --  --  --  --

"ong-term, buy-and-hold investing is the single best way to build wealth. It's also one of the least stressful. Rather than buying in and out of stocks, fretting over every press release, or panicking when a bad quarter crops up unexpectedly, individual investors with a long-term mind-set can look to the horizon and let the power of compound interest work its magic.With that in mind, we recently asked three contributors at The Motley Fool for companies they're following that will be better than ever 20 years from now. Here's why they chose  ,  , and  .Image source: Getty Images. Long-term investors will find a lot to like about Xcel Energy, which owns four electric utilities located in the middle of the Lower 48. The stock pays out an annual dividend yield of 2.7% and has delivered a five-year return of 129% with dividends included, which is markedly higher than the total return of ""only"" 68% for the S&P 500 index. It seems likely that market-thumping pace will continue for the foreseeable future.Xcel Energy is positioning itself to respond to and capitalize on several sweeping changes affecting American electric utilities. Namely, the rise of wind and solar power generation, the coming transition to electric vehicles, and the retirement of coal-fired (and, inevitably, natural gas-fired) power plants. In fact, it remains the only utility or utility holding company to have committed to generating 100% of its electricity from zero-carbon power sources by 2050.  Xcel Energy has discovered that the more it relies on wind power, the lower its operating expenses and capital expenditures become. That's because a wind farm doesn't require refueling, which is obviously not true for a power plant running on natural gas, coal, or nuclear power. Consider that 47% of a typical customer bill in 2010 went to fuel-related expenses, but that's expected to fall to just 25% by 2027 thanks to coal-fired power plant retirements and increasing wind power investments. That transition can keep customer bills low while freeing up substantially more capital to invest in new power generating assets -- or dividends. The company thinks 46% of its generation mix will come from wind and solar assets by 2027, up from 22% last year. That could increase to 60% by 2030, which would allow Xcel Energy to reduce carbon emissions 80% from 2005 levels. Simply put, this stock figures to continue being great for investors and the environment for the next two decades and beyond. Image source: Getty Images.Software has automated a lot of back-office functions, but plenty of accounting work is still done manually. For example, most accountants produce financial reports by manually pulling together data from a hodgepodge of sources. This is a slow, repetitive process that is essential for a business but can be extremely frustrating.BlackLine is on a mission to bring accountants into the 21st century. This software-as-a-service business provides tools that collect data from numerous sources and process it in real time. This increases accuracy, smoothes out the natural boom-or-bust cycle, and frees up time for accountants and managers to focus on other projects.More than 227,000 users from more than 2,700 companies have already adopted BlackLine's solutions. This includes companies from a wide range of industries such as , , , , SunTrust Bank, and more. Better yet, existing customers find the software so useful that they spend more money with BlackLine each year. BlackLine has been able to consistently grow its top line at an above-average rate for many years (this figure was ).The opportunity ahead of BlackLine remains massive. Management estimates that its current total addressable market opportunity is $18 billion. That's an enormous figure when compared to the $279 million analysts expect it to haul in during 2019. With its differentiated product, history of success, and massive runway for growth, there are a lot of reasons to believe that BlackLine will be able to grow at an above-average rate for decades to come. That, in my book, makes it an ideal stock to buy and hold for the long term.Image source: Getty Images. It would be an understatement to say that investors made out well by holding Starbucks during its first 20 years as a public company. If you bought in at its 1992 IPO, you'd have seen your investment  by 160 times over the next two decades. Its sheer size means the chain's huge growth days are behind it, but shareholders could still enjoy solid long-term returns from here.Starbucks stock recently hit all-time highs following a second-quarter earnings report that showed notable sales growth and a return to rising profit margin. Those wins were tempered by  in the key U.S. market and fierce competition in China.The chain seems well positioned to handle both challenges, and the assets it brings to these fights include a market-leading brand, a fast cadence of innovative drink releases, and a world-class .

"ver the past couple of decades, the share of U.S. electricity generated by coal has declined materially. On the surface, the big driver of that drop-off is a global shift toward cleaner fuel sources. But look deeper, and you'll see there are other issues in play. The CEOs of   and   recently explained exactly what's going on, in their views. Here's why transitioning to clean-energy sources is so hard, and why scale and diversification will be increasingly important in this industry.In June,  polled 3,281 U.S. residents about their feelings on environmental issues. The results were pretty clear: 69% of respondents believe that ""aggressive"" action is needed to help fight climate change. However, when the same people were asked if they would be willing to pitch in $100 a year to help get the environmental ball rolling, support dropped to 34%. The tiny incremental cost of $8.33 a month was enough to reduce support for attacking the causes of climate change by half.Image source: Getty Images.That reflects exactly what the heads of Duke Energy and Xcel Energy have been saying lately. Ben Fowke, the CEO of Xcel, summarized the issue at a recent conference: ""[Customers] do want to see us reduce carbon emissions, but they don't want to see us do it at the price of affordability or sacrificing reliability. So, I think this transition will happen because customers want it, but it has to happen at the speed of value that technology brings."" Basically, people don't want to see big increases in their bills, nor are they willing to accept power shortages. As promoters of traditional fuels are quick to point out, wind and solar are intermittent power sources -- solar panels only work when the sun is shining, and .Which brings up some interesting numbers. Coal, one of the dirtiest sources of electric power, has seen its share of the power grid fall, while renewable power's share has increased. But the most notable growth over the past decade or so has been the percentage of electricity generated by natural gas. Effectively, utilities are replacing their oldest and most-polluting base-load coal plants (facilities that run continuously) with cleaner-burning natural gas plants. That's driven by a lower cost of construction and low natural gas prices, but with the add-on benefit that natural gas burns more cleanly than coal.Renewable power has indeed grown into a notable contributor to the grid, but it's not the biggest story in the U.S. power market despite the headlines it generates.The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects coal plant retirements to slow materially by 2025, and those that remain will be run at higher utilization rates. As a result, coal's contribution to the U.S. grid should remain fairly consistent between 2025 and 2050. The biggest factor that will influence that is expected to be the cost of the fuels in question. If natural gas stays cheap, coal will face greater challenges, but so, too, will renewables, which would continue to grow their market share, but at a slower pace. Effectively, renewables will be competing primarily with more-efficient and cleaner-burning natural gas in the future, rather than with dirty coal, which will make renewables a little bit harder to sell.To be fair, these are just educated guesses, and the EIA has been wrong before in its long-term projections. (It's not exactly easy to accurately look ahead 30 years.) But the logic is sound, and the forecast fits with what utility industry CEOs are saying and doing. For example, coal made up 61% of Duke Energy's generation in 2005, with natural gas pitching in a tiny 6% and renewables a scant 1% (nuclear power made up the rest). By 2018, coal was down to 31%, natural gas up to 32%, and renewables had risen to 5%, with nuclear's contribution remaining constant.Obviously, natural gas was the biggest gainer, and it will continue to be if Duke's current plans pan out. By 2030, it hopes to get coal down to just 15% of its mix, with natural gas increasing to 41%. Renewables are projected to increase to 14%. (Nuclear will continue to make up the rest.) That implies a balanced approach from Duke, with reduced coal exposure shifting in roughly equal proportions toward natural gas and renewable power. data by .Xcel is taking a more aggressive approach. Coal's share of the company's generation fell from 56% in 2005 to 33% in 2018. Renewable power took up the largest share of that slack, increasing from 3% of the mix to 22%. Xcel is one of the largest players in wind power, partially because it serves markets in generally windy states. The company hopes to get 60% of its power from renewables by 2030, with coal, natural gas, and nuclear filling out the mix. But it notes that regulatory approval will be needed to make that happen -- cost and system reliability are two key factors that regulators consider when making such decisions.Also interesting to consider are the recent comments utility peer   about the increasing investment risks in the renewable space. Put simply, it has pulled back from building renewable power assets that sell electricity to others because  to the long-term contracts backing these investments. That last risk was on clear display when  got court approval to renegotiate some renewable power contracts it had signed before it declared bankruptcy. That could have big implications for  in the renewable industry. data by .For example, renewable power upstart   proactively cut its dividend because of its exposure to PG&E.   also had a handful of assets selling power to PG&E. But size matters. NextEra owns the largest regulated utility in Florida, the foundation upon which it has built a huge business selling renewable power to other utilities under long-term contracts. As a diversified giant, NextEra can handle the hit from PG&E, where a relatively tiny renewable power-focused company couldn't.Yes, renewable power is set to keep growing, and there will be a lot of money to be made in the industry. But be careful not to get too caught up in the hype. Utilities have to live within real-world constraints (which they are openly telling investors), and those will have an impact on renewable power's growth rate.So far, the biggest news hasn't really been the growth of renewable power, it's been the shift from coal to cleaner natural gas. With that transition nearly over, renewables will increasingly have to compete with relatively new and low-cost natural gas plants. If natural gas stays cheap, it could be a lot harder to convince utilities -- and their regulators -- to aggressively switch to renewables.Technological advances could change that equation. We could see rapidly falling solar panel prices and improvements in large-scale energy storage, for example. But be careful about how you choose to invest in the renewable power space. Bigger players with more diversified businesses (such as NextEra and Southern) may end up being better calls than small, niche renewable players (Clearway) that don't have anything else to fall back on.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''.  These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand.  Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).  Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

"wning dividend stocks can be one of the best ways to beat the market and generate a little income along the way. And energy stocks have long been an investor favorite for dividends. But the last few years have shown more volatility in energy dividends than investors might want. Oil price volatility has affected everyone from oil drillers to marketers. Even utilities have . With these risks in mind,   ,  , and   have solid dividends in the energy industry today. Image source: Getty Images.Yieldcos -- companies that own assets with high levels of deprecation, resulting in non-operating losses but generate cash for dividends -- have gone in and out of favor for investors, but NextEra Energy Partners has stood the test of time. The company is a subsidiary of  , one of the biggest utility companies in the country. This gives the company a stability few yieldcos have had before it. NextEra Energy's involvement gives NextEra Energy Partners 21 gigawatts (GW) of backlogged renewable energy projects that can be sold -- or dropped down in industry parlance -- to the yieldco. To buy those assets, though, Next Era Energy Partners needs to use either debt or equity to fund these dropdowns. As long as the yieldco has a relatively low dividend, currently at a 4.1% yield, and a low cost of debt, it can keep buying dropdown assets at a relatively low cost of capital to drive growth. As it stands today, NextEra Energy Partners has 5.3 GW of assets in the portfolio with an average of 17 years remaining in contracts to sell electricity to utilities. Because of the treatment of dividends as a return of capital to investors, at least the next eight years of dividends will also be tax-free. And with projects already in the portfolio and visibility of future dropdowns, management says it expects 12% to 15% dividend growth through 2023. The utility business has been more unpredictable than most investors expected as rooftop solar eats into demand, and cheap natural gas challenges the economics of aging fossil fuel plants. Xcel Energy has the advantage of operating primarily in states where residential solar doesn't have much market share (Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Colorado) and demand has steadily grown. Xcel has also been able to leverage the renewable energy assets in its territory to grow, while not running afoul of more renewable energy regulation. The company operates utilities with one of the largest concentrations of wind power in the country, expected to be 11.3 GW by 2021. Owning those renewable energy assets gets the utility out in front of regulation or customers preferring renewable energy (I buy 100% wind power from Xcel Energy). When combined with steady consumption growth in its areas of operation, the utility has the steady growth you see below. data by Xcel doesn't have the biggest dividend, trading at a 2.7% yield right now. But the stability of its utility business along with its growing renewable energy portfolio makes it a great dividend stock to own long term. Hannon Armstrong is lumped in with traditional yieldcos, but it's a different beast altogether. The company says it provides financing for infrastructure projects that ""reduce carbon emissions and increase resilience to climate change."" That can include anything from a  for a corporate partner. It doesn't usually invest directly in renewable energy projects, instead buying underlying assets that present lower risks. For example, 22% of its $1.9 billion portfolio consists of land under solar projects, 17% is preferred equity in wind projects, and 31% are energy projects with government agencies. These asset classes each present a much lower risk than owning equity in a project, as yieldcos and utilities do. Hannon Armstrong's  is a solid payback for a company presenting relatively low risk for investors. The company has shown a history of prudent investments, and it's providing a growing amount of financing that allows more sustainable projects to be built. NextEra Energy Partners, Xcel Energy, and Hannon Armstrong all have their own strengths in energy, but one commonality is that they have predictable revenue streams years into the future. I think that's important in an era when oil and gas prices can rise and fall sharply based on the news of the day. For the foreseeable future, these dividends are as rock solid as it gets in the energy industry. When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"nvestors in Xcel Energy Inc (Symbol: XEL) saw new options begin trading this week, for the July 19th expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the XEL options chain for the new July 19th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $55.00 strike price has a current bid of 35 cents.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $55.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $54.65 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of XEL, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $57.20/share today.

Because the $55.00 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 76%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 0.64% return on the cash commitment, or 5.05% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.


Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Xcel Energy Inc, and highlighting in green where the $55.00 strike is located relative to that history:


   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $60.00 strike price has a current bid of 10 cents.  If an investor was to purchase shares of XEL stock at the current price level of $57.20/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $60.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.07% if the stock gets called away at the July 19th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if XEL shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Xcel Energy Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing XEL's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $60.00 strike highlighted in red:



   
Considering the fact that the $60.00 strike represents an approximate 5% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 79%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 0.17% boost of extra return to the investor, or 1.39% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.


The implied volatility in the put contract example is 23%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 17%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 250 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $57.20) to be 16%.

They selected clean energy-focused utility , hydropower leader , and tech giant . Read on to find out why they believe these stocks seem like excellent ""forever"" holdings.Image source: Getty Images. The business owns four regional electric utilities positioned within the American Wind Corridor, which is home to some of the best wind power potential on the planet. That's helped to give management the confidence to make an ambitious and bold promise: Xcel Energy will generate all of its electricity from zero-carbon sources by 2050.For reference, the company's power mix leaned on wind and solar for 22% of its electricity generation at the end of 2018, while nuclear contributed 13% and other renewables such as hydroelectric contributed 3%. Wind and solar alone will jump to 46% of the total generation mix by 2027 thanks to an . So the company is well on its way compared to most utilities, but investors also know the road to 100% zero-carbon electricity represents an incredible growth opportunity.Xcel Energy has taken advantage of its geographic location to go all-in on wind farms, which don't require fuel, which makes them cheaper to operate than coal-fired or natural gas-fired power plants in the long haul. That has freed up capital to invest in new renewable energy projects, increase its above-average dividend that currently yields 2.9%, and explore futuristic products and services such as at-home charging for electric vehicles (EVs). Regarding the latter, the utility expects as many as 2 million EVs in its service areas by 2035, which could provide a significant boost to its business.Given the long-term certainty surrounding its vision, the new growth opportunities it will create, and the fact shares trade at just 20 times future earnings, Xcel Energy is an easy stock to consider for investors with a long-term mindset.Hydropower-focused Brookfield Renewable Partners has outperformed the market by a wide margin since its formation. That's mainly due to the company's ability to buy renewable power-generating assets at bargain prices and then increase their profitability through improved operating and financial performance.The company currently anticipates that it can grow the cash flows of its existing portfolio at a 6% to 11% annual rate over the next five years, which includes some benefit from development projects it has underway. That embedded growth alone should support 5% to 9% yearly increases in the company's 6%-yielding distribution.On top of that, the company maintains a strong financial profile, which gives it the flexibility to continue making value-based investments. Brookfield Renewable recently made one such deal by securing a 750 million Canadian dollar ($558 million) . The company also just acquired two wind farms in India. The company's global mandate and ability to invest across several different renewable technologies opens up tremendous opportunities for future investment.In Brookfield's view, there is as much as an $11 trillion opportunity set in its core market alone for renewable investment. That massive potential makes it an ideal company to hold in the decades ahead.Image source: Getty Images.Networking hardware market leader Cisco has been transforming itself over the past few years. The company has bet on subscriptions, software, and services, reducing its dependence on one-off sales of switches and routers. Selling switches and routers is still the company's core business, but those products are increasingly being sold as part of subscription packages. The Catalyst 9000 series of switches, for example, is bundled with software and sold as a subscription.This shift toward recurring revenue has helped Cisco post a streak of solid growth, despite tariffs on Chinese products and general macro-economic uncertainty. The company grew sales by 6% year over year in its fiscal third quarter, excluding divestitures, and it expects sales to grow by 4.5% to 6.5% in the fourth quarter. Unlike some companies struggling with a , Cisco so far appears unscathed.If trade tensions continue to escalate, Cisco may feel at least some pain. But in the longer run, the company has positioned itself to continue to dominate the market for networking hardware. And Cisco's bets on other areas, like security and collaboration, can help drive growth as well.Cisco stock trades for around 17 times the average analyst estimate for full-year adjusted earnings. That's not clear-cut bargain territory, but it's not an unreasonable price to pay for this dominant company.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''.  These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand.  Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).  Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

he United States generated close to 10% of its total electricity from wind and solar in 2018. The share of modern renewables in the nation's power mix is expected to grow to 13% by 2020 and could reach 30% by 2030. The impressive growth can be attributed to a combination of technological improvements, cost declines, and state policies. But the growth hasn't been evenly distributed. Thirty-eight percent of America's solar power capacity is installed in California. One-quarter of the country's wind power capacity is spinning in Texas, while 66% is contained within the 11 states in the American Wind Corridor, which runs roughly down the center of the Lower 48. There's a 360,000-square-mile swath of the Southeast, spanning seven whole states, that isn't home to a single wind turbine. And the Eastern Seaboard is furiously building natural-gas pipelines and power plants -- even converting coal-fired power plants to run on gas.  Put another way, wind and solar power potential is heavily influenced by geography, which means national averages can be a little misleading. That's something individual investors have to take into account when crafting a clean-energy investing strategy.Image source: Getty Images.A thermal power plant would deliver roughly the same output if it were built in Texas or New York. The same would not be true for two identical solar or wind farms. That affects everything from the price of electricity to the ambitions of state policies. It's why sun-soaked California can mandate that 100% of its electricity come from renewable sources by 2045 without much trouble, while cloud-covered  for clean energy.Generally speaking, the West Coast benefits from bountiful solar, the Midwest thrives from wind-swept plains, and the Eastern Seaboard is praying that  can help to mitigate its reliance on cheap natural gas. The regional differences in renewable power potential are clearly evident when considering the generation portfolios of  ,  , and  .NextEra Energy produces more electricity from wind and solar than any other company in the world thanks to its power-generation subsidiary NextEra Energy Resources (NEER), which operates 17,000 megawatts of renewable power assets across the country. The company's massive project pipeline highlights how it plans to use geography to its advantage when decarbonizing the nation's regional electric grids. Data source: Investor presentation.The long-term pipeline really highlights the poor renewable energy potential of the mid-Atlantic states and the stale air of the Southeast. The latter has actually created a headache for NextEra Energy and its main utility subsidiary, Florida Power & Light (FPL).Despite being called the Sunshine State, Florida relies on natural gas for 73% of its generation mix, partly due to its lack of wind potential. That led to an outcry from climate-conscious investors that likely tipped the utility's hand to announce an ambitious solar power strategy in which it plans to install  -- representing more installed solar capacity than the entire state boasts today. To be fair, the state's high humidity and salty air corrodes solar panels faster than usual, which also corrodes the economics of the power source, but FPL is .Xcel Energy shouldn't have to worry about that problem. The company benefits from owning four electric utilities covering states in the salt-free American Wind Corridor. It's on track to lean on wind and solar for 45% of its power mix by 2027. In fact, it's the only utility in the country to have publicly committed to generating 100% of its electricity from zero-carbon sources by 2050.What's most impressive about that ambitious goal is the company's confidence it can jettison low-cost natural gas from its portfolio, although that's heavily influenced by geography and , as its operational territories boast some of the cheapest wind and solar electricity prices in the country.Image source: Getty Images.Dominion Power won't have it so easy. The mid-Atlantic power generator  for 52% of its electricity mix, while renewables contribute just 4%. While the company has come under scrutiny for not being ambitious enough with its long-term plans for clean energy, geography plays a major role in its investing decisions. That means investors can expect natural gas and nuclear power (responsible for the remaining 43% of its power mix) to hold down the portfolio for the foreseeable future, although the company has one trick up its sleeve: offshore wind power. The United States has just 30 megawatts of offshore wind power capacity operating today, but boasts nearly 24,000 megawatts of projects in planning or development. Nearly all of those dot the Eastern Seaboard, including a potential 2,000-megawatt project being considered by Dominion Energy. If the economics work out from a pilot-stage test phase, then the company could put the massive wind farm into service by 2030.Investors eager to add renewable energy growth stocks to their portfolio will have to take into account the regional differences in wind and solar potential from sea to shining sea, especially if more ambitious climate change regulations are handed down by state and federal authorities in the near future. NextEra Energy offers the most complete one-stop shop thanks to its power generation subsidiary, while Xcel Energy's concentrated assets in the American Wind Corridor should help it transition to 100% zero-carbon electricity with relative ease. Dominion Energy and its mid-Atlantic peers won't have it so easy, but it's a stock to watch in offshore wind power, which might represent a significant part of the company's future.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and NextEra Energy wasn't one of them!

"nvestors in Xcel Energy Inc (Symbol: XEL) saw new options become available this week, for the August 16th expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the XEL options chain for the new August 16th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $55.00 strike price has a current bid of 15 cents.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $55.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $54.85 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of XEL, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $60.51/share today.

Because the $55.00 strike represents an approximate 9% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 95%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 0.27% return on the cash commitment, or 1.95% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.


Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Xcel Energy Inc, and highlighting in green where the $55.00 strike is located relative to that history:


   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $65.00 strike price has a current bid of 10 cents.  If an investor was to purchase shares of XEL stock at the current price level of $60.51/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $65.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 7.59% if the stock gets called away at the August 16th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if XEL shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Xcel Energy Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing XEL's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $65.00 strike highlighted in red:



   
Considering the fact that the $65.00 strike represents an approximate 7% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 88%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 0.17% boost of extra return to the investor, or 1.18% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.


The implied volatility in the put contract example is 23%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 16%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $60.51) to be 16%.

"hile it's always best to take a long-term view of a business and to not get too fixated on a single quarterly performance, individual investors won't get penalized for admitting that a business turned in a mediocre performance, either. Unfortunately for  , it started off 2019 with a dud.The electric utility holding company grew  (EPS) compared to the year-ago period, but only because of a sharp drop in income taxes in the most recent quarter. Operating expenses rose faster than revenue, which led to operating income growing only 1% year over year.Of course, electric and natural-gas utilities are exposed to seasonal ebbs and flows, so one quarter is hardly enough to make or break the business. More important, management is confident Xcel Energy will meet full-year 2019 earnings guidance; it announced the approval of a massive wind-power project, which will prove crucial to meeting multiple long-term goals.Image source: Getty Images.Xcel Energy owns four regional utilities that deliver electricity and natural gas to customers in seven states. All of those states are in the American wind corridor, a region that extends from West Texas to North Dakota and boasts some of the best wind potential on the planet. That has helped the company become the second-largest operator of wind turbines in the United States, and to embark on its ambitious ""Steel for Fuel"" strategy. It's quite simple: replace aging fossil-fuel plants with wind turbines, which don't require fuel inputs once built, thus lowering operating expenses.The strategy continues to deliver for the business and shareholders. In the first quarter of 2019, electric revenue rose 2.4% while the cost of electric revenue fell 2%. Xcel Energy has to share the cost savings with customers because its regional utilities are regulated, but it's still freeing up significant capital to reinvest elsewhere.One area receiving growth capital in recent years: natural gas utilities. While revenue grew 20% year over year due to cold weather and a rate increase in Colorado, Xcel Energy saw natural-gas expenses jump 28% in the comparison period. That was responsible for 56% of the year-over-year increase in total operating expenses, which include maintenance, depreciation, amortization, and non-income taxes. Put another way, natural gas was largely responsible for the company's lackluster start to 2019.Data source: Company press release. YoY = year over year.The large increase in natural gas expenses weighed on operating income, which grew by just $6 million, or 1.2%, compared to the year-ago period. That dropped the company's total operating margin to 15.5% in the first quarter of 2019, compared to 16.3% in the prior-year quarter. Xcel Energy managed to grow net income from $291 million to $315 million in that span, but only because income taxes fell 58%.That's not a reliable way to grow EPS, but management seems unfazed when it views the bigger picture.Management reaffirmed its confidence in achieving full-year 2019 EPS guidance of $2.55 to $2.65. Not only is its Steel for Fuel strategy succeeding, but Xcel Energy also earned higher rates from regulators in New Mexico, and saw renewable-energy legislation progress in four of the seven states it operates in.Additionally, Xcel Energy earned approval to build the 500-megawatt Cheyenne Ridge wind farm in Colorado. It's part of the company's , which will add 1,800 MW of wind and solar power to the state's generation mix while shuttering coal-fired power plants. Less obvious is the project's importance to the company's broader plans, which include owning most of the wind power added to its portfolio in the next several years. After exiting 2017 owning a sliver of the 6,700 MW of wind capacity in its portfolio (most was entered into via power purchase agreements), the business expects to own 40% of the 11,300 MW of wind capacity in its generation mix by 2021.Image source: Getty Images.While most businesses are judged by net income and EPS, operating income is a better measuring stick in many cases. After all, there are a lot of ways to juice EPS -- such as reducing share count, receiving a tax cut, or accounting for changes in the fair value of financial instruments -- that aren't sustainable in the long run. Growing revenue at healthy margins is a more reliable way to endure as a business.That said, the mediocre year-over-year comparison reflects just three months of operations. Investors shouldn't panic, but it wouldn't hurt to remain vigilant about the business for the remainder of 2019. For now, there's no reason to think Xcel Energy cannot hit its goal of growing EPS 5% to 7% per year from 2018 to 2023.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Xcel Energy wasn't one of them!

Image source: The Motley Fool.  Q1 2019 , Good day, and welcome to the Xcel Energy First Quarter 2019 . Today's conference is being recorded.At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Paul Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. -- Good morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2019 First Quarter . Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Frenzel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have other members of the management team available to answer your questions.This morning, we will review our first quarter results and update you on recent business and regulatory developments. As you are aware there are slides that accompany today's call available on our website.As a reminder, some of the comments during today's conference call may contain forward-looking information, significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated or described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC. On today's call, we will discuss certain metrics that are non-GAAP measures, including ongoing earnings and electric and natural gas margins. Information on the comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations are included in our earnings release.I'll now turn the call over to Ben. -- Thank you, Paul, and good morning. Today we reported first quarter earnings of $0.61 per share compared to $0.57 per share last year. We're pleased with the strong start to the year and we are well positioned to deliver on our 2019 guidance and our long-term financial objectives.So let me start with some quick highlights from the quarter. In February, we increased our quarterly dividend by $2.5 per share or 6.6%. This represents an annualized increase of $0.10 per share, which is a step up over historic levels of $0.08 per share. We are growing the dividend at an increased rate due to our strong transparent earnings growth profile and the flexibility afforded by our low dividend payout ratio.We also continue to make strong progress on our Steel for Fuel strategy, with almost 3,000 megawatts of new wind that has received regulatory approval and is moving forward in the construction process.In Colorado, the commission approved our certificate of need for our Cheyenne Ridge wind farm based on a constructive settlement, which includes a construction cost cap and a customer protection mechanism. We will recover costs upon completion through riders until the next rate case after the project goes into service.Our Hale project in Texas is on track with construction expected to be completed in June on time and within budget. And we are waiting for final generation interconnect studies and agreements for our Sagamore project in New Mexico and our Crowned Ridge 3 project in Minnesota. We expect construction to begin later this year.All of our other wind projects are in various stages of permitting and construction and will be completed as expected between 2019 and 2021. These projects highlight the excellent planning, construction and project management skills of our employees.In December, we were the first utility in the United States to announce plans to achieve an 80% carbon reduction by 2030 and a 100% carbon-free electricity by 2050. We're excited to work with stakeholders as we continue the Clean Energy Transition, while providing reliable service and keeping bills low. The legislative session is still ongoing in most of our states and we continue to work with stakeholders on various legislative initiatives that would impact the utility sector.In Texas, there are bills under consideration that will provide the right of first refusal on new transmission projects and rider recovery for new generation and AMI investment. The outlook for these proposals is positive and points to a more constructive regulatory environment in Texas.In New Mexico, the Energy Transition Act was signed into law by the governor in March. This law targets a 50% renewable portfolio standard by 2030 and a 100% carbon-free electricity by 2045. We believe we are well positioned to meet the 2030 milestone.In Colorado, there's proposed legislation that quantifies our plans to achieve 100% carbon-free electricity by 2050 and 80% carbon reduction by 2030. In addition, the bill is expected to provide for voluntary securitization as an option and it targets utility ownership of 50% of all generation and provides customer protections.I'm proud to be leading the Clean Energy Transition and support these bills, which are consistent with our carbon reduction objectives and provide positive benefits for our customers and our shareholders. This is another example of our strong alignment with policymakers in our states.I also want to recognize the efforts of our employees as they worked through the polar vortex and the bomb cyclone that hit our various states. They did a great job working in extreme conditions to restore service in record time.I'll now turn the call over to Bob and he'll provide more detail on the quarterly results and our regulatory plans. -- Thanks, Ben, and good morning to everyone. We had a strong first quarter with earnings of $0.61 per share compared with $0.57 per share in 2018. Most significant earnings drivers for the quarter, include high electric and natural gas margins, which increased earnings by $0.15 per share, including the impact of favorable weather and various regulatory outcomes and riders to recover our capital investments, partially offset by wind production tax credits that flow back to our customers.In addition, our lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.06 per share. However, the majority of the lower effective tax rate is due to an increase in production tax credits, which flow back to our customers through electric margin and tax reform impacts both of which are largely earnings neutral.Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation interests and other taxes reflecting our capital investment program, which reduced earnings by $0.11 per share and higher O&M expenses, which decreased earnings by $0.06 per share. Please note that we've calculated the EPS deviations for both years presented based on a blended statutory tax rate of 25% following the implementation of tax reform.Turning to sales. Our weather adjusted electric sales increased to 0.5% in the first quarter, reflecting continued strong customer growth, partially offset by lower use per customer. Weather adjusted natural gas sales increased 2.5% for the quarter as a result of strong customer growth and higher use per customer.For 2019, we're still anticipating relative flat consolidated electric sales, which reflects some discrete known declines in large customer usage and expectations of lower use per customer in the residential sector. For natural gas, we expect slightly positive sales in 2009 (sic ) 2019 reflecting continued growth in C&I and residential loads.Turning to expenses. Our O&M expenses increased by $40 million reflecting costs from substantial winter storms, the in-servicing of the Rush Creek wind farm, higher business systems and benefit costs and the timing of plant overhauls. Over the last 5 years, we've increased our rate base by approximately 7% annually, while keeping O&M expenses relatively flat. Over the same time period, customer expectations and risk aversion have increased. As a result, we're increasing our O&M spending in strategic areas to enhance the customer experience, increase cyber security and reduce systematic risk in our operations. And we remain committed to our long-term objective of improving operating efficiencies and taking other costs out of the business for the benefit of our customers. Therefore, we've raised our 2019 O&M guidance, which reflects a decline of approximately 2% from 2018 levels.We expect to offset the impact of the slightly higher O&M and are confident in our ability to deliver earnings in our guidance range consistent with our plan.Next let me provide a quick regulatory update. In March, SPS reached a settlement with the New Mexico commission resulting in a revised rate order, which eliminated the retroactive TCJA refund, increase the equity ratio to 53.97% from the previously authorized 51% and increase the ROE to 9.56% from the previously authorized 9.1%. The revised order is expected to increase annual revenue by $4.5 million effective in March of 2019.We believe this is a constructive settlement and a sign of progress in New Mexico. In addition, we're planning to file electric cases in Colorado later in the second quarter, Texas and New Mexico this summer to recover our investment in the Hale Wind project as well as other SPS capital projects and Minnesota in November.With that, I'll wrap up. In summer, we had a strong first quarter. We increased our dividend for the 16th straight year. We reached constructive settlements in our rate case in New Mexico and in the CPCN proceeding for our Cheyenne Ridge wind farm. This constructive legislation that's being considered in our various states and we are well positioned to deliver on our 2019 ongoing earnings guidance range of $2.55 to $2.65 per share. Our 5% to 7% earnings growth objective and our 5% to 7% dividend growth objective.This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we'll now take questions.(Operator Instructions) We'll take our first question from Jonathan Arnold, Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. -- Yes. Can you hear me? -- Yes. We can now. -- Yes. Thank you. I just wanted to ask about the update you gave on O&M, which obviously, I think, you've been saying you expected to go back to '17 levels, now you're saying just down 2%. But I would still put you at 2.3% roughly in aggregate, so which was the run rate you were talking about last quarter. So just can you clarify, are you talking about more of a structural uplift some of these customer experience investments or ROE really sort of increasing one area and saving elsewhere? -- Well, I mean, I think it's -- first of all, I guess, I would say Jonathan, we are ahead of plan and that's a good thing, despite the additional O&M that Bob described. We continue to take out costs out of our business smartly, but we're reinvesting some of those cost savings into things that I think are really important for our customers. And improving the customer experience is part of that, reducing systematic risk in areas of cyber security, gas safety, proactively implementing best practices for wildfire risks. I think these are things that are important and we're putting a little more money in that than we originally planned. We look ahead to 2019 or rather 2020. I think you can expect us to keep O&M relatively flat with where we end up in 2019. -- And your comments on despite the higher expense you still being in the guidance range, are you -- is embedded within that comment that you're skewing a little lower in the range than you might have otherwise been? Or just am I reading too much into that? -- No. Absolutely, not, Jonathan. We're ahead of our internal plans as of right now. -- Okay, perfect. Thank you.We'll now take our second question from Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please go ahead. -- Thank you. Good morning. -- Good morning, Ali. -- Good morning. First question. There's been some opposition to the Mankato acquisition as you filed for approval for that. Can you just give us an update and your current confidence level of getting that approved? -- Yes. Ali, it's not really unusual in these sorts of situations for the department to have negative comments. Not only with us, but other utilities in the state. But I think what you'll find in the -- if history is any guide, as we give the department more information so they can better model the customer benefits, you start to see the comments be more supportive. We believe that this is of great economic benefit to our customers. I think, it's an important asset for us to own for the long-term and we ultimately think this gets approved. -- And the timing I believe is June or so, is that right? -- Yes. I believe that's right. -- Okay. And then, also, can you remind us currently what's the regulatory lag in the system? And have we reached a point where the rest of it is just structural or is there any further improvement potential. -- Yes. We've achieved the 50 basis points objective, Ali. And there's some opportunity for improvement, but to your comment, you're starting to get to the point where we've got -- most of it is structural lag at this point. -- I see. And then, last question. Apart from calling out O&M being maybe slightly higher for this year than budgeted, are there other movements in your basic assumptions for the year is a positive or negative to be aware off, and just specifically on O&M again, I don't know if I picked it up, but what kind of incremental spending are we thinking about this year versus what you had previously assumed? -- Ali, it's Bob. We've had favorable weather through the first quarter and favorable sales for the first quarter so we think there's some benefit there to offset some of the higher expenses that Ben mentioned. We also have an expectation for slightly lower interest expense through the year than we've given original guidance for. And as you mentioned in the previous question that we are above our internal forecast for the year, so we feel confident in our ability to deliver earnings within our range. -- Okay. And Bob, just to clarify, you're talking about O&M being down 2% versus '18 as your base assumption for the year. What was it before that just to give a sense of how much it's changed? -- Yes, we've been guiding to flat to 2017, and so the guidance -- we're probably 2% above '17 levels or 2% below '18 levels as guidance for '19. -- I got you. Thank you.It appears there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Frenzel, I'd like to turn the conference back to you for any additional comments. -- Well it appears that there might -- looks like there's one more call there.Yes, we do seem to have another question that just joined from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead. -- Julien, we could never not let you get a question in. -- Sorry, this is actually Richie here on Julien. -- We'll see you later, Richie. -- Just had a quick question on the Texas rider legislation. How meaningful is the improvement and regulatory lag there. I thought legislation pass has given the Sagamore plant is coming online in '20? -- Well remember, we already have a settlement deal for our wind assets. But I mean, look, it's helpful. I mean, it's helpful as that system continues to grow with really good sales. I would expect that we're going to need more generation, potentially both fossil and renewables and that's a great thing to have, along with the rider for the investment in the smart meters that we're looking to do. So it's going to help. And again, I think the environment at SPS is getting better. -- Hay Richie , it's Bob. Just to add on to what Ben said, we're expecting to file rate cases in Texas and New Mexico to support the investment. We expect our Hale wind farm to go in service next month -- sorry, early June. And we'll put those into rates almost immediately based on the settlement mechanisms that Ben mentioned. And in addition to the wind, we'll also get the rest of the capital in Texas in service in more real-time and that's all part of the wind settlement agreement. I think, the AMI and the generation potential riders that are working through legislation would further increase as we seek to do AMI and additional generation in the next decade. -- Got it. Thank you that's very helpful that's all I had.It appears there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Frenzel, I'd like to turn the conference back to you for any additional remarks. -- Thanks for participating in our call this morning and please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team with any follow-up questions. -- Thank you.Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

"(RTTNews) - Atlantic Power Corp. (AT, ATP.TO) said Monday that it has agreed to sell its Manchief power plant to Public Service Co. of Colorado or PSCo for $45.2 million, subject to working capital and other customary adjustments. PSCo, a subsidiary of Xcel Energy, Inc. (XEL), is the current customer under the Manchief Power Purchase Agreement or PPA. Atlantic Power expects closing of the sale to occur in May 2022, following the expiration of the PPA.Manchief entered commercial operation in July 2000 and is an approximately 300 megawatt gas-fired peaking facility. Under the terms of the PPA, the plant is dispatchable by the customer. In November 2017, Atlantic Power submitted several proposals in PSCo's 2017 All-Source Solicitation for its longer-term energy supply needs. In June 2018, PSCo notified the company that it had selected the proposal under which it would acquire Manchief from the company at the end of the PPA term.The sale is subject to receipt of regulatory approvals from the Colorado Public Utilities Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which are expected within approximately 11 months of filing. Atlantic Power said it expects to use proceeds of the sale to reduce the remaining principal amount of its senior secured term loan.James Moore, Jr., President and CEO of Atlantic Power said, ""By retaining Manchief for the next three years, we will continue to realize the cash flows for the remaining PPA term. In addition, upon expiration of the PPA in 2022, the sale of the plant will provide us with a cash purchase price that eliminates uncertainty about post-PPA revenue and will support continued debt reduction.""

"nvestors in Xcel Energy Inc (Symbol: XEL) saw new options become available this week, for the May 17th expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the XEL options chain for the new May 17th contracts and identified the following put contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $55.00 strike price has a current bid of 75 cents.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $55.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $54.25 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of XEL, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $55.39/share today.

Because the $55.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 56%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.36% return on the cash commitment, or 11.85% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.

"ou couldn't tell from all the doom-and-gloom headlines about climate change, but the United States might not be too far off its near-term carbon reduction pledge under the Paris Climate Accord signed in 2015. The country agreed to voluntarily cut total carbon emissions at least 26% from 2005 levels by 2025. By the end of last year it had reduced energy-related carbon emissions -- the great majority of total emissions -- 13% from that benchmark.There's  , but there's room for a little eco-pragmatism and optimism, too. The bulk of the reduction to date has come from retiring coal-fired power plants and replacing the generation with natural gas (half the emissions per unit of energy relative to coal) and renewable energy. The decarbonization gains should continue for the foreseeable future thanks to the  that are about to hit the market and a nearly insatiable appetite for renewable energy projects among electric utilities.A handful of encouraging trends are already underway. Here are three for investors to keep an eye on in 2019.Image source: Getty Images.The United States counted over 96,000 megawatts of installed wind power and 64,000 megawatts of solar power at the end of 2018. That generated close to 10% of the country's total electricity production, but the U.S. Energy Information Administration expects the share of modern renewables in the grid to accelerate going forward. Wind and solar could reach 11% of total electric output in 2019 and 13% in 2020. By comparison, coal power is expected to drop to 23% by 2020, down from 39% as recently as 2014.Wind will reach an important milestone in 2019: topping hydroelectric power as the top renewable power source.  (NYSE: NEE) and  (NASDAQ: XEL) have paved the way for that with over 22,000 megawatts combined -- and will continue to add new wind capacity for the foreseeable future.Meanwhile, solar appears poised to grow even more quickly than wind's impressive rise. Solar has accounted for at least 27% of all new capacity from any energy source added to the grid each year since 2013. Once again, NextEra Energy and Xcel Energy will lead the way. The former's main electricity utility in Florida has embarked on its ""30 by 30"" strategy, which will build  . The panels will represent an estimated 10,000 megawatts of capacity, compared to just 2,100 megawatts in the entire state today.Image source: Getty Images.Energy storage is a giant reason for optimism that wind and solar can accelerate their growth in the years ahead. Batteries can be used to help smooth out intermittent production profiles from modern renewables and could soon help tip the economic calculus for new power generation in the favor of wind and solar projects in more geographies. The data show energy storage markets are developing virtually overnight.Greentech Media  that the United States installed a record 311 megawatts of energy storage in 2018, which should double in 2019 and triple in 2020. The surge will be driven by bigger investments from utilities. For instance, Xcel Energy wants to couple 275 megawatts of energy storage with 2,000 megawatts of wind and solar projects in its pipeline. The 1-to-10 rated power capacity seems to be common among the nation's pipeline of proposed battery projects.Meanwhile, the residential energy storage market is beginning to show signs of life. Battery companies such as  and  (NASDAQ: ENPH) are  product offerings to homeowners in 2019. The latter expects to launch its highly anticipated residential battery lineup by the end of this year, which could be de-risked by  .Image source: Getty Images.Most conversations and policies regarding carbon-free power fail to include two next-generation renewable power sources likely to emerge by 2030: offshore wind power and enhanced geothermal systems (EGS).The  owing to its vast coastlines, including on the Great Lakes, and the fact most of its population resides in coastal cities. New technology allows offshore wind turbines to be built far enough into the ocean that they're not visible from the shoreline. And they can be much taller than their onshore peers -- boasting operating efficiencies higher than natural-gas power plants.The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) reports that over 23,000 megawatts of offshore wind projects could be put into production by 2030, enough to generate about 3% to 4% of the country's total electricity. Recent bids for offshore acreage in New Jersey, New York, and Massachusetts earned record bids from  ,  , and  , to name a few companies. It all points to a domestic offshore wind industry being developed virtually overnight, despite a lack of discussion.Image source: Getty Images.Meanwhile, EGS is still in the earliest stages of development, but it has equally impressive potential. The technology involves drilling wells deep underground, circulating a fluid over naturally hot rocks, and using the steam created in a closed-loop system to spin turbines on the surface. Unlike conventional geothermal or hydrothermal resources that are dependent on existing geology in a limited number of states, EGS projects could be economical across a wide range of the country.In fact, the DOE thinks the United States has at least 100,000 megawatts of next-generation geothermal potential -- equivalent to the nation's installed nuclear power fleet (although EGS would produce slightly less electricity than nuclear on a power capacity basis, but more than wind or solar). In 2018, the department doled out a record $16 million in grants to accelerate research, and it thinks commercially viable technology could be ready as soon as 2030.That may sound ambitious, but much of the technology will  (""fracking"") techniques developed to tap into American shale oil and gas resources. If the technology works as envisioned, then EGS could provide at least 15% of the nation's total electricity by midcentury. Yet it never shows up in long-term decarbonization projections to 2050.Image source: Getty Images.The United States generated nearly 10% of its total electricity from wind and solar power in 2018. Add to that 7% from hydropower and 20% from nuclear, and the country generated approximately 37% of its electricity from zero-carbon sources last year -- a remarkable figure. Considering onshore wind and solar are now among the lowest-cost sources of new generation, as well as the approaching advances in electric vehicles, energy storage, offshore wind power, and EGS, it's clear there's reason for plenty of optimism about America's pace of decarbonization. Investors will certainly want exposure to renewables at large.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

There are 9 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Xcel Energy Inc, but the average is just that — a mathematical average.  There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $47.00.  And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $58.00.  The standard deviation is $4.213.


But the whole reason to look at the average XEL price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes.  And so with XEL crossing above that average target price of $55.00/share, investors in XEL have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $55.00 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?  Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Xcel Energy Inc:

"nvestors in Xcel Energy Inc (Symbol: XEL) saw new options become available this week, for the September 20th expiration.  One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 170 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the XEL options chain for the new September 20th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $40.00 strike price has a current bid of 10 cents.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $40.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $39.90 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of XEL, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $55.35/share today.

Because the $40.00 strike represents an approximate 28% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 100%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 0.25% return on the cash commitment, or 0.54% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.


Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Xcel Energy Inc, and highlighting in green where the $40.00 strike is located relative to that history:


   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $60.00 strike price has a current bid of 10 cents.  If an investor was to purchase shares of XEL stock at the current price level of $55.35/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $60.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 8.58% if the stock gets called away at the September 20th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if XEL shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Xcel Energy Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing XEL's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $60.00 strike highlighted in red:



   
Considering the fact that the $60.00 strike represents an approximate 8% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 75%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 0.18% boost of extra return to the investor, or 0.39% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.


The implied volatility in the put contract example is 34%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 17%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $55.35) to be 17%.

"he next decade will be the most important yet for renewable energy technologies. While the bulk of the headline-grabbing discussions today are a little heavy on the fire and brimstone, there's actually a lot of room for optimism if individual investors read the data with a level head. There are also quite a few above-average growth opportunities at hand.For instance, electricity utility  (NASDAQ: XEL) operates four utilities in the coveted American Wind Corridor, which is home to some of the lowest-cost wind resources on the planet. That has helped it to rapidly decarbonize its power generation portfolio in recent years and become the first utility to publicly commit to 100% zero-carbon energy by midcentury. Meanwhile,  (NYSE: ALB) is already the world's largest supplier of lithium metals today, and it's racing to increase output several fold by 2025. That will make it one of the most important companies on the planet for tackling climate change.That's a good start for each business. Here's a closer look at why you can buy and hold each stock for the next decade.Image source: Getty Images.Under the Paris Climate Accord, the United States pledged to voluntarily reduce its total carbon emissions 26% from 2005 levels by 2025. The power sector, which emits most of the country's total atmospheric pollution, achieved a 13% reduction from the benchmark through 2018. That's actually pretty impressive, but it pales in comparison to the decarbonization pace set by Xcel Energy.The utility holding company has already cut carbon emissions 40% since 2005, and estimates it'll deliver an 80% reduction from the benchmark by 2030. It'll then spend the next two decades figuring out how to jettison natural gas from its portfolio and hit zero-carbon operations by midcentury. That's great news for shareholders, because, as it turns out, renewable energy is great for business.Xcel Energy is committing to renewable energy because of the long-term benefits to its bottom line. Wind turbines and solar panels never need to be refueled after installation, and they don't create waste in the course of operations. That's expected to drive a remarkable shift in the financial profile of the business: Fuel expense will fall from 47% of a customer's bill in 2010 to just 25% in 2027. That will keep bills low, and free up generous amounts of capital to reinvest in the business.Image source: Getty Images.Investors can have confidence in this ""Steel for Fuel"" strategy because it's already worked. The share of Xcel Energy's power generation sourced from coal, natural gas, and nuclear (all of which require fuel inputs) has fallen from 91% in 2005 to just 75% today. The company expects that to drop to just 52% by 2027 -- promising to continue a long history of improving financial benefits.Xcel Energy has grown earnings per share at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.1% since 2005. It expects EPS to increase at a 5% to 7% annual clip through at least 2023. That will be catalyzed by over $20 billion in total capital investments to grow its rate base (the value of assets from which rates charged to customers are determined) in that span.The incremental cash flow generated can be used to invest in new growth opportunities, including the recently teased idea of installing electric vehicle charging hardware for customers, or the also-recently teased idea of next-generation nuclear reactors. Xcel Energy also figures to continue growing its dividend, which has boasted a CAGR of 6.3% since 2013 and pays a current yield of 2.9%. Given all the growth potential, its ultra long-term commitment to zero-carbon electricity, and the fact shares trade at a respectable 20 times future earnings, this is a great stock to buy and hold in any portfolio.Image source: Getty Images.In 2015 Albemarle projected that the world would need 400,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) per year by 2025. The latest estimate calls for as much as 1.2 million metric tons of LCE by the same year. The crazy error bar is the result of faster-than-expected adoption of hybrid and electric vehicles and the sooner-than-expected introduction of  .It all points to an incredible growth opportunity for the world's largest lithium supplier. Indeed, Albemarle has embarked on an ambitious expansion effort in an attempt to meet the nearly insatiable appetite of its customers. The company exited 2018 with an annual production capacity of 65,000 metric tons of LCE, but that will swell to 170,000 metric tons of LCE by 2021.And that will only be the beginning. A second wave of expansion in the early 2020s will boost annual production capacity to as much as 350,000 metric tons of LCE by 2025, 30% more than total global production today. Even more impressive, the company will own perhaps as much as 80% of the  for lithium hydroxide, the most sought after lithium material by battery manufacturers.Image source: Getty Images.In addition to significantly increasing its mining output, Albemarle is positioning itself to become a go-to partner for battery manufacturers by  that will be needed for next-generation lithium-ion batteries. The opportunity is sufficiently distant to be difficult to characterize in 2019, but it at least shows management is taking intriguing risks to maintain and diversify its leadership position in the lithium market.Investors don't exactly have to take on much risk to see it through. Shares of Albemarle trade at just 12 times future earnings and a  of 1.03 -- rather impressive for a nearly-$9 billion company. Furthermore, shares boast a dividend yield of 1.7% today, which could swell to impressive levels for investors that hold on for the next decade or more.

" has selected Clearway Energy Group's Rattlesnake Flat Wind Project in Washington to purchase power through a 20-year power purchase agreement.Per the terms, Clearway Energy Group will provide Avista with nearly 50 average megawatts (""MW"") of renewable energy and initiate deliveries from 2020.Avista operates as an electric as well as natural gas utility company. The company serves 388,000 electric customers and 355,000 natural gas customers as of Feb 2019. It introduced the Integrated Resource Plan in 2017, which can be considered as a roadmap for the company to cater to the energy needs of electric as well as natural gas customers in the next 20 years. The plan enables the utility to consider additional resources acquisitions, if such resources have lower long-term cost than electric market alternatives.Along with supporting the Integrated Resource Plan, the new purchase agreement will provide Avista additional renewable energy. This will offset higher priced market purchases and fossil-fuel generation. Since lower usage of fossil-fuel is environmental friendly, renewable generation has been receiving wide acceptance in the past few years.Per a recent release from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (""EIA""), renewable generation provided a new record of 742 million megawatthours (MWh) of electricity in 2018, nearly double from 382 million MWh produced in 2008. Renewables contributed 17.6% of electricity generation in the United States in 2018. Wind generation rose from 55 million MWh in 2008 to 275 million MWh in 2018 and contributed 6.5% to total electricity generation.Rising awareness regarding emission, federal and state policies as well as declining costs are driving renewable technologies in the United States, particularly in wind and solar. Thus, utilities and corporations are increasingly shifting their focus to renewables. Utility companies like WEC Energy Group, Inc.  , NiSource  and Xcel Energy  are focusing on renewable generations or expansions.In addition to the stocks discussed above, wouldn't you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-holds for the year?From more than 4,000 companies covered by the Zacks Rank, these 10 were picked by a process that consistently beats the market.

"nvestors in Xcel Energy Inc (Symbol: XEL) saw new options become available this week, for the April 18th expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the XEL options chain for the new April 18th contracts and identified the following put contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $55.00 strike price has a current bid of 30 cents.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $55.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $54.70 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of XEL, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $55.39/share today.

Because the $55.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 60%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 0.55% return on the cash commitment, or 19.91% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.


Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Xcel Energy Inc, and highlighting in green where the $55.00 strike is located relative to that history:


   The implied volatility in the put contract example above is 19%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $55.39) to be 17%.

hough Wall Street no longer considers renewable energy a hot investment, it remains one of the highest potential markets we have today. The energy business is a multitrillion-dollar business annually and the declining cost of wind, solar, and other renewable energy power sources have made them competitive with oil, natural gas, and coal. As much potential as there is, however, investing in the renewable energy industry isn't easy.We asked three Motley Fool contributors for their favorite renewable energy stock today and  (NASDAQ: XEL) ,  (NASDAQ: SPWR) , and  (NASDAQ: SEDG) were their top picks.Image source: Getty Images. Most utilities are making at least some effort to invest in renewables. None, however, are being as bold as Xcel Energy, which has  to generating all its power from carbon-free sources by 2050. That's a tectonic shift for a company that still relied on coal to produce 37% of its electricity in 2017, making it a name to watch in the renewables space.Xcel Energy, which distributes power to roughly 3.6 million customers in eight states across the central U.S., unveiled its bold vision for the future late last year. The company aims to build on its recent success of boosting its renewable generating capacity from a mere 3% in 2005 up to 23% last year, enabling it to slash its carbon emissions 35% over that time frame. Xcel Energy plans to invest more than $20 billion over the next five years on this initiative, which will help reduce its carbon emissions 60% by 2030. Furthermore, this spending should help grow earnings per share at a 6.5% annual pace through at least 2023, a slight acceleration from the 5.9% compound annual growth rate Xcel has delivered since 2005.That high-powered earnings growth should enable Xcel Energy to keep increasing its dividend at a healthy pace in the coming years. This mix of rising earnings and cash returns, when combined with the focus on renewables, makes Xcel Energy a compelling stock to put on your watchlist. 2018 was an epically bad year for solar companies. The U.S. solar industry was hit with tariffs early in the year, which hurt the world's second-largest market, but incentive reductions in China, the world's largest solar market, cratered the market midyear. In 2019, the industry is expected to grow again, with IHS Markit expecting an 18% increase in installations to 123 gigawatts (GW).SunPower is a company to watch because it makes the world's most efficient solar panels, indicating that there's demand in residential and commercial solar markets. But it also makes a product called P-Series, which takes commodity solar cells and assembles them in a way that produces a slightly more efficient solar panel at a low cost. In short, SunPower is a bellwether for all of the solar industry.Where I think SunPower could differentiate itself this year is in the U.S. The company bought SolarWorld's Oregon manufacturing facility and is now the second-largest U.S. solar manufacturer behind First Solar. It also received an exemption from solar tariffs that  . If SunPower performs well in the first quarter, it could bode well for the company and the entire industry this year. 2018 was a tough year for many solar companies, particularly panel makers that felt the impact of  imported into the U.S. And while it's quite evident that the expectation that those tariffs would lead to a resurgence in domestic solar panel manufacturing  , they've certainly played a big role in helping set up residential and commercial solar for a good 2019 by killing global panel demand last year and  .A good 2019 should also be great for SolarEdge, one of the biggest makers of panel-level electronics and other components that connect solar panels to homes and businesses and to the power grid.But it's not just expected growth in distributed solar installations in 2019 that has SolarEdge worth watching. The company has recently taken several steps to expand its offerings beyond just power inverters. It is also an energy storage system provider and is expanding the line of battery products it offers to take advantage of one of the fastest-growing parts of the residential and commercial solar market.It also recently entered the electric-vehicle component business and plans to expand its capacity to help meet the burgeoning need for EV chargers and other components to support the fast-growing EV market.Right now, investors can buy in on this fast-growing -- and expanding -- company for about 15 times 2018 earnings. That's a cheap price to pay for a high-quality leader in the solar industry that's expanding into related areas where its expertise should pay hu  .Renewable energy stocks aren't for the faint of heart. They have a lot of potential to disrupt a multitrillion-dollar industry, but they face falling costs and unreliable profitability. Though these three companies are better prepared for the future than most, investors should be aware of the risks the industry faces as it upends energy as we know it.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and SunPower wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@3 Top Renewable Energy Stocks to Watch This Month@2019-03-05@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-top-renewable-energy-stocks-watch-month-2019-03-05
"omentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the  , helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at  , a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Xcel Energy currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for XEL that show why this utility shows promise as a solid momentum pick.Looking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.For XEL, shares are up 1.37% over the past week while the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry is flat over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 4.63% compares favorably with the industry's 2.93% performance as well.While any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Over the past quarter, shares of Xcel Energy have risen 8.35%, and are up 28.38% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved 6.11% and 1.87%, respectively.Investors should also pay attention to XEL's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. XEL is currently averaging 3,468,174 shares for the last 20 days.The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with XEL.Over the past two months, 3 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost XEL's consensus estimate, increasing from $2.61 to $2.62 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 2 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.Taking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that XEL is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of B. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Xcel Energy on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

nvestors considering a purchase of Xcel Energy Inc (Symbol: XEL) shares, but cautious about paying the going market price of $53.60/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the September put at the $50 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $1.25. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 2.5% return against the $50 commitment, or a 4.3% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to XEL's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $50 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Xcel Energy Inc sees its shares fall 6.7% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $48.75 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $1.25 from $50), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 4.3% annualized rate of return.Interestingly, that annualized 4.3% figure actually exceeds the 2.8% annualized dividend paid by Xcel Energy Inc by 1.5%, based on the current share price of $53.60. And yet, if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downside because the stock would have to lose 6.65% to reach the $50 strike price.Always important when discussing dividends is the fact that, in general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Xcel Energy Inc, looking at the dividend history chart for XEL below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 2.8% annualized dividend yield.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Xcel Energy Inc, and highlighting in green where the $50 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the September put at the $50 strike for the 4.3% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Xcel Energy Inc (considering the last 250 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $53.60) to be 17%.

"ate last year,  (NASDAQ: XEL) became the first utility to publicly and boldly commit to generating all of its electricity from 100% carbon-free sources by 2050. While individuals and groups who take environmental stewardship seriously cheered the news, individual investors and Wall Street analysts should be cheering, too.Why? Publicly committing to such an ambitious long-term goal provides a good deal of certainty for the road ahead. That will benefit individual investors, especially considering few things are as detrimental to a stock as uncertainty. The advantage of mitigating future policy risks by going all-in on zero-carbon power, coupled with continually improving economics for renewable energy and an increased appetite for states to provide incentives for nuclear power, suggest other utilities will follow Xcel Energy.Image source: Getty Images.Amid the doom and gloom coverage of climate change in the news media, there are plenty of reasons for optimism. While there's room for smart policy changes to expedite the transition away from coal-fired power plants and toward cleaner energy sources, innovation and market forces actually have the power sector in the United States on pace to meet its climate pledges. In fact, half of electric utilities are  . Xcel Energy has been a shining example.In 2005, the utility, which serves three states in the Southwest as well as five upper Midwestern states, relied on coal power for 56% of its electricity generation. Wind and solar, categorized as ""modern renewables,"" made up just 3% of its generation mix that year. By 2017, the utility cut the share of coal in its portfolio to 37% and increased modern renewables to 23%. The 35% drop in carbon emissions from the 2005 baseline in that span exceeds the Paris Accord commitment of reducing carbon emissions 27% by 2025, and it exceeds the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Clean Power Plan goal of a 32% decline by 2030.Xcel Energy has no intention of easing up on its assault on more expensive and dirtier coal-fired power. The utility expects carbon emissions -- compared with 2005 -- to fall 45% by 2021, 80% by 2030, and 100% by 2050. The near-term targets aren't too surprising considering that the recently approved  will shift the company's generation mix to just 19% coal and 46% modern renewables by 2027.The longer-term targets are perhaps a little more surprising, as they suggest the utility will need to jettison natural-gas-fired power plants -- which will provide 21% of its electricity in 2027 -- from its portfolio. Current economics don't provide any easy ways to stop using the cleaner-burning fuel (natural gas emits half the carbon emissions as coal to generate an equal amount of electricity), although that could change in the coming decades if wind, solar, and energy storage continue to walk down the cost curve. And if Xcel Energy sees a path to zero natural gas, then so could some of its well-positioned peers.Image source: Getty Images.Xcel Energy's ambitious power plan is part of its ""Steel for Fuel"" strategy. That is, modern renewables can be more economical to operate than coal-fired and natural-gas-fired power plants, since wind and solar farms don't require fuel purchases to operate.  (NYSE: NEE) has a similar strategy for its lone electric utility franchise, Florida Power & Light.The utility is powering ahead with its ""30 by 30"" strategy -- a pledge to install 30 million solar panels in Florida by 2030. NextEra Energy says that would result in 10,000 megawatts of solar power capacity, up from the entire state's 2,159 megawatts in operation today. Investors who can remember back to 2017 will notice how quickly the plans have changed.Way back then, Florida Power & Light had only committed to installing 10 million solar panels by 2023 and 2,100 megawatts of solar capacity by 2025.  have changed that overnight. NextEra recently said the four solar facilities coming online in Florida in 2019 cost one-third the price of facilities brought online just a few years ago. It has already sited an additional 100 facilities (yes, 100) for future expansion.While the current 30-by-30 strategy is encouraging, Florida faces challenges on the path to 100% carbon-free electricity. The American Southeast has virtually no wind potential, which explains why Florida has no wind turbines operating today (it may be able to generate 15% of its electric needs from  , though). And although it's called the Sunshine State, Florida has salty and humid air that corrodes solar panels and saps efficiency. The challenges are why Florida Power & Light leans on natural gas and nuclear power for 73% and 25%, respectively, of its electricity generation. Solar power is currently just 2% of the utility's portfolio, no better than the national average.That said, three decades will pass between now and 2050, so forecasting market conditions, technology improvements, and societal changes is impossible. But NextEra Energy's increasingly ambitious plans for solar power in Florida are encouraging -- and might even hint at a way to ditch natural gas by midcentury.Image source: Getty Images.Xcel Energy made a bold public commitment to 100% carbon-free electricity by 2050. It was already well on its way, thanks in large part to geography: The company's four electric utilities operate in regions with some of the best wind and solar opportunities on the planet. While that gives it an edge over most peers, the improving economics of wind and solar suggest other electric utilities might not be too far behind in their pledges.NextEra Energy is an obvious bet for the next company to announce a zero-carbon electricity pledge, even if its Florida-based utility faces unique challenges. That would provide certainty for investors on the long-term trajectory of the business and help the $85 billion company make good on plans to grow earnings and its dividend at a healthy rate for years to come.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

 subsidiary, NIPSCO, announced the addition of three new wind projects in Indiana. Through the Your Energy, Your Future initiative, the company aims to achieve coal-free operations by 2028.Through successful bids, under the company's 2018 Integrated Resource Plan process, three renewable energy developers - Apex Clean Energy, EDP Renewables North America LLC and NextEra Energy Resources, LLC - were selected to generate nearly 800 megawatts (MW) of wind energy. The wind capacity is expected to initiate operations by late 2020. NextEra Energy Resources is a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Inc.  .NiSource is working to lower emission levels while producing electricity. The company will do the same by retiring old coal plants and replacing the coal fired units by renewable sources.

Also, the retirement of two units of R.M. Schahfer Generating Station (Units 17 and 18) is scheduled at the end of 2023.In the past few years, the U.S. renewable energy industry has witnessed significant growth. Awareness toward lower pollution level boosted the usage of renewable energy sources. Wind energy is one of the fastest growing forms of power generation in the United States.Per a recent release from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), U.S. total utility-scale electricity generation from wind power plants to rise to 12.1% in 2019 and 28% in 2020 from 2018 level.

"n recent trading, shares of Xcel Energy Inc (Symbol: XEL) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $51.89, changing hands for $52.36/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 9 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Xcel Energy Inc, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $47.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $57.00. The standard deviation is $3.1.But the whole reason to look at the  XEL price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with XEL crossing above that average target price of $51.89/share, investors in XEL have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $51.89 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Xcel Energy Inc:

 posted first-quarter fiscal 2019 earnings of $1.38 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.33 by 3.8%. However, the reported earnings declined 1.4% from the prior-year figure.Total revenues of $877.8 million lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $978 million by 10.2%. The figure was also lower than the year-ago total revenues of $889.2 million by 1.3%. The year-over-year decline in revenues was due to lower contribution from its distribution segment. : Revenues from the segment decreased 2.5% from $860.8 million in the prior-year quarter to $838.9 million. Distribution contribution margin increased to $401.1 million from $397 million in the year-ago quarter, driven by increase in consumption in its Mid-Tex, Mississippi and Colorado-Kansas Divisions. : Revenues from the segment increased 6.3% from $126.5 million in the year-ago quarter to $134.5 million. Contribution margin rose 7.3% year over year to $134.8 million. The upside was on account of increase in rates due to the Gas Reliability Infrastructure Program (GRIP) filings approved in fiscal 2018, along with positive demand and supply dynamics in the Permian Basin. | Operation and Maintenance expenses in the reported quarter increased 7.4% from the year-ago quarter to $138.6 million due to higher employee costs and timing of pipeline maintenance activities.Operating income in the reported quarter was down 2.3% year over year to $236.5 million. The decrease primarily reflects higher operating expenses and increased depreciation costs. Positive contribution margins, driven by weather, consumption, higher customer counts in the distribution segment, and volumes in its pipeline and storage segment, marginally offset the decline.The company incurred interest expenses of $27.9 million, down 11.4% from the year-ago period.It invested $416.4 million in the reported quarter, with 82% of the investment directed toward strengthening the existing systems and increasing the reliability of its operations.As of Dec 31, 2018, Atmos Energy had cash and cash equivalents of $218.2 million compared with $13.8 million on Sep 30, 2018.Long-term debt was $3.08 billion as of Dec 31, 2018, up from $2.49 billion on Sep 30, 2018.The company's cash flow from operating activities over the three months ended Dec 31, 2018 was $164.7 million, down from $173.2 million recorded in the prior-year comparable period.Atmos Energy has re-affirmed its fiscal 2019 guidance.

Image source: The Motley Fool. (NASDAQ: XEL)Q4 2018 Jan. 31, 2019 , Good day and welcome to the Xcel Energy 2018 Year End . Today's conference is being recorded.At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Paul Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. -- Good morning and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2018 year-end  . Joining me today are Ben Fowke Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Frenzel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.In addition, we have other members of the management team available to answer your questions. This morning we will review our 2018 results and update you on recent business and regulatory developments. Slides that accompany today's call are available on the website.On today's call we will discuss certain ongoing earnings metrics that are non-GAAP measures. Comparable GAAP measures and reconciliation are included in our earnings release. As a reminder some of the comments used during today's conference call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC.I'll now turn the call over to Ben. -- Well thank you Paul and good morning. And I say good morning, but as you all probably know it is brutally cold here in Minnesota and I'd like to thank the men and women of Xcel who worked so hard to keep the gas flowing and the electricity on over these last few days. I'd say with just a few exceptions our system has held up remarkably well and it's due to the dedication and commitment so thank you. For 2018 was an excellent year with a long and impressive list of accomplishments. Let me share a few of them with you.We reported ongoing EPS of $2.47 in 2018 and this was our 14th consecutive year of meeting or exceeding our earnings guidance. We increased our long-term EPS growth target rate to 5% to 7%. We raised our dividend by $0.08 which represents the 15th straight year we've increased our dividend. We completed our equity issuances for the five year forecast period and don't plan any additional equity beyond our dividend reinvestment and benefit programs.Our stocks hit an all-time high closing price of $53.68 in December. We secured approval for over 1,000 megawatts of new wind in Texas and New Mexico, our Colorado Energy Plan and 300 megawatts of wind in South Dakota. We completed construction of 600 megawatt Rush Creek wind farm on time and under budget. We reached agreements to purchase the 760 megawatt Mankato natural gas combined cycle plant for $650 million and to acquire 70 megawatts of repowered wind farms for a $135 million. We expect both acquisitions that we approve later this year. Our nuclear plants combined to achieve our capacity factor of almost 96% while reducing O&M cost by almost 3%.We followed an electric vehicle pilot program in Minnesota. We resolved tax reform proceeding in most jurisdictions with the final resolution in North Dakota expected later this year. I'm also very proud that our actions have been noticed by others, resulting in numerous awards, including being recognized by Fortune magazine as one of the world's most admired companies for the fifth consecutive year. Being honored by the Military Times as Best for Vets Employer for the fifth consecutive year and being named utility of the year by Utility Dive. So 2018 was a great year, but we're now focused on 2019 and beyond.Leading the Clean Energy Transition continues to be a strategic priority for us as we carry out Xcel Energy's vision to be our customers' preferred and trusted energy provider, also helping us to achieve two other strategic priorities. Keeping our customer bills low and enhancing the customer experience. We're a national leader in wind energy through our steel-for-fuel strategy which adds renewables while at the same time lowering bills.As a result we've made outstanding progress achieving a 39% reduction in carbon emissions from 2005 levels. Well we want to do even more which is why we set a vision to reduce carbon emissions by 80% by 2030. Longer-term we expect to deliver our customers a 100% of carbon-free energy by 2050. These are the most ambitious carbon goals within the electric power industry. And I'm confident with supported public policy we can achieve the 80% interim goal while keeping our bills affordable and our product reliable.Technologies come a long way in the last 10 years and it gives me confidence that our 100% carbon-free goals can be met as well. We look forward to working with our regulators, legislators and stakeholders to implement our plans across the jurisdictions we serve. Also very focused on our customers, earlier this month we entered into agreements to provide electric service to a proposed new Google data center located on property adjacent to our Sherco plant in Minnesota.As you may remember back in 2015 we announced our intention to close two of the Sherco coal units. This particular location for the new data center will create jobs bring investment to the state and benefit all of our customers. And consistent with our goal to lead the clean energy transition we are planning to serve the data center's energy needs with 100% renewable energy. And I believe our environmental leadership will lead to more economic development opportunities overtime. We also recently filed to expand our pilot Renewable Connect program in Minnesota. Renewable Connect allows customers to choose how much of their energy comes from renewable sources. Been extremely popular and has commission approval in Minnesota, Colorado and Wisconsin. This is yet another way for us to add renewable energy and meet the needs of our customers. And importantly Renewable Connect is not negatively impact the bills of nonparticipants.We anticipate the future expansion at Google and in Renewable Connect program will create potential renewable ownership opportunities for Xcel.So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob who will provide more detail on our financial results and outlook and a regulatory update. Bob? -- Thanks Ben, and good morning everyone. My comments today will focus on full year 2018 results. For details of our fourth quarter results please see our earnings release. As Ben discussed we realized another strong year of our operational and financial performance. We recorded 2018 ongoing earnings of $2.47 per share compared with $2.30 per share in 2017, representing the top end of our original guidance range of $2.37 to $2.47 per share.Weather was certainly a positive factor contributing $0.07 per share compared to normal in our annual results. We also incurred additional O&M expense which offset the weather benefit. Looking at the income statement the most significant drivers for the year include higher electric and natural gas margins which increased earnings by $0.44 per share largely due to favorable weather and strong electric and natural gas sales as well as rate increases in riders recover our capital investments.And higher AFUDC equity which increased earnings by $0.07 per share reflecting growth in capital investments. Partially offsetting these positive drivers were higher O&M expenses which decreased earnings by $0.10 per share increased G&A expense as a result of our capital investment program which reduced earnings by $0.10 per share and higher interest expenses, property taxes and other items combined to reduce earnings per share by $0.14.Turning to sales, our weather adjusted electric sales increased 1.3% in 2018 reflecting strong economies in the states we serve and favorable sale to commercial and industrial customers as well as solid residential sales growth. Our electric sales growth was strongest at our SPS business with 4.1% growth driven by the oil and natural gas sector in the Permian Basin. Weather adjusted natural gas sales increased 2.4% in 2018 as a result of continued customer growth and increasing customer use largely in the commercial and industrial customer segment.For 2019 we're anticipating relatively flat electric sales which reflects some specific declines in large customer usage more modest oil and natural gas driven growth and expectations of the lower use per customer in the residential sector. For natural gas we expect slightly positive sales in 2019 reflecting continued growth in C&I and residential loads.Turning to expenses, O&M increased by $82 million or 3.6% reflecting additional spend for vegetation management and system maintenance due to the hot summer. Business system costs investments to improve and enhance business processes and customer service as well as damage prevention and remediation costs. We remain committed to our long-term objective of improving operating efficiencies in taking costs out of the business for the benefit of our customers.But we continue to face rising costs in certain strategic areas including the impacts of adding incremental renewable generation, improving cyber-security and enhancing the customer experience. We are focused on delivering 2019 O&M expenses at levels that in aggregate are consistent with 2017.Next, let me provide a quick regulatory update. We had a very busy and productive year in which we filed a result of multiple rate cases in addition to tax reform proceedings in all of our states. In 2019 we're planning to file a Colorado Electric Case in the spring. Rate cases in Texas and New Mexico in the summer and a Minnesota rate case in November and a Minnesota resource plan in the summer. We anticipate that new rates from these cases will go into effect in 2020. With that, I'll wrap-up.In summary 2018 was another great year for Xcel Energy. We delivered ongoing earnings within or above our guidance range for the 14th consecutive year. We increased our dividend for the 15th straight year. We completed our equity issuance for the five year time period. We continue to execute on our steel-for-fuel strategy receiving regulatory approvals for new wind in Texas and New Mexico and South Dakota as well as the Colorado Energy Plan. We entered into agreement to acquire the 760 megawatt Mankato natural gas plant plant and buyout 70 megawatts of wind PPAs in Minnesota. We are well positioned to deliver on our 2019 ongoing earnings guidance range of $2.55 to $2.65 per share. Our 5% to 7% earnings growth objective and our 5% to 7% dividend growth objective.This concludes our prepared remarks. And operator, we'll now take some questions.(Operator Instructions) We'll take our first question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America. Please go ahead. -- Hi, good morning. Can you hear me? -- Yes, you're a little faint, but good morning, Julien. -- Excellent, well, I appreciate it. Good morning. Congratulation again on the results. -- Thank you. -- Maybe just to touch base a little bit, I know there's a litany of difference regulatory, more importantly legislative angles for this year. Can you touch base a little bit on them by specifically Texas, Colorado and the status in Minnesota, I know something just came up there as well to go through across the three? -- Well, it's a whole bunch of them, not a lot of things -- there is a -- it's a pretty busy legislative agenda. So why don't I touch on a few that we're looking at, and if I miss one, please ask a follow-up question Julien. Starting in Texas of course, we're interested in the AMI legislation. That would basically allow non-ERCOT companies to get the same regulatory treatment that Arcot companies received concurrent recovery that's particularly important.It's important to note there that in our CapEx, in the CapEx -- in the forecast period we anticipated about $80 million spend of AMI. So wouldn't increase the capital too much there Julien, but the recovery would be great. And we're optimistic about that. Over New Mexico of course we're following the RPS standard to see where that goes and watching the securitization bill as well. Moving up to Colorado, there is a number of different things proposed in Colorado.The Securitization bill is one that we're following. Our thoughts there is -- it could be another tool in the toolbox if you will. That said some of the things that we've already accomplished leading the Clean Energy Transition while keeping those flat, taking care of our communities, something I'm particularly proud of, taking care of our employees, I think we've shown we can do it and achieve pretty remarkable results. That was always in the details, but if the securitization bills, it could become a valuable voluntary tool that'll be great. Minnesota there's just a number of things going around. Some of it addresses the Community Solar Gardens. Most of those are -- most of the legislation I would say in Minnesota is in earlier stages. So if there is something specific that you're interested in Minnesota just a follow-up. Did I catch everything you're interested in? Or did I miss anything Julien? -- No. I think you did. I mean, I'm more curious as you think about some of these playing out, are there any specific capital items that -- coming out of these that you'd be focused on the Colorado or otherwise? But I know that there is a lot that's why I wanted to get the priorities from you if you will? -- No. If any of those bills will drive much incremental capital I mean, I'm there is the EV storage bill that could be helpful to us and would allow us to do more with basically seating what I think it's going to be a very interesting development in the future and that's the electrification of transport so that could drive some CapEx. But a little early to put anything hard dollars on the table, Julien. -- Great. And just a quick clarification, if I can. On the capital investment forecast that EEI, you provided an incremental case of $1 billion of additional capital, obviously you're changing around slides every update. Is there anything to read into that? -- Well I mean, I think we shifted some things from '19 to '20, but we overall and we put the, the Mankato and the wind farm into our base forecast now. But the overall spend is still roughly the same I believe in that time frame. So in those outer years we are still looking to have -- achieve that incremental case which would grow rate base by 7%. And I think we can get there in a number of different ways. Of course we continue to look for opportunities to buy out PPAs and other opportunistic things. So that and the fact that if you look at history Julien the out years tend to be more capital intensive as the out years become forward years. -- Excellent. Thanks for clarifying. All the best. -- Thank you.We'll now take our next question from Ali Agha of SunTrust. Please go ahead. -- Good morning, Ali. -- Thank you. Good morning. First question, I wanted to just clarify Ben I think you mentioned you're expecting both the Mankato and the 70 megawatt buyout approval to happen, did you say by the third quarter? I just wanted to clarify when you're expecting that? -- Yeah, well I think that's the good timeline to think about end of the second quarter or early third quarter. -- Okay. And with the $20.1 billion five year CapEx, that does equate to 6.5% rate base CAGR as you had previously shown us? Is that correct? -- Correct. -- Okay. And to -- if I think about the long-term earnings goal aspiration of 5% to 7%. To hit the high end of that 7% does that assume that you would get that incremental billion dollars so that rate base could also be growing at 7%? Or do you think the high end growth rate can be achieved U.S. based on the CapEx as you laid out today? -- No. I mean, I think the incremental CapEx would certainly be helpful, but there is other levers as well, improvement in regulatory outcomes specifically higher ROEs that would also be very helpful sales. We've got -- we had a good year in '18. We expected to be a little bit flatter in '19 and beyond, but if we got some pick up there that would be helpful. And of course we continue to look for a cost efficiencies in the business. So there is multiple levers of the incremental CapEx just being one. -- But and -- I guess, looked another way, Ben, I mean, assuming you do get that incremental CapEx. Should we -- we should not expect the 5% to 7% growth rate of change as a result of that, that would just make it easier to perhaps hit the higher end. Is that the way to think about it? -- I mean we -- as you know we always -- we always take a look at that. But I mean I think what you just said is a good assumption. -- Okay. And my last question. Can you just I guess give a little more detail? As you mentioned, your electric load growth weather-normalized was north of 1% this -- in 2018 which you're assuming flat growth in '19? Can you just elaborate a little bit more on why you're expecting that to slowdown in '19 versus '18? -- Ali we had good solid growth in 2018, lot of it was driven by large C&I demand in some oil and gas growth in our SPS business. We think that year-over-year we have a couple of discrete instances where we know we have lower demand from some of those C&I customers and we don't expect as aggressive growth in the oil and gas industry as we saw in '18. Obviously if we had upside as Ben mentioned to the sales growth in some of our expectations if we exceeded the flat forecast it would obviously be upside for 2019 earnings. -- I see. And lastly the DRIP program does that support of about $75 million sort of annual run rate for equity issuances is that good for modeling purposes? -- Yeah, that's a 75% to 85% is a good number. -- Got you. Thank you. -- Thanks, Ali.Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Christopher Turnure of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. -- Good morning. -- Good morning, guys. I wanted to follow-up on one of the earlier questions on the incremental capital plan. You mentioned PPA buyouts are one thing that you're looking at there. What's the next milestone that we might see in that process? And is there anything else that you're looking at there where we could see some some kind of information near term? -- Well, I think, I think we've talked about the universe of opportunities and it's going to be, obviously, case by case. Our Corporate Development team's hard at work looking for those opportunities and making sure that the there's a good deal for the buyer and seller and just as importantly our customers. So there aren't really any time frames on that, but we are optimistic that there will be transactions to talk about in the future. -- Okay. And then, on the PSCo CapEx shift to 2019 from 2020, what was behind that? And then when we think about modeling for 2020 and feeding in the 500 megawatts of wind from the Colorado Energy Plan, how should we model that CapEx and rate base, and potentially earnings growth within the 2019 year? -- Yeah, Chris its Bob. On the shift when we filed our CPCN for the Colorado Energy Plan and the wind farm there, we had originally contemplated that being a build-own-transfer where the developer would construct it and transfer it to us at COD. Through the process of the fourth quarter and negotiations with the developer, we opted to step-in, buy the land and development rights and build the project ourselves. So the shift in capital is just a pull forward from that wind from. So you see a incremental capital in 2019 in Colorado and then probably slightly less capital in '20 for the same wind farm. -- Got you. So I admit that between the two years really no total change, just a pull forward of the CapEx and potentially earnings power as well? -- That's right. We do have CapEx pull forward AFUDC pull forward and slight interest expense pull forward, but in total in aggregate across the two years the same amount. -- Okay. Got you. And then, I guess, just kind of summarize that and the impact on 2019 that looks like a positive since you introduced guidance at third quarter earnings, you also have the Mankato project, you had wind repowering elsewhere, flat load growth assumption for the year and maybe a little bit of weather benefit at least to kickoff year in the first 30 days or so. Is that kind of the correct way to think about the puts and takes around guidance since you originally put out there? -- Yes. You certainly talked about some of the upside levers actually across the entirety of the system for the month. We'll see how it comes and the upper Midwest is certainly very cold, but the rest of our jurisdiction and relatively benign in January. So...It's going to be a 40 degrees here on Sunday, so. And that's above, not below -- But yes, I think you had some of the positive sensitivities for the year. -- Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.We'll now take our next question from Travis Miller of Morningstar. -- Hi, Travis. -- Good morning. Thank you. I just have bit of a higher-level strategy question. But I was wondering if you could give your take on the idea of the SPP transmission area of westward expansion, your thoughts there. -- I'm not quite sure what your question is? I'm -- David, do you have? No? -- Just -- the Mountain West Transmission Group, just discussions ... -- Are you talking, you're talking more about Colorado now aren't you? -- Yes, it'd be Colorado, and I believe, Texas -- part of your Western Texas would be involved. -- So you probably know, Travis, that we looked at joining Mountain West. And at the end of the day the cost benefit analysis that really didn't pencil out for the benefit of our customers the way we were hoping it would. Doesn't mean we're not open to looking at those things in the future, but the math didn't work for us at least in this round. -- Okay. Would renewables be involved in that? Is that a big part of that? -- Well, it's certainly something we're looking at. One of the -- I'm sorry Travis. You go ahead. I cut you off. -- No. Just -- you heard that correctly. The renewables for SPP in general. Is that part of the idea there? -- The advantage of joining Mountain West would be potentially a larger footprint, which is good for renewable integration, certainly seeing the benefits of that with MISO in other regions. But again their costs and other trade-offs and when we -- when we added up the pros and the cons we thought it was not enough of a benefit for our customers to move forward with it. Again these things need to be periodically revisited and that's what we'll do. -- Okay. Great. And then there's another high-level question. When you think about Minnesota and the programs you have there, you talked about the Renewable Connect and the EV pilot, obviously, the renewables on the system. What's your view in terms of how that state looks in your system and say three to five years as you get through the later part of your capital spending and even operating spending potentially? -- The -- it's absolutely amazing how quickly renewables -- I think, it's by 2022 if not '21. Renewables will be the biggest source of energy across all of our eight states and that includes the upper Midwest in Minnesota. And I believe around the mid-20s we cross the line of renewables will be 50% of our energy mix. So it's absolutely phenomenal. And Travis as I mentioned in my prepared remarks this is also affordable it's creating a brand for the state which I think is helping to attract economic development. We're really excited about Google. I don't think that'll be in the last data center that we -- we're able to obtain. And I do think what we're doing with Leading the Clean Energy Transition can become our strategic asset for the state and our other states as well. -- Okay. Great. I appreciate. -- Thank you, Travis.We'll now take our next question from Greg Gordon of Evercore. Please go ahead. -- Greg. -- Hi, guys, actually, you guys answered all my questions from prior analysts. So, I'll give you the time back. Thank you. -- Thank you. -- Thanks, Greg.We'll now take our next question from Angie Storozynski of Macquarie. Please go ahead. -- Thank you. So I have a really big picture question. So I'm looking at the slide from your EEI deck with the PPA roll off. And I heard you mentioned the potential early buyout of some of the PPAs and now given what we are witnessing in California now with this whole discussion about how expensive the renewable power PPAs have inflated customer bills. I'm just wondering if you can give us a sense, for instance, if there is any kind of rule of thumb, what kind of CapEx opportunity do you see as these PPAs roll off. And just -- just before I let you answer it, I'm just wondering if, is it the same type of rule of thumb that we have for O&M savings that some of the utilities mentioned that for instance $1 of O&M allows to spend anywhere between $6 and $7 of CapEx. Is the same rule of thumb applicable to those expiring PPAs? Thanks. -- Well, I mean, the CapEx rule of thumb, it would hold true to that if you're buying out a PPA and putting in rate base, that's a good rule of thumb. We've got a large universe of power purchase agreements. There is a slide that you're probably looking at from the EEI deck I don't have it in front of me now. But we anticipate about 4000 megawatts of those PPAs with half of it in renewables and wind, I believe and the other half in fossil fuels might be something that we could look at.Now whether or not we can pull the transaction again you got -- it has to work for us it has to work for the seller and it has to work for our customers. And we've had some success with that and we anticipate future success. But either way Angie that when these PPAs roll off most of them are at higher dollars than what the market prices would be now. And so that at the very least is going to help us with our very important objective of keeping those low and create headroom for investment at that leverage point that you're talking about.So it's really kind of a version of steel-for-fuel if you will. So we don't have quite the same high-priced type PPAs that I think PGE might have. But the reality is energy prices have fallen over the last 10 years. So, as things we did 10 years ago roll off, it's going to create opportunities either for buying or at the very least keeping bills low for customers, all of which is good. -- Okay. But I'm just going back to that slide, and again, I know you're not seeing it right now. I'm looking at it. So is it as simple as I'm just basically looking at the expiration of those PPAs and I see that you guys are showing us rough pricing of those PPAs. And so basically in the absence of that expense I multiplying that benefit by say six times and seven times and that's the incremental CapEx I can spend? -- Bob, I don't think we'll quite will look at it that way. -- When we think about the impact on customer bills and the headroom of that higher-priced PPAs rolling off create, it factors into how we think about our capital investment program. As Ben says we could invest in grid-like infrastructure to a significant degree and we talk about what replacement costs in the same deck we talk a little bit about what replacement cost for the grid would look like.We're throttled by that usually at the pace of what we think that our customers would or should afford as we increase the capital plan. So fuel and purchase power reductions enable the company to invest in capital to the benefit of our customers while keeping bills low. So I don't know if we're using a specific multiplier there, Angie, but your thesis is correct. -- Angie, I think the way you have to -- I think and may we could take some of those offline. But I think the way you have to look at it, is if it has a positive NPV for the customer we would and we can negotiate the transaction with that in mind then it's then the opportunity is to put that CapEx and you can probably do the math on 2,000 megs of wind and 2,000 megs of fossil where that would roughly be then you'd be putting that in rate base and you get the earnings power of it. That's the universe I think it's how we would look at it. -- Okay. I understand. Just one follow-up. So can you give us a sense of you running into any issues with finding good sites for future wind farms and if you're close to reaching a point where solar is becoming cost-competitive or attractive versus incremental wind? -- Yes, I mean, we've -- there are sites out there and we -- I think pretty good success in finding sites and I think the results speak for themselves there. And those sites will continue to be available. As far as solar becoming more competitive you're absolutely right. And I think the -- my thought Angie is solar is going to continue to see significant cost reductions more than offsetting, in my opinion, the fall off of the ITC. And I think that marries up really nicely with the actual coal plant retirements that we're looking at because as you know solar has far higher planning capacity than wind does. Wind is more like fuel, solar is kind of a mixture of the two. So I think the stars are aligning very well for us in that regard. -- Great. Thank you. -- Thank you, Angie.We'll now take our next question from Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. -- Hi, John. -- Good morning, guys. -- Good morning. -- Hello? -- Can you hear us? -- I can hear you. Could you hear me? -- Yeah, we can hear you. Loud and clear. -- Hello, can you hear me now? -- We can hear you. -- Okay. All right. I was -- we got kicked off the call for a little bit and then came back. So, I'm going to apologize to you, if you already answered this one. -- Must been bad behavior, Jonathan -- It's -- something was sensed. So O&M you're targeting flat to 2017 levels which means getting sort of backed down to just under $2.3 billion as I -- as I read the phase of the numbers. So and you've been saying for a while that you want to be flat through 2022 that kind of two-three level. So are you -- is the kind of reduction in '19 just kind of getting back down to plan having being a little over in '18? Or are you -- is it a precursor to may be starting to push for something that's a bit better than flat? Just curious if you can maybe speak to '18 number and then that guidance? -- Jonathan one of the things to think about is we are adding a significant amount of new wind on to our system in advance of retiring any legacy generation. And that new wind causes O&M upward pressures. So, I would say that the balance of the base business as we continue to bend the cost curve on the base business while we observe the increasing O&M from the wind. So as we absorb lots of new generation we've had some cost pressures in O&M. I think generally keeping it flat is us spending the cost curve except for the new wind adds. -- So is the forecast still like the $2.3 billion number throughout through the program? Or is that changed a little bit? -- Yeah, I think that's a good -- still a good assumption. That's still our good guidance. -- Okay. Great. That was it. Thank you.We'll now take our next question from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead. -- Good morning. -- Paul, how are you? -- Good morning. So just one sort of quick question here. The -- can you talk a little bit on the use of securitization has being one of the tools in the toolbox you guys are indicating. What do mean by that in terms of just how we should think about if the legislation over the past, what might happen with that or how do you guys might use that? -- Well in Colorado and in securitization in general, one there is two things it has to has. It has to be written in a way that technically you can actually do the bond programs off of it. And then, two, one of the things we've been looking at is things like utility ownership of the generation that's been securitized. If those things come together and remember in Colorado at least it's a voluntary tool than it might be something we look at. But I think the important thing as I mentioned Paul earlier is that we've achieved the goals and securitization through our own efforts.And that includes community and employee taking care of both the communities and the employees and keeping our bills flat and that's what we've achieved. So we don't need securitization to keep doing that, but it -- if it's something that makes it even more tangible then we're all for it. -- Okay. I guess, I'm still wondering in the case of New Mexico, I can see what people are sort of thinking about. I'm just sort of, like, is there any particular project or issue that securitization would address that I'm just missing? I apologize for just being dense on this. -- No, no, no. Again that's why I think it's just that tool in the toolbox. I mean, it's down the road it might be something we would want to look at, but there isn't anything we are specifically thinking about today. -- Okay. Great. That's it from me. Keep warm. -- Thanks. Thank you.Thank you. It appears there are no further questions at this time. So, Mr. Frenzel I'd like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks. -- Well as always thank you all for participating in our  this morning. Please contact our Investor Relations team with any follow-up questions. -- Thank you.This concludes today's call. Thank you all for your participation.

The state of Michigan witnessed one of the wettest winters this fourth quarter, which subsequently will result in lower household expenditure on heating. This, in turn, may go on to adversely impact the company's revenues in the upcoming fourth-quarter results. In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth- quarter revenues is pegged at $1,535 million, reflecting year-over-year fall of 13.7%.Such low revenue expectations are likely to hamper the company's bottom-line results as well. Meanwhile, absence of tax benefits, courtesy of the latest U.S. Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, lowered CMS Energy's earnings in the third quarter of 2017. To this end, we may expect the upcoming results to reflect lower tax benefits. Considering these factors, the consensus mark for the company's fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at 41 cents per share, representing a year over year decline of 19.6%.Here are a few other players from the  that have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Ameren Corp.  has an Earnings ESP of +4.62% and a Zacks Rank #1.

tilities are often singled out by environmentalists for not doing enough to respond to climate change, but the perception that the industry is only reluctantly fulfilling its responsibility to society isn't quite accurate. An  and power generators in the United States -- comprising half of the nation's installed power capacity -- shows that the power sector is on pace to blow away even the most ambitious decarbonization projections.In fact, even without market intervention, it might be possible to retire most of the country's coal-fired power plants by 2040. Considering coal power is responsible for roughly 30% of America's electricity generation and 69% of power sector carbon emissions today, that'd be a huge step to reaching the nation's climate change goals.The bad news is that may not be quick enough to limit the most damaging effects of climate change. The good news is that it's entirely possible for the United States to send most of its coal-fired power plants to an even earlier retirement, perhaps as soon as 2030. There's just one major hang up: a quirky financial accounting mechanism called accelerated depreciation. It rarely comes up in conversations about climate change, but it actually represents one of the biggest obstacles and opportunities to rapidly decarbonize the economy. For better and for worse, investors in electric utility stocks will need to become familiar with the term.Image source: Getty Images.Depreciation is a part of basic accounting. You can check out  , but the gist of it is that the value of an asset deteriorates over time because of use or age, and companies get to deduct the future expense of replacing it through depreciation.Utilities do the same thing for multi-million-dollar power plants, depreciating the assets over a period of decades. If a coal-fired power plant built in 1990 was expected to have a useful life of 50 years, then the owner won't account for the full depreciation expense until 2040. If the owner of the power plant wants to retire the facility 20 years early, in 2020, then it has to account for two decades' worth of depreciation expense in a much shorter time frame. That's accelerated depreciation.Image source: Getty Images.When a utility wants to make changes to its power generation portfolio, it must submit a proposed power plan to its regional regulator. The regulator weighs various factors when assessing a plan, such as how it will affect grid resiliency based on projected energy consumption growth and, most importantly, how it will change rates for customers. And that's become a sticking point lately.Let's say a utility wants to retire a coal-fired power plant 10 years early and shows it can completely replace the lost electricity with wind, solar, and energy storage. The cost to generate electricity will be the same or even lower for ratepayers. But since utilities are tightly regulated, and depreciation is an expense on the income statement, the accelerated depreciation expense is treated as an unrecovered investment that generally has to be recouped from ratepayers or offset by savings elsewhere in the proposed power plan. Regulators aren't always willing to increase rates just to pay for accelerated depreciation, so sometimes coal-fired power plants are forced to keep operating against a utility's wishes.That's not just a hypothetical.Image source: Getty Images. (NASDAQ: XEL) almost had its  rejected over these concerns last year. The utility proposed to retire 660 megawatts of coal-fired power plants 10 years ahead of schedule and replace them with 380 megawatts of natural gas, 700 megawatts of solar, 1,100 megawatts of wind, and 275 megawatts of energy storage.The Colorado Public Utilities Commission didn't think the long-term savings from cheaper renewable energy sources would make up for the accelerated depreciation expense and almost nixed the power plan because of it. The company's shares struggled to overcome the uncertainty last summer -- a rare feature for a usually steady utility stock with a long history of thumping the returns of the  .Investors can expect more uncertainty -- and more battles between utilities and regulators -- over the issue in the coming years. While a sizable amount of coal-fired power capacity has been retired in the last 10 years, it comprised mostly older, smaller, and less efficient facilities averaging 52 years in age and 102 megawatts in capacity. The nation's existing fleet boasts an average age of 39 years and an average capacity of 319 megawatts. Early retirement of these assets would result in a higher accelerated depreciation due to both their youth (more years of depreciation) and size (higher overall depreciation expense).Image source: Getty Images.The issue certainly isn't going away for Xcel Energy, which recently became the first utility to commit to 100% zero-carbon electricity by 2050. The utility will still lean on coal for 22% of its electricity generation in 2027 after overhauling its portfolio in Colorado -- not to mention a significant amount of natural gas. That means investors will need to be prepared for the risks posed by accelerated depreciation, both in terms of wrangling with regulators and the possibility it will have to keep underperforming coal facilities on line longer than it wants.Few discussions over how to best tackle ambitious climate change goals mention accelerated depreciation, but given the average age and size of America's operating coal-fired power plants, it's going to become an increasingly important detail handicapping utilities. The uncertainty that gripped Xcel Energy in summer 2018 might only be the first example to flash across investor radars.Unless the federal government steps in to eat the cost of accelerated depreciation currently creating a stalemate between utilities, regulators, and ratepayers -- a move some experts have estimated might only cost $50 billion in total, and one that could flip the risk into a gargantuan opportunity -- investors in electric utility stocks will need to keep the accounting mechanism top of mind as companies release ambitious long-term carbon reduction strategies.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

he market expects Xcel Energy (XEL) to deliver fla  compared to the year-ago quarter on higher revenues when i  s results for the quarter ended December 2018. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 31. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the  , it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.This utility is expected to pos  of $0.42 per share in its upcoming report, which represents no change from the year-ago quarter.Revenues are expected to be $3.01 billion, up 7.8% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks  (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce  , and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).For Xcel, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.39%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Xcel will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Xcel would post earnings of $0.98 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.96, delivering a surprise of -2.04%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our  to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Xcel appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

" .  announced that it has completed the sale of its minority owned interest in the K2 Wind power facility (""K2"") in Ontario for $160 million (CAD 216 million) to a consortium of investors led by Axium Infrastructure. The deal was completed on Dec 31, 2018.K2 is a 270-MW wind power facility located in the Township of Ashfield-Colborne-Wawanosh. Markedly, Pattern Energy owned minority interest of 90 MW in the wind facility. It will still continue to operate the wind facility.The company is planning to sell some of its non-core assets and redeploy the proceeds into more accretive assets. Last year, Pattern Energy sold its El Arrayan Wind operation in Chile for net consideration of $68.5 million and decided to expand operations in Japan through acquisitions.Japan is among the fastest-developing renewable markets in the world. Notably, Pattern Energy already has five renewable energy facilities in the country via acquisitions. Four of these five facilities are in operation and one under construction, totaling 206 MW of owned capacity. The company is also exploring opportunities to expand its renewable operation in Mexico.The primary objective of the company is to look for growth opportunities across the spectrum of wind, solar, transmission, storage and advanced energy technologies. It supplies low cost energy from renewable sources to customers, which lowers dependency on fossil fuels.The company owns renewable assets in the United States, Japan and Canada, with owned capacity totaling nearly 2.9 GW. Pattern Energy, through further planned investment in renewable assets, aims to double the megawatts (MW) owned or managed by the company within 2020-end.Per a release from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (""EIA""), it is quite evident that the primary focus across the United States is to lower emission levels, despite the efforts taken by the new administration to encourage the usage of coal in industries.EIA expects the share of U.S. total utility-scale electricity generation from natural gas-fired power plants to rise from 32% in 2017 to 35% in 2018 and 2019. In addition, EIA expects wind, solar and other non-hydropower renewables to contribute 11% of the total generation in 2019, up from 10% in 2018.EIA also forecasts that the electricity generation share from coal will average 26% in 2019, down from 28% in 2018.Increase in the usage of renewable sources and natural gas in the production of electricity was due increasing awareness regarding emission and continued research to bring down the cost of installing utility scale renewable plants. In addition, support from the government through tax credit is resulting in the development of new renewable generation units.As a result, we could notice that large utility companies like NextEra Energy Inc.  are planning to expand its power generation capacity by adding 5,400-7,800 MW of wind assets in the 2017-2020 time period. Another utility Xcel Energy  already owns 1,450 MW of wind assets, and has plans to build 2,950 MW of wind generation and add clean assets in its generation portfolio.Pattern Energy's shares have gained 10.5% in the past three months against its  's decline of 21%.Pattern Energy currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see  .A better-ranked stock from the same industry is Ameren Corporation  , sporting a Zacks Rank #1.Ameren reported average positive earnings surprise of 15.4% in the last four quarters. Long-term (three to five years) earnings growth of the company is pegged at 6.79%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 has moved up 0.3% to $3.28 in the past 60 days.Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

ome  entice with their high yields, but few offer the stability and security that investors can bank on for decades, even a lifetime. Established companies that have sustainable economic moats and are led by management committed to shareholders can typically afford to pay regular and often generous dividends year after year, giving investors a bankable, long-lasting source of extra income.We asked our Motley Fool contributors to identify three such dividend stocks that they believe should be able to pay you for the rest of your life. Here's why  (NASDAQ: XEL) ,  (NYSE: MMM) , and  (NASDAQ: MSFT) make the cut. Electric utilities get a bad rap when it comes to climate change discussions, but the reality is that a steady stream of investments in renewable energy by power generators has put the United States well on track to hit its long-term climate goals. In fact, no other country in the world has slashed more carbon emissions this century than the United States (looking at you, China and India). American emissions could continue to plunge in the next decade, as most utilities have  fleets.Xcel Energy is one of the best examples of the overlooked trend. In 2017, the company leaned on coal for 37% of its electricity generation and wind and solar for 23% -- both well above the national averages. But after receiving a hard-fought portfolio overhaul from  , the generation mix should shift to 22% coal and 45% renewables by 2027. Even that ambitious target could turn out to be an underestimate.Choose dividend stocks that can reward you for the rest of your life. Image source: Getty Images.After its Colorado energy plan was accepted, the company announced the most ambitious power generation strategy of any utility in the United States: Xcel Energy will strive to generate 100% of its electricity from carbon-free sources by 2050. More impressively, the business said it's aiming to reduce carbon emissions 80% by 2030 from 2005 levels. That probably means it can't have any coal-fired power plants in its portfolio by then.The long-term commitment to carbon-free power sources provides a lot of certainty for investors looking ahead. Couple that with the fact that Xcel Energy plans to deliver annual earnings per share growth of 6% for the long haul. Or the fact it has saved millions of dollars in fuel costs by switching a large chunk of its portfolio to wind power, which doesn't require fuel purchases once put into production. Or that the stock already pays a 2.9% dividend yield. Not only should this dividend stock pay you the rest of your life, but you'll also have no guilt owning one of the most climate-friendly electric utilities on the planet. 3M is an old favorite among income investors, but not many are happy with the way things are going at the industrials conglomerate. 3M's numbers  for the better part of 2018, as the company visibly struggled to grow its top line amid weakness in key markets. Yet 3M's challenges arise from macroeconomic factors, and the company looks as well poised to reward shareholders in the future, as it has in the past.For starters, 3M isn't only about Post-it Notes and Scotch tape. Sure, they're among the company's most recognizable products, but 3M's portfolio consists of more than 60,000 products sold in nearly every country today. Because its end markets are so diversified, there'll be strength somewhere and weakness elsewhere most times, which is why 3M isn't the kind of company that can grow like a weed.Yet a company that can prudently mix acquisitions with organic growth shouldn't find it tough to grow earnings and cash flows. So  , 3M believes it can grow EPS by 8%-11% and convert 100% of the income it earns into free cash flow. These projections are only for the next five years, but 3M hasn't failed before and shouldn't beyond 2023, either.Because dividends are paid out of free cash flow, income investors can safely expect regular dividend checks from 3M to hit their mailboxes for years to come. In fact, investors can expect fatter checks every year, as 3M is a  , having increased its dividend  year for more than 60 straight years now. So no matter what the economy does, 3M should pay you dividends for the rest of your life, and probably pay you well.

 's  subsidiary, Oklahoma Gas and Electric, recently announced that it has submitted a proposal to the Oklahoma Corporation Commission for a rate increase of $77.6 million per year. Notably, the company is trying to recover $609-million investment made to adhere to the federal Regional Haze Rule. Also, it has installed emissions-reducing scrubbers on the two coal-fired units at Sooner and is converting two units from coal to natural gas at Muskogee.The projects have been completed on time and are under budget and scheduled to go online in January 2019. If approved, customers will witness an increase in monthly bills of $7.60. Even if the rate hikes is approved the company rates will be among the lowest in the country, at 31% below the national average.OGE Energy is installing scrubbers to lower emission and follow environmental rules. The facility is expected to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions by nearly 90%, nitrogen oxide by 75% and carbon dioxide by 40% for the plants from beginning of 2019.Regulated Utility companies are capital intensive and keep on making investments toward maintenance as well as upgrade of utility infrastructures. The recovery of the investments is mostly done through rate hikes, which is a common trend in the utility sector. OGE Energy's rate hike appeal, if approved, is expected to contribute significantly to total revenues.Between 2018 and 2022, OGE Energy plans to spend around $5 billion, up from the previous five-year investment plan of $3.3 billion. Higher capital spending capabilities reflect enhanced operations, based on which OGE Energy expects long-term utility growth rate in the range of 4-6% with 2018 as the base year.In the past few years, people have become more conscious about pollution-less environment. The awareness increases the demand for renewable energy sources over coal. The usage of renewable energies and natural gas is increasing rapidly.

 recently unveiled its latest product line of ultracapacitors - 3.0-volt (3.0V). This is in line with the company's attempt to optimize its energy storage portfolio by diversifying Maxwell's ultracapacitor products in a large and growing energy storage market, expected to be worth $4.5 billion by 2023 (as per Wood Mackenzie Power & Renewables).Users of Maxwell's existing 2.7-volt product line can use the 3.0-volt to boost energy and power, by using fewer ultracapacitor cells or modules. This makes the new ultracapacitors cost efficient. Users may also totally upgrade their system to the 3.0V version, which, in turn, would extend the life expectancy of the products. Basically, with 3.0V small cells, Maxwell's XP brand has been reformed to a more user-friendly version.Ultracapacitors are electrical energy storage devices that have the ability to store a large amount of electrical charge. With the increasing predominance of renewable energy, more wind turbines are getting installed these days, which require more energy storage to ensure pitch control during critical moments. This, in turn, has pushed up the demand for ultracapacitors.On the other hand, the rapidly expanding e-commerce market has amplified ultracapacitors' demand in warehouses to provide Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) with high power and fast charging capabilities. Moreover, the demand for enhanced connectivity in smart meters for gas, water and electric utilities requires high power functionality to improve accurate meter readings and response time to customers.Maxwell's latest 3.0V platform comes with the highest energy and power in the company's portfolio. Undoubtedly, this product line can very well satisfy the increasing demand for ultracapacitors across varied markets offering cost-effective solutions to the customers.A host of policy and market developments have set the stage for faster energy storage growth in the United States. These includes Xcel Energy's  plan for 275 MW of batteries to support nearly 2 GW of wind and solar power, or NV Energy's plan for 100 MW of storage to accompany more than a gigawatt of new solar.And not only in the United States alone, the energy storage market has been growing significantly across the whole world. The growing cost-competitiveness of carbon-free energy sources, along with improving technology and more environmentally conscious government policies, are spurring demand for batteries in both transportation and utility power sectors.Such developments must have led Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) to predict that the global energy storage market will grow to a cumulative 942GW by 2040, attracting a whopping $620 billion in investments. With the next-generation Ultracapacitors playing the role of a key catalyst in this market, Maxwell surely holds a strong growth potential, with additional small, medium and large cells of its 3.0v platform coming out in the near future.Maxwell's shares have tanked 60.5% in the last year, wider than the  's decline of 21.8%.Maxwell currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the same industry are Novanta  and ZAGG Inc  , sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see Novanta exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in the trailing four quarters, the average being 11.5%. The company's 2019 estimates have moved 5% north in the last 90 days.ZAGG Inc surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in the preceding four quarters, the average being an impressive 621.9%.

tilities provide basic services and are not affected by the vagaries of the economy. These are preferred by investors due to stability of operations and their capability to reward shareholders with regular dividend payments.Utility operation is capital intensive as consistent investment is required to upgrade, maintain and replace older wires and electric poles, as well as power stations. Hence, apart from internal sources of funds, utilities depend on the credit market for funds to carry on upgradation activities.The Fed rate has now been raised for the ninth time since the first hike was announced in December 2015, when the U.S. economy pulled itself out of the Great Recession. In a way, rising interest rates increase this sector's cost of capital, in turn impacting margins. Plus, higher cost of funding may force utilities to delay their capital expenditure plans, impacting cash flow and earnings growth.However, cost control, new electric rates, customer growth and stable demand continue to help the utility sector maintain operational stability.Amid the above backdrop, let's focus on two Zacks  industry stocks, namely FirstEnergy Corporation  and  Xcel Energy Inc.  , to ascertain which is a better buying option going into 2019. Steady performance, along with stable earnings and cash flow enable these companies to reward investors through regular dividends.FirstEnergy, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), has a market capitalization of $19.06 billion. You can see  .Xcel Energy, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), has a market capitalization of $25.31 billion.In the past 12 months, shares of FirstEnergy and Xcel Energy have gained 21.7% and 2.4%, respectively. The industry recorded a decline of 2.2% over the same period.Earnings of FirstEnergy and Xcel Energy are expected to improve 6% and 5.86%, respectively, in the long term (three to five years).FirstEnergy and Xcel Energy both outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate, and recorded average positive earnings surprise of 3.67% and 4.51%, respectively in the last four quarters.ROE is a measure of a company's efficiency in utilizing shareholders' funds. ROE in the trailing 12 months for FirstEnergy and Xcel Energy was 24.42% and 10.75%, respectively. Both the companies outperformed the industry's ROE of 9.44%.The debt-to-capital ratio is a good indicator of the financial position of a company. The indicator shows how much debt is used to run the business. FirstEnergy has a debt-to-capital ratio of 70.73% compared with the industry's 49.52%. Meanwhile, Xcel Energy has a debt-to-capital ratio of 56.04%.Utility companies generally distribute dividends. Currently, the dividend yield for FirstEnergy stands at 3.86%, higher than 3.09% for Xcel Energy. FirstEnergy's dividend yield is also better than the industry's 3.19%.Both the companies are providing quality services to customers and presently have plans to invest billions of dollars in capital projects over the next few years. These additions and the expansion of infrastructure will enable these two utilities to serve their expanding customer base more efficiently.Markedly, it is quite evident from the above comparisons that FirstEnergy is a better utility stock to accumulate.Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

 announced that it has entered into a joint venture with Smithfield Foods, Inc. to form Align Renewable Natural Gas. Align Renewable Natural Gas will capture methane emissions from hog farms and convert these into clean renewable energy for residential home heating and power for local businesses.The project will start operation by collecting waste methane from hog farms in North Carolina, Virginia and Utah, and then convert the same into renewable natural gas. The joint venture will benefit from Smithfield Foods' relationships with contract farmers.Dominion has been working on increasing renewable generation in its production portfolio. The company has a considerable presence in Virginia owing to its solar assets. The new joint venture with Smithfield Foods will aim at lowering methane emission, which is at least 25 times more potent than CO2 as a greenhouse gas.Dominion, through its existing projects, has already lowered more than 10 billion cubic feet of methane emissions. The new project will further lead to a decrease in methane emissions in the atmosphere. The companies will jointly invest $250 million in this project over the next decade.The usage of clean resources to produce electricity in on the rise in North America. Per the recent U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) release, the usage of renewable sources, Wind, solar and other non-hydropower, will keep on increasing. More than 10% of the total electricity generated in the United States in 2018 was generated from the above sources and the contribution from the same will exceed to 11% in 2019.The usage of natural gas and other clean sources continues to curb the dominance of coal in the electricity generation mix in the United States. Utilities like NextEra Energy  and Xcel Energy  continue making substantial investments to add more renewable assets in their existing portfolio.In the past six months, shares of the company have gained nearly 15.5% compared with its  's growth of 5.6%.Dominion Energy currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

very investor has different financial goals and time horizons, so any strategy that works for one may not work for another. Yet it pays to follow what stocks some of the top investors in the world are buying and selling and why they're doing so, as that can not only help you dig up fresh stock ideas to research but also help you better understand the companies whose stocks you own.With that in mind, we asked three Motley Fool contributors to each pick a stock that some of the smartest investors on Wall Street are buying right now and tell us whether they're worth your money. Here's what they have to tell you about utility  (NASDAQ: XEL) , industrials conglomerate  (NYSE: DOV) , and cloud marketing leader  (NYSE: HUBS) .Image source: Getty Images. In mid-October, electric utility Xcel Energy issued a press release arguing that shareholders should reject a mini-tender offer from TRC Capital. The investment firm had reached out to shareholders and offered to purchase their shares (for below market value). If successful, TRC Capital would end up owning 0.49% of Xcel Energy.No matter how that process shakes out, investors with a long-term mindset might agree with TRC Capital that there's an opportunity here. The $24 billion utility has grown into a leading renewable energy advocate in the last 10 years. After relying heavily on coal-fired power plants for most of its history, Xcel Energy is on track to generate  .That's great news for the environment and investors alike. As Xcel Energy has discovered, wind farms and solar facilities don't require fuel purchases, which makes well-sited renewable assets big profit generators compared to coal- and natural gas-fired power plants.It may not seem like much, but avoiding fuel expenses frees up considerable cash flow for growth investments. Consider that fuel purchases comprised 47% of all capital expenditures in 2010, but a bevy of coal retirements and renewable project start-ups are expected to drop that to just 28% by 2027. That should accelerate growth for the business (and renewable energy) and allow Xcel Energy to continue growing its 3.2% dividend yield for the long haul. Dan Loeb and his hedge fund Third Point, which has nearly $17.5 billion in assets under management, has owned a stake in Dover Corp since the third quarter of 2017. An activist investor, Loeb mainly wanted the industrials conglomerate to separate its energy business to reduce cyclicality and unlock greater shareholder value from its core industrials segments.Loeb has closely engaged with Dover since and even bought another 80,000 shares during the second quarter this year. In between, the company has restructured its operations, even spinning off its upstream energy segment as a stand-alone business now listed as  (NYSE: APY) . That leaves Dover with three broad businesses to handle: engineered systems (industrials and fast-moving consumer goods), fluids (pumps and filtration systems), and refrigeration and food equipment. That means Dover is still a well-diversified company minus the volatility associated with energy.Dover believes it should be able to generate operating cash flow worth nearly $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion between 2019 and 2021, leaving it with ample capital to deploy on organic growth and bolt-on acquisitions while continuing to reward shareholders. For perspective, Dover is among the handful of companies that has  . Management intends to maintain a conservative payout of 30% but grow dividends annually by 2% to 4% through 2021 alongside share repurchases.I foresee Dover growing its operating income by high single-digit or even double-digit percentages in the long run as its restructuring efforts bear fruit. The company already has an incredible free cash flow (FCF) conversion rate (the percentage of net income converted to FCF, the higher the better). With analysts projecting Dover to grow its earnings by nearly 14% annually over the next five years and management committed to growing dividends, the stock looks like a great investment for the long haul. HubSpot, a cloud-computing marketing platform company, has gained the attention of lots of investors as its stock has skyrocketed about 50% over the past year. And the hedge fund created by billionaire investor George Soros, Soros Fund Management, reported in its most recent 13-F filing that it too is now betting on HubSpot.If you haven't heard of HubSpot, the company helps other businesses connect with their customers through marketing services, including lead generation, blogs, content management, customer relationship management, and much more.The company's sales in the  were up 38% year over year to $122.6 million, and earnings per share hit $0.18, up from $0.07 in the year-ago quarter. HubSpot's business is built on the freemium model, which means that it allows potential paying customers to use a variety of its services for free and hopes they'll upgrade to more robust services later. So far, the strategy appears to be working, and in the second quarter, HubSpot's subscription revenue was up 38% year over year.So should investors follow Soros's fund and pick up HubSpot shares for themselves? I think it could be a wise move when you consider that the company increased its total customers by 40% year over year in the most recent quarter and expanded its operating margins to 5.3%, up from 2.7% in the year-ago quarter. Add all of that to HubSpot's sales and earnings growth, and this company looks like a tempting marketing platform play.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and HubSpot wasn't one of them!

"n recent trading, shares of Xcel Energy Inc (Symbol: XEL) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $50.78, changing hands for $51.11/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 9 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Xcel Energy Inc, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $47.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $55.00. The standard deviation is $2.488.But the whole reason to look at the  XEL price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with XEL crossing above that average target price of $50.78/share, investors in XEL have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $50.78 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Xcel Energy Inc:

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Comcast (CMCSA), ConocoPhillips (COP) and Delta Air Lines (DAL). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see Buy-ranked  's shares have outperformed the Zacks Cable Television industry year to date, losing -5.8% vs. -11.4% in the space. Comcast's third-quarter 2018 results benefited from solid growth in the number of residential high-speed Internet customers.Advertising revenues also increased due to higher spending on political advertising. Moreover, strong adoption of Xfinity Home drove top-line growth. The Zacks analyst thinks the nationwide rollout of the DOCSIS 3.1 technology and the completion of the nationwide rollout of Comcast's wireless services under the Xfinity Mobile brand will continue to boost subscriber base. Partnerships with the likes of Charter, Netflix and Amazon Prime are other positives.The Sky acquisition expands Comcast's international reach. Sky's content portfolio strength is a major growth driver. However, the company continues to lose voice and video subscribers due to cord-cutting and stiff competition. Additionally, high debt level is a headwind.(You can  ).Shares of Buy-ranked  are up +33.5% over the past year, outperforming the Zacks U.S. Integrated Oil industry, which has gained +13.7% over the same period. In terms of production and proved reserves, ConocoPhillips is the largest oil and gas exploration and production (E&P) player in the world.The company recently reported strong third-quarter 2018 results, courtesy of higher oil realizations and strong volumes from unconventional assets. The Zacks analyst thinks there are significant opportunities for the upstream energy player in the Eagle Ford where it owns about 3,400 undrilled locations. In fact, a strong focus on two other prospective resources like Delaware basin and Bakken shale is expected to help ConocoPhillips achieve its target of 22% CAGR of production through 2017 to 2020.Importantly, through 2017, the firm had lowered its debt load by 30%, thereby enhancing its credit rating. Consequently, ConocoPhillips offers substantial upside potential from the current price levels and is a preferred E&P company to own now.(You can  ). ' shares have lost -1.5% year to date, outperforming the Zacks Airline industry's -21.8% decline. The stock has also outperformed fellow airline heavyweight, American Airlines, which has declined -33.4% in the same time frame. Delta performed impressively in the third quarter of 2018, despite high fuel costs. Both earnings and revenues surpassed the respective estimates and improved year over year.Strong demand for air travel aided results, causing passenger revenues to i ncrease 8.2%. Anticipating travel demand to remain strong, Delta raised its view pertaining to revenue growth for 2018. The Zacks analyst is also impressed by the company's efforts to reward its shareholders.Despite the robust third-quarter performance, the threat posed by rising fuel costs, which increased 32.1% in the third quarter, is a major concern. Also, its fuel bill rose 35% in the quarter. Fuel costs are anticipated to be between $2.47 and $2.52 per gallon in the final quarter of 2018. Expenses on the labor front might also limit bottom-line growth.(You can  ).Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include ServiceNow (NOW), Xcel Energy (XEL) and Zimmer Biomet (ZBH).The greatest discovery in this century of biology is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization.

Image source: The Motley Fool. (NASDAQ: XEL)Q3 2018 Oct. 25, 2018 , Good day, and welcome to the Xcel Energy Third Quarter 2018 . Today's conference is being recorded. Questions will only be taken from institutional investors. Reporters can contact media relations with inquiries and individual investors and others can reach out to the investor relations. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Paul Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. -- Good morning and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2018 third quarter earnings release conference call. Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Frenzel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have other members of the management team in the room to answer your questions if needed.This morning, we will review our third quarter results, discuss earning guidance, update our final plans -- financial plans and objectives and update you on recent business developments and regulatory developments. Slides that accompanies today's call are available on our website. As a reminder, some of the comments made during today's conference call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated or described in their earnings release and our filing with the SEC. I'll now turn the call over to Ben. -- Thank you, Paul, and good morning. We're having a great year. I'm excited to discuss some of our accomplishments and an improved outlook. So let's start with earnings. Today, we reported third quarter earnings of $0.96 per share. That's compared to $0.97 per share last year. Our earnings for the third quarter were consistent with our plans, and with the first three quarters of the year behind us, we're on track to deliver earnings at the high end of our original earnings guidance range. We have also updated our base capital forecast, which reflects rate base growth of 6.2% going forward and using 2018 as a base.We're also confident there are incremental investment opportunities beyond our base capital plan as we continue our steel for fuel and customer-focused strategies. As a result, we are increasing our long-term EPS growth objective 5% to 7%. We're very confident in our ability to deliver earnings at or above the midpoint of the EPS growth range over the forecasted time period.Next I'll provide you with an update on some of our accomplishments with a focus on our leading the clean energy transition and steel for fuel investment strategy. In August, the Colorado Commission approved our Colorado energy plan, which will result in the addition of 1,100 megawatts of wind, 700 megawatts of solar and 275 megawatts of battery storage along with the retirement of 660 megawatts of coal generation.PSCo would own 500 megawatts of new wind generation, acquire 380 megawatts of existing natural gas generation and invest in new transmission for a total investment of about $1 billion, which is reflected in our updated capital budget.Colorado energy plan is projected to provide over $200 million worth of savings for our customers, while reducing emissions by 60% from 2005 levels. Renewables at PSCo will represent 55% of our fuel mix by 2026. I'm extremely proud of our team for delivering this remarkable plan to our customers, the state of Colorado and our investors. I really think it's a model for how the clean energy transition can pragmatically occur in the United States.As part of the Colorado Energy Plan, we also received commission approval for our EVRAZ contract proposal. This represents a creative economic development effort and allows us to retain our largest customer in Colorado through our unique contract underpinned by the addition of 240 megawatts of third-party solar behind a meter for this customer. EVRAZ was considering moving out of the state, but instead plans to stay in Pueblo and expand its operation which is a great news for all of our customers and the Company, but especially Southern Colorado. This is yet another example of how we have worked to have a positive impact on our local communities.We're seeing good progress as we move from the approval to execution stage with our steel for fuel program. We recently completed on time and under budget, the construction of our Rush Creek 600 megawatt wind farm in Colorado. So we're well on our way to having approximately 11,500 megawatts of wind on our system by 2021, solidifying our position as the leading renewable generation utility in the United States, while providing significant customer benefit.By 2022, we expect to have 48% of our energy coming from renewables and will have reduced carbon emissions by 50% across all of our systems. Steel for fuel helps drive a very robust capital investment plan of $19.3 billion. And I'm confident we have upside potential to that capital forecast. We have a track record of consistently delivering more investment opportunities in the outer years of our forecast period and I believe this forecast will be no different.I also believe we have plenty of attractive capital investment opportunities beyond the forecasted time frame. There will be multiple phases of steel for fuel and increased opportunities to invest in our electric and natural gas infrastructure. I'm also excited about the opportunities we have to deliver customized products to our customers and to partner with them to achieve their energy goals.Great example of that is our renewable connect programs, which have been a very big success in Colorado and Minnesota. RenewableConnect offers our customers a flexible and affordable way to receive up to 100% of their electricity from renewable energy and also without the cost being subsidized by other customers. We filed for commission approval of RenewableConnect in Wisconsin and we plan to continue to expand the program in Minnesota and Colorado, which is another customer-driven way for us to add cost-effective renewables to our system. Xcel Energy is also leading the way toward an electric vehicle future that is cleaner, more affordable and more convenient for our customers.Our nation's leading clean energy initiatives paired with the advances in automotive and battery technology have created a pathway to reduce carbon in significant and exciting ways. We recently filed a plan in Minnesota that proposes initiatives and pilot programs focusing on three main areas, home charging, public charging, and fleet operation. Our goal was to test innovative EV services that can be expanded to our customers over time. This truly is an exciting time for Xcel Energy.We are leading the clean energy transition and providing our customers with new innovative products that will ensure we remain their trusted energy provider in the future and provide future investment opportunities for our shareholders.In wrapping up, I'd like to highlight a couple of awards we've received. Xcel Energy was recently recognized as the goal (ph) leader under the state of Colorado's Environmental Leadership Program for the Company's environmental programs, emission reductions, and stewardship initiatives. Xcel Energy was also recently named the Forbes' Best Employer listing, we are ranked number 74 globally, which I think is a pretty significant accomplishment. I think it's always nice to be recognized for our environmental leadership and our workforce culture.So with that, let me turn over to Bob who will provide more detail on our financial results and outlook and a regulatory update. Bob? -- Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. We had a solid third quarter with earnings of $0.96 per share compared with $0.97 per share last year. And on a year-to-date basis, we're now $0.17 ahead of last year. The most significant earnings driver for the quarter after netting the impact of tax reform include higher electric margin, which increased earnings by $0.10 per share, largely due to favorable weather and sales growth, as well as rate increases and riders (ph) to recover our capital investment.Offsetting these positive drivers were higher O&M expenses, which decreased earnings by $0.07 per share; increased depreciation expense reflecting our capital investment program, which reduced earnings by $0.03 per share; and higher interest expense to fund our capital investment program, which reduced earnings by $0.01 per share.Turning to sales. On a weather-adjusted basis, our year-to-date electric sales increased 1.3%, reflecting strong sales growth to our commercial and industrial classes and modest residential sales growth. Year-to-date natural gas sales increased 1.9% on a weather-adjusted basis, reflecting continued customer growth and increasing use per customer. Weather has contributed approximately $0.06 per share this year as compared to normal, and as we indicated in the second quarter call, we've been investing O&Ms to improve and enhance customer service. Accordingly, our third quarter O&M expenses increased by $57 million, which reflects increased vegetation management and maintenance due to the hot summer, initiatives to improve business processes, business systems costs and remediation cost for former manufactured gas plant site.Next, let me provide a regulatory update. We have had a busy regulatory schedule between rate cases and tax reform this year. I'm pleased to point out that most of the regulatory proceedings have either been settled or finalized and we will enter 2019 with relative certainty around our rate revenue. In Texas, we have a rate case settlement with various interveners in which there will be no change in rates as we will use the benefits of tax reform to offset our projected revenue deficiency. The settlement is pending a Commission decision, which we expect during the fourth quarter.In October, we reached a settlement agreement with the staff and the OCC to extend our pipeline integrity rider through 2021 in Colorado. This will provide timely recovery of about half of our capital investment in the natural gas business. The settlement is pending commission approval.And looking forward, next year we anticipate filing rate cases in Colorado in the second quarter and Minnesota in the fourth quarter with new rates going into effect primarily in 2020. As we've discussed, we plan to file rate cases in Texas and New Mexico next year to incorporate the hail wind farm and other infrastructure investment for which we expect real time recovery. Next I want to update you on the regulatory proceedings related to tax reform treatment.We've made significant progress on tax reform in all of our states. You can find additional discussion of each jurisdiction in the earnings release, so I'll just focus on a few recent developments. In Colorado, our tax settlement for Electric Operations was approved and will result in a $42 million customer refund and a $59 million accelerated amortization of prepay pension assets for 2018.In 2019, the customer refund will increase to $67 million and the amortization of the prepaid pension asset will be $34 million. Tax reform for 2020 and beyond will be addressed in our next electric case. For our natural gas operations in Colorado, we've agreed to refund the benefits of tax reform to our customers.As expected, our tax reform through a filing, we requested to increase the authorized equity ratio to at least 56% to offset the impact of tax reform on our credit metrics. We anticipate a commission decision later this year.In Minnesota, the commission approved a customer refund of approximately $136 million and low income funding of $2 million. And finally in North Dakota, we reached an electric settlement with the staff which includes a one-time customer refund of approximately $10 million. While NSP, Minnesota will retain the benefits of tax reform in 2019 and 2020 to offset revenue deficiencies that would have resulted in rate cases. Settlement is pending commission approval.Turning to earnings guidance. Based on our year-to-date results and full year expectations, we are narrowing our 2018 earnings guidance to $2.45 to $2.49 per share, which represents the high end of our original guidance range of $2.37 to $2.47 per share. We are also initiating our 2019 earnings guidance range of $2.55 to $2.60 per share, which is consistent with our revised long-term EPS growth objective of 5% to 7% annually.Please note that our 2019 EPS guidance is based on several assumptions, which are listed in the earnings release. I wanted to highlight a couple of them here. We assume constructive regulatory outcomes in all proceedings. We expect flat electric sales and modest natural gas sales growth of 0% to 1 % and we expect O&M expenses to be flat with 2017 levels. In our earnings release, you'll find our updated five-year capital forecast, which reflects investment of $19.3 billion in our base capital plan and drives compound annual rate base growth of approximately 6.2% over the period. As Ben mentioned, we are confident that there are incremental investment opportunities beyond our base capital plan as we continue our steel for fuel and customer-focused strategies.We've updated our financing plan. In addition to reinvesting our cash flow back into infrastructure and our operating companies, we expect to issue operating company and holding company debt and approximately $690 million of drip in common equity to fund our capital plan. This will allow us to maintain our solid credit metrics with expanded capital investment program.Let me wrap up by highlighting a few of our key accomplishments. We received approval of our Colorado energy plan. We received approval of the EVRAZ contract. We reached a settlement to extend our PSIA rider and we've made significant progress on tax reform in all of our jurisdictions. We're on track to deliver 2018 earnings within a narrowed guidance range of $2.45 to $2. 49 per share and we've increased our long-term EPS growth rate to 5% to 7 %. Finally, we've initiated 2019 EPS guidance of $2.55 to $2.65 per share, which is consistent with our long-term objective.This concludes our prepared remarks. And operator, we are prepared to take a few questions.Thank you very much, sir. (Operator Instructions) We'll now take our first question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Please go ahead, you line is open. -- Hey, congratulations. -- Thank you. -- Absolutely. So -- just a couple things real quickly, just high level, what's (technical difficulty) on the 5-7. And what I'm getting at more is your commentary in the prepared remarks around the future investments and being able to roll forward, as obviously you provided 22 and now 23, but how do you think about the investment, as the wind -- and wind PTC scale down whether it's (inaudible) or distribution or what have you. How do you think about the future sources to keeping this higher sustained level of growth going? And then separately if I can come back just a little bit nitty gritty here, just has been a slight reduction in the nominal level of rate base on 22 since your last update. Can you give us a little bit of a flavor of exactly what transpired there? -- Okay. Well, obviously we update our capital forecast which is what we did rolling it forward one year. I think, Julien, when you look at it, I mean it's I think it's strong in its own merits and reflects significant rate base growth of 6.2%. We also have clarity with our steel for fuel programs now, you know they're behind us and approved. And as I said on my prepared remarks, if you look at our history, Julien, those outer years always get filled in and I think if you go back for example like to 2014 and look what we were forecasting in that '17 and '19 period of time, we were looking about $2.8 billion average annual in those three years periods. And in fact we are spending more like $4 billion. So I'm quite confident we're going to find incremental opportunities in the forecast period and then when you look beyond that just as importantly, we're not done with the clean energy transition, we still have 4.4 gigawatts of coal in our system. I'm really excited, Julien, about customer-driven programs like I mentioned RenewableConnect, we're just now starting to develop more customized programs to allow customers to have EVs and other customized products. I think it's going to open up a whole new world for us. And of course, we are behind probably some of our peers in some of our grid monetization efforts. And so I think we've got a great transparent opportunity to have investments going forward. -- Hey, Julien, it's Bob. Just one more add there. On our base capital plan, we expect, as Ben indicated in his comments, that we expect that to drive earnings growth at or above the midpoint, and the incremental opportunities that Ben mentions would lead you to further growth rates in the range. -- Got it. Can you come back just on the 2022 rate base. It's down about $300 million versus the last slide deck you provided, you gave about 35 CEP (ph) approval. So I wanted to know whether it's been a CEP change in terms of the final approval or is that something else just moving in and around in the forecast? -- Julien, it's really just the nuances of developing the capital forecast. It's nothing, no one project or one decision point, it's just really the fact that as we update the timing of when capex goes into service before tax asset, things like that, there's just some natural hedges timing drilling basically, there isn't a project dropping out. -- Got it. All right. Great comprehension. And then one further followup there. With respect to further grid mod, can you elaborate just a little bit further on opportunities, maybe, in Texas. I know there's some talk of legislation in the '19 calendar year potentially around this? -- You know well, I mean Texas is not one of our biggest jurisdictions, but it's one of the few places where I understand we still have manual reading -- meter reading. So I think there's tremendous opportunities to update the grid there. As you know, Julien, the bigger opportunities in SPS are keeping up with the incredible expansion of infrastructure required to drive oil and gas opportunities in the Permian Basin. And you know as you can see in the sales and some other commentaries we've made, that part of the country is really growing quickly. -- Great. Thank you all very much. Congrats again. -- Thank you, Julien.Thank you. We'll take our next question from Jonathan Arnold from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, your line is open. -- Good morning, guys. On the equity, so you're now -- you're saying you've done 200 of the 300 via ATM in 2018 and you had 300 sort of in the plan -- the prior five-year plan and now you've got 300 in the new five-year plan, but nothing in '19. Is that sort of an incremental 300 that sort of in the back end of the new plan. Am I thinking about that right? -- Yeah, Jonathan, I think that what we said was when we got the Colorado Energy Plan approved, we would likely need approximately $300 million of equity associated with that. So as we've rolled the Colorado Energy Plan into the capital forecast, we've also rolled that $300 million into the equity forecast. That equity is going to be timed more commensurate with the spend on the CEP, which is sort of '20, '21 time frame. -- Okay, great. Thank you. And then just if I could just revisiting the last question, you also had a change in the '18 rate base, went down by $400 million, which -- yeah and if that hadn't happened, you have been showing up some 6 % CAGR. So I'm just curious what drove that shift. It looks like a shift from '18 to '19. Can you shed some light on that? -- Yeah, look, I think as we think about $4 billion worth of capital spend that was planned in '18, some of that capital might just get shifted into '19, particularly as we do developments on our larger wind farm projects, some of that stuff is shifting across year-end. -- Some of it's timing of payments, you know the big turben payments, et cetera, Jonathan. -- Okay. But the general message is the back end, there's more to come there basically. -- Well, I think if you look at our historic track record, we always -- I think first of all, we will put out a very conservative transparent forecast. So there's not a lot of, you know, what we're going to find (inaudible) let's put it into forecast. And if you look at our historic track record, the outer years always turn out to have a heavier capital spend than what we have originally forecasted going into those years. -- Okay. Thank you very much.Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Ali Agha from SunTrust Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open. -- Thank you. Good morning. -- Good morning. -- Ben, I wanted to clarify one point if I heard that correctly. With regards to looking at the EPS CAGR and then looking at the rate base CAGR. So rate base CAGR of the '18 is just over 6 %, EPS now 5% to 7%. Was I hitting it right that to get to the 7% high end of that EPS CAGR would imply some additional CapEx spend that you're confident you'll spend beyond what you've laid out for us or does that imply some improvement in earned ROE from where we are currently, so that EPS CAGR could actually be greater than rate base CAGR. Just wanted to clarify your message on how we get to a 7 % EPS CAGR from here? -- Do you want to take it? -- Yeah. Hey,Ali, it's Bob. Look, I think that to achieve the high end of the earnings guidance range, you could see either, driving the midpoint to a higher end, would either be higher earned ROEs or incremental investment opportunities in our operating companies and I think either are possible. -- Okay. But if I stuck to the base plan as you've laid out today, there is room for ROEs to go up, because in the past as we've talked, it seemed to me that in terms of finishing off any theoretical lag, there wasn't much left. But are you indicating that there's still room to increase the earned ROEs from here? -- Yes, I think that's probably true. We initiated or closed the ROE gap (ph), we had about 90 basis points of lag. We've narrowed that to closer to 50 basis points of lag and you know we think there's still upside opportunity to close that further. -- I see, and then with regards-- -- And Ali, I think if you look at a rising interest rate as we file rate cases, the first one to tell you that ROEs were sticky going down as interest rates fell. I think they will be sticky going up. But the fact of the matter is and this is an issue we use every opportunity we can to talk to our commissions. We have below national average ROEs. So I think we're going to be a little less sticky going up than perhaps others that have enjoyed better ROEs today. So I think ROEs will improve. You know I think our base capital expenditures give us silently put us, as I said in my remarks, at the middle of that range, a little improvement in ROE with any additional CapEx and we're going to be even better than that. So we're really excited about this plan. -- I got you. And my other question was when I look at the $19.3 billion plan, are there any constraints you think about whether the customer rate impact, how much equity you want to put in the system, when you factored all of those issues and how much, I guess, capacity do you have to increase that plan and stay within whatever parameters that you like to track? -- Ali, I think that's a great question, it's something that we're always looking at and what I'm pleased to tell you is that while rate base is growing at 6 plus percent in this time frame and I think it will continue to grow at those kinds of rates going forward. The key is not to have that translate for the need to corresponding rate increases to our customers. So if you look at our cost that where we've been since 2013 on a total bill basis, our bills have actually fallen, that's lower commodity prices, that's the beginning days of steel for fuel, that's energy efficiency and our own cost initiatives to keep rates low. If we look at the forecast time period, we don't think rates will go up any more than 1% to 2% on that time frame. So that creates that headroom potentially for additional investments that I think are closely aligned with customer wants and expectations. So it's a really important thing, you've got to keep your eye on a ball. I don't think you can ask for more than CPI-type rate increases with -- and have success and that's the beauty of steel for fuel and turning fuel into investment opportunities and -- et cetera. I mean it allows us to grow, give you something to get excited about and give our customers what they want without a price increase. -- And would you, I mean just from a rough perspective, give us some quantification of how much headroom you think there is? -- I really think it depends on what you're investing in. I mean I think we have tremendous opportunities to continue to invest in our distribution grid, our gas infrastructure and those are just conversations we're going to have with regulators, because there is many opportunities as they want us to do. I can't really quantify it for you Ali, but I mean to the extent you can hold O&M flat to the extent you can help customers be more energy efficient to the extent you can do things like steel for fuel that save customers' money. I think that creates the headroom to give us more runway that I would venture to say most of my peer companies have. -- Understood, thank you.Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Greg Gordon from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open. -- Hey, Greg. -- Thanks, hey, good morning, guys. I think you guys have really answered most of my questions. The only one I have and make me--? -- We talk about (multiple speakers). -- Yeah, well, that's a short conversation, not a great one. Given the way you guys handle this on Sunday. But when we get out, I just don't recall these numbers, we get out to the end of your current capital plan, what percentage of your generation fleet remains coal, if any? -- It's 4.4 gigs. So what's the -- does anybody have the energy mix, what that would be? -- Maybe less than 30 %. -- Less than 30%, Greg. (Multiple speakers). We think about the forecast period being 2023, we really haven't gotten into the meat of the shutdown of the Sherco Units 1 and 2 and Comanche Units 1 and 2. We will -- by the time we set those units down by the mid-2020s, we will be -- we'll have about 4,400 megawatts of coal left on our system. And so I think that our declining coal percentage will continue both in terms of generation as well as capacity, and as we think about it as a percentage of rate base, our coal investment will be less than 5 % of our rate base by that point too. -- So less than a 5 % rate base and in terms of capacity and/or energy and I'm not looking for a precise number, it will be substantially lower than 30%, substantially lower than 20%, just what's your guess? -- Maybe lower than 30%, Greg. -- Perfect. We can have a conversation offline. I was just trying to get a sense of it. Because I mean you guys have come up incredibly long way with the steel for fuel plan. I mean where were you five years ago, six years ago, what was--? -- Well, I think when we look back where we started this journey, I mean we were dominated by coal as you know and again I -- we will get it, we should have the energy mix, Greg, but you know when we get all the steel for fuel and wind that we're talking about here by 2022, the renewables 50 % of our energy mix. So coal has got to be and gas, I think, is somewhere around in the mid 20s. So it's falling and then you look out to 2030, that's when we have still 4.4 gigs left after the coal retirement as Bob mentioned and I think the percentage then is somewhere in the 20%, isn't it, and more to come after that. -- Great. (Multiple speakers). -- Yeah, the key is to do it in a way that doesn't sacrifice reliability and affordability and that's what I'm very proud of. -- Agreed.We will now take our next question from Christopher Turnure from JP Morgan. Please go ahead, your line is open. -- Good morning, guys. I wanted to ask one of the prior questions in a little bit of a different way, just on the constraints, if any, to your rate base growth plan. It sounds to me like there's a lot of opportunity to invest. It sounds like the customer bill is something that you're clearly focused on and thinking about, but the inflation rate there does not sound particularly higher on your base plan. And today you introduced a bit of incremental equity through the five-year plan. Do you view the balance sheet as a constraint on that growth given, I guess, the current capital market conditions? -- Yes, Chris, it's Bob. We find that the capital markets have been very receptive to our offerings and our larger strategic story and to the extent that they remain open, you know we certainly think we can access the markets both the fixed income and the equity markets at rates that are appropriate to finance this plan. And if this plan were as Ben indicated to have additional investment opportunities. My belief is that capital finds good projects, and if we've got good projects, we'll be able to raise the money. -- Perfect, great, good to hear. And then given the unfortunately low ROE and kind of unfavorable rate case outcome in New Mexico, can you give us your latest thoughts on that jurisdiction and strategy, near term at least? -- Yes, I mean it was a disappointment, there's no doubt about it. We did petition in the Mexico Supreme Court to stay that decision and that petition was successful. So we'll have a shot at getting it appealed and particularly as it relates to the refunding of the amounts under the tax reform, I've got David, he is sitting across from me and he has worked with David Hudson who runs SPS getting out there and outreaching to our customers and our regulators. It's important, ROE matters, credit quality matters. As rather Moody's downgraded SPS, I think as a result of some of the New Mexico actions, we also recognize that -- we got to -- you know we got to get out there and talk to our constituents more and this is a growing area rate base, it's going to grow significantly, I think, by almost 50% with the wind we're adding. We've got to get the right regulatory construct now. I think you also probably know that there's an election that's going to take place and there is five commissioners in Mexico, they're all elected and we'll have three new commissioners as of January 1. So perhaps there's a chance to kind of restart the dialogue if you will. David, do you have anything to add to that? -- No, I think you covered it, an increased presence in New Mexico. We've already started working with our customers that intervene or involved in the regulatory process and we'll embrace and work with those new commissioners. And we have two important cases coming up with Hayo and Jagger Moore (ph) in the middle of 2019 and then in '20. So we will position to get a very different outcome then. -- Great, thank you.Thank you, we'll take our next question from Travis Miller from Morningstar. Please go ahead. Your line is open. -- Hey, Travis. -- Good morning, thank you. Hi. Question again about that 5% to 7% range, interested in the opposite side of that 5%. What takes you down to that, would it be more unexpected operating costs or higher, or is it more the projects and the CapEx toward the outer years don't come through or something else? -- I mean I think what takes you down is probably poor regulatory outcomes and declining sales and things like that that would create essentially more regulatory lag as you'd have to file rate cases sooner. We don't anticipate that. In fact I mean I think we have pretty conservative sales assumptions for 2019. But you asked, so those are the things that we'd have to look at. -- Okay, good. And then second question on some of these customer plans that you've talked about in closer touch with the customer, are there earnings opportunities there, or is there just more of a reputation building and perhaps even down to the regulatory relations improvement, stuff like that. -- Oh, I think there's earnings opportunities and I -- obviously I think it enhances our reputation with our customers, which is always important, but yeah, no, I think there's -- I think there are definitively indefinitely earning opportunities and things we're talking about. -- Through capital investments? -- Yeah. Through making investments that help our customers to be successful. -- Okay, great, I appreciate it. -- Thanks, Travis.We will now take our next question from Paul Patterson from Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead, your line is open. -- Good morning, how are you doing? -- Good. -- So, just one sort of quick followup, Moody's took rating action on you guys with a broader view subsidiaries and it seems that they're basically predicating the affirmation that in Colorado on you guys getting the regulatory treatment, the equity ratio bump that you're asking for. Just to sort of clarify you, if you don't get the regulatory treatment that you expect, would there be any change in the plan itself, I mean or would you just let the credit rating do it as if you know what I'm saying. -- Well, Paul, I mean it's a great question, but I think you're talking about the Moody's recent credit action? -- Yes, that's right. -- My understanding I'll turn this question over to Bob pretty quickly is that the action there was to downgrade SPS and I think that's a result of some of the regulatory actions that they took and then the other one was to put the holding company on negative watch. I don't think they made any action in Colorado. -- Let me clarify, I didn't mean that they took action, what they said, I guess, in their affirmation of the rating Colorado was that, they seem to spell up very specifically that they were predicating it. You getting the regulatory treatment that you were seeking with the bump in the equity ratio. And I guess my question is and I apologize it wasn't clear is what would happen if you don't get the regulatory treatment, do you guys have some rating objective or would you just simply let the rating do it, whatever do -- let the rating agencies do whatever they're going to do. Do you follow what I'm saying? Or would you guys, as also discussed by Moody's, potentially change your CapEx or something else? -- Yes, Paul, this is Bob, in all of our jurisdictions, we interacted with the staff and the commissions around the importance of their decisions in preserving the credit ratings and our operating companies. And in Colorado in particular, we filed for what we thought was the appropriate capital structure for public service in Colorado which was a 56% equity ratio in both the gas and the electric companies and we stand by their recommendation as appropriate for preserving the credit quality in those companies.We've had a lot of conversations across the year about the importance of their decisions in preserving credit quality. I mean at the end of the day, the commissions decide capital structure, they decide ROE, they decide regulatory mechanisms for capital recovery. And so it's very important that they recognize that as we do that the credit quality is important and we felt like the equity structure in Colorado that we recommended is still appropriate based on our tax reform views or post tax reform outcomes. -- So Paul, I think you're also asking if we're making those recommendations as Bob mentioned. I think you're asking would we change our equity plans. The answer is the equity plans are what we shared with the rating agencies and we don't anticipate changing those, what we hope is that our commissions follow our guidance, so that the credit ratings would be preserved. -- Okay. So for the most part, your plan would be pretty much intact one way or the other If I understand you guys correctly. -- Correct. -- Okay. Awesome, thanks so much.We will now take our next question from Paul Freemont from Miguel. Please go ahead, your line is open. -- Thank you. First of all, congratulations. Second of all, following up on Paul Patterson's question. I think Moody's was seeing consolidated 16% to 17% FFO to debt metric on a going-forward basis. Is that consistent with what you're seeing as well? -- Yes, hey, Paul, it's Bob. Good morning. We share our forecasts with Moody's and S&P and Fitch and I think that their forecasts are consistent with ours on an adjusted basis and they make certain credit adjustments for pensions or for other fixed capacity payments we make for power plants and PPAs and things like that to our underlying FFO to debt metrics. I think they also recognize that we have a very diversified holding company that spans eight states and multiple regulatory jurisdictions, and they cited the benefit of that diversity in their ratings' outcomes. And so we work with Moody's very closely on all of their calculations and their outcomes. -- So I mean if that plays out, is it reasonable to assume that there likely would be a potential change in the rating you know coming a year from now? -- Look, we shared with them their forecast they put us on negative watch and they're going to continue to have conversations with us. I don't think there's a triggering action at this point for them. And so we're going to sit and watch and work with them and talk about our what we think is a very solid financial profile of our holding company. -- Okay. And then my other question is when we think about sort of rebasing growth as we get to the end of the year, would it more likely be -- would it be like year-end numbers or how should we think about that? -- You know, Paul, in the earnings release, we gave a base for the growth rate at $2.43, which represent the midpoint of our original guidance range of $2.37 to $2.47. We can always revisit that once actuals of '18 are known, but that's the basis today. -- Okay. Thank you.We will now take our next question from Andrew Levy from Exodus Point. Please go ahead. Your line is open. -- Hi, good morning. Ben, you find increased growth rate, there you go. (Multiple speakers). I discussed this with Paul the other day. So I think I understand it, but there were some questions with the two other Paul, Paul D, and Paul F, just as you look at the cash flows, I didn't really see them hand out, but I guess as the wind comes on, you get into a negative tax rate situation, I think, in like '21 or something like that and so that also will affect the cash flows as well. And I don't know if that's what Moody's is focused on as well, but don't you -- isn't there like a $200 million or $300 million change in operating cash flow, because you get into that negative tax rate, but you still have to pay the PTCs. Am I correct on that. And can you just kind of talk about that and I guess the bottom line of the conversation I had last week was, your parent rating is so high if you get knocked down a notch, it doesn't really matter. -- Hey, Andy, it's Bob and good morning and obviously thanks for the continued support. You know we give Moody's our forecast and I think the ratings and their calculations are based on that and it includes the impacts of the negative ETR that you mentioned. So I think they'll continue to watch the holding company as they put us on watch and we'll keep working with them espousing while we think it's a solid credit there. -- Andy, this is Ben, just stepping back. That's not going to be -- that's not a determining factor in the ratings. I mean they're looking at some of the actions that the utilities have taken and we mentioned New Mexico, we're keeping an eye on Colorado. In fact, I think Moody's is impressed with how we run our holding company and they liked the fact that unlike a holding company on top of a single operating company, we had four distinct operating companies operating in eight different states, I think, with 21 different jurisdictions. They like the fact that we're purely regulated, they like the fact that we had economic customer regulatory diversity. So the holding company is a strength, not a weakness. And I think that's just important for our investors to understand. -- Ok. I definitely do understand that, but just to make sure that I got it right last week. There is a reduction in the operating cash flow because of the way your tax rate becomes negative because of the GTT. -- Andy, the way to look at this is, we run that one and we generate PTCs, they flow back through the customer and the reduction in tax expense to the extent that we don't fully utilize all those PTCs. There would be a cash flow impact and they result on being added to the balance sheet and we are going to return on that. And that's -- Andy, that's baked into our financing plans as we've laid out here. -- Great, and that was also baked into kind of what you showed the rating agencies. There really shouldn't be--? -- It's exactly. (Multiple speakers). The real issue with the rating agencies is the fact that tax reform was implemented, caused our FFO to debt go down by about 300 basis points. That's really what drove the change in the outlook which is why we went to our commissions and generally said the best way to mitigate that is through higher equity ratios and we've had some success and some things that we're still working on. And that's where we are. -- And if you don't get the higher equity ratios and obviously with everything else we had discussed, that wouldn't change your equity plan, would it? -- The equity plans have been established with the rating agencies and what we are -- -- So based on the equity ratios you have right now?

"nvestors in Xcel Energy Inc (Symbol: XEL) saw new options begin trading this week, for the June 2019 expiration. One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 233 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the XEL options chain for the new June 2019 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $45.00 strike price has a current bid of 70 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $45.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $44.30 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of XEL, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $48.72/share today.Because the $45.00 strike represents an approximate 8% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 75%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.56% return on the cash commitment, or 2.44% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Xcel Energy Inc, and highlighting in green where the $45.00 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $50.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.95. If an investor was to purchase shares of XEL stock at the current price level of $48.72/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $50.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 6.63% if the stock gets called away at the June 2019 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if XEL shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Xcel Energy Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing XEL's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $50.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $50.00 strike represents an approximate 3% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 56%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.00% boost of extra return to the investor, or 6.27% annualized, which we refer to as the  .The implied volatility in the put contract example is 27%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 20%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $48.72) to be 17%.

cel Energy (XEL) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.96 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.98 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.97 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -2.04%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this utility would post earnings of $0.47 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.52, delivering a surprise of 10.64%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Xcel, which belongs to the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, posted revenues of $3.05 billion for the quarter ended September 2018, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.14%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $3.02 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the .Xcel shares have added about 4.5% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's decline of -0.7%.While Xcel has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Xcel was favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see  .It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.40 on $2.97 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $2.47 on $11.74 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Utility - Electric Power is currently in the top 23% of the 250 plus Zacks industries.

nvestors considering a purchase of Xcel Energy Inc (Symbol: XEL) stock, but tentative about paying the going market price of $49.35/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the March 2019 put at the $45 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of 55 cents. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 1.2% return against the $45 commitment, or a 3.2% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to XEL's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $45 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Xcel Energy Inc sees its shares decline 9% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $44.45 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the 55 cents from $45), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 3.2% annualized rate of return.Interestingly, that annualized 3.2% figure actually exceeds the 3.1% annualized dividend paid by Xcel Energy Inc, based on the current share price of $49.35. And yet, if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downside because the stock would have to lose 9% to reach the $45 strike price.Always important when discussing dividends is the fact that, in general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Xcel Energy Inc, looking at the dividend history chart for XEL below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 3.1% annualized dividend yield.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Xcel Energy Inc, and highlighting in green where the $45 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the March 2019 put at the $45 strike for the 3.2% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Xcel Energy Inc (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $49.35) to be 16%.

n 2000, wind and solar combined to be the source of just 0.1% of all electricity generated in the United States. No wonder renewable energy had so many critics. To be fair, wind and solar were expensive, inefficient, and hadn't done much of anything since being hyped up during the energy crisis in the 1970s. But all of that has changed now.Today, wind power is, on average, the cheapest source of electricity on a levelized cost basis in the United States. Solar power is third, just behind natural gas, and together with wind, the renewable pair is responsible for nearly 10% of total electricity production in the country. Shares of companies that have led installments, such as  (NYSE: NEE) and  (NASDAQ: XEL) , have thumped the S&P 500 in the last two decades or so as a result.Investors probably haven't missed out yet. Considering that wind and solar could provide 25% or more of America's electricity by 2030, and new opportunities are emerging in offshore wind and a next-generation geothermal technology, there could be decades of growth left in renewable energy stocks. Here are five amazing facts about how we got here, and where we might be heading.Image source: Getty Images.The United States is on pace to generate 275 terawatt-hours of electricity from onshore wind power in 2018, compared to just 5.6 terawatt-hours in 2000. That amounts to a whopping 4,810% increase since the turn of the century. By comparison, the S&P 500 has gained 168% in that span with dividends (and two brutal recessions) included.Therefore, it shouldn't be surprising that some of the best-performing stocks in that span belong to businesses that went all-in on the future of wind power. NextEra Energy stock has delivered a total return (share performance plus dividends) of 1,430% in that time, growing from a ho-hum electric utility in Florida to the world's largest publicly traded utility. Even shares of Xcel Energy, which only began investing heavily in renewable energy in the last decade, have put up a total return of 477% in that period.NextEra Energy and Xcel Energy began the year with nearly 21,000 megawatts of installed wind capacity combined, or about one-quarter of the country's total. The companies have played a pivotal role in increasing wind power's share of nationwide electricity generation to nearly 7% -- enough to make it the  , something hydropower has claimed for over 100 years -- and hope to replicate their success with solar power. While solar electricity production is about 10 years behind the trajectory of wind power, it could grow more quickly as costs continue to decline.Image source: Getty Images.The United States exited 2017 with an estimated 115,000 megawatts of installed wind and utility-scale solar power capacity. It took decades, dozens of industry players, and tens of billions of dollars for the country to reach that level. If NextEra Energy has its way, then the next 115,000 megawatts might take significantly less effort.The company's power-generation subsidiary, NextEra Energy Resources, has plans to grow its renewable energy project backlog to 40,000 megawatts by 2020. Perhaps equally impressive is the fact that each major region of the United States is represented in the ambitious portfolio, even those considered to have relatively poor renewable energy potential, whereas today, most wind and solar energy power capacity is concentrated in only a handful of states. Considering the business' current backlog is larger than its entire operating portfolio at the end of 2011, investors don't have to guess at the appetite for wind and solar projects among American electric utilities.Image source: Getty Images.When low-orbit satellites survey planet Earth for regions with the most photosynthetic activity, a measure of plant growth and carbon dioxide consumption, jungles and the occasional algal bloom in the ocean stand out as expected. But no region swipes more carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere than the American Midwest, home to America's Corn Belt.In addition to being a  , the American Corn Belt is home to over 90% of the country's ethanol production and more than half of total global output. That has created problems in recent years for producers such as  and  (NASDAQ: GPRE) , which are drowning in oversupply, but the industry is taking a lesson from the country's oil and gas boom with hopes to create a more sustainable future: exporting the excess.The United States is on track to export 1.8 billion gallons of ethanol in 2018, and it has now exported over 1 billion gallons for three consecutive years. Considering more export terminals are coming online this year and next, and nearly 1 billion gallons of ethanol production capacity remains offline, this is  .Image source: Getty Images.The United States will soon have 100,000 megawatts of onshore wind power in operation, but the technology's offshore counterpart hasn't even been able to launch from the starting block. Hindered by a lack of domestic expertise, high costs, and zoning issues, offshore wind power boasts just 30 megawatts of installed capacity in the country today. That's all about to change thanks to a helping hand from Europe.After cutting their teeth on their home continent, which hosts the overwhelming majority of offshore wind projects on the planet, European players such as  are crossing the Atlantic to grab a piece of North America's incredible untapped potential. The United States could realistically generate more than twice its total electricity needs from offshore wind power in the Lower 48. Tremendous power potential, falling costs, and experience gleaned from Europe have resulted in a project pipeline of 23,375 megawatts today. Most of that  and greatly improve the carbon footprint of American cities, most of which are located on or near an oceanic coast or one of the Great Lakes.Image source: Getty Images.Nuclear power is currently the nation's largest source of carbon-free power, comprising roughly 19% of the country's total electricity consumption. But it's in trouble. Atomic energy facilities simply can't compete economically with lower-priced natural gas and wind power. While some states have provided subsidies to reward nuclear power plants for providing carbon-free electricity, that can't continue indefinitely. By 2030, the country's aging fleet will be long overdue for retirement.Help could come from a completely unexpected source: geothermal energy. The U.S. Department of Energy is quietly funding the development of a novel technology called enhanced geothermal systems (EGS). By using fracking technology pioneered and perfected for use in shale oil and gas regions, it may be possible to create geothermal energy wells across the United States that can produce massive amounts of clean energy.In what can only be proof that we are indeed living in a simulation, the numbers are almost too good to be true. The United States has an estimated 100,000 megawatts of easily accessible next-generation geothermal potential -- exactly the amount of nuclear power currently operating. Geothermal is the second most efficient energy source by a mile, right behind nuclear power, and the U.S. DOE is targeting a deployment date of 2030 -- exactly when the nation will need to replace its nuclear fleet.The opportunity isn't quite ready for individual investors yet, but companies that specialize in oil and gas well optimization such as  and  can also tap into emerging opportunities in EGS.

 is set to report third-quarter 2018 financial results on Oct 25, before the market opens. The company is expected to come up with a positive surprise this earnings season. Last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 17.07%.Our proven model conclusively shows that CMS Energy is likely to beat on earnings this reporting cycle. This is because the stock has both a positive  and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. CMS Energy has an Earnings ESP of +2.11%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate is pegged at 58 cents, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 57 cents per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . CMS Energy carries a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP. Moreover, a positive ESP increases the odds of an earnings surprise. Thus, this combination makes estimate beat look more feasible.Conversely, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.CMS Energy has been working to lower operation and maintenance (O&M) costs, which in turn, boost its margins. In fact, the company has been able to cut down on O&M costs coupled with a favorable weather condition, which has led to increased earnings per share in the first half of 2018 by 29% compared with the figure registered in the same period of 2017. The lower O&M cost has contributed nearly 10 cents per share in first-half 2018. We anticipate similar cost reductions in the company's upcoming third-quarter results.CMS Energy anticipates that the earlier approved electric rate case, is going to have a positive impact on third-quarter earnings. Also, CMS Energy's service territory Michigan has experienced a strong building permit as well as GDP growth, which has driven higher demand for electricity. The company has achieved roughly 70 megawatts of new business in 2017 and anticipated to reach 100 megawatts in 2018.The company focuses on capacity maximization, reliability improvement, clean power generation and infrastructural upgrade. It plans to spend $10.1 billion from 2018 through 2022. Moreover, CMS Energy anticipates that capital expenditures will help reducing the operation and maintenance by 2% between 2017 and 2019. The company aims to deploy around $8 billion to expand its natural gas system over 2017 to 2026 period. Also, the company is putting in continuous efforts to extend its renewable portfolio as well.Here are a few other stocks worth considering in the  space as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings in the upcoming releases. You can see  .American Electric Power Company, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +2.46% and a Zacks Rank of 2. It is expected to report third-quarter 2018 earnings on Oct 25.Ameren Corporation  has an Earnings ESP of +8.65% and is a Zacks #2 Ranked player.

" recently unveiled the Green Source Advantage program - a new renewable energy project - to serve its South Carolina customers. However, successful implementation of the program remains subject to approval from the Public Service Commission of South Carolina (""PSCSC"").Through this project, the utility provider intends to provide renewable energy to large commercial and industrial customers in particular, supporting them in fulfilling clean energy goals.On approval, this project will enable Duke Energy to supply up to 150 megawatts (MW) of reserved renewable energy to its South Carolina customers. Participation in this project will enable the company's large non-residential customers to secure significant amounts of solar or other renewable energy.Per the terms of the agreement, on participation in the renewable energy program, Duke Energy's large business customers will receive bill credits for energy produced by a solar site that is not located on the customers' premises. The program also enables customers to retain the renewable energy certificates (RECs) produced by the facility.These perks that Duke Energy's customers will get on participating in the Green Source Advantage program should drive more customers to choose the company as their preferred utility provider.To promote increased adoption of renewables, a handful of state commissions across America have made it mandatory for utilities to enhance their renewable portfolio. Being no exception, South Carolina is also following suit.Notably, South Carolina's renewable energy portfolio continues to grow despite a nationwide loss of jobs in the solar industry. According to a new report from The Solar Foundation, the Palmetto State's solar industry experienced a 2.1% increase in employment last year, while the same declined 3.8% nationwide.Interestingly, Duke Energy played a vital role in establishing renewable energy industry in South Carolina. To this end, in 2015, Duke Energy offered rebates to customers over there in order to help offset the initial costs of installing solar on their property. Naturally, the latest program should all the more bolster the company's position in the state.Per a latest release from the U.S. Energy information administration (EIA), solar generation in the United States will rise 26% from 211,000 MWh/d in 2017 to 267,000 MWh/d in 2018 and 14% to 305,000 MWh/d in 2019 (an increase of 14%). Moreover, wind, solar, and other non-hydropower renewables provided slightly less than 10% of electricity generation in 2017. EIA expects them to provide more than 10% in 2018 and nearly 11% in 2019.Realizing the expanding renewables market in the nation, U.S. utilities are aggressively investing in renewable projects and lowering their carbon footprints. The latest program proposed by Duke Energy is an example of that. In this regard, it is worth mentioning another utility provider - Xcel Energy  - that achieved a 40% carbon-free generation portfolio. By 2022, its wind capacity alone will reach 40%, totaling a 61% carbon-free mix.Per management, CMS Energy  has taken a leadership position in the Utility sector by reducing its carbon emissions by more than 35% from 2005 to date, as of Jun 30, 2018. It also decreased its combined percentage of electric supply from coal by 16 percentage points since 2015.Meanwhile, Ameren Corp  aims at expanding its renewable sources by adding at least 700 megawatts (MW) of wind generation by 2020 in Missouri and neighboring states. Over the next 10 years, the company aims to add 100 MW of solar generation.Zacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

hether it's through stocks, bonds, ETFs, or other types of securities, all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns. But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.Based in Minneapolis, Xcel Energy (XEL) is in the Utilities sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of -1.02%. Currently paying a dividend of $0.38 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 3.19%. In comparison, the Utility - Electric Power industry's yield is 3.24%, while the S&P 500's yield is 1.93%.Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $1.52 is up 5.6% from last year. Xcel Energy has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 6.24%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Xcel's current payout ratio is 61%, meaning it paid out 61% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Earnings growth looks solid for XEL for this fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 is $2.47 per share, with earnings expected to increase 7.39% from the year ago period.From greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.For instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, XEL presents a compelling investment opportunity; it's not only an attractive dividend play, but the stock also boasts a strong Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Moreover, it repurchased $89 million of outstanding debt and utilized the balance to redeem the 2022 notes, which will result in annual interest savings of $20 million.In addition, NRG Energy also targeted $640 million in debt reduction.

The company's initiative to lower debts will surely bring down this ratio near the industry average.Courtesy of the positive initiatives undertaken by the company, NRG Energy's interest outlay was $369 million in the first six months of 2018, reflecting a 21.7% decline from the year-ago levels.In the past 30 days, shares of NRG Energy have returned 1.9%, outperforming its  's growth of 0.6%.NRG Energy currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

 recently announced that its Energy Services segment, which operates through CenterPoint Energy Services, Inc. and its subsidiary CenterPoint Energy Intrastate Pipelines, LLC, has expanded its retail natural gas supply to residential customers and businesses of all sizes in Illinois.From this month, the company began providing services in Illinois, where it already established presence.

The EIA anticipates natural gas production to increase nearly 11% in 2018. It also anticipates the average to be 81.3 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) for the year. Moreover, the EIA expects natural gas production to witness growth in 2019, with average production reaching 84.5 Bcf/d.Growing production of natural gas in the United States, increasing replacement of coal-fired power plants and higher energy consumption by industrial projects are likely to ensure strong natural gas demand.CenterPoint Energy stock has rallied nearly 1% over the past six months, outperforming the  's return of 0.0%.CenterPoint Energy currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

" announced that it will lower methane emissions from its natural gas utility operations by more than 80% within 2040. Since 2011, the company has been able to lower methane emission by 16%, courtesy of improvement in its natural gas distribution system.The company is set to achieve its emission reduction target by replacing steel and cast iron pipelines, along with installing new materials such as polyethylene tubing for main and service lines, as well as epoxy coated high-strength steel for transmission lines.After investing $12 billion within the 2013-2017 time period, the company aims to invest $17 billion in the 2018-2022 time frame to further strengthen its utility infrastructure and midstream operations. The company will spend $2.1 billion in the said period to strengthen its Gas operations.DTE Energy will also retire all its coal-fired plants, having a total generation capacity in excess of 6,400 megawatt (MW), by 2020 and replace them by adding in excess of 7,500 MW of power from renewable sources within 2050.The company aims to achieve a balanced mix of renewable energy sources, and gradually lower its methane emission and promote increasing usage of natural gas.Per the U.S. Energy Information Administration (""EIA""), as of February 2018, renewables accounted for 22% of the total U.S. electricity generation capacity. The percentage of renewables in the total generation mix is expected to rise, thereby curbing the share of fossil fuel generation.Despite efforts of the new administration to revive the usage of coal in different industries, we notice that large utilities like NextEra Energy  and Dominion Energy  are increasingly investing in renewables, and lowering emission.Another utility Xcel Energy  is also investing regularly to lower its carbon footprint and aims to achieve 60% carbon reduction by 2030. Electricity production from renewables is expected to reach 45% in 2027 from 3% in 2004, while power production from coal is likely to drop to 22% in 2027 from 56% in 2005.Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

ll investors love getting big returns from their portfolio, whether it's through stocks, bonds, ETFs, or other types of securities. But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.Based in Minneapolis, Xcel Energy (XEL) is in the Utilities sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of -2.22%. The utility is paying out a dividend of $0.38 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 3.23% compared to the Utility - Electric Power industry's yield of 3.24% and the S&P 500's yield of 1.77%.Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $1.52 is up 5.6% from last year. In the past five-year period, Xcel Energy has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 6.43%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Xcel's current payout ratio is 61%, meaning it paid out 61% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Looking at this fiscal year, XEL expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 is $2.47 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 7.39%.From greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.Big, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that XEL is not only an attractive dividend play, but is also a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

nvestors interested in Utility - Electric Power stocks are likely familiar with Xcel Energy (XEL) and El Paso Electric (EE). But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Currently, Xcel Energy has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while El Paso Electric has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that XEL has an improving earnings outlook. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.XEL currently has a forward P/E ratio of 19.05, while EE has a forward P/E of 24.14. We also note that XEL has a PEG ratio of 3.30. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. EE currently has a PEG ratio of 5.17.Another notable valuation metric for XEL is its P/B ratio of 2.06. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, EE has a P/B of 2.10.These metrics, and several others, help XEL earn a Value grade of B, while EE has been given a Value grade of C.XEL sticks out from EE in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that XEL is the better option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

fter an extended period of aggressive investing, market watchers are veering around to taking a more defensive approach toward stock picking. The recent spike in yields and the accompanying rise in volatility is the primary trigger for the change in stance. Investors are expressing concerns over valuations and looking to invest in government bonds, which are safer than their equity counterparts.For equity-centric investors, it makes sense to invest in defensive stocks to protect hard-earned profits. These stocks offer slower but stable growth during periods of uncertainty. Since these also hold the promise of higher-than-average yields, investing in defensive stocks looks like a prudent option at this point.On Oct 3, yields on benchmark Treasury Notes scaled record levels following the release of a series of strong economic reports. The ISM services index hit an all-time high in August. Factory orders posted their largest monthly increase since September 2017. Also, ADP data reflected strong private sector job additions in September.This trend continued on Oct 5 with the release of impressive jobs data. Consequently, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note increased by 3 basis points to 3.227%, its highest level since May 2011. (Read:  )This resulted in a weekly increase of 17.1 basis points, the highest such increase since February. Fears over rising yields spilled over into trading on Oct 8, leading to a three-day run of losses for the broader markets.The pickup in wage growth will likely cause the Fed to hike rates further in order to combat inflationary pressures. On Oct 3, Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated that there's still a long way to go for rates to hit neutral, a clear indication of further rate hikes. This will raise the cost of funds for both corporations and investors.Investors are increasingly of the opinion that they would be better off investing in risk-free government securities. This has also led to fresh concerns over the valuation of investments, which have benefited from a sluggish rate environment. A perfect storm may be in the works for stocks and will bring with it a spike in volatility.Defensive options are becoming increasingly popular in such an environment. On Oct 8, the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (XLP) gained 1.4%. The Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) and the Real Estate Select Sector SPDR (XLRE) increased 1.7% and 0.4% on Oct 5, emerging as the only two sectors to finish in the green. The XLU was the best sector performer last week, gaining 2% over the period.The rise in yields has been primarily caused by a series of bullish economic reports. However, investors have chosen to focus on a rise in cost of funds, leading to a spike in volatility and losses for equity markets. With the Fed intent on hiking rates further, such fears are unlikely to die down in a hurry.Investing in defensive stocks, which offer a safe and stable choice during periods of uncertainty, looks like a good option at this point. Further, they carry the promise of above-average dividend yields. We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics. a commercial mortgage real estate investment trust (REIT), is a real estate finance company that acquires, originates, manages and finances commercial real estate loans and real estate-related securities.Ready Capital has expected earnings growth of 24% for the current year.

"fter a  , the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) announced that it would approve an ambitious power plan from  (NASDAQ: XEL) that will permanently reshape the state's electric grid. The utility will be allowed to retire two coal-fired power units representing one-third of its total coal capacity and replace them with over 2 gigawatts of combined wind, solar, and energy storage assets. It's not without controversy.Xcel Energy is confident that the $2.5 billion Colorado Energy Plan will end up saving ratepayers hundreds of millions of dollars over time, but the state regulator had doubts about the economic estimates. Failing to deliver the expected cost savings could have an impact on ratepayers and shareholders, as Colorado was responsible for 39% of the company's net income in 2017. However, the power plan future-proofs the business -- and it could actually end up saving over $1 billion.Image source: Getty Images.Last year, Xcel Energy boasted a power-generation mix comprising of 37% coal (well above the national average) and 23% wind and solar. The company also had a capital base (the value of installed assets from which customer rates are determined) of $25.1 billion. Both will receive a big boost from the Colorado Energy Plan.The regulatory green light means Xcel Energy will be able to expand its dominant position in  and shift its generation mix to 22% coal and 45% renewables by 2027. Similarly impressive, the capital base will now grow to $36.4 billion by 2022, which represents a compound annual growth rate of 7%, up from an earlier estimate of 6.5%. That's music to the ears of income investors, who can expect the current annual distribution of $1.52 per share to grow even faster now.Here are the specifics of the Colorado Energy Plan:It adds up to retiring 660 megawatts of coal and replacing it with 2,075 megawatts of renewables and 380 megawatts of natural gas. That will boost the share of renewables in Xcel Energy's generation mix in the state from 28% today to 55% by 2026. Once complete, it will also reduce the company's carbon emissions 60% from a 2005 baseline.That's good news for the environment, and although that's one consideration of the CPUC, the regulator is a little more concerned about protecting the wallets of ratepayers. The three-person panel approved the $2.5 billion power plan despite openly questioning the accuracy of the company's cost-savings projections, which the utility says will pile up to $213 million by 2054.That's not a lot of savings -- especially not over a nearly 30-year period -- to begin with, but regulators think the real savings will be even less. Some external observers think the power plan will actually cost ratepayers money. However, shareholders with a long-term mindset should consider the utility's argument, which is actually pretty persuasive. data by  .Xcel Energy argues that wind and solar farms don't have fuel expenses once built and are now the  in Colorado. That should help to cancel out one of the biggest costs of the power plan: retiring the coal-fired power units early.While it's nice to think a power generator can just hang up its hard hat and walk away from its coal fleet, the reality is that regulated utilities have to weigh legal requirements around the financial accounting of accelerated depreciation of assets. Early retirement means the bill comes due sooner, and all at once. Ratepayers are usually stuck with the tab. Avoiding fuel expenses with renewable energy sources allows them to make up the difference in this case, according to Xcel Energy.Even though that wasn't enough to persuade CPUC, there's another huge cost that doesn't factor into the regulator's considerations: the social cost of carbon dioxide.  . The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency abbreviates it as ""SC-CO2"" and defines it as the economic impact of emissions on healthcare costs, rising energy bills, reduced heating costs, and the like.By 2050 -- around the time Xcel Energy's cost-savings estimates end -- the EPA estimates that the SC-CO2 could reach $26 per metric ton to $212 per metric ton of emissions. While this isn't factored into economic or regulatory decisions today, it very well could be at some point in the next three decades.Therefore, the utility's 60% reduction in carbon emissions from the Colorado Energy Plan actually represents a huge cost savings, and it future-proofs the business from environmental and regulatory risks down the road. In fact, using the SC-CO2 (although the exact per-ton value used isn't clear), Xcel Energy estimates that its latest shift toward renewable energy will end up saving over $1 billion. That could end up saving long-term investors quite the headache --  .Image source: Getty Images.Xcel Energy's Colorado Energy Plan is a win all around. Shareholders can expect the increased capital base to grow its revenue, earnings, cash flow, and dividend at a faster pace than previously estimated. Ratepayers should save money on their utility bills, or at least not be on the hook for the accelerated depreciation associated with retiring coal assets 10 years ahead of schedule. And everyone wins from a steep reduction in carbon emissions that avoids risks from increased social costs and potential regulatory burdens, including future shareholders. Who knows, that could be a future version of yourself, albeit decades from now.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

enewable energy sources like solar and wind power are growing fast, gaining market share in the world's energy markets. Companies that focus just on renewable power are easy to find, but they aren't the only way to gain exposure to this trend. In fact, we are also a long way from a world powered solely by renewables, with current power options deeply entrenched and supported by years of strong demand ahead of them. This will provide existing energy suppliers ample room to shift with the times. Which is why it shouldn't be too surprising to find out that old-school energy companies like  (NYSE: NEE) ,  (NASDAQ: XEL) , and  (NYSE: AES) are quickly bringing renewables into their businesses.NextEra Energy owns Florida Power & Light, a traditional regulated utility based in Florida that happens to be the largest electric utility in the United States. However, it also operates a business called NextEra Energy Resources. This division of the company owns a renewable-merchant-power business that is one of the largest wind- and solar-power companies in the world, with 20 gigawatts of power capacity.Image source: Getty Images.Roughly 70% of that capacity is wind, 11% solar, and 14% nuclear, with the rest spread across natural gas and other fuels. NextEra has long-term plans to build another 40 gigawatts of renewable generation, with a current goal of spending as much as $25 billion on renewables between 2017 and 2020. The stock isn't cheap, trading with a relatively low yield of 2.6% and a relatively high (compared to peers) forward P/E of 22. However, it is expecting capital spending to push earnings up around 11% to 12% a year and dividends higher by 12% to 14% annually, driven by letting its low payout ratio increase. Xcel Energy is an electric and natural gas company that operates in eight western and midwestern states. In 2005, it generated just 5% of its electricity from wind and solar power. Today that number is up to 23%. The goal is to reach 45% by 2030, with 3.6 gigawatts of renewable construction in the works today. Add in the roughly 13% the company generates from nuclear power, and by 2030, clean energy will account for nearly 60% of Xcel's generating capacity.  data by The spending to get from here to there, while also supporting its traditional operations, is expected to push earnings higher by 5% to 6% a year, with dividends set to rise by 5% to 7%. Between 2018 and 2022, Xcel's capital budget is roughly $18.5 billion, with nearly a quarter of that earmarked for renewables (second only to the utility's spending on distribution). The yield is more in line with the broader utility industry at roughly 3.3%, with a modest payout ratio of target of between 60% and 70%. Income investors looking for a more traditional utility investment should take a look. The forward P/E of around 19 is middle of the road for the utility space.AES isn't your typical U.S. utility company, with assets spread across 15 countries. In that way, it is a very different animal compared to NextEra and Xcel, and it's probably most appropriate for more aggressive investors. That said, the stock's 3.7% yield is more generous than the two companies above, and its forward P/E of around 11 is toward the low end of the utility industry.Those are enticing figures, especially when you add that AES expects to grow earnings between 8% and 10% a year through 2022. The dividend, meanwhile, has been increased $0.04 a year recently, which amounted to 8% in 2018. (Note that the company only started paying a dividend in 2012, so its historical dividend growth rate is unrealistically high and not a reliable indicator of future growth potential.) If you are willing to handle the uncertainty involved with AES's far more diversified business model, it may be worth the extra legwork needed to understand the business. data by Roughly 27% of its 34 gigawatts of capacity is renewable today. And while it plans to expand its renewable-power capacity over time, the most interesting thing about AES is its commitment to storage through a joint venture with Siemens called Fluence. This business is expected to expand rapidly, hitting 22 gigawatts of storage capacity by 2022 (roughly 10 times its current capacity).  . Since wind and solar are intermittent sources of power, storage allows utilities to hold the power until it is needed and reduce their reliance on traditional generation to smooth supply. AES is a more complex story but is still worth the research effort even if you don't end up buying it.You could easily run out and buy renewable-only companies, but that focuses you on just one area of the power market. It's a growing niche, to be sure, but diversification and scale have benefits, including things like  . Don't get caught up in the hype surrounding renewable power; make sure to put old-school, diversified utilities like NextEra, Xcel Energy, and AES on your research list of renewable-power companies even though they don't look like renewable-power companies. You might just decide that owning one of these industry giants is a better fit for your portfolio than a company focused only on one niche in the energy space.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"n recent trading, shares of Xcel Energy Inc (Symbol: XEL) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $49.12, changing hands for $49.28/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 8 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Xcel Energy Inc, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $47.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $53.00. The standard deviation is $2.031.But the whole reason to look at the  XEL price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with XEL crossing above that average target price of $49.12/share, investors in XEL have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $49.12 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Xcel Energy Inc:

"enewable energy is off to a roaring start in the 21st century. It may not seem like that, considering electricity generated from wind and solar farms still comprises a minority of total global energy production, but many observers forget that the long-term trajectory of the technologies will be exponential, not linear. You gotta start somewhere, as the saying goes.The fast rise of wind and solar bodes well for reaching international climate goals, and has also proven to be great for individual investors that know where to look. That said, there are still quite a few misconceptions about renewable energy -- on both ends of the spectrum -- that could lead investors down the wrong path.The funny thing is that I used to make this argument years ago. But it turns out wind and solar energy have sprinted down the cost curve -- and they're headed lower. In fact,  , on a levelized cost basis unsubsidized wind power is the cheapest source of electricity generation in the United States at just $0.03 per kilowatt-hour (kWh). That's followed by the newest natural gas-fired power plants at $0.04 per kWh and, surprisingly, unsubsidized utility-scale solar power at $0.043 per kWh.That explains why most major electric utilities have ambitious plans to retire coal-fired capacity and replace it with wind, solar, and natural gas. For instance,  (NASDAQ: XEL) could lean on wind and solar to generate  , with only 22% coming from coal. In 2005 the company's generation mix was just 3% renewables and 56% coal. You can see similar trends in the generation portfolios of most American utilities, and it's driven almost entirely by economics.Image source: Getty Images.There may be no quicker way to sabotage climate goals than arguing that renewable energy can (or even should) replace nuclear power in the short-term. The reason being is  . In the United States, it takes 3.4 gigawatts of solar capacity or over 2 gigawatts of wind capacity to replace the electricity generated from 1 gigawatt of nuclear power. The on-off nature of renewable power assets means that they run at fractions of their nameplate capacity, whereas nuclear power facilities consistently run at 90% capacity or better. That gap will close slightly as technology improves, but if maximizing clean energy is the goal, then nuclear power has an important role to play in the next decade or two.Unfortunately, undervaluing nuclear power's clean energy production has forced  and  (NYSE: EXC) to announce plans to retire four money-losing nuclear power plants in Pennsylvania and Ohio by 2021. If completed, the four retirements will swipe 40 terawatt-hours per year of carbon-free electricity off the regional grid, called PJM, which produced only 30 terawatt-hours of electricity from  wind and solar installations last year.Luckily for these utilities, there's a push to get the two states to provide financial assistance with zero-emission credit systems. Similar legislation aided Exelon's operations in Illinois and New York, stemming losses and keeping carbon-free electricity energy on the grid. Investors may want to keep a sliver of hope that the company can persuade policymakers to do the same in additional states, which could further boost the company's profitability.Image source: Getty Images.The difference between power and energy also matters when comparing one renewable energy project to another, especially in different countries. For instance, China and the United States rank first and second, respectively, in installed power capacity from wind and solar. The former had 289 gigawatts of capacity installed at the end of 2017, while the latter had 121 gigawatts installed. That's a difference of 139%, but  . The country only generated 38% more electricity from wind and solar than its second-place challenger.Most of the gap between installed capacity and energy generated can be explained by the quality of technology installed, grid connections, and the large differences in wind and solar potential between the two countries. Nonetheless, the comparison highlights the importance of evaluating the details of international utility projects in the portfolios of renewable electricity yieldcos such as  (NASDAQ: PEGI) .The company is making a  , but the country has relatively poor wind potential compared to the United States. The best wind farms in Japan operate at just 29% efficiency, compared to over 50% in the United States. Heck, the average wind farm in America operates at 37% efficiency. Luckily for individual investors, while the assets produce less electricity compared to similarly sized wind projects in the United States, the company appears to be offsetting that with higher electricity prices in the Japanese market. However, it's a good reminder that power capacity is not the most important metric for investors to focus on for these types of companies.Image source: Getty Images.As a group, oil majors generate tens of billions of dollars in free cash flow per year, and they're beginning to  . That's great news, and should expedite the transition to lower-impact energy production and consumption.  ,  , and  are spending billions of dollars per year to build profitable renewable energy and clean energy portfolios. The general idea is for these oil and gas giants to slowly transform into electric and gas utilities, which will come in handy as global transportation shuns liquid fuels for electric charging.That said, few oil companies are going as far as  (NYSE: EQNR) , formerly known as Statoil. It changed its name to remove the word ""oil"", but that's only the start. The Norwegian energy giant is taking its experience operating in the rough waters of the North Sea to become one of the world's leading developers of  , which holds tremendous promise for taking renewable energy to the next level. That's because offshore wind farms can produce amounts of electricity comparable to what you'd get from natural gas-fired power plants, they don't take up land that could be used for other purposes, and they can be located near coastal cities, where most of the world's population lives.However, the technology is still relatively expensive right now, largely because the industry is just getting started. In 2017 the world had only 19 gigawatts of offshore wind capacity, compared to 495 gigawatts of onshore wind capacity. Equinor is hoping to capture a first-mover advantage, and will soon bring offshore wind power to the United States. The company is building a 1 gigawatt project off the coast of Long Island, New York called Empire Wind, which will electrify 1 million homes. It's early, but the oil company's investments show it's serious about a renewable future.Image source: Getty Images.There seems to be a popular narrative that America is helplessly behind on its climate change goals, but there's a compelling argument to be made that the United States is actually  of schedule.Wind energy is on pace to overtake hydro as the nation's  in 2019 (numbers through the first four months of 2018 hint it could reach that milestone this year). In the first five months of 2018 the amount of electricity generated from solar panels increased 30% compared to the same period of last year. At 55%, solar comprised the majority of all new generation capacity installed on the grid in the first quarter of 2018.Investors who dare to peek ahead to 2030 will see plenty of reasons to be optimistic for the future of renewable energy. By then it will be feasible for onshore wind power to generate between 15% and 20% of American electricity, while solar power will likely reach a double-digit market share. Throw in offshore wind power (only now getting started in the United States, and excluded from many long-term projections) and  (aiming to leverage hydraulic fracking technology to become economical by 2030), and  and nuclear assets might be a slam dunk by 2040. It could even make financial sense to begin early retirement for certain natural gas power plants by then.Image source: Getty Images.Renewable energy represents a great opportunity for individual investors to build long-term wealth. That's especially true considering two things: First, wind and solar power are among the cheapest sources of electricity, which means they're likely to comprise the majority of new generation capacity for the foreseeable future. Second, exciting new technologies such as offshore wind and enhanced geothermal are coming down the industry's pipeline.However, it's still important to acknowledge the complexity of energy markets and to make room for nuance in your stock analysis. Doing so might change your mind on power generation companies with existing nuclear power plants, or even the potential for oil supermajors to be considered ultra-long term plays in the future of renewable energy.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"nvestors in Xcel Energy Inc (Symbol: XEL) saw new options begin trading this week, for the March 2019 expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 231 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the XEL options chain for the new March 2019 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $45.00 strike price has a current bid of 50 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $45.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $44.50 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of XEL, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $47.08/share today.Because the $45.00 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 67%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.11% return on the cash commitment, or 1.76% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Xcel Energy Inc, and highlighting in green where the $45.00 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $50.00 strike price has a current bid of 25 cents. If an investor was to purchase shares of XEL stock at the current price level of $47.08/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $50.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 6.73% if the stock gets called away at the March 2019 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if XEL shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Xcel Energy Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing XEL's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $50.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $50.00 strike represents an approximate 6% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 68%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).

This sector, along with 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors, is likely to come up with improved year-over-year earnings. Currently, the Autos and the Conglomerates sector is likely to register a decline in earnings.The Utility sector's second-quarter earnings are expected to increase 1.8% year over year on 1.3% revenue growth, courtesy of expected stable performance by most of the utilities. Utility stocks are expected to gain from the new rates in their service territories, customer growth and effective management of expenses, all of which should have a positive impact on second-quarter earnings.Unemployment rate in the United States during the second quarter was in the range of 3.8-4.0%. This historic low level of unemployment boosted demand for new housing units and in turn the requirement for utility services. Per a U.S. Energy Information Administration (""EIA"") report, electricity demand from residential, commercial and industrial sectors during the first half of 2018 improved from the year-ago period.However, these utilities do have their share of challenges such as a rising debt level, stringent regulations and the hurricane season, which can wreak havoc on infrastructure. Rising interest rates (the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates in June, marking the seventh increase since December 2015) make bonds a strong investment option, as interest rate hike increases the utilities' cost of capital, impacting margins and compromising on their ability to pay or hike dividend rates. Despite the rate hikes, we find the utilities fundamentally strong enough to come up with positive earnings surprise this earnings season.Let's take a look at some Utility stocks scheduled to report second-quarter 2018 earnings on Jul 26 and how things are shaping up prior to the announcement. delivered a positive earnings surprise of 11.76% in the last reported quarter.

"hile utilities are eager to clean up the power sector, they're realizing that will be a difficult task for renewables alone to accomplish. Consider that, because  , it takes 2 gigawatts (GW) of solar or 1.4 GW of wind to replace the electricity generated from every 1 GW of retired coal-fired capacity. That gap will close as technology improves, but time is of the essence to meet carbon emission reductions outlined in the Paris Agreement.That helps to explain why many utilities are turning to one of the most important, lowest-cost, and most often overlooked clean energy technologies available: energy efficiency. Long-term investors should pay close attention, as the compounding synergies realized from pairing renewables with energy efficiency could differentiate the best utilities stocks to own from the rest of the pack.Image source: Getty Images.According to the most recent  from the Consortium for Energy Efficiency, American electric utilities spent nearly $7 billion on energy efficiency programs for customers in 2016 and saved an estimated 25,788 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of electricity. That's up markedly from just $1.6 billion spent in 2006 and was roughly equivalent to annual retail electricity consumption for the entire state of Connecticut.So why would electric utilities, in the business of selling electricity, invest in reducing their market opportunity?While it may seem counterintuitive, energy efficiency investments are actually largely driven by economics. That's because when energy saved is considered an ""energy source,"" it's by far the cheapest form of electricity, with levelized costs as low as $0.028 per kilowatt-hour (kWh). By comparison, the average American household pays $0.102 per kWh of electricity.Energy efficiency programs are adding value elsewhere, too. For instance, energy efficiency lowers peak demand -- the most expensive electricity to generate and deliver -- during summer months, which makes it cheaper to replace a portion of  with efficiency efforts. As  (NYSE: DUK) bluntly tells customers, ""the cleanest, most efficient power plant is the one we never have to build."" To accomplish that goal, the company pays customers to make energy-conscious upgrades to their homes, including new HVAC systems (rebates of up to $525), water heaters (up to $325), and more. In fact, most major electric utilities (and gas utilities, too) have energy efficiency rebate programs for their customers. Image source: Getty Images.Duke Energy has made energy efficiency programs a core piece of its long-term sustainability efforts. By 2030, the company aims to cumulatively save 22,000 GWh of electricity consumption in its network. That works out to 8.7% of the company's total generation in 2017. Again, it's all about reducing expenses and capital expenditures.Energy efficiency efforts will play a major, albeit quiet, role in allowing Duke Energy to generate over 80% of its electricity from zero- and low-carbon energy sources by 2030. The math works out on a national level as well.For instance, if the United States consumed 10% less electricity from fossil fuel sources in 2017, then renewables would have seen their share of the energy mix rise from 17% to 19%. It may seem insignificant, but it's equivalent to an 11% increase -- delivered without installing a single additional wind turbine or solar panel. Considering the  , which don't have fuel expenses, utilities understand that energy efficiency will allow them to transition more of their generation mix to higher-margin production, faster.Many major utilities are now ramping up investments in cost-saving, margin-boosting energy efficiency programs. In fact, there's a strong correlation between the most ambitious renewable energy investment strategies and energy efficiency programs. Some utilities have a lot of catching up to do.Perhaps not surprisingly, there's a general correlation between long-term total stock returns and energy efficiency and renewable energy programs. It was even stronger prior to the collapse of PG&E stock in late 2017, when it  to better manage regional risks from California wildfires. data by  .If the cost savings from even more ambitious energy efficiency programs play out as expected, then this divergence in stock performance could widen in the next decade between those electric utilities taking the value proposition seriously and those that aren't.While it may be counterintuitive for a utility (in the business of selling electricity) to reduce its market opportunity, avoiding large up-front capital investments from building new power plants and transitioning a greater portion of energy generation to higher-margin production from renewables makes energy efficiency a great investment. The math -- and stock performances -- hints that this is an under-discussed trend that could play a big role in investing success.Additionally, if you're in the market for a new HVAC system, refrigerator, water heater, smart thermostat, pool pump, or other power-hungry appliance or system in your home, then you might want to check with your local electric utility to see if rebates are available. More likely than not, energy efficiency can be a great investment for your home, especially with free money available for purchases you'll need to make anyway.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"any new stock pickers are naturally attracted to  . The logic is that they can easily buy hundreds (or thousands) of shares of a company that trades for under $1 with only a few hundred dollars. The same can't be said for ""expensive"" stocks that trade for over $100 per share.However, we Fools know that penny stocks  for investors. So which stocks do we think penny stock lovers should focus their time and attention on instead? We asked a team of Motley Fool investors to weigh in and they picked  (NASDAQ: AMCX) ,  (NASDAQ: XEL) , and  (NASDAQ: MITK) .Image source: Getty Images. The cable content studio has trailed behind the broader market recently, falling 25% lower in three years while the  benchmark marched 35% higher. At the same time, AMC's business never stopped growing.Trailing sales increased by 18% over the same three-year period while  surged 32% higher and adjusted earnings per share soared to a 69% increase.As a result of these contradictory trends, AMC's shares are trading at ridiculously low prices today. You can buy this stock for just eight times trailing earnings or 3.4 times EBITDA. In short, the stock is priced as if end times were near -- despite plenty of proof that the business is showing healthy growth.It's true that the traditional cable industry is suffering as  at an alarming and accelerating rate. But AMC is hedging its bets by making hit shows like  and  available on leading streaming platforms Hulu and  (NASDAQ: NFLX) . The low stock prices have also given rise to rumors that one of the streaming leaders might just boost their content production chops by acquiring AMC Networks for a song.So AMC shares give you a premium content producer in an era where content is king, with high-quality financial results to match and a bargain-bin discount price. I'd rather own this proven winner over whatever rickety penny-stock gamble might be popular this week -- especially at these low-risk entry prices. Electric utility stocks have gotten off to a rotten start in 2018, but investors should view that as an opportunity rather than an omen to stay away from the industry. After all, it would be difficult to find another group of stocks more capable of beating the total return of the S&P 500 over the long haul. Xcel Energy is  .Shares have trailed the total return of the S&P 500 by 13% in the last year, but have edged the index in the last three-, five-, and 10-year periods. That includes a total return of 237% in the last decade, compared to ""only"" 180% for the index. Peering into the company's ambitious strategy for the next decade provides plenty of reasons for optimism.Xcel Energy, already the nation's second-largest producer of wind energy, plans to generate 60% of its electricity from zero-carbon sources in 2022. A combination of coal-fired power plant retirements, energy efficiency programs, and big investments in wind and solar will be used to achieve that goal. If successful, then the utility would slash its carbon emission in half compared to levels from 2005.It's important to note that the focus on renewable energy is driven by economics, which makes any utility's renewable energy strategy a top consideration for investors. Simply, wind and solar assets provide significant savings over time because they avoid fuel expenses. Consider that in 2010 Xcel Energy spent 47% of its capital budget purchasing fuel, but that is expected to drop to just 30% in 2022 and 28% in 2027. That will free up more cash flow to invest in growth, double down on renewables, or directly create shareholder value with dividend growth or share repurchases. With a dividend yield of 3.2% today, that's no minor detail. I was lucky enough to lose a bundle from buying penny stocks when I first started investing. That early experience was painful but it was invaluable for teaching me that it is foolish to only invest in stocks that trade for a low dollar amount. That's why you'll find that  is full of companies that trade for well over $100 per share today and why most of the companies that I follow trade for at least $10 per share.However, Mitek Systems is a notable exception. At a recent price of just over $9, this is the lowest-priced stock that I follow. Since I think there are reasons to be bullish on this business, it could be a great stock for price-focused investors to get to know.Mitek Systems isn't a household name but the odds are pretty good that you've used the company's product, even if you didn't know it. Mitek is a leading provider of mobile image capture software. The company sells its technology to thousands of financial institutions that want to offer mobile check deposit to their customers. Offering this solution is a no-brainer decision for most banks because it is far cheaper to deposit a check by using the mobile app instead of processing it at a branch of ATM. Customers also love the convenience of not having to visit their bank in person for such a simple transaction, so it's a win-win scenario all around.For investors, there's  about Mitek's business. The company has already achieved profitability and sports a debt-free balance sheet. Better yet, only about 3% of checks that are deposited each year in the U.S. are done on mobile devices, so there's a tremendous runway ahead for growth.Mitek is in a great position to deliver double-digit revenue and profit growth for the foreseeable future as mobile deposits continue to gain traction with consumers.

" announced that its unit Duke Energy Carolinas continues to support solar energy production for its customers. In excess of 5,000 of the company's South Carolina customers have already installed solar panels on their homes and businesses, reaching a legislative goal for customer-owned solar capacity.Courtesy of Duke Energy Carolinas' support, and willingness and initiatives of customers, the company is expected to achieve its goal of 40 megawatts (MW) of private ""rooftop"" solar well ahead of 2020. Duke Energy Progress, the utility serving the northeastern part of the state, is well on its way to meet 13 MW of private solar goal.Development of residential solar in South Carolina was supported by strategic programs like the net metering incentive and rebate offerings. In addition to the net metering incentive, the company also provided in excess of $50 million in rebates as an extra incentive for customers who wanted to install solar panels across South Carolina.Owing to friendly legislation passed in the state, a new report by Southern Alliance Clean Energy (SACE) suggests the South Carolina solar market to expand much rapidly in the coming years. South Carolina registered 318 watts of solar per utility customer in 2017 and the report expects solar per utility customer to grow 170% to 856 watts by 2021.Per a latest release from the U.S. Energy information administration (EIA), non-hydropower renewables provided slightly less than 10% of electricity generation in 2017 and are expected to provide more than 10% in 2018 and nearly 11% in 2019. The report indicates that production from solar energy is going to increase further from the current levels.Utilities are investing in renewable projects and lowering their carbon footprints. Xcel Energy  already achieved a 40% carbon-free generation portfolio and by 2022, its wind capacity alone will reach 40%, totaling a 61 percent carbon-free mix.Duke Energy aims to invest $25 billion within 2017-2026 to create a smarter, greener energy grid that will be more reliable and resilient even during severe weather conditions.At present, 40% of Duke Energy's electricity produces no greenhouse gas emissions and the objective of the company is to own, or have under contract, 8,000 MW of wind, solar and biomass capacity by 2020. This will further lower carbon footprint of the company.In the past six months, shares of Duke Energy have gained 2.0%, outperforming its  's growth of 1.4%Duke Energy currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

" announced that it will utilize drones to survey birds' nests on utility poles. Birds of prey habitually nest on tall structures like electric transmission towers and poles. Drones can track and identify these nests quickly. Early removal of nests will lower the possibility of power outage and provide safety to the bird.It's mandatory for a utility electric company to maintain its network of transmission and distribution lines to supply uninterrupted electricity to customers. Expansion of business operation requires large investment toward maintenance of electric poles, lines and grids. Such initiative enhances resilience of the system against natural events and heightens reliability of services.FirstEnergy plans to invest nearly $10 billion in regulated business through 2021 to strengthen and augment infrastructure. Recently, its subsidiaries completed the inspections of transmission lines. Since 2014, the company has upgraded or replaced existing power lines and incorporated smart technology into the grid. FirstEnergy upgraded dozens of substations with new equipment and enhanced security features to serve customers more efficiently.The company has initiated a modernization drive plan named ""Energizing the Future."" Aiming for upgraded and expanded regulated transmission capabilities, the company expects to invest $1-$1.2 billion annually through 2021.Regular monitoring and servicing involves more expenses, time and manpower. Usage of modern technology offers a fast and safe method of surveying locations. Utility companies are investing regularly to provide safe, clean and reliable service to customers.Adopting advanced technologies to maintain and inspect expansive infrastructure, drones are gradually becoming popular among the utility service providers in the United States. Xcel Energy Inc  , CMS Energy Corp  and PPL Corporation  have already started to utilize drones to maintain their infrastructure. Considering the benefits of drones, we expect to see higher usage of the same among other providers as well.FirstEnergy currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see Shares of FirstEnergy have returned 14.5% against the  's decline of 10.2% in the last 12 months. The upside can be attributed to the continuous investments made by the company to upgrade and modernize transmission and distribution lines.Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

Shutterstock photoLegendary investor Warren Buffett advises to be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful. One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.In trading on Monday, shares of Xcel Energy Inc (Symbol: XEL) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 29.9, after changing hands as low as $41.99 per share. By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) is 70.8. A bullish investor could look at XEL's 29.9 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. The chart below shows the one year performance of XEL shares:    Looking at the chart above, XEL's low point in its 52 week range is $41.51 per share, with $52.22 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $42.13.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Xcel Energy is Now Oversold (XEL)@2018-06-11@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/xcel-energy-now-oversold-xel-2018-06-11

"Chicago, IL - June 5, 2018 - Stocks in this week's article include: Stryker Corp.  , SS&C Technologies Holdings, Inc.  , Fifth Third Bancorp  , AMETEK, Inc.  and Xcel Energy Inc.  .Investors often fail to consider sales growth as a dependable metric when it comes to selecting stocks. This might be because of their preconceived notion that a company's price performance is typically sensitive to its earnings momentum. But betting on stocks depending totally on such a perception may not prove worthwhile.It's worth keeping in mind that in cases when companies incur a loss, albeit transitorily, they are valued on revenues and not earnings, as top-line growth (or decline) usually reflects a company's future earnings performance. Notably, in contrast with price to earnings and price to book value ratios, which can turn negative and cease to be relevant, the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is available even for firms that have hit choppy waters.Also, a company can improve earnings by resorting to expense saving measures while maintaining stable revenues. However, superior profits could be achieved through continued revenue growth.Further, earnings and book value are largely influenced by several factors including accounting decisions tied with depreciation, significant charges and inventory. But there are limited opportunities to manipulate sales, which further underscores the importance of P/S ratio.A huge sales figure does not necessarily convert to profits. Hence, considering a company's cash position along with its sales number can prove to be more prudent. Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow lend a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and investments.And that's what we're screening for today…Get the remaining stocks on the list and start putting this and other ideas to the test.

"n 2019 -- or possibly even this year -- wind power will become  power generation, and provide around 7% of the country's total electricity. The magnitude of that cannot be understated: It will be the first time since the late 1800s that hydroelectric power won't be the nation's most productive renewable energy source.Many stakeholders and technologies have played a role in this changing of the guard, but two companies in particular made incredible contributions:  (NYSE: NEE) and  (NASDAQ: XEL) . The pair of renewable utility holding companies ended 2017 with a combined 20.7 gigawatts of wind power in their generation mix. Throw in budding solar portfolios and their total renewable energy capacity tops 24 GW.Their exemplary commitment to clean power over the years makes NextEra Energy and Xcel Energy two of the best renewable energy stocks on the market. Hefty dividends of around 3% help, too. But if investors could only own one, which renewable stock would be the better buy right now?Image source: Getty Images.NextEra Energy has invested tens of billions of dollars in renewable energy over the decades, and that's bought a whole lot of wind turbines and solar panels. In fact, the company owns 16% of installed wind capacity in the United States and 11% of the nation's installed solar capacity -- the largest shares of each. And it's not stopping there. By the end of 2018 it expects to add up to 4.1 GW of wind and 1.3 GW of solar, representing capacity growth of 29% and 50%, respectively.The business got off to a great start this year thanks to steady growth from its  , the regulated utility Florida Power and Light and the competitive energy business NextEra Energy Resources. In the first quarter of 2018, NextEra Energy delivered adjusted EPS of $1.94, compared to $1.75 in the year-ago period. Management reiterated its full-year 2018 guidance, calling for adjusted EPS of $7.45 to $7.95 and longer-term expectations for that to grow 6% to 8% annually through 2021. data by That would already rank among the best growth rates in the industry, and it's built on the continued expansion of clean (ultra-efficient natural gas) and renewable (wind and solar) assets. In late May NextEra Energy acquired Gulf Power and Florida City Gas for $6.5 billion to expand its empire in the Sunshine State. It already serves 5 million paying customers in Florida, who enjoy monthly electric bills that are 30% below the national average. The company expects to extend the same operational efficiency to its newest 600,000 customers, while adding $0.15 and $0.20 to adjusted EPS in 2020 and 2021, respectively.Meanwhile, the core business has begun its next phase of expansion: solar power and energy storage. Florida Power and Light commissioned 600 MW of new solar capacity, including the largest solar-plus-storage operation in the United States, and filed plans for adding 3.2 GW of additional solar in the state in the coming years. NextEra Energy Resources added 667 MW of new wind projects to its backlog, in addition to 334 MW of solar. Its first solar-plus-storage project also commenced operations.Image source: Getty Images.On the other hand, Xcel Energy owns 6.7 GW of wind power situated along the American wind corridor, which runs down the center of the country and offers optimal potential for wind farms. That allows the company's wind assets to operate at capacity factors (the amount of time a generation asset runs at full capacity) of 45% to 50%, compared to the national average of 37%.Turns out the same geographic position helps most of the company's 1.4 GW of solar assets top the national averages, too. The company's photovoltaic installations operate at capacity factors of 22% (in North Dakota and Minnesota) to 34%, compared to the national average of 27%.The business turned in a solid performance in the first quarter of 2018, although investors wouldn't know it judging by the share price. The stock has struggled since the end of 2017, and is now mired in its longest and deepest rut in the last five years. At any rate, Xcel Energy delivered EPS of $0.57 in the first quarter of the year, compared to just $0.47 in the year-ago period. Management also reaffirmed its full-year 2018 guidance calling for EPS of $2.37 to $2.47.While the year-over-year EPS gain can be explained by a lower tax bill in the first quarter of 2018, Xcel Energy has ambitious growth plans in the years ahead. It expects to grow EPS 5% to 6% annually, and tack on 5% to 7% per year to its dividend. That should be possible if the rate base increases from $24 billion in 2016 to $34.5 billion in 2022 as expected. As in the case of NextEra Energy, the company's utilities aim to accomplish that with a  (which will grow from providing just 5% of the rate base to 12% in that span) while keeping customer bills low.Image source: Getty Images.All right, so both NextEra Energy and Xcel Energy are leaders in renewable energy. They got there with wind power, and are looking to cement their positions with heavy expansions of solar assets in the coming years.But what metrics should investors focus on to begin differentiating the two renewable stocks?Well, as noted above, NextEra Energy expects to grow at a considerably faster annual clip than Xcel Energy for the foreseeable future -- the midpoint of their annual growth rates are 7% and 5.5%, respectively. That overshadows the latter's higher dividend and promises to help the larger renewable power company continue to extend its stock performance dominance over its smaller peer in the years ahead. While the two have graced shareholders with total returns of 244% and 220%, respectively, over the last decade, it hasn't even been close over the past five years.In fact, given its tumble over the last six months, Xcel Energy has only matched the total returns of the S&P 500.

" made an appeal to the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (""PUC"") for approval for the retirement of two coal power plants in Pueblo, which have a combined capacity of 660 megawatts (""MW""). Projecting higher demand in Denver metro-area in the coming years, Xcel Energy is planning to generate power from natural gas and wind as well as solar projects. The operations will be jointly owned by the the company and a third party.Xcel Energy plans to purchase 707 MW of solar power and 1,100 MW of wind power from third-party owners, subject to the approval of PUC. Xcel Energy intends to shut down coal units and replace them with clean generating sources, which will involve an expenditure of $2.5 billion, which will enable customer to save $215 million.Xcel Energy generates electricity through coal, natural gas, nuclear, other renewable, solar and wind energy sources. The company is planning to lower emission and is on track to reduce carbon emissions by 60 % by 2026 from 2005 levels.The company expects to generate nearly 55% of its electricity from renewable energy sources by 2026. Moreover, for emergency purpose the company also proposed to have three large scale battery projects to save powers on the grid. Two of these battery projects will be located in Pueblo.Over the last few years, dependency on fossil fuel is gradually declining. The U.S. coal industry has faced stringent environmental regulations. The need for an emission-less environment is pushing the industry toward renewable energy. Coal is the primary source of greenhouse gas emissions and thus Utilities are shifting to renewables and other clean sources to generate electricity.Per Energy Information Administration, wind generation will account for 6.4% and 6.9% of total utility-scale electricity generation in the United States in 2018 and 2019, respectively, up from 6.3% in 2017. Solar electricity generation was 211 gigawatt-hour/day (GWh/d) in 2017, which is likely to increase to 246 GWh/d in 2018 and 294 GWh/d in 2019.In the last three months, shares of Xcel Energy have lost 1.3%, narrower than the  's decline of 2.4%.Xcel Energy has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

"hile traders spend time chasing rumors and tips trying to capture quick profits in the stock market, in-the-know investors understand that this method of investing rarely pays off. Often, it turns what  be a profitable venture -- owning stocks -- into a money-loser. Smart investors know that a far easier method of investing also happens to work much better: Pay a good value for high-quality companies, and then sit on your hands. By investing in a basket of great companies for the long term, you get to participate in the growth of those businesses, which should result in increasing the value of your investment far better than trying to guess your way to riches.It gets even better with  , which can raise the payout regularly, further boosting your returns and making it easier to hold through the market's ups and downs. We asked three Motley Fool investors who know a thing or two about finding great dividend stocks to identify their top dividend stock ideas; they made compelling arguments for  (NYSE: BIP) ,  (NYSE: WM) , and  (NASDAQ: XEL) .In-the-know investors don't rely on rumors to make money. You shouldn't either. All three share a few powerful characteristics dividend investors should love: predictable, recurring revenues; minimal competition with high barriers to entry; and businesses that are in demand no matter what the economic environment. But that's just the tip of the iceberg. Keep reading about each company to learn whether it belongs in your portfolio. Finding solid companies is only part of the equation when it comes to identifying great long-term investments. After all, even great companies can sometimes operate in mediocre industries with minimal prospects for long-term growth -- and that can lead to mediocre returns. Take a great company that operates in an industry with big growth ahead, and you can get far better returns.And this is exactly what makes  in my book. First, it meets all of the qualities outlined above, operating many utility-like businesses around the world, often with local or regional monopolies, that generate steady year-round, any-economy cash flows. Second, it operates in many countries, giving it solid geographical diversity. Lastly, infrastructure is a massive global growth industry, and will require trillions of dollars in expansion to support the growth of urban population around the world (as in  more people) in coming decades.Brookfield Infrastructure is one of the best-positioned companies for investors to profit from this megatrend, as its management team has already demonstrated by delivering over 400% total returns since it went public, and doubling its stock's value over the past five years. data by  .As the stock is trading for less than 11.5 times trailing  and yields nearly 5% at recent prices, investors who buy now and hold for the long term should do incredibly well. Smart dividend investors know that a dividend is only as good as the earnings power of the company that pays it. That makes Waste Management's dividend particularly attractive. After all, as a garbage company, it deals with stuff that others produce but nobody wants anymore -- at least in its then-current form.Waste Management doesn't just deal with standard landfill trash; it also handles recycling services, and has the ability to turn landfill gas into energy for a greener way of generating power and fuel. That helps it diversify its revenue stream as companies adopt ""  "" policies, and other trash-reducing practices that would otherwise threaten its core business model.Its dividend right now sits at $0.465 per share per quarter, an amount it boosted by just over 9% earlier this year. data by  .That dividend represents a payout of less than 40% of the company's earnings, giving Waste Management room to continue increasing the dividend as its business grows over time. Speaking of that growth, Waste Management is expected to be able to boost earnings by a bit more than 12% annualized over the next five years, providing reason to believe the dividend hikes can continue.In addition to the covered and growing dividend, Waste Management trades at a reasonable valuation of around 19 times its expected 2018 earnings. That suggests that investors buying today are getting good value for their money, particularly if the company's earnings growth materializes as expected. That combination of dividend payment, growth, and a reasonable price makes Waste Management a dividend stock for in-the-know investors to consider owning. Although it seems to have been largely overlooked by investors, Xcel Energy is a must-know stock for anyone interested in renewable energy and dividends. Why? The company owns four regional utilities that are quickly moving toward a green future -- and powering a 3.3% dividend in the process.In 2005 just 3% of all electricity supplied by the company was sourced from wind or solar power. But that jumped to 23% in 2017 and could climb to 45% by 2027. The move toward clean energy will save tens of millions in operating expenses because wind and solar turbines don't require constant refueling, as do the soon-to-be-retired coal-fired power plants. That seemingly minor detail is a huge component powering  to grow both earnings per share and dividend payouts 5% to 7% per year for the foreseeable future.Image source: Getty Images.It promises to be a stable business and dividend for the long haul, too, as all revenue and profits are generated from regulated utilities. However, the growth plan and natural evolution of its power-generation portfolio both require the cooperation of state regulators. And right now, uncertainty regarding the cost of Xcel Energy's plan to  and replace them with a combination of wind, solar, energy storage, and natural gas has weighed on the stock.While investors are still awaiting the decision from regulators to determine the ultimate cost of the proposed Colorado Energy Plan, the company's long history in the state and willing compliance with its aggressive renewable energy targets (some of the strictest in the nation) bode well for a palatable outcome for shareholders. Knowing that, the stock's recent slide seems like a great opportunity for long-term investors.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"t may not be seen as a leader in renewable energy, but Colorado has quietly become one of the most ambitious states in the Lower 48 when it comes to modernizing its electric grid. It was the first state to adopt a Renewable Energy Standard for its electricity consumption by referendum. It also has the second-strictest 2020 targets of any state, mandating that investor-owned utilities generate 30% of their power from renewable sources -- and that 3% of that must come from distributed generation, such as rooftop solar. (NASDAQ: XEL) , which owns one of two investor-owned utilities in the state, has already exceeded the 30% target. But it knows even more ambitious standards are coming in the not-too-distant future. That's why it's proposed an ambitious new power plan to the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) that would allow the company to generate 55% of its power in the state from renewables by 2026. It would also double the company's current total solar capacity.The new power plan has implications for all stakeholders, including shareholders. That's because Xcel Energy's Colorado subsidiary is responsible for 40% of its total rate base revenue and 39% of its annual earnings per share. A decision from the CPUC is expected by fall 2018. Here's what investors need to know.Image source: Getty Images.Xcel Energy is considered a  today. It owns 6.7 gigawatts of wind power capacity, delivers 9% of the country's total wind power generation, and pays a 3.3% dividend. While it plans to further its  , it wants to become a leader in the future of solar energy, too. Both should be possible -- and Colorado is an important proving ground.A sliver of the  , home to the country's most powerful wind potential, catches the eastern edges of Colorado, and that's all it needs. Xcel Energy's wind assets in the state operate at 45% capacity, well ahead of the national average of 36.7%. The state is also generously situated to capture some of the country's best solar potential. The company's solar assets in the state operate at 30% capacity, again better than the national average of 27%.That (and  and solar) makes Xcel Energy's ambitious Colorado Energy Plan quite possible at the technical level. It still needs regulatory approval to proceed, however. Here's what it has proposed to CPUC together with a group of stakeholders:Let's break that down further. The first three points concern grid reliability and commitment to the state's long-term Renewable Energy Standard, while the last two concern financial aspects for the regulated utility and its pledge to keep customers' utility bills stable.So how has the proposal been received to date? When Xcel Energy's utility first presented its portfolio to CPUC, the state authority balked at the idea that 2,400 MW of new power generation was needed after retiring the coal assets. It asked the utility to come back with portfolios totalling 750 MW and 1,100 MW, well below the net additions of up to 1,740 MW in the original proposal. Investors have yet to learn the generation mix of the two smaller proposals, but lower installed capacities could impact the rates (and revenues) achieved over time.CPUC also asked the utility to submit a scenario that didn't reduce the Renewable Energy Standard rider to pay for the accelerated depreciation of the coal assets. On one hand, it makes sense that Colorado wouldn't want to halve the money flowing into programs aimed at bolstering renewable energy in the state. On the other hand, regulators and voters may want to consider the value provided by taking coal power plants offline sooner than expected.As far as investors are concerned, it means Xcel Energy's Colorado Energy Plan could end up being a lot smaller and a little more expensive than originally envisioned. Although no decisions have been finalized just yet, one thing investors do know is that the CPUC rebuttal pushed back the decision timeframe from ""summer 2018"" to ""fall 2018"" in investor presentations. The additional uncertainty has kept the stock constrained around $45 per share this year, and delayed the most important near-term catalyst for the company.Image source: Getty Images.Uncertainty is never good for a stock, and right now Xcel Energy's Colorado Energy Plan faces multiple sources of it.The back and forth between the utility and regulators is par for the course, so this in and of itself isn't a huge concern for shareholders yet. But the CPUC request for smaller portfolios could impact revenues generated in the future, while disallowing the accelerated depreciation mechanism proposed could make the Colorado Power Plan more expensive for Xcel Energy.Right now investors don't know whether or not Xcel Energy will be able to add its most ambitious dose of renewable energy to the grid, but even the smaller portfolios should include a healthy amount of renewable energy. More information will be handed down soon, as the utility expects to file an updated proposal by the end of May. One thing is certain: This is the most important near-term catalyst for the stock, so investors will want to pay close attention to upcoming events.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

 filed an application with the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada to increase statewide overall general rate of $32.5 million including the benefit of reduced tax liability associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 for its Nevada service areas. Through this rate increase filing, the company intends to recoup the capital investment made since the last rate filing in April 2012 in Nevada as well as for the planned capital investment going ahead.The previous rate hike came into effect from November 2012, which raised the company's annual revenues by $7 million, lower than the filing rate hike of $26.9 million. Since the last rate filing in Nevada, the company's total investment amounted to nearly $2,402.4 million for customer support, enhancement and replacement of gas infrastructure across all its three service territories, namely Arizona, California and Nevada.The company also received an approval for its planned proposal to expand its natural gas services to Mesquite, NV. The expansion approval calls for a capital investment of approximately $28 million, for construction of 17 miles of approach main and 20 miles of distribution pipelines.Companies distributing natural gas require a huge amount of capital spending to fund infrastructure needs. Over the past decade, the company's expenditure to build, replace and upgrade its aging infrastructure has increased.The company is expected to incur a capital expenditure of nearly $2 billion over the period of 2018-2020 and estimates to recover 63% of the annual investment within a year's time. It included a capital expenditure on replacement of 6,700 miles of vintage pipelines.The company is the largest distributor of natural gas in Nevada by serving the Las Vegas metropolitan area and Northern Nevada. At the end of 2017, the company had more than two million residential, commercial, industrial and other natural gas customers, of which, almost 0.75 million are based in Nevada alone. Also, the company derived 35% of the total operating margin in 2017 from Nevada.Nevada does not have significant amount of natural gas resources and hence, producing only a limited amount of the demand required in the region. Nearly, 88% of the total energy consumed in Nevada comes from outside the state.Per U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), in 2016, 73% of the electricity generated in Nevada came from natural gas. This demand for natural gas is greater than the usual supply in Nevada. Plus, three of five households use natural gas as the primary source of energy for home heating fuel. Therefore, this rise in requirement for natural gas in the region calls for more capital investment as well as exploration of growth opportunities for companies like Southwest Gas.In the last six months, the Southwest Gas stock has gained 12.8%, outperforming its  's rise of 6.8%.Southwest Gas carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

nvestors often fail to consider sales growth as a dependable metric when it comes to selecting stocks. This might be because of their preconceived notion that a company's price performance is typically sensitive to its earnings momentum. But betting on stocks depending totally on such a perception may not prove worthwhile.It's worth keeping in mind that in cases when companies incur a loss, albeit transitorily, they are valued on revenues and not earnings, as top-line growth (or decline) usually reflects a company's future earnings performance. Notably, in contrast with price to earnings and price to book value ratios, which can turn negative and cease to be relevant, the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is available even for firms that have hit choppy waters.Also, a company can improve earnings by resorting to expense saving measures while maintaining stable revenues. However, superior profits could be achieved through continued revenue growth.Further, earnings and book value are largely influenced by several factors including accounting decisions tied with depreciation, significant charges and inventory. But there are limited opportunities to manipulate sales, which further underscores the importance of P/S ratio.A huge sales figure does not necessarily convert to profits. Hence, considering a company's cash position along with its sales number can prove to be more prudent. Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow lend a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and investments.In order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected  and  as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy. This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company's revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales. Better-than-industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in stock price. Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs, an optimal situation for the company. This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.

" announced that it has acquired Safari Energy LLC, a leading provider of solar energy solutions. Safari Energy provides a turnkey solution to its customers, starting from financing their projects to designing, engineering and construction.The company management did not divulge details about the purchase consideration but expects this acquisition to be accretive to its earnings immediately. However, the acquisition is not expected to make a meaningful contribution to the company's earnings per share till 2020.With the buyout of Safari Energy, the company would be able to avail of low-risk opportunity in renewable & clean energy segment. The acquisition would enable it to diversify its revenue components and the customer base. The transaction would help PPL Corporation gain expertise in turnkey projects for serving clients, who need support right from the project's seed funding till its construction and completion.The company planned to replace its Kentucky's coal fired generation plant over time with a mix of renewables and natural gas. It expects to incur approximately $15.41 billion of capital investment over the 2018-2022 period and projects to recover nearly 80% of the annual investment within a year, thereby lending a clear visibility to its earnings growth.Per U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the source of energy from renewables increased over the years. Of 55% of the total energy generated, nearly 21 gigawatt (GW) added in the United States during 2017, was from a renewable source. Also, 22% of the total electricity generation in the United States comes from a renewable source as of Feb 2018.In 2017, electricity generation from solar resources touched nearly 77 million megawatthours (MWH) in the United States and by 2018 end, EIA expects an additional 5,067 MW of solar power to come online. According to the forecast, solar capacity is anticipated to grow by 127 gigawatt (GW) from 2020 to 2050. Also, electricity generation will likely account for nearly 14% of the total energy output to be generated during the same period.Per Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), the consistent growth over the years across some of the renewable energy sources is attributable to U.S. federal policies. Electricity generation from solar enjoys a special Federal Solar Tax Credit, scheduled to expire by 2022. This tax credit has enabled the growth of solar power generation companies as the credit allowed to power generators is transferred to end users via lower solar prices.Since the release of the news, shares of PPL Corporation have lost 1.3% compared with its  's decline of 1.9%.PPL Corporation currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see Some better-ranked stocks from the same industry are as follows:CMS Energy Corporation  holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

"hings are moving fast in renewable energy.  fast. Consider that in 2008 wind farms supplied just 1.5% of all electricity in the United States. But by 2019 wind power is expected to contribute 6.9% of American electricity and overtake hydropower as the top renewable energy source.The rise of wind power wouldn't have been possible without two companies in particular, which combine to own 20.7 gigawatts of wind capacity, or about 24% of the country's total. Investors wouldn't be surprised to learn that clean energy provider  is one of the renewable energy stocks  . However, the relatively unheard of natural gas and electric utility  (NASDAQ: XEL) doesn't seem to garner nearly the same level of attention. Overlooking it could be a mistake.With 10-year total returns of 226% and plans to grow its dividend and EPS at annual clips of 5% to 7% -- all while investing billions in new wind and solar capacity -- it could be the best renewable energy stock you've never heard of.Image source: Getty Images.One look at Xcel Energy's geographic footprint shows why it's a leading player in wind power. All of its operations are located in the American wind corridor from the Dakotas to West Texas. The region is home to the majority of the  , including all of the company's 6.7 GW.That will make it a lot easier to reach the long-term goals to shift its generation mix away from fossil fuels and toward renewable energy. Consider how the company's generation mix has changed and is expected to change over time:
  
Source: Company presentation.Early retirements of coal-fired power plants and pouring billions into renewable energy have reduced Xcel's carbon emissions 35% from 2005 to 2017. Using 2005 as a baseline, Xcel Energy is targeting 50% reductions in carbon emissions by 2022 and greater than 60% by 2027. The next phase will be driven by $4.25 billion of investment into renewables between this year and 2022. Most of it will fund over 3 GW of new wholly owned wind capacity, boosting the company's total installed capacity 46%.It's all part of the ""steel for fuel"" strategy. The idea is simple: Xcel Energy will replace perpetual fuel expenses from traditional power sources, such as coal, with ""steel in the ground"" for wind turbines, which don't require fuel inputs once installed. The company's advantageous position in the American wind corridor and the installation of highly efficient turbines have already proven the strategy. Fuel expense fell from 44% of electric revenue in 2013 to less than 39% in 2017. It was a win-win for shareholders and the company's electric utility customers: average monthly bills dropped from $83.52 to $81 in that span.Image source: Getty Images.When combined with rate increases from state regulators, lower fuel expenses helped to boost Xcel Energy's net income 17% from 2013 to 2017. That's despite revenue growth of just 4.5% in the period. In fact, renewable energy investments have allowed the company to grow EPS at a compound annual growth rate of 5.9% from 2005 to 2017. The dividend has grown 6.3% annually from 2013 to 2018.That track record should give investors confidence that the company can deliver on its goals of growing EPS 5% to 6% per year and the dividend 5% to 7% per year. And in case investors aren't convinced, fuel expenses are projected to fall to just 28% of electric revenue by 2027, freeing even more cash flow for reinvestment into the business or redistribution to shareholders.Similarly, Xcel Energy's renewable energy leadership should provide confidence in its ability to deliver on the next phase of the growth plan, from 2022 onward, which includes a stronger focus on solar power and energy storage. Right now, however, the focus is on the nearer term.The main focus is on an upcoming decision from state regulators in Colorado on the company's proposal to shutter 660 MW of coal and replace it with 1 GW of new wind, 700 MW of solar, and another 700 MW of natural gas or energy storage. If given the green light in summer 2018, then Xcel Energy will have no remaining question marks surrounding its current investment plan that runs through 2022. The stock could respond well to the added certainty.Image source: Getty Images.Xcel Energy has largely flown under the radar in discussions of renewable energy stocks, but that's no fault of the company. The predominantly electric utility is a shining example of how companies can lead the United States to a clean energy future -- and proving that it can be a profitable endeavor. A healthy 3.3% dividend (and growing), falling operating expenses, and a long-term history of beating the total returns of the S&P 500 show that this renewable energy stock is worth a closer look at the very least -- and maybe even a spot in your portfolio.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the iShares MSCI USA ESG Optimized ETF (Symbol: ESGU), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $65.11 per unit.With ESGU trading at a recent price near $59.40 per unit, that means that analysts see 9.61% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of ESGU's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Campbell Soup Co (Symbol: CPB), Colgate-Palmolive Co. (Symbol: CL), and Xcel Energy Inc (Symbol: XEL). Although CPB has traded at a recent price of $34.62/share, the average analyst target is 32.60% higher at $45.90/share. Similarly, CL has 15.33% upside from the recent share price of $62.14 if the average analyst target price of $71.67/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting XEL to reach a target price of $48.25/share, which is 10.64% above the recent price of $43.61.

ydropower emerged as a dependable way to illuminate American cities in the late 1880s. Not much has changed in 2018; in fact, hydroelectric dams have been the largest source of renewable electricity generation in the United States for over 100 years. But that's all about to change.A combination of decommissioning of older hydroelectric dams and cumulative investments of over $145 billion in the last decade will combine to knock hydropower into the number two spot in the rankings by 2019 -- to be replaced by wind power.  is expected to continue for the foreseeable future, promising to make the change permanent. Here's how individual investors can take advantage.Image source: Getty Images.According to  by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, hydropower is projected to account for about 6.5% of American electricity generation in 2018 and 6.6% in 2019. There's some wiggle room since hydroelectric dam output depends on annual water runoff volumes in various regions, but barring below- or above-average rainfall those are reasonable estimates.Soon enough, not even higher water runoff will be able to keep hydropower in the top spot. According to the EIA, wind power is projected to account for 6.4% of American electricity generation this year, and to overtake hydropower with 6.9% in 2019. The expectations for continued steady growth come on the heels of an estimated 16.3 GW of new capacity installations in the next two years, which will push total American wind capacity to over 104 GW.The expansion has been possible due to a mix of technology and economics. The latest wind turbines are more efficient at producing power, which means 1 GW installed today is more valuable than 1 GW installed a decade ago. New analytics software can even boost the output of older generation assets.From an economics perspective, a healthy tax credit on production provides predictable cash flow for years after project completion. Meanwhile, wind farm owners have figured out they can actually  electricity costs over time compared to, say, coal power plants since they don't need to purchase fuel. While many companies have caught on to wind power's potential, two companies in particular have been leading the charge.Image source: Getty Images.After dropping a cumulative $23.6 billion on wind power-generating assets over the years,  (NYSE: NEE) is the undisputed king of low-carbon utilities. It's the largest owner of wind capacity in North America, making up roughly 16% of America's total with 14 GW installed. That number could jump as much as 4.1 GW by the end of this year depending on project completion dates.The company's  has certainly paid off for shareholders, who have been treated to 10-year total returns of 235% -- well ahead of the  's 135%. In 2017 NextEra Energy generated 55% of its total net income from NextEra Energy Resources, which uses no-carbon sources for 94% of its installed generation capacity. That included a big one-time boost from tax reform, but even without the interest deduction it would have been a record year of profitability.Given the company's healthy operating cash flow and plans to invest another $40 billion across its assets (not just wind) between now and 2020, investors should expect NextEra Energy stock to continue running laps around the broader market.Image source: Getty Images.While NextEra Energy is far and away the largest owner of wind capacity, second-place  (NASDAQ: XEL) is furiously investing in new generation. The utility owns about 6.7 GW of wind capacity and delivered roughly 9% of the country's total electricity supplied from wind in 2017. But it's not stopping there.Xcel Energy is undertaking an ambitious program to gradually replace coal production capacity with renewable energy. The goal: reduce coal capacity from 7 GW in 2016 to just 4.4 GW by 2027. The first phase of the initiative is well under way, and will see the company boost wind capacity 46% by 2021. If all goes according to the long-term plan, then the utility will go from generating 56% of its power from coal in 2005 to just 20% in 2027. Renewables -- mostly wind -- will jump from 3% to 47% in the same span.Once again, heavy reliance on wind power has proven lucrative for shareholders. Xcel Energy stock has essentially matched the total returns of NextEra Energy in the last decade at 229%. The business has grown EPS from $1.95 in 2013 to $2.30 in 2017, and is expecting $2.42 at the midpoint of full-year 2018 guidance.That has allowed the company to grow its dividend at a compound annual rate of return of 6.5% in that span. It yields a healthy 3.5% today. Given plans to continue growing low-cost wind power generation for the next decade at least, this renewable stock figures to continue creating value for shareholders.Image source: Getty Images.Wind power's overnight rise has been pretty remarkable. In a span of just 11 years, from 2008 to 2018, it will go from generating only 1.5% of total U.S. electricity to 6.5%. No wonder the top wind power stocks have crushed the market.That said, there's a long way to go before clean power sources dominate the American electric grid. In 2017 fossil fuels accounted for 62.7% of all power generation. Nuclear (the ugly duckling of clean power) contributed 20%, while all other renewables combined for just 17.1%. Then again, that just means there will be plenty of renewable energy opportunities for investors for the foreseeable future.

The S&P 500 index is off its highs for the year and currently remains barely in positive territory, while the Technology-heavy Nasdaq composite is up +2.1% in the year-to-date period.Stock market investing is no doubt a risky venture, and even well-thought out investment strategies at times fail to generate desired returns. Against this backdrop, let us focus on the domestic-focused, capital-intensive utility stocks that assure investors steady performance and regular dividend yields. Utility stocks are subject to heavy regulation, both at the federal and state levels. Utilities are known for stability and visibility of earnings and cash flow.Utilities, aside from investing in generating plants that produce electricity with low and negligible amounts of emissions, are also focused in improving and upgrading transmission and distribution networks. They are also investing in power storage facilities and guiding investors for efficient usage of electricity. We expect more battery storage units to be installed across the U.S. due to increasing production of electricity from renewable sources and support to the power grid.Utilities are also undertaking long-term plans to shift transmission lines underground in weather-sensitive areas to lower chances of power outages. The introduction of smart meters are helping users make efficient use of electricity.Natural gas utilities depend on pipelines to deliver their product to end users. Water utilities are also required to upgrade and replace old pipelines and water mains. The utilities are using the latest technology to upgrade and maintain their existing infrastructure to increase reliability of their services.  (XEL) received approval from Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to use drones beyond their operators' vision to survey transmission lines and perform other operations that require consistent monitoring.So, to upgrade and strengthen the existing infrastructure, utilities depend on capital markets. Though regulated utilities are cash generators, the funds generated from internal sources are not sufficient to carry out long-term projects. The rate-sensitive, capital-intensive utility stocks also had to accommodate the Fed rate hike.The rise in interest cost will no doubt increase cost of capital for utilities and might limit their ability to pay dividends and buy back shares. These developments could lower the attractiveness of utilities, and investors might turn to bonds as an alternative source of investment.However, utilities across the United States have gained from the implementation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act from January 2018. Utility operators decided to pass on the benefits to their customers, and the majority of them have enjoyed a decline in monthly bills.The unemployment rate in the United States was static at a historical low of 4.1% for the last six months. In addition, the United States Building Permits increased 4.4% in March 2018 to 1,379 thousand. The new permits had exceeded the U.S. building permit average of 1355.99 thousand from 1960 to 2018. All these factors indicate an increase in demand for residential utility services.All other industries depend on utilities for the basic requirements of electricity, gas and water. The ongoing growth will result in higher demand from industrial, commercial and residential space for utility services and boost its performance.In August 2015, President Obama introduced the Clean Power Plan to lower carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions levels from electricity generation by around 32% by 2030 from the 2005 levels. President Trump has taken steps toward repealing the Clean Power Plan. Trump believes that such plans will make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive in the global markets. This new development will help in running the coal-fired electricity generation units for a longer period than previously expected.The U.S. Energy Information Administration (""EIA"") estimates that U.S. energy-related CO2 emissions declined by 861 million metric tons or nearly 14% from 2005 to 2017. EIA now projects that carbon dioxide emissions will rise 1.8% from 5,143 million metric tons in 2017 to 5,237 million metric tons in 2018, primarily due to an increase in coal usage in power plants. In 2019, energy-related CO2 emissions will be about 13% lower than 2005 levels.However, utilities are focusing overall on sources of fuel that help to lower emission levels. Large solar power plants and extensive development of wind farms are indicating a shift in preferences relating to fuel sources among utilities. We notice that utility operators like  (NEE) and  (DUK) have already invested and plan to spend more on creating green energy generation portfolio.Within the  classification, utilities are a stand-alone sector, one of 16 Zacks sectors. The rural wire-line telephone companies are also grouped within the Zacks Utility sector, but the three major industries within this sector include Electric Power, Gas Distribution and Water Supply.We rank the 265 sub-industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry. We put our industries in two groups - the top half (industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank). Over the last 10 years, using a one-week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than two to one. To learn more visit: About  .)Two out of three industries related to the utility sector - Gas Distribution, Electric Power and Water Supply - fall into the first group, having the Zacks Industry Rank of #81, #110 and #232, respectively.Our present outlook for the utility sector is positive, with two major industries placed in the first group of the Zacks Industry Rank.The valuation of the sector (Considering Gas Distribution, Water Supply and Electric Power industry) looks attractive at present. The Water Supply industry is currently trading at 19.4X forward 12-month EPS estimates, the Gas Distribution industry is trading at 20.7X while the Electric Power industry is trading at 13.4X compared with the S&P 500 trading average of 17.5X.The current 20.7x multiple for Gas Distribution companies compares to the five-year range of 17.2X to 24.6X (median of 20.5X) while the 19.4X multiple for Water Utilities compares to the five-year multiple range from a low of 12.4X to a high of 23.3X (median of 18.7X). The current 13.4X multiple for Electric Utilities compares to a five-year range of 11.4X to 16.2X (median of 13.5X).The above study shows that the current multiples are within the five-year ranges, but trading above their historic median level (except Electric Power), offering some room for an increase from the current levels.First-quarter earnings in the utility space (till Apr 25, 2018) were up 7.7%. Utilities gained from favorable weather in the first quarter, while tax reforms and ongoing infrastructure spending helped the utilities.We expect cost control, new electric rates and customer growth will help the utility sector to come up with earnings growth in the first-quarter reporting cycle. First-quarter earnings from the utility sector are expected to improve 12.5% on the back of revenue growth of 0.4%.The defensive  sector's earnings for first quarter 2018 are expected to improve 13.9%, on the back of revenue growth of 1.4%.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility Portfolio Experiences Big Outflow@2018-05-01@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/powershares-sp-500-low-volatility-portfolio-experiences-big-outflow-2018-05-01

"nvestors in Xcel Energy Inc (Symbol: XEL) saw new options become available this week, for the December 21st expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 240 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the XEL options chain for the new December 21st contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $40.00 strike price has a current bid of 85 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $40.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $39.15 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of XEL, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $45.78/share today.Because the $40.00 strike represents an approximate 13% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 90%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of XEL stock at the current price level of $45.78/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $50.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 11.29% if the stock gets called away at the December 21st expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if XEL shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Xcel Energy Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing XEL's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $50.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $50.00 strike represents an approximate 9% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

nvestors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and  may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Xcel Energy is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings - with the most up-to-date information possible - is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for XEL in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 52 cents per share for XEL, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 51 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for XEL, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +1.11% heading into earnings season.A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises and outperforming the market.

"he Q1 earnings season is set to cross its half way mark by the end of this week. So far, earnings and revenue growth rates and the proportion of positive earnings surprises are above historical levels.Total earnings for the 87 S&P members that have released results as of Apr 20, improved 25% year over year on 10.7% higher revenues. The beat ratio for the bottom line was 82.8%, while that for the top line was 67.8%.Notably, we expect total Q1 earnings for the index members to rise 18.3% from the year-ago period on 7.7% higher revenues. At present, 14 out of the 16 sectors in the Zacks universe are expected to witness an improvement in earnings.Amid this backdrop, let's see how the  sector is poised for this earnings season. Earnings from the utility space are expected to improve 12.4% in the first quarter. (For more details check out our latest  )Utility business is known for stability and visibility of earnings and cash flow, with the primary growth driver being consistent demand for electricity and utility services. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (""EIA"") predicted that annual average U.S. residential electricity price will increase 2.6% in 2018. Thus the sector is expected to tread on a growth trajectory.Therefore, staying invested in fundamentally strong and domestic-focused utility stocks will provide investors with steady returns. Currently, the sector is undergoing a transition, wherein the primary fuel source - coal - is being replaced by natural gas and renewables.However, utility stocks are subject to stringent regulations, both at the federal and state levels. Moreover, being capital intensive in nature, higher interest rates dent the growth of these stocks. In March 2018, the Federal Reserve raised rates for the sixth time since December 2015 when the Federal Open Market Committee began increasing rates from near zero. This is likely to have a negative impact on the sector.Nevertheless, to maintain their performance level, utilities are undertaking cost-savings initiatives, modernizing transmission and distribution lines, upgrading infrastructure and focusing on renewable energy to generate electricity. Further, new electric rates and customer growth will help the sector to witness improvement in earnings in the first quarter.The quarter was also a witness to a colder-than-normal winter in most parts of the United States. Utilities are likely to benefit from this as it will drive heating expenditures for households, boosting the companies' earnings.However, earnings projections for the sector hint at an unimpressive quarter, when compared to its Q4 performance.The sector's earnings are likely to improve 12% on in-line year-over-year revenues.

Expecting this trend to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for American Electric's first-quarter revenue estimate of $3.74 billion shows an annual decline of 4.9%.However, lower tax rates, courtesy of the latest tax reform, is expected to boost American Electric's quarterly bottom line.Per our proven model, a stock is likely to beat earnings estimate if it has a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).

 is expected to deliver a positive earnings surprise in first-quarter 2018, before the market opens, on Apr 26. This utility reported a negative earnings surprise of 2.33% in the last quarter.Our proven model shows that Xcel Energy is likely to beat estimates because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive  (which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate) and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates, and Xcel Energy has the right mix. : Earnings ESP is pegged at +1.11%.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . |  : Xcel Energy carries a Zacks Rank #2. The combination of Xcel Energy's favorable Zacks Rank and a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of a positive surprise this season.Conversely, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.For the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Xcel Energy's revenues is pegged at $2,932 million, indicating a sequential increase of 4.9%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is 51 cents, reflecting sequential growth of 21.4%.Xcel Energy is expected to continue benefiting from ongoing improvement in the economic condition in its service territories. The upward revision in both electric and natural gas customers is expected to have a positive impact on demand.Continuous improvement in productivity through technology has lowered Xcel Energy's O&M expenses. We expect the company's initiative to keep O&M expenses flat, boosting margins in the first and coming quarters.In addition to Xcel Energy, here are a few more players from the  that have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.CenterPoint Energy Inc.  is expected to release first-quarter results on May 4, 2018. It has an Earnings ESP of +0.59% and a Zacks Rank #1.Vistra Energy Corp.  is anticipated to release first-quarter results on May 4, 2018.

 .  is scheduled to release first-quarter 2018 results before the opening bell on Apr 24. Last quarter, this utility reported a negative earnings surprise of 4.6%. Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Management expects NextEra Energy's performance in the first half of 2018 to be softer in comparison to second half results. The company expects its subsidiary Florida Power & Light Company's (FPL) performance to be lower than expected, as tax savings will not immediately offset its typical reserve amortization requirements. This is going to have an adverse impact on earnings in the first quarter.In January 2018, FPL announced its plans to apply federal tax savings toward the Hurricane Irma restoration cost of $1.3 billion. Otherwise, it would have increased utility bills of 4.9 million customers in the first quarter of 2018.However, the economy of Florida remains sturdy, with its current unemployment rate below the national average. Plus, new building permits indicate customer additions and an increase in demand from the residential space.Our proven model does not conclusively show that NextEra Energy is likely to beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

" .  received the approval from Federal Aviation Administration (""FAA"") to use drones beyond the operators' vision and utilize them to survey the transmission lines and perform other operations that require consistent monitoring.Over the past three years, Xcel Energy is using drones in their coal-fired plants to inspect equipments. In 2017, the company got the approval from FAA to use them for power lines inspection, within the operator's vision. Following the approval, Xcel Energy will deploy the drones for the survey of their transmission line in Denver area. The company plans to seek further permission from FAA to inspect its 320,000 miles of electricity and natural gas infrastructure located in different regions.Xcel Energy operates in eight Western and Midwestern States. Half of the states are tornado prone areas. The electric transmission and distribution lines as well as natural gas pipelines are expected to be weather resistant. Proper maintenance and repair of infrastructure enables the company to provide 24x7 services amid difficult climatic conditions. Drones ensure early detection of faults and damages of the electric transmission and distribution lines, which lower chances of outages and increase reliability of services.However, the drones will not replace previous modes of inspection and detection. The company believes that drones have advantages over trucks, helicopters or fixed-wing aircraft. The inspection of lines will be completed at a faster pace and lower related costs, which will benefit consumers.Utility companies are investing regularly to provide safe, clean and reliable service to customers. Additionally, the companies are adopting new technologies to maintain and inspect their expansive infrastructure. Usages of drones are yet to become common among all utility service providers in the United States. However, we have seen FirstEnergy Corporation  and PPL Corporation  among others to use drones for the maintenance of infrastructure.Considering the advantage of drones over traditional methods of inspection and maintenance of essential electrical infrastructure, we expect to witness increasing usage of the same among other providers as well.In the last 12 months, shares of Xcel Energy have returned 4.7% compared with its  's rise of 2.3%.Xcel Energy has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Investors can consider CenterPoint Energy  from the same space, which flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). CenterPoint delivered an average earnings surprise of 11.50% in the trailing four quarters.

 recently announced that Florida Power & Light Company (FPL) has signed a seven-year contract renewal for managed services, purchases of new Gen5 hardware and professional services.The renewal of the deal follows FPL's contract award to Silver Spring Networks, Inc.  in 2007 before its acquisition by Itron. This contract involved the deployment of Silver Spring's wireless IPv6 mesh networking technology, as well as management and control software to connect and control FPL's meters.Under the renewal contract, FPL will deploy Itron's new Gen5 network hardware and 2,100 new automated feeder switches which will help the former in achieving its network reliability targets. In addition, FPL will replace 1,000 radios from the legacy Distribution Automation systems with Gen5 bridges. | Notably, FPL will restructure the Itron Distributed Automation system in order to provide end-to-end IP connectivity for greater security and higher network performance. On the other hand, Itron will provide managed services to FPL, ensuring reliable, predictable software delivery, operations and upgrades.The FPL contract will contribute to Itron's backlog.

This utility reported positive earnings surprise in the last four quarters with an average surprise of 6.04%.Our proven model shows that FirstEnergy is likely to beat estimates because it has the right combination of two key ingredients.

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the First Trust Large Cap Core AlphaDEX Fund ETF (Symbol: FEX), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $65.61 per unit.With FEX trading at a recent price near $59.91 per unit, that means that analysts see 9.52% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of FEX's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are PVH Corp (Symbol: PVH), Atmos Energy Corp. (Symbol: ATO), and Xcel Energy Inc (Symbol: XEL). Although PVH has traded at a recent price of $140.49/share, the average analyst target is 10.48% higher at $155.21/share. Similarly, ATO has 9.99% upside from the recent share price of $79.46 if the average analyst target price of $87.40/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting XEL to reach a target price of $46.78/share, which is 9.52% above the recent price of $42.71. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of PVH, ATO, and XEL:Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
  
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Look Under The Hood: FEX Has 10% Upside@2018-03-08@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/look-under-hood-fex-has-10-upside-2018-03-08

egulated utilities that thought the recently passed corporate tax cut would result in a profit windfall may be in for a big surprise. The first salvo in what is likely to become a barrage came when Montana regulators asked  's (NYSE: NWE) NorthWestern Energy utility to come up with a proposal for how it will use its tax reduction to benefit customers.Wyoming's regulators have also brought up the topic,  and we could soon see widespread pressure for regulated utilities across the country to cut customers significant breaks that parallel the one the companies received from the Republican tax overhaul. It's possible that the tax cut won't benefit many utility companies or their investors at all.Image source: Getty Images.Regulated utilities aren't just regulated in the sense that the government watches over what they do: Their returns are regulated, too. So, when they get a big boost to their margins -- as they will now that Congress has cut the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% -- the resulting higher profits cause state regulators to take notice.Since utilities and regulators had set power rates to provide what they viewed as a reasonable profitability level based on the previous 35% tax rate, it makes sense that regulators would want to modify rates now.But the benefit to customers may not come back solely in the form of rate cuts; companies may be allowed to make greater investments in energy access or safety, depending on where utilities and regulators jointly conclude the funds are needed. Montana's regulators didn't specifically demand lower rates: They gave the utility discretion to make a proposal, though it will have to show it's using the money to benefit customers.So windfalls probably aren't coming, and whatever changes result from the corporate tax cut, the benefits may not make their way to utility shareholders.Below, I pulled the returns for utility stocks NorthWestern,  (NYSE: XEL) , and  (NYSE: SO) . They all generally tracked the  's return from October to mid December, but when the Republican tax bill passed, their share prices fell off a cliff. data by  .It's not certain that the drop was due to utilities having to adjust their return expectations because of the tax law, but the timing of the synchronized tumble suggests that investors were adjusting their expectations based on its anticipated impact.Beyond the fact that the tax windfall may not be as big as utilities hoped, these companies are dealing with growing threats to their business models. The advent of cost-effective rooftop solar power systems has allowed large numbers of customers to produce their own electricity. In 2018, we'll likely see more economical energy storage add to utilities' difficulties by allowing commercial and residential customers to lower their bills despite the dynamic pricing and other rate structures put in place by utilities to combat the advance of the solar energy industry.There's just no reason to think that regulated utilities will increase profits in the long term as these threats become more mature and widespread. So, if their short-term profitability outlook isn't great either, it's not a good sign for utility stocks.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"he fourth-quarter earnings season has crossed the half way mark. So far, the results reflect a favorable trend, with an above-average proportion of companies beating top- and bottom-line expectations.Total earnings for the 251 S&P members that have released results as of Feb 2, improved 16% year over year on 10.5% higher revenues. The beat ratio for the bottom line was 80.5%, while that for the top line was 78.1%.Notably, we expect total Q4 earnings to rise 13% from the year-ago period on 7.7% higher revenues. At present, 14 out of the 16 sectors in the Zacks coverage universe are expected to witness an improvement in earnings.Amid this backdrop, let us focus on  this earnings season. Earnings from the utility space are expected to improve 5.5% in the fourth quarter. Read more details in our weekly  .Utility business is known for stability and visibility of earnings and cash flow, with the primary growth driver being consistent demand for electricity and utility services. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (""EIA"") predicted that annual average U.S. residential electricity price will increase 2.6% in 2018.Therefore, staying invested in fundamentally strong and domestic-focused utility stocks assure investors a steady performance and regular dividends.However, utility stocks remain subject to heavy regulation, both at the federal and state levels. Moreover, being capital intensive in nature, higher interest rate environments tend to deter growth of these stocks. Notably, in 2017 Federal Reserve increased interest rates thrice, in March, June and December. This is likely to have a negative impact on the sector.Nevertheless, to maintain their performance level, utilities are resorting to cost-savings initiatives, modernizing transmission and distribution lines, upgrading infrastructure and focusing on renewable energy to generate electricity with lower emission. Further, new electric rates and customer growth will help the sector to witness growth in earnings in the fourth quarter.Projections for the Zacks Utilities sector (one of the 16 Zacks sector), hint at an impressive quarter, when compared to its Q3 performance.The sector's earnings are likely to improve 5.5% on 1.3% higher revenues. In the third quarter, earnings for this sector declined 3.6% on 2.1% sales slump.This is going to be another busy week with 482 companies expected to release earnings including 92 members of the S&P 500.

The company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 1.76%.We believe that the rate hikes at Atlanta City Electric effective September 2017 will have a positive impact on Exelon's performance. Also, the company is expected to benefit from its cost-management initiatives.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company's fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $7.60 billion, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 3.6%.

ind and solar energy have long been marginal players compared to fossil fuels, but  . In the last few years the costs to build both wind and solar power plants have fallen far enough that on a per unit of energy basis they can compete with any fossil fuel. And they  .Newly leaked bids for energy contracts for  's (NYSE: XEL) 2017 All-Source Solicitation show that wind and solar are not only competitive, they're dominant when combined with energy storage. Adding storage to renewable energy plants allows the utility to control when energy is dispatched to the grid, reducing or eliminating the variability that's inherent with wind and solar energy. This is a game-changer for utilities, renewable energy companies, and investors worldwide, and could begin to spell the end for fossil fuels.Image source: Getty Images.Shayle Kann, advisor at Wood Mackenzie's Greentech Media, broke the news of Colorado's ultra-low energy bids. Below is his tweet with the table of bids.A few numbers pop out from this table. One is that a whopping 17.38 GW of wind projects were bid at a median price of 1.81 cents per kWh. More shocking is that wind with battery storage was just 2.10 cents per kWh, which would beat every fossil fuel option.On the solar side, the 13.44 GW of solar bids is a huge number, and bids of 2.95 cents per kWh would be among the lowest bids ever in the U.S. But 3.6 cents per kWh for solar plus storage is incredible given the fact that it'll beat most energy sources besides wind.What we don't know about these bids right now is the size of the storage component, which will impact cost and the flexibility of the asset. But the fact that wind and solar can be combined with energy storage for 2.1 cents/kWh and 3.6 cents/kWh respectively is astonishing because it makes fossil fuels obsolete as a form of new electricity generation.Estimates of the cost of  , but maybe not fast enough. The latest  by investment bank Lazard estimates that the cost of unsubsidized solar is 4.3-5.3 cents per kWh, and wind is 3.0-6.0 cents per kWh. Solar plus storage was estimated to be 8.2 cents per kWh (assuming a 400 MWh battery for a 200 MW solar system).Based on these recent bids the market is already well below that, at least for future bids. The Xcel projects aren't due to be online until 2023, and we don't know final details of storage size or what the low-cost bids are -- but still you can see the rapid cost reductions taking place, and just how competitive solar and wind plus storage are today.There are two companies already building solar plus storage projects in the U.S.  (NASDAQ: TSLA) is a leading energy storage company, and its SolarCity subsidiary has built solar plus storage projects in Hawaii.  (NASDAQ: SPWR) is  , and is a leader in commercial solar plus storage systems.Utilities could also be big beneficiaries of wind and solar plus storage. For example,  (NYSE: AES) is the utility developing the power plant using SunPower's solar panels and energy storage system. It'll generate a return for decades on the development, something other utilities can replicate in their territories.Energy storage has always been the last technology advance needed to end the debate around wind or solar's inability to be the primary energy sources for the grid. As the cost of storage comes down and states like Hawaii prove you can make a goal of a 100% renewable energy grid a reality, the future for renewables gets brighter -- and for fossil fuels, it gets dimmer.Economics are what drives energy investment, and Colorado's bids show that the economics of wind, solar, and energy storage can beat fossil fuels today. Investors in all forms of energy should take notice.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"nvestors in Xcel Energy Inc (Symbol: XEL) saw new options become available this week, for the September 21st expiration. One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 240 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the XEL options chain for the new September 21st contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $40.00 strike price has a current bid of 80 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $40.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $39.20 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of XEL, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $45.48/share today.Because the $40.00 strike represents an approximate 12% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 93%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.00% return on the cash commitment, or 3.04% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Xcel Energy Inc, and highlighting in green where the $40.00 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $50.00 strike price has a current bid of 30 cents. If an investor was to purchase shares of XEL stock at the current price level of $45.48/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $50.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 10.60% if the stock gets called away at the September 21st expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if XEL shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Xcel Energy Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing XEL's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $50.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $50.00 strike represents an approximate 10% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 86%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).

""These utilities serve the regions with the lowest cost of electricity, and American Electric Power and Xcel are taking advantage of low-cost wind (power) to drive rates even lower.""""There is also the potential for wind and solar developers, we would highlight  (  ) and  (  ), to get involved in supplying 'firm' renewable power solutions to concentrated mining operations,"" Ashworth added.Digital currency transactions require energy-intensive computer networks. A public ledger, called a  , provides a record of where every digital token was first ""mined"" using computing power. For Bitcoin, verifying a transaction and adding it to the blockchain earns a miner a specific number of bitcoins.By design, Bitcoin mining software makes it very expensive - in terms of computing power and electricity - to add new blocks. Cryptocurrency power use is facing more scrutiny, particularly in China, where officials are concerned miners are taking advantage of low electricity prices.Some parts of the U.S. - such as the Midwest and Northwest - could also offer mining networks low power costs, Ashworth said in the report.""Electricity consumption from Bitcoin in 2018 could be as great as we forecast for global electric vehicles in 2025,"" added the Morgan Stanley report.""However in theory Bitcoin's energy usage should decline in the long run.

enchmarks ended in negative territory on Wednesday as investors remained indifferent even as Congress passed the much-awaited Republican tax Bill. During the day, all the three key U.S. indexes reached record high levels initially, but finished lower following a pullback. Markets have already traded higher in the last few sessions on optimism over the passage of the tax cut Bill and witnessed a sell-off after both the Houses actually passed the Bill on Wednesday.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) decreased 0.1%, to close at 24,726.65.

On Nasdaq, a 1.01-to-1 ratio favored advancing issues. The CBOE VIX decreased 4.4% to close at 9.59.On Tuesday, the House of Representatives passed the Republican tax overhaul Bill. Although, the House passed the tax Bill, it violated Senate rules during this process. The three provisions which were included in the Bill did not fulfill the Byrd Rule.

The Senate voted 51-48 in favor of the Bill, with majority of the Republicans present in the Senate supporting the new tax code. The Bill permanently slashes corporate tax rates from 35% to 21%.

"n this series, we look through the most recent  report, and then we cherry pick only those companies that have experienced insider buying within the past six months. The officers and directors of a company tend to have a unique insider's view of the business, and presumably the only reason an insider would choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money - maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both. So when stocks turn up that see insider buying, and are also top ranked, investors are wise to take notice. One such company is Xcel Energy Inc (Symbol: XEL), which saw buying by Director Daniel Yohannes.Back on September 5, Yohannes invested $49,530.00 into 1,000 shares of XEL, for a cost per share of $49.53. In trading on Friday, bargain hunters could buy shares of Xcel Energy Inc (Symbol: XEL) and achieve a cost basis 5.6% cheaper than Yohannes, with shares changing hands as low as $46.76 per share. It should be noted that Yohannes has collected $0.72/share in dividends since the time of their purchase, so they are currently down 4.1% on their purchase from a total return basis. Xcel Energy Inc shares are currently trading -0.69% on the day. The chart below shows the one year performance of XEL shares, versus its 200 day moving average:Looking at the chart above, XEL's low point in its 52 week range is $40.04 per share, with $52.22 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $46.80. By comparison, below is a table showing the prices at which insider buying was recorded over the last six months:
  
The DividendRank report noted that among the coverage universe, XEL shares displayed both attractive valuation metrics and strong profitability metrics.

Below is a long-term dividend history chart for XEL, which the report stressed as being of key importance. Indeed, studying a company's past  can be of good help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Xcel Energy Named Top Dividend Stock With Insider Buying and 3.06% Yield (XEL)@2018-01-05@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/xcel-energy-named-top-dividend-stock-insider-buying-and-306-yield-xel-2018-01-05

At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the XEL options chain for the new January 2018 contracts and identified the following put contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $50.00 strike price has a current bid of 5 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $50.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $49.95 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of XEL, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $50.79/share today.Because the $50.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 57%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

The company's third- quarter earnings topped expectations on solid operational performance, steadily decreasing breakeven production costs, improvement in the realized prices of commodities and new project ramp ups.The Zacks analyst likes TOTAL's new start-ups and acquisitions, which are helping it to boost production. Its decision to acquire Maersk Oil for $7.45 billion will further strengthen its position globally as an oil and gas operator.Going forward, the company will continue to benefit from its cost management initiatives.

Its top line has been witnessing an uptrend for past many years. Sufficient generation of cash flow has helped the company take up several capital deployment initiatives aimed at enhancing shareholders' value.Humana's sound balance sheet and disciplined capital management remains a positive.

However, continued growth from Victoza and Tresiba as well as higher contributions from Saxenda and Xultophy will be partly offset by the impact of lower realized prices in the United States, loss of exclusivity for products in hormone replacement therapy, intensifying competition within the diabetes and biopharmaceutics markets and macroeconomic conditions in many markets under International Operations.(You can  ).Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Target and Xcel.Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

 's  natural gas utility subsidiary announced that it has submitted a review proposal for its natural gas rate, with the Arkansas Public Service Commission.Notably, the review is anticipated to result in a rate increase, which in turn is expected to generate additional revenues of $29.9 million per year, for the company. If the proposal is approved, increased rates for the 166,000 natural gas customers that the company serves across Arkansas will definitely benefit Black Hill's operating results.Per the filing, the company is seeking to derive a return on equity of 10.2% for investments that Black Hills has been making in its natural gas system in Arkansas. The company is looking forward to implement the new rates in the fourth quarter of 2018, subject to approval.Since 2016, Black Hills has made investments worth $160 million toward replacing, upgarding and manitaining its natural gas transmission and distribution pipelines in Arkansas, that is stretched over 5,500 miles.Notably these infrastructural investments have been made keeping in view the increasing needs of customers. Further, these have been directed to provide safer and more reliable natural gas delivery services to homes and businesses.Utility companies operate in a regulated, yet highly competitive market structure. Upgrading and modernizing infrastructure from time to time is consequently important for providing better service to the customers. Further, investments to improve reliability of existing infrastructure become essential, especially in meeting the ever increasing growth in demand for electricity and other utility services.Being no exception, Black Hills has also made such huge investments, to ensure steady and uninterrupted supply of utility services for its customers in Arkansas. Further, a steady economic growth in Northwest Arkansas might have encouraged the company to invest in this state, for ensuring smoother and improved services.Notably these investments in improving its transmission and distribution system have been paying off well for Black Hills' operating results, as is evidenced by its performance in the third quarter of 2017. Toward this, Black Hills witnessed an increase of 2.5% in revenues of $342 million.Now, a rate increase aids a utility operator to recover the costs of investments. In recent times, other few utilities have also proceeded in the same path like Black Hills, to enjoy the fruits of hiked rates in the form of enhanced profits.For instance, in June 2017, it was announced that Xcel Energy Inc.  is gearing up to place a rate increase request to the Colorado Public Utilities Commission for natural gas, which would be effective for three years starting 2018.Shares of Black Hillshave underperformedthe  in the last three months. The company's shares lost 12.3%, against the industry's gain of 1.3%.Such underperformance can be attributed to lower contribution from the company's natural gas business that was negatively impacted by lower irrigation demand, during the third quarter of 2017.Black Hills carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Investors can consider some better-ranked stocks from the same space such as IDACORP, Inc.  and NextEra Energy, Inc.  , both of which carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see  .IDACORP delivered positive earnings surprise of 8.43% in third-quarter 2017. Its 2017 current year estimates have risen by 2% to $4.08 per share in the last 60 days.NextEra Energy delivered positive earnings surprise of 5.71% in third-quarter 2017. Its 2017 current year estimates have risen by 0.1% to $6.73 per share in the last 60 days.Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

Let's see how things are shaping up for this earnings season.Xcel Energy continues to invest in its utility assets to provide reliable services to its customers and effectively meet rising electricity demand.For the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Xcel Energy's revenues is pegged at $3,284 million, indicating 10.8% year over year and 23.8% sequential increase. We expect the increase in total revenues to be driven by higher contribution from its Electric segment.Economic growth in its service territories, especially in Minnesota and systematic investment in regulated operation is expected to boost the bottom line. Xcel Energy's focus to produce more electricity from renewable sources will also yield positive results. Earnings are projected to be 93 cents per share, reflecting year-over-year growth of 6.9%.Notably, shares of Xcel Energy have gained 5.5% in the last three months, outperforming the  's 4.4% rally. | Our proven model does not conclusively show that Xcel Energy is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components.

"n recent trading, shares of Xcel Energy, Inc. (Symbol: XEL) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $47.44, changing hands for $47.70/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 9 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Xcel Energy, Inc., but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $42.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $54.00. The standard deviation is $3.745.But the whole reason to look at the  XEL price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with XEL crossing above that average target price of $47.44/share, investors in XEL have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $47.44 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Xcel Energy, Inc.:

ooking at the universe of stocks we cover at  , in trading on Wednesday, shares of Xcel Energy, Inc. (Symbol: XEL) were yielding above the 3% mark based on its quarterly dividend (annualized to $1.44), with the stock changing hands as low as $47.91 on the day. Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return. To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) back on 12/31/1999 - you would have paid $146.88 per share. Fast forward to 12/31/2012 and each share was worth $142.41 on that date, a decrease of $4.67/share over all those years. But now consider that you collected a whopping $25.98 per share in dividends over the same period, for a positive total return of 23.36%. Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.6%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 3% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable. Xcel Energy, Inc. (Symbol: XEL) is an S&P 500 company, giving it special status as one of the large-cap companies making up the S&P 500 Index.In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Xcel Energy, Inc., looking at the history chart for XEL below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 3% annual yield.

 announced its finance subsidiary, NiSource Finance Corp., has completed the sale of $750-million aggregate principal amount of 3.950% Notes due 2048.NiSource Finance, will utilize the proceeds from this offering to finance the capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes. The balance proceeds could be used to repay short-term borrowings.NiSource previously announced plans to make planned utility infrastructure investments of about $1.6-$1.7 billion in 2017 and has identified long-term infrastructure investments worth $30 billion, with over 90% of it allocated to regulated pipes and wires.In addition to the above actions, the company is also taking commendable steps to reduce the greenhouse gas emission to keep up with peers like Duke Energy Corporation  , Xcel Energy Inc.  , NRG Energy, Inc.  etc. All of these companies are striving to bring down their carbon footprint.According to the projected figures, its coal usage is expected to drop to 42% of its generation mix by 2023, from the current level of 78%. The company will do the same by retrofitting emission control equipment in its existing coal plants, retiring old plants and replacing the coal fired units by renewable sources.Northern Indiana Public Service Company (NIPSCO) continues to execute its seven-year, $845 million gas infrastructure modernization program to further improve system reliability and safety. NIPSCO is also working to execute its seven-year electric infrastructure modernization program, which includes enhancements to its electric transmission and distribution system designed to further improve system safety and reliability.NiSource's long-term debt was $6,777.4 million for the period ended Jun 30, 2017, compared to $6,058.2 million for the period ended Dec 31, 2016.The rise in long-term debt level is a matter of concern as it can lead to rise in interest expense and can erode the company's profit margin. This newly issued debt will increase interest expenditure by approximately $30 million.Interestingly, during the second quarter the company was able to successfully refinance about $1 billion of near-term maturity debt with lower-rate debt.

 announced that it has completed the sale of $300-million convertible senior notes due 2020. These notes will pay interest semi-annually, at the rate of 1.50% per annum, and will mature on Sep 15, 2020. These notes can be converted to equity at a 25% premium according to the closing price of $42.29 per common unit on Sep 6, 2017.The capital accumulated from this offering will be utilized to fund the company's expansion plans in the current year. The partnership is aiming to use a portion of the proceeds from this offering to acquire renewable assets either from NextEra Energy Resources or third parties. The partnership might utilize the proceeds to fund the initial cost of the capped call transaction and use the balance proceeds for general partnership purposes.The partnership has already received offers to buy the following assets from NextEra Energy Resources - 25.9% interest in Desert Sunlight 250 and Desert Sunlight 300 at Riverside County, CA; Brady Wind I and Brady Wind II at Stark and Hettinger counties, ND and Javelina I at Webb County, TX. However, the partnership is under no obligation to buy these assets.NextEra Energy  formed NextEra Energy Partners to own, manage and acquire contracted clean energy projects with stable and long-term cash flows.The partnership evaluates and adds high-quality renewable assets to its portfolio. During the second quarter, it completed the acquisition of 250 megawatts (MW) Golden West Wind project from NextEra Energy Resources for approximately $238 million.With global warming on the rise, it is important to plan energy consumption carefully. It is important to note that non-renewable energy sources are limited and will be exhausted in the near future. Therefore, major energy providers like NextEra Energy, Duke Energy Corporation  , Xcel Energy Inc.  and others are gradually switching to low or no-emission energy resources, such as solar, wind, hydro etc., which are available abundantly.According to U.S. Energy Information Administration, in 2016, approximately 10% of total energy consumption in the United States was from renewable energy sources. We expect contribution from the renewable sources to the total generation mix to rise due to lower cost of power production from renewable sources and government's initiatives to provide more impetus to renewable generation projects.Units of NextEra Energy Partners have returned 49%, outperforming the  's increase of 14.6% in the last one year.This outperformance could be attributed to the company's growing renewable portfolio which has boosted its performance.NextEra Energy Partners carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Among the largest underlying components of XLU, in trading today Edison International (Symbol: EIX) is up about 0.2%, Consolidated Edison Inc (Symbol: ED) is up about 0.2%, and Xcel Energy, Inc. (Symbol: XEL) is relatively unchanged.  The chart below shows the one year price performance of XLU, versus its 200 day moving average:Looking at the chart above, XLU's low point in its 52 week range is $45.33 per share, with $55.42 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $55.04. Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Notable ETF Inflow Detected - XLU, EIX, ED, XEL@2017-08-31@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/notable-etf-inflow-detected-xlu-eix-ed-xel-2017-08-31
lectric services provider, Duke Energy Corporation  , has laid down a request for rate increase with the North Carolina Utilities Commission (NCUC). If the requested new rates are approved by the NCUC, it will come in to effect spring 2018.This recent filing would reflect an overall 2.5% increase annually, as Duke Energy Carolinas' last rate adjustment request in North Carolina was way back in 2013. Once approved by the state regulators, revenues are expected to increase by $647 million, for an overall average rate increase across customer groups by 13.6%. The average rate increase will be 16.7% for residential and 10.9% rate increase for commercial and industrial customers.The current rate request filing by the company is in sync with its aim of modernizing power plants, generating cleaner electricity, by responsibly managing coal ash and improving reliability. This, in turn is likely to increase value for customers and shareholders for a smarter energy future.Energy saving initiatives such as implementation of modern technologies at its facilities to expand scale of operations is likely to bode well, going forward. Notably, the company's robust five-year capital plan and current plans of investing about $37 billion in growth projects over the 2017-2021 time frame support this notion.The solar energy market in the United States has evolved massively in the past few years. In fact, Duke Energy Carolinas has retired half of its older, less-efficient coal plants which lack state-of-the-art emission controls and had them replaced with cleaner, natural gas-fueled plants. The utility has also supported the sustainable growth of solar energy, helping move North Carolina to second in the nation for overall solar power.We appreciate the company's efforts of expanding its scale of operations, pursuing additional generation projects and introducing newer renewable projects to meet growing demands for renewable energy in the dynamic environment.Another company that is currently diversifying its generation portfolio with emphasis on renewable sources is Xcel Energy Inc.  . This utility is currently planning to invest about $4.2 billion in renewables over the next five years. The company expects to bring 3,400 megawatts of renewable generation online by 2020.Duke Energy has outperformed  in the last 12 months. The company's shares gained 13.2% compared with the industry's increase of 11.2%.Duke Energy's focus on core domestic regulated assets and highly-contracted renewable business are going to drive performance over the long term.Duke Energy currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Investors can consider other top-ranked stocks like Pattern Energy Group Inc.  and Ameren Corporation  from the same industry. These two stocks carry the same Zacks Rank as Duke Energy. You can see Pattern Energy posted an average surprise of 59.21% in the trailing last four quarters. The company's 2017 estimates increased significantly form a loss of 10 cents to earnings of 27 cents in the last 90 days.Ameren posted an average surprise of 2.83% in the trailing last four quarters. The company's 2017 estimates increased by 3 cents to $2.80 in the last 90 days.It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it.

 announced that it has filed a stipulation with the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to invest in clean energy in rural Colorado. The filed stipulation is a broad collaboration between Xcel Energy and 14 other diverse groups.According to the filing, Xcel Energy seeks permission from CPUC to invest approximately $2.5 billion in rural Colorado, to increase its clean energy portfolio. The company has vouched that the approval will not increase customers' bill.Xcel Energy stated that their aim is to provide low-cost power and increase the use of cleaner energy in its service area. If approved, the proposal will increase the company's renewable energy portfolio to 55% by 2026. It will also be very effective in enabling customers to save money and reduce carbon emission by almost 60% by 2026 as compared with 2005 level. As of now, Xcel Energy has lowered its emission level by 30% from 2005 levels and is on track to lower it by 45% through 2021. This proposal may also add up to 1,000 megawatts (MW) of wind, 700 MW of solar and 700 MW of natural gas and storage to the company's portfolio on completion.The company has also asked the commission to consider the early retirement of two 660 MW of coal generation units in southern Colorado. Xcel Energy is currently diversifying its generation portfolio with emphasis on renewable sources. To this end, it is planning to invest about $4.2 billion in wind assets over the next three years.Xcel Energy is not the only company undertaking additional measures to reduce carbon emission by reducing coal usage and increasing use of renewable energy, even when President Trump is actively promoting the usage of coal, to revive the industry.NextEra Energy's  subsidiary, Florida Power & Light Company (FPL), has bought out existing contracts with two independent coal-fired power plants with the goal of shutting down both plants, thereby saving hundreds of millions of dollars for customers and reducing green house gas emission.Another utility giant who is investing heavily in clean power is Duke Energy  . The company's five-year plan includes investment of $3.3 billion in highly-efficient natural gas-fired combined-cycle plants. The company has brought down emission level by almost 30% compared to the 2005, by retiring coal plants and bringing on more natural gas and renewable.With clean energy as the ultimate future, such initiatives adopted by utilities like Xcel Energy will surely help them to capture increased shares in the renewable energy market, which boasts a multi-billion dollar opportunity.Shares of Xcel Energy have returned 20.1% in the last one year outperforming the  's growth of 7.8% in the same time period.Xcel Energy's disciplined investments in infrastructure projects and focus on renewable expansion might have led to this outperformance.Xcel Energy currently holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better ranked stock in the same is CenterPoint Energy, Inc.  carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see  .CenterPoint Energy delivered a four-quarter average positive surprise of 10.34%.

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Xcel Energy is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings-with the most up-to-date information possible-is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for XEL in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 43 cents per share for XEL, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 42 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for XEL, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +2.38% heading into earnings season. | A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more  ).Given that XEL has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see  .Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Xcel Energy, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaries,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"he Q2 earnings season is gradually unfolding. As of Jul 25, 128 S&P 500 members came up with earnings results. Total earnings for these companies are up 7.0% from the same period last year on 4.2% higher revenues. 77.3% of the companies beat EPS estimates while 70.3% topped revenue estimates.It is going to be another busy week with nearly 800 companies - including 183 S&P 500 members - expected to come up with earnings results. Combining results of the reported index members (97 members till Jul 21) with the remaining 403 members of S&P 500, earnings are estimated to improve 8.6% on 4.7% higher revenues.Let us now focus on the utility sector, which is characterized by its defensive nature and domestic orientation. Earnings are expected to drop 2.9% this season.The utility sector is capital-intensive. These companies need huge capital to set up generation facilities, and transmission and distribution infrastructure. They also require considerable funds to maintain and upgrade the existing systems in order to meet emission-control standards. Utilities have been benefiting from the rock-bottom interest rate environment. However, the Federal Reserve has raised the rates twice in 2017 - in March and June. This will definitely hurt the utilities. The Fed has maintained its forecast for one more rate hike in 2017.With the rising interest rates, the stable, regular dividend payer utilities will face strong competition from bonds as these provide higher returns, which will make them a more attractive option for the investors.The U.S. coal-based utilities got a respite with President Trump's decision to repeal the Climate Power Plan. Moreover, Trump has walked out of the Paris Climate Agreement.Five out of the 16 sectors in the Zacks coverage universe are expected to witness an earnings decline this season.

 is set to report second-quarter 2017 results before the market opens on July 27. Last quarter, this public utility company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 6%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.The sign of economic improvement is prominent across Xcel Energy's service territories, especially in Minnesota, compared with the nation as a whole. The consolidated unemployment rate in the company's service territory was 3.2% in Dec, 2016, lower than the nation's average of 4.7%.The optimism in the market continues to drive the company's sales and is likely to boost top line in the second quarter.Additionally, the company has seen a consistent rise in the number of customers over the last few quarters. We expect this trend to continue in second quarter as well boosting its earnings.However, rising debt level remains a matter of concern for the company. Xcel Energy's debt/capital ratio stands at 55.3% compared with the industry's average of 49.7% and the S&P 500's level of 41.9%. Moreover, the company's current ratio stands at 0.71, so the rising interest rates do not bode well for Xcel Energy. This is because the resulting increase in cost of capital will escalate cost of operations, thereby denting its margins. | Our proven model does not conclusively show that Xcel Energy is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat consensus estimates.

 reported second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of 41 cents per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 51 cents by 19.6%. However, on a year-over-year basis earnings increased 5.1%.Increased earnings in the second quarter can be attributed to benefit arising out of electric utilities from new generation and transmission investments as well as strong industrial sales.In second-quarter 2017, Black Hills' total revenues of $348 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $372 million by 6.5%. However, revenues were up 14.3% from $325.4 million in the prior-year quarter.During the second quarter, Black Hills cost of fuel, purchased power and gas amounted to $98.2 million, increased 16.2% year over year from $84.5 million.The company's operating and maintenance expenses amounted to $132.3 million reflecting a marginal decrease of 0.5% year over year.Operating income in the reported quarter increased 95.2% year over year to $68.9 million.Interest expenses increased 1.5% year over year to $34.1 million.Black Hills narrowed guidance for 2017 earnings per share to the range of $3.45-$3.60 from $3.45-$3.65.

lectric services provider,  , recently revealed its plans of constructing three solar facilities in Northern Kentucky. These solar units will incorporate 31500 solar panels and generate over 6.8 megawatts (MW) of electricity. Notably, these stations will directly serve the customers of Kentucky.Out of the three units, Walton Solar Power Plants 1 & 2, will be built in Kenton County. The site will have 19,000 solar panels installed and the capability of generating more than 4 MW of electricity.The third one - Crittenden Solar Power Plant - will be located in Grant County and will incorporate 12,500 panels. This plant will produce more than 2.7 MW of electricity.The company has laid down plans of completing a major part of the construction by the end of 2017. On being operational, these plants will be able to offer electricity to almost 1,300 average-sized homes.With increasing demand for electricity in Kentucky, Duke Energy aims at making most of the opportunity by setting up more solar power plants in the state. Moreover, cost of building solar projects is cheaper than before, making it more cost-competitive compared with other sources of power generation. Being an experienced solar power supplier, Duke Energy enjoys a competitive edge over peers in reaching out to more customers. The company already serves 850,000 customers in the Ohio/Kentucky region.The three solar power plants set to be constructed in Northern Kentucky will complement Duke Energy Kentucky's existing power generation fleet in Kentucky, which incorporates a 650 MW coal-fired plant and a 500-MW gas-fired facility.The solar energy market in the U.S has evolved greatly in past few years. Since 2008, solar installations in the country have grown seventeen-fold from 1.2 gigawatts (GW) to an estimated 30 GW today.Duke Energy is a premier utility service provider offering efficient power and energy services across various states in the U.S. and other international areas. We appreciate the company's efforts of expanding its scale of operations, pursuing additional generation projects and introducing solar projects to meet growing demands for renewable energy in the dynamic environment.In pursuit of green energy, the company has invested more than $5 billion since 2007. As of Mar 2017, Duke Energy Renewables owns and operates about 2,894 MW of renewable energy out of which 583 MW is solar.Despite President Trump's withdrawal of the U.S. from the Paris agreement and the strong steps taken by his administration to abolish the Clean Power plan, utilities are still inclined toward adopting renewable as source of energy. This is because, although Trump is currently aiming to revive the coal industry, no one can deny the fact that renewable energy is the future.Notably, 2,044 MW of solar PV were installed in the U.S., in first-quarter 2017 to reach 44.7 GW of total installed capacity, enough to power 8.7 million American homes. Moreover, the industry is forecasted to nearly triple over the next five years, surpassing 100 GW nationwide, according to the U.S. Energy Department.Naturally, other utilities like Xcel Energy Inc.  and Westar Energy, Inc.  are also expanding base in solar power production to triumph in the long run, which can pose stiff competition to Duke Energy.Duke Energy has outperformed the Zacks categorized  industry in the last 12 months. The company's shares gained 2.7% compared with the industry's increase of 0.5%.Duke Energy's strong focus on core domestic regulated and highly-contracted renewable business has augured well for its stable financial position and streamlined portfolio, which can primarily be attributed for this outperformance.Duke Energy currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Investors can also consider another top-ranked stock, Atlantica Yield PLC  which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see Atlantica Yield reported an earnings surprise of 36.84% in the last quarter. Its current year estimates increased by 21.6% to 62 cents in the last 90 days.It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

 's  subsidiary, Entergy Louisiana, announced that Louisiana Public Service Commission has approved its plan to construct the Lake Charles Power Station.Entergy wants to build a combined-cycle power plant in Westlake, LA, with a capacity of 994 megawatt. This natural gas-fired plant is in line with Entergy Louisiana's plan to generate clean, efficient energy which will strengthen the state's economic growth and will add to the savings of its customers.The total cost of the project is expected to be around $872 million. This will include transmission and other project-related costs and contingency. The company wants to start the construction by Aug 1, 2017 and the plant is expected to go live by June 2020.Over the anticipated 30-year life this high efficient plant is expected to save an expenditure amounting $1.3-$2 billion for customers. With the construction of this plant, the company will be able to avoid about $600 million of transmission projects which would have been necessary to maintain reliability in the Lake Charles region.This plant is projected to create over 1200 direct and indirect jobs a year throughout the states. The company will employ 30 workers after the completion of the project.Among all other positive impacts, it will bring down the greenhouse emission by almost 40% once it becomes operational.During his electoral campaign, President Trump promised to revive the dying coal industry. His recent decisions to walk out of the Paris Climate Agreement and repeal the clean power plan have boosted lagging coal companies which were on the verge of bankruptcy. This in turn is expected to keep fossil fuel-based electricity plants afloat longer than expected and hurt companies with a focus on alternative energy sources, at least in the near term.However, his decision did not entirely discourage the major utility companies to shift their focus from lower emission sources. Irrespective of any stringent environmental regulations, companies like Xcel Energy Inc.  , Duke Energy Corporation  , Dominion Resources, Inc.  etc., are still focused on reducing carbon emission. These companies are willing to invest substantial amount in the subsequent years to generate cleaner energy through natural gas and other renewable sources.As a result of continued investments, these companies will not only contribute to a cleaner future but will also be prepared for any change in environmental regulations from the future governments.Shares of Entergy have gained 2.1% in the last three months outperforming the Zacks categorized  industry's gain of 0.1%.This is mainly because of the company's focus on disciplined investment in growth projects along with its pollution control measures and cost-containment efforts.Entergy currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see  .It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

Two of these centers will be located in Indian River County and one in St. Lucie County. These centers will provide cost effective, clean and emission-free energy by early next year.The company has plans to construct and place a total of eight solar power plants by early 2018. As a result, Treasure Coast facilities are expected to become a part of one of the largest solar expansion plans in the eastern U.S. The entire project will include over 2.5 million solar panels with approximately 600 megawatts of solar capacity, which can power up to 120,000 homes.Florida Power & Light is teaming up with Veterans Florida, Indian River State College and others.

Per the company, its percentage of production from solar will outgrow the same from coal and oil combined by 2020.The company has been effective in improving its solar portfolio in Florida for over last three decades. It all started with the installation of a 10-kilowatt PV facility in Miami. Presently, the company has more than 335 MW of solar generating capacity throughout the state.The relaxation of strict environmental regulations has given the coal industry some relief for the time being, which is temporary. However, in the long run availability of the renewable sources like solar, wind and hydro will be the ultimate sources of power generation. Global warming due to emission from generating energy from fossil fuel sources is a serious concern for everyone and the clean renewable sources power sources can lead to a greener future for the planet.Though, President Trump is highly inclined towards saving the coal industry, companies like NextEra Energy, Xcel Energy Inc.  , American Electric Power Co., Inc.  , Duke Energy Corporation  among other utilities are maintaining their focus on increasing their solar portfolio.These utility giants realize that solar energy is the future of power generation and regular investment in the solar space will prove to be beneficial in the long run.In the last six months, shares of NextEra Energy have gained 19.3% compared with the Zacks categorized  industry's gain of 3.4%.The improvement in economic condition coupled with additions to renewable generation assets, is constantly boosting the performance of the company.NextEra Energy carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

 is set to release second-quarter 2017 financial results  on Jul 27. Last quarter, this power management company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 9.86%.Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.FirstEnergy expects earnings per share for the second quarter to be in the range of 54 cents to 64 cents per share. The company secured regulatory approvals for base rate increase in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Ohio which are expected to boost the company's top line.However, rising debt level remains a headwind for the company. FirstEnergy's debt/capital ratio stands at 74.3% compared with the industry's average of 49.7% and the S&P 500's 41.9%. Moreover, the company's current ratio stands at 0.36, which indicates that rising interest rates do not bode well for FirstEnergy. Also, the choppy return from competitive electric markets might adversely impact the company's second-quarter result. | Our proven model does not conclusively show that FirstEnergy is likely to beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) for this to happen.But that is not the case here, as you will see below. You can see  . The Most Accurate estimate is at 58 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 59 cents, resulting in an Earnings ESP of -1.70%. FirstEnergy has a Zacks Rank #3 which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company's negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Note that we caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 or #5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are a few companies in the utility sector that have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Pattern Energy Group Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +23.08 and carries a Zacks Rank #2. It is slated to report second-quarter 2017 earnings on Aug 4.The AES Corp.  has an Earnings ESP of +20.00% and holds a Zacks Rank #2. It is slated to report second-quarter 2017 earnings on Aug 8.Xcel Energy Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +2.38% and holds a Zacks Rank #3. It is slated to report second-quarter 2017 earnings on Jul 27.It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it.

Xcel Energy, Inc. will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.36 on 7/20/17, UGI Corp. will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.25 on 7/1/17, and Atrion Corp. will pay its quarterly dividend of $1.05 on 6/30/17.

 's  subsidiary, Florida Power & Light Company (FPL), has filed a petition with the Florida Public Service Commission (PSC), seeking permission for shutting down St. Johns River Power Park (SJRPP) by Dec 2017. SJRPP, a 1,300-megawatt (MW) coal-fired plant, is jointly owned by FLP and JEA.This 1,300 MW unit has served customers of both JEA and FPL for decades. However, it is no longer economically viable. With the retirement of SJRPP, FPL customers are expected to save $183 million. This planned closure will also help the company to reduce its carbon dioxide emission by 5.6 million tons annually.FPL is shutting down not only its own coal-fired power plants but also two independently owned coal-fired power plants that it bought in the last two years. While the Cedar Bay plant in Jacksonville was closed in 2016, the Indiantown Co-generation plant in Martin County will stop functioning by 2019. The objective is to reduce greenhouse gas emission and save hundreds of millions of dollars of customers.FPL is one of the biggest producers of solar power in Florida compared with other competitors, with 335 megawatts including six universal solar power plants. The company plans to add nearly 2,100 megawatts of universal solar power from 2017 through 2023. The first eight new solar plants, which are being built to supply approximately 600 megawatts combined, are expected to be complete in less than 12 months from now. The remaining 1500 megawatts of solar power projects are expected to be completed through 2019-2023.The company has also invested in high-efficiency natural gas energy generation since 2001. These new plants have saved not only more than $8.6 billion in fossil fuel costs but also have reduced carbon dioxide emission by about 108 million tons.Major utility companies are working toward reducing their carbon emission with or without Clean Power Plan. This will not only help them in generating clean power but also save millions of dollars for their customers.Earlier Xcel Energy  announced its plans of adding 3,380 megawatts (MWs) of wind generation to its existing system by building 11 new wind firms in seven states. The company's target is to invest $3.5 billion in the said project in the next five years. (Read more:  )In Apr 2017, FPL's parent company NextEra Energy and Westar Energy  jointly commissioned the Kingman and Ninnescah Wind Energy Centers in Kansas.

 announced that NiSource Finance Corp., a subsidiary, has completed the sale of $1 billion of 10-year Notes and $1 billion of 30-year Notes. The $1 billion 3.490% Notes is due 2027 and another $1 billion 4.375% Notes is due 2047.On May 11, 2017, NiSource Finance announced cash tender offers for four series of its outstanding debt securities. According to the terms of the tender, the company offered to purchase any and all of its outstanding 6.125% Notes which are due 2022 for cash.NiSource Finance said that it will utilize part of the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes to fund the purchase price of its previously announced tender offers. These offers include the purchase of approximately $1,095 million aggregate principal amount of four series of its outstanding notes.The company intends to utilize the balance to finance capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. NiSource issues notes from time to time to meet its financial obligation and to fund its expansion programs.NiSource plans to invest nearly $1.6-$1.8 billion annually in planned utility infrastructure from 2018 to 2020 and has identified long-term infrastructure investments worth $30 billion. In its efforts to bring down green house gas emission, the company has been shifting its focus toward alternative energy.NiSource projects coal to drop to 42% of its generation mix by 2023 from the current level of 78%. The company will do the same by retrofitting emission control equipment in its existing coal plants, retiring old coal plants and replacing the coal fired units by renewable sources. With the current pulse in the U.S. market favoring clean energy, NiSource's investment in this field is commendable.Irrespective of President Trump's view of removing the clean power plan, the major utility companies are focusing on reducing their emission level, which is not only helpful for the environment but will also help customers to save millions of dollars.Earlier NextEra Energy, Inc.'s  subsidiary, Florida Power & Light Company (FPL), filed a petition with the Florida Public Service Commission (PSC), seeking permission for shutting down St. Johns River Power Park (SJRPP) by Dec 2017.

"n this series, we look through the most recent  report, and then we cherry pick only those companies that have experienced insider buying within the past six months. The officers and directors of a company tend to have a unique insider's view of the business, and presumably the only reason an insider would choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money - maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both. So when stocks turn up that see insider buying, and are also top ranked, investors are wise to take notice. One such company is Xcel Energy, Inc. (Symbol: XEL), which saw buying by Director James T. Prokopanko.Back on February 7, Prokopanko invested $41,447.00 into 1,000 shares of XEL, for a cost per share of $41.45. In trading on Wednesday, shares were changing hands as low as $46.54 per share, which is 12.3% above Prokopanko's purchase price. It should be noted that Prokopanko has collected $0.36/share in dividends since the time of their purchase, so they are currently up 13.2% on their purchase from a total return basis. Xcel Energy, Inc. shares are currently trading +0.30% on the day. The chart below shows the one year performance of XEL shares, versus its 200 day moving average:Looking at the chart above, XEL's low point in its 52 week range is $38.00 per share, with $46.79 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $46.65. By comparison, below is a table showing the prices at which insider buying was recorded over the last six months:

"n recent trading, shares of Xcel Energy, Inc. (Symbol: XEL) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $44.88, changing hands for $44.92/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 8 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Xcel Energy, Inc., but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $40.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $50.00. The standard deviation is $3.181.But the whole reason to look at the  XEL price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with XEL crossing above that average target price of $44.88/share, investors in XEL have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $44.88 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Xcel Energy, Inc.:
  
The average rating presented in the last row of the above table above is from 1 to 5 where 1 is Strong Buy and 5 is Strong Sell.

he Q1 earnings season is approaching the halfway mark, with about 57% of the S&P 500 members coming out with their earnings results by the end of this week. Nearly 800 companies are scheduled to report results this week, including 191 S&P 500 members. As of Apr 21, 95 S&P 500 members came out with their earnings results. Total earnings for these companies are up 14.3% from the same period last year on 4.6% higher revenues, with 72.6% beating EPS estimates and 62.1% beating revenue estimates.For the remaining index members, earnings are estimated to improve 9.1% on 6% higher revenues. Notably, this could be the third straight quarter of earnings growth after five quarters of back-to-back declines.Let us now focus on the utility sector, which is characterized by its defensive nature and domestic orientation. Earnings are expected to drop 0.9% this season.The utility sector is also known for its capital-intensive nature. This is because these companies need huge capital to set up generation facilities, and transmission and distribution infrastructure. They also require considerable funds to upgrade the existing systems in order to meet emission control standards. Utilities have been benefiting from the rock-bottom interest rate environment. However, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates for two consecutive quarters (Dec 2016 and Mar 2017), which will definitely hurt the utilities.As per the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), total U.S. electricity generation from utility-scale plants is expected to decline 0.7% per day in 2017 from 11,140 gigawatt hours per day in 2016 on account of lower demand. The drop in electricity generation will more than offset the expected rise in electricity prices in 2017 and will mar the prospects of utilities as well.Moderate winter weather in most parts of the U.S. is not going to help the utilities either and is likely to have an adverse impact on demand and earnings of these companies.Five out of the 16 sectors in the Zacks coverage universe are expected to witness an earnings decline this season. Read more details in our weekly  report.Let's take a look at a few utilities that are scheduled to report quarterly numbers on Apr 27.American Electric Power Co., Inc.  reported a positive earnings surprise of 21.8% in the previous quarter. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see American Electric Power's  is currently -2.06%.

cel Energy Inc.  is scheduled to report first-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Apr 27. Last quarter, the company's earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.45%.Let's see how things are holding up for the first quarter.Some of the states of Xcel Energy's service territory experienced a warmer January and February, the major winter months, in 2017. This will adversely impact the results in the first quarter of 2017.Xcel Energy's long-term debt grew from $8.8 billion in 2011 to $14.2 billion till the fourth quarter of 2016. Xcel Energy's debt/capital ratio is 56.3% against the industry average of 48.4% and the S&P 500 level of 41.8%. The rise in the debt levels translate into higher interest cost burden, which eats into the company's margins.However, the company is hopeful about customer growth in its service territories for both the electric and natural gas businesses and expects a long-term growth of around 0.5%.In Jan 2017, the company got an approval for the Texas rate case from the commission. The total annual estimated impact of this approval is expected to be about $51.8 million. The final rates will be effective retroactive to Jul 20, 2016. Therefore, we can expect some impact of the same in the first quarter results. | Our proven model does not conclusively show that Xcel Energy is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here, as you will see below.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . : Xcel Energy's Earnings ESP is -2.0%, as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 49 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is 50 cents,. : Xcel Energy carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

"nvestors in Xcel Energy, Inc. (Symbol: XEL) saw new options become available today, for the May 19th expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the XEL options chain for the new May 19th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $40.00 strike price has a current bid of 5 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $40.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $39.95 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of XEL, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $43.70/share today.Because the $40.00 strike represents an approximate 8% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 85%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 0.12% return on the cash commitment, or 0.76% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Xcel Energy, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $40.00 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $45.00 strike price has a current bid of 45 cents. If an investor was to purchase shares of XEL stock at the current price level of $43.70/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $45.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 4.00% if the stock gets called away at the May 19th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if XEL shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Xcel Energy, Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing XEL's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $45.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $45.00 strike represents an approximate 3% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 65%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).

"extEra Energy, Inc.'s  affiliate, Florida Power & Light Company (""FPL""), announced its target of adding around 2,100 megawatts (MWs) of new solar capacity across the state of Florida in the next seven years. This includes approximately 600 MW of solar power that was announced earlier, and is likely to be operational by early 2018.Florida Power & Light also plans to replace its existing power plant at Dania Beach, FL, near Fort Lauderdale with modern, high fuel-efficient natural gas technology. By doing so, the company expects to save customers' money and cut down emissions. The new plant will generate more power using less fuel, thereby lowering its overall natural gas consumption.Florida Power & Light has also entered into a preliminary agreement with Jacksonville Electric Authority (JEA) to shut down the jointly owned coal-fired power plant at St. Johns River Power Park in Jacksonville, FL. The company's vision is to produce more energy through solar capacity than oil and gas combined.The long-term plan of the company includes reducing its coal and oil usage to less than 1% combined, while more than quadrupling the use of solar power in its total energy production.Along with producing energy through cleaner sources, the company wants to keep overall electric rates lower than levels seen 10 years ago.In the last few years, solar and wind energies have gained immense popularity among American Electricity producing companies. They have started adding new solar and wind plants to their portfolio to lower emission and meet the requirements of stringent emission standards.Xcel Energy  plans to add approximately 3,380 MWs of wind generation to its existing system by building 11 new wind firms across seven states. These wind-powered plants will be part of Xcel Energy's five-year plan of investing about $3.5 billion in renewables.

 has announced an ambitious plan to add 3,380 megawatts (MWs) of wind generation to its existing system. The company aims to build 11 new wind firms in seven states to supply more clean energy to its customers.The above project is a part of the company's target to invest about $3.5 billion in renewables over the next five years.The company intends to add new wind firms in states in the Southwest, the Upper Midwest and Colorado. These firms are expected to come online by 2021 and increase Xcel Energy's wind generation contribution to 35% of its total energy mix.Apart from being a clean source of energy, these projects will also lead to substantial savings in customer energy bills. The 1,230 MW wind projects in the Southwest states-Texas and New Mexico-will save $2.8 billion for customers over a 30 year period.The 1,550 MW projects in Upper Midwest states-Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota and Iowa-will save $4.0 billion in customer energy bills over the life of the project, while the 600 MW project in Colorado will similarly save $1.1 billion.The company expects at least a 45% companywide reduction in carbon emissions levels by 2021, if it is able to fully implement approved and proposed renewable energy plans.Production Tax Credit (PTC) is a federal performance-based incentive that has helped the U.S. wind industry to lead the clean energy market. Nearly 18 gigawatts of wind power capacity are now under construction or in advanced development in the U.S, primarily due to the extension of this tax credit.Xcel Energy will benefit from utilizing PTCs to secure low wind energy prices.We have noticed a gradual increase in renewable source usage to produce power in the U.S. The gradual drop in expenses from emission-less as well as renewable-source power generations are the primary reasons behind the higher usage of renewable energy sources.As per the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), wind energy capacity at the end of 2016 was 81 gigawatts (GW), which is expected to go up to 95 GW by the end of 2018.Xcel Energy shares gained 7.9% over the last one year, compared with the  industry loss of 0.0%.The Zacks rank #3 (Hold) company continues to substantially invest in its utility assets to provide reliable services to its customers and effectively meet rising electricity demand. The company's capital expenditure of $18.4 billion (for 2017 through 2021) is directed toward transmission, distribution, electric generation and renewable projects.

"s the broader markets are headed toward the longest stretch of gains, investors raise doubts over the catalyst behind the surge. They are not sure about how effectively any of President Donald Trump's pro-growth policies like tax cuts, deregulation and infrastructure outlays will materialize or whether the net effect of such policies will stand in good stead.The stock market, moreover, has been on a tear since the presidential election which has left many wondering about whether the market is overheated. Several analysts have also cautioned about stretched valuations. Such uncertainty has made investing in safer bets like utilities a lucrative option. Utility stocks are already gaining traction, with such companies posting encouraging weekly gains.The Dow extended its record-setting streak on Feb 24. The blue-chip index posted its eleventh straight session of record closes for the first time since 1987. The Dow saw the third straight weekly gain, while both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq ended in the green for the fifth consecutive week.U.S. stocks, in fact, have scaled record highs since the Election Day as investors expect Trump's policies on taxes, regulation and infrastructural spending will accelerate growth and boost corporate earnings. Trump plans to overhaul tax codes for business and individuals over the next two to three weeks. He also intends to implement a multi-trillion-dollar tax cut that will boost the U.S. economy and lift corporate profits.Trump also signed an executive order designed to scale back the Dodd-Frank Act. Trump views the Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul as a harsh measure on banks as they had to beef up compliance compartments to deal with a list of new rules, while he also keeps talking about how he wants to reconstruct America's roads, bridges and other infrastructure. This led his administration to unveil a proposal to spend $1 trillion over the next 10 years (read more:  ).However, concerns are growing over the administration's ability to deliver on such plans. Apprehensions are rife that tax cuts may come in later than many have expected. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had said that the Trump tax plan should be in place by August, suggesting much work was still required on the major elements of the sweeping tax reform plan.Trump vowed to repeal ""Obamacare"", although he recently pushed back the timeline for doing so. Such business-friendly reforms are more likely to be slower than expected as Trump's team will be working on only one thing at a time.The big jump in stocks, in the meantime, had come at a time when investors see markets as overpriced. Analysts at The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.  warned that ""we are approaching the point of maximum optimism and the S&P 500 will give back recent gains as investors embrace the reality that tax reform is likely to provide a smaller, later tailwind to corporate earnings than originally expected"". They noted that while markets are rising steadily, expectations for S&P 500 earnings have been declining.The concern was quite apparent when U.S. indices fell modestly all through the session on Feb 24, before a buying spree in the last half hour of trading drove shares. Lest we forget, the Trump-induced rally hasn't factored in less business-friendly campaign rhetoric such as tearing up NAFTA, breaking up banks and even criticizing the Federal Reserve.Even though the stock market has been on a tear of late, investors are maintaining a bearish stance as they question the longevity of the Trump-induced rally. The utility sector, which is less sensitive to gyrations in the broader market and viewed typically as a defensive trade, moved north. Owing to a stable income base, utility companies have the means to pay steady return to shareholders with minimal price volatility and moderate risk.Utility companies registered their best weekly performance on Feb 24 since July as investors poured more into dividend-paying stocks. The Utility Select Sector SPDR  gained 4.1% last week, the highest among the S&P 500 sectors.As the markets are approaching the point of ""maximum optimism"", investors are latching on to relatively safe utility stocks. Such high yield stocks are more in demand after rise in bond prices dragged their yields down. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note slipped to 2.317% on Feb 24, its lowest since late Nov 2016.We have, thus, selected five solid utility stocks that you should bet on amid this backdrop. These stocks boast a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and are well poised to grow in the near term. Such stocks also flaunt a  of 'A' or 'B'.

"he coal industry continues to fight a very difficult battle, with challenges being flung from all quarters, domestic and international. In the U.S., declining  , stringent regulations and additional impetus to solar and wind power generation through the extension of tax credits are steadily luring away utility operators from coal.Jittery developments in key global markets and higher production countries like Australia and Indonesia, and, importantly, a stronger greenback, are making the export market fiercely competitive for the U.S. coal players.After the new Clean Power Plan, was unveiled in Aug 2015, utilities like  (NEE) and  (D) which were already investing to create a green energy generation portfolio have enhanced their emphasis to generate more electricity from clean fuel sources.At present the fate of the Clean Power Plan is uncertain, given the Supreme Court ruling in Feb 2016 to stay the implementation of the Clean Power Plan, and if President Trump starts acting in accordance to his pre-election promises then that can provide an impetus to the ailing coal industry. However, even with uncertainty looming large on Clean Power Plan, new investments are being directed towards natural gas and renewable-based power production, due to the low cost of natural gas and tax credits provided to produce more electricity from solar and wind.Failing to cope with the continuous fall in demand and declining prices of coal, some coal miners have filed for bankruptcy. The latest on this list is Peabody Energy, preceded by names like Patriot Coal and Walter Energy. Notably, these companies had tried all possible means to remain solvent, but the harsh reality is that coal demand is gradually going down.In response to the anti-carbon drive, utility operators are shutting down coal-based power plants and are directing fresh investments toward constructing natural gas facilities and adding more renewables. U.S. coal production touched its lowest levels in 2016 to 739 million short tons (MMst) since 1978.Here are some of the severe headwinds that the coal industry is up against: : Coal has been losing importance as a fuel source over the last few years, particularly in the U.S., in comparison with other sources that are less harmful to the environment. Concerns over the emission of greenhouse gases and global climate change have resulted in the formulation of new legislations and policies which emphasize the use of environment-friendly fuel sources, particularly in the power sector.This has considerably slowed down the expansion of coal-fired capacity in the power sector, with utility companies now building new natural gas-fired plants and resorting to alternative sources of energy generation like wind, solar and hydro power.The final version of the Clean Power Plan will ensure that coal consumption for power production in the U.S. will go down from the present level, unless the utilities invest more money to upgrade existing plants. . (XEL) a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has already reduced carbon dioxide emissions during power generation by around 22% since 2005. You can see Another  (AEP) has eliminated over 5,500 megawatts (MW) of coal-fired capacity from its generation portfolio. : A major substitute for coal in energy generation is another fossil fuel - natural gas. Coal is being dumped in favor of natural gas, which due to extensive exploration and production, and a shale gas boom in onshore U.S., is witnessing significantly lower prices than in the past.Natural gas is an attractive choice for new generating plants because of its relative fuel efficiency, low emissions, quick construction timelines and low capital costs. This trend is encouraging power generating utilities to not only convert their existing plants to gas-fired ones but to build new units.The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects natural gas to contribute to 32% of the total energy generation in 2017, while coal represents 31%. However, in 2018, the share of natural gas is expected to improve 33% while coal's share will remain unchanged.Besides power generation, natural gas is being utilized in new projects in the fertilizer and chemical sectors. : Apart from natural gas, the coal industry has been losing a major share of its electric generation demand to renewable sources of energy.The EIA report reveals combined electricity generation from conventional hydroelectric and renewable will reach 1.753 billion KWh per day in 2017, exhibiting growth of 5.9% from 2016 levels. The production from the alternate sources is anticipated to reach 1.845 billion KWh per day in 2018, reflecting growth of 5.2%.These renewable additions will eat into coal's share of electricity generation. Production of power from renewable sources is supported by most of the U.S. states though there is no national consensus regarding the percentage of renewables in the total energy mix. However, the Clean Power Plan will encourage energy conservation and efficiency plans, use of renewables and clean alternative technologies for lowering air pollution.The extension of the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for solar and Production Tax Credit (PTC) for wind will drive expansion of renewable generation units at the cost of coal. Making use of the government support, NextEra Energy expects to bring on-line nearly 2,400-3,800 MW of new wind projects over the 2017-2018 time frame. : Besides competition from renewables and natural gas, U.S. coal producers are also affected by rising export from Indonesia and Australia as well as a stronger dollar, which is making this commodity dearer in the international markets. International players enjoy the benefit of low mining and transportation costs, consequently making the coal cheaper than their American peers.In Dec 2016, Indian energy giant Adani sated it will start construction at the $21.7 billion Carmichael mine in Australia by the middle of 2017. The company will mine coal and export the same to thermal plants of India, which is bound to increase competition for the U.S. coal exporters.According to the EIA, weak coal demand, lower international coal prices and higher output of other coal exporters have jointly led to decline in coal exports from the U.S. In fact, in 2017, U.S. coal exports are anticipated to drop by 13.8% to 51.1 MMst and further in 2018 by 2.7% to 49.7 MMst. : Capital-intensive coal projects are gradually losing favor among primary funders like banks and financial institutions. Banks are distancing themselves from coal projects and are rather getting involved in natural gas-based power projects.In '  ,' we have focused on factors that can drive the industry forward.Even though President Trump has made promises to revive the coal industry, it will be an uphill task for the new administration to repair the damage already caused to it. The new policies from the Trump administration might bring in temporary relief for the coal miners, but we are skeptical about the long-term viability of the new policies.Billions of dollars are already invested to produce electricity from clean energy sources and more projects are being lined up for approvals, so the question arises in the policy makers' mind will it be feasible to revive coal industry in the long run. Carbon emission is a serious threat for our future and we all agree to this basic fact.At present, we will advise investors to stay away from  (SXCP), which not only carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), but has also registered negative earnings surprises in two of the trailing four quarters. Additionally, its 2017 estimates have gone down by 11.4% in the last 30 days to $1.78 per share.To overcome the difficult times and remain viable, coal producers are idling coal mines, lowering headcount, delaying capital expenditure plans and even resorting to selling their mines. Despite these initiatives, coal producers are bracing themselves for an extended down-cycle, as demand for coal might improve marginally in near term but its share in fuel mix is going down over the long term.To help you find the most promising stocks in this industry, you are invited to download the full list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 ""Strong Buy"" stocks - absolutely free of charge.

"Shutterstock photoIn the latest look at the underlying components of the S&P 500 ordered by largest market capitalization, AutoZone, Inc. (Symbol: AZO) has taken over the #239 spot from Xcel Energy, Inc. (Symbol: XEL), according to  .Market capitalization is an important data point for investors to keep an eye on, for various reasons. The most basic reason is that it gives a true comparison of the value attributed by the stock market to a given company's stock. Many beginning investors look at one stock trading at $10 and another trading at $20 and mistakenly think the latter company is worth twice as much - that of course is a completely meaningless comparison without knowing how many shares of each company exist. But comparing market capitalization (factoring in those share counts) creates a true ""apples-to-apples"" comparison of the value of two stocks. In the case of AutoZone, Inc. (Symbol: AZO), the market cap is now $21.17 billion, versus Xcel Energy, Inc. (Symbol: XEL) at $21.14 billion.Below is a chart of AutoZone, Inc. versus Xcel Energy, Inc. plotting their respective size rank within the S&P 500 over time (AZO plotted in blue; XEL plotted in green):    Below is a three month price history chart comparing the stock performance of AZO vs. XEL:Another reason market capitalization is important is where it places a company in terms of its size tier in relation to peers - much like the way a mid-size sedan is typically compared to other mid-size sedans (and not SUV's). This can have a direct impact on which mutual funds and ETFs are willing to own the stock. For instance, a mutual fund that is focused solely on Large Cap stocks may for example only be interested in those companies sized $10 billion or larger. Another illustrative example is the S&P MidCap index which essentially takes the S&P 500 index and ""tosses out"" the biggest 100 companies so as to focus solely on the 400 smaller ""up-and-comers"" (which in the right environment can outperform their larger rivals). So a company's market cap, especially in relation to other companies, carries great importance, and for this reason we at  find value to putting together these rankings daily.According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, AZO and XEL collectively make up 1.86% of the PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility Portfolio ETF (  ) which is relatively unchanged on the day Wednesday.At the closing bell, AZO is up about 0.5%, while XEL is down about 0.3% on the day Wednesday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@AutoZone Moves Up In Market Cap Rank, Passing Xcel Energy@2017-02-15@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/autozone-moves-market-cap-rank-passing-xcel-energy-2017-02-15

he Q4 earnings season is picking up pace and we saw earnings releases by 171 S&P 500 members as of Jan 30. Reported earnings were up 6% year over year on 3.1% higher revenues. This may well be one of the busiest weeks of this earnings season, with 413 companies (including 106 S&P members) lining up to release financial results.For the remaining 329 index members, projections are of a 5.3% improvement in earnings on 4.0% higher revenues despite expectations of growth in the negative territory for five of the 16 sectors in our coverage.

During his election campaign, Trump had vowed to lower the regulatory pressure on domestic manufacturers and suggested increased investment in energy infrastructure.

" has begun the commercial operation of the largest solar array in the City of Ypsilanti. The company had started construction of the array in Jun 2016 and it was commissioned in September.The Ypsilanti array, with a capacity of 800 kilowatts (""kW""), utilizes 2,520 solar panels, which can almost cover Eastern Michigan University's football field. It will generate enough clean energy for around 150 homes.Located at the junction of Clark Road and River Street on about five acres of land, the array is owned by Highland Cemetery.DTE Energy is Michigan's largest investor in solar and wind assets. The company is currently working on three additional large-scale solar arrays in the cities of Detroit and Lapeer, which are expected to be complete in 2017. With these installations, DTE Energy's total number of solar installations in the state will reach 31.According to Irene Dimitry, Vice President of business and development for DTE Energy, the current installation is part of its long-term plan to build a cleaner and more diversified energy portfolio. The plan also calls for increased focus on sourcing more energy from renewables. | DTE Energy is investing steadily to enhance its renewable generation assets. Over the next 15 years, DTE Electric plans to withdraw a portion of its coal-fired generation, and ramp up contribution from natural gas and renewables.The company plans to continue investing in wind and solar to maintain a balanced portfolio. Currently, it is constructing 50 megawatts (MW) of solar generation and 50 MW of wind generation, in addition to its commitment to reduce usage through energy optimization programs.Regulations pertaining to pollution control are becoming increasingly stringent, making it crucial for utilities to spend more on emission control infrastructure. Meanwhile, because of their clean-burning nature, investment in the alternate energy space could prove to be profitable over the long run. In particular, solar energy, which presently contributes to only 1% of the total electricity generation in the U.S., represents ample scope of improvement in the days to come.DTE Energy currently holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The company's capital expenditure budget of $18.4 billion (for the 2017-2021 period) is directed toward transmission, distribution, electric generation and renewable projects. Sizeable investments are expected to drive rate base growth of 5.4% compounded annually, thereby aiding the top line. Xcel Energy will fund the capital program with cash flows, existing debts and by issuing new debts. | Moreover, economic improvement is increasingly evident across Xcel Energy's service territories, especially in Minnesota, in comparison with the nation as a whole. The consolidated unemployment rate in the company's service territory was 3.5% in September, lower than the national average of 5%. The company witnessed customer additions of 1% in the third quarter that resulted in electric sales growth of 1.6% in the quarter. It's thus clear that market optimism continues to drive Xcel Energy's sales. Going forward, the company's performance is likely to improve with the gradual economic recovery.However, Xcel Energy's long-term debt has increased from the 2011 level of $8.8 billion to $13.4 billion in third-quarter 2016. Rising debt levels translate into higher interest cost burden, which eats into the company's margins.Besides, Xcel Energy's debt/capital ratio stands at 55% compared to the industry average of 50% and the S&P 500 level of 42.6%. Note that the higher the debt relative to its capital, the higher the financial leverage and risk of default.Xcel Energy carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

"Chicago, IL - October 27, 2016 - Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses the Coal, part 3, including  (NYSE:  -  ),  (NYSE:  -  ),  (NYSE:  -  ),  (NYSE:  -  ) and  (NYSE:  -  ).Industry: Coal, part 3Link: The coal industry continues to fight a very difficult battle, with challenges being flung from all quarters, domestic and international. In the U.S., declining  , stringent regulations and additional impetus to solar and wind power generation through the extension of tax credits are steadily driving away utility operators from coal.Jittery development in key global markets and higher production countries like Australia and Indonesia, and, importantly, a stronger greenback, are making the export market fiercely competitive for U.S. coal players.The new Clean Power Plan, unveiled in Aug 2015, calls for CO2 reductions of 28% by 2025 and 32% by 2030, from 2005 levels. This is slightly stricter than the draft proposal wherein the EPA had proposed total CO2 reduction of 29% by 2025 and 30% by 2030. Utilities like  (NYSE:  -  ) and  (NYSE:  -  ) are investing consistently to increase their green generation portfolio.Another operator in this space,  (NYSE:  -  ) is planning to wind down its old coal-fired electricity generation units. Meanwhile, the company will add increase the share of natural gas and renewable energy in its generation portfolio in order to its carbon footprint over the long run. This stock has surpassed earnings estimates in three out of the last four quarters. It currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see  .Failing to cope with the continuous fall in demand and declining prices of coal, some coal miners have filed for bankruptcy. The latest on this list is Peabody Energy, preceded by names like Arch Coal Inc., Patriot Coal, Alpha Natural Resources and Walter Energy. These companies tried all possible means to remain solvent, but we have to accept the harsh reality that coal demand is down and almost out.In response to the anti-carbon drive, utility operators are shutting down coal-based power plants and are directing fresh investments toward constructing natural gas facilities and adding more renewables. U.S. coal production during the second quarter of 2016 was 160.5 million short tons (MMst). This reflects a decline of 7.2% sequentially and 24.4% year over year.Per a release from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the decline in U.S. coal production is expected to continue through 2016, with output expected to tumble 19.1% or by 171.1 MMst from the 2015 levels.Here are some of the severe headwinds that the coal industry is up against: Coal has been losing its importance as a fuel source over the last few years, particularly in the U.S., vis-à-vis other sources that are much less harmful to the environment. Concerns over the emission of greenhouse gases and global climate change have resulted in the formulation of new legislations and policies which emphasize the use of environment-friendly fuel sources, particularly in the power sector.This has considerably slowed down the expansion of coal-fired capacity in the power sector, with utility companies now building new natural gas-fired plants and resorting to alternative sources of energy generation like wind, solar and hydro power.The final version of the Clean Power Plan will ensure that coal consumption for power production in the U.S. will go down from the present level, unless the utilities pour more money to upgrade existing plants. (NYSE:  -  ) has already reduced carbon dioxide emissions during power generation by around 22% since 2005 and  (NYSE:  -  ) has eliminated over 5,500 megawatts (MW) of coal-fired capacity. NextEra Energy's unit, Florida Power & Light Company decided to purchase a 330-MW coal-based power plant with the intention of phasing it out gradually to lower carbon emission.Due to such legislative stringency, coal usage in electric generation is expected to witness a decline this year. In fact, the EIA forecasts coal consumption in power generation of 673 MMst, down 9.1% from 2015. A major substitute for coal in energy generation is another fossil fuel - natural gas. Coal is being dumped in favor of natural gas, which due to extensive exploration and production and a shale gas boom in onshore U.S., is seeing significantly lower prices than in the past.Natural gas is usually an attractive choice for new generating plants because of its relative fuel efficiency, low emissions, quick construction timelines and low capital costs. This trend is encouraging power generators to not only convert their existing plants to gas-fired ones but to build new units.The EIA expects natural gas to contribute to 35% of the total generation in 2016, while coal represents 30%. However, in 2017, the share of natural gas is expected to dip to 34% while coal's inches up 31%.Besides power generation, clean burning natural gas is being utilized in new projects in the fertilizer and chemical sectors. Apart from natural gas, the coal industry has been losing a major share of its electric generation demand to renewable sources of energy.The EIA report reveals expectations of a 6.3% year-over-year increase in renewable energy consumption to 10.513 Quadrillion Btu in 2016 and a 3.7% rise to 10.533 Quadrillion Btu in 2017.These renewable additions will eat into coal's share of electricity generation. Production of power from renewable sources is supported by most of the U.S. states though there is no national consensus regarding the percentage of renewables in the total energy mix. However, the Clean Power Plan will encourage energy conservation and efficiency plans, use of renewables and clean alternative technologies for lowering air pollution.The extension of the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for solar and Production Tax Credit (PTC) for wind will drive further additions in renewable generation units at the cost of coal. Making use of the government support, NextEra Energy expects to bring on-line nearly 2,400-3,800 MW of new wind projects over the 2017-2018 timeframe.Many are little publicized and fly under the Wall Street radar.

" has received an approval from the Louisiana Public Service Commission (""LPSC"") to construct a natural gas-fired, combined-cycle power plant in St. Charles Parish.With the LPSC vote, Entergy Louisiana can now start the construction of the 980-megawatt (""MW"") unit in Montz, around 30 miles from New Orleans. The plant is scheduled to begin commercial operations by Jun 2019. The cost of building the plant, including transmission and other project-related expenses, is approximately $869 million.This plant will offer a reliable source of clean and affordable energy that will duly satisfy customer demand and help drive economic growth in southeast Louisiana. It is also expected to facilitate sustainable reliability of the electric grid and ease the process of repairing the same after major storm events that hamper the transmission system.The St. Charles Power Station, once built, will be one of the cleanest fossil fuel-fired units in Entergy Louisiana's generation fleet. Throughout the expected 30-year life of the unit, customers are projected to save over $1.3 billion, which will exceed the project's construction cost by 10 years.According to an analysis by Louisiana economist, Dr. Loren Scott, during the plant's construction phase, an estimated 2,000 direct and indirect jobs will be generated annually across the state. It is also expected to boost Louisiana business sales by $1.4 billion and household earnings by $476.8 million.Notably, Entergy Louisiana decided to build the unit after evaluating all other options submitted through a 2014 request for proposals for power resources to cater to southeast Louisiana. An independent monitor supervised the procurement and selection process, which was conducted after discussing with the LPSC staff. | Entergy has stated plans to invest $10.3 billion in the 2017-2019 time frame, comprising $4.36 billion for generation, $2.84 billion for distribution and $2.45 billion for transmission. The company expects grid upgrades, asset replacement and industrial load growth to drive bottom-line growth.In addition to pursuing opportunities in the generation business, the company has a strong project pipeline as well as the LPSC approval to replace 100 miles of pipe over the next 10 years. A combination of different types of projects will enable the company to diversify its revenue stream.Entergy currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A few better-ranked stocks in the utility sector include DTE Energy Company  , CenterPoint Energy, Inc.  and Xcel Energy Inc.  . All the three stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see  .DTE Energy witnessed a 1.3% rise in its last five days' stock price.

 has recently signed twin sell out deals, worth a total value of $2.4 billion; to finally reduce its international exposure. This leaves the company with the 25% equity stake it has in National Methanol Company (NMC) overseas, which its management plans to retain. The after-tax gains from the transactions are expected to contribute to the company's debt reduction.Per the terms of one of the contracts, I Squared Capital - an independent global infrastructure investment manager - will purchase Duke Energy's international assets situated in Peru, Chile, Ecuador, Guatemala, El Salvador and Argentina, for a total enterprise value of $1.2 billion. This will mark the company's final exit from its Latin American business.These Latin American assets of Duke Energy include hydroelectric and natural gas generation plants, transmission infrastructure and natural gas processing facilities, totaling 2,300 megawatt (MW) of installed capacity. This deal requires Argentina's antitrust approval, although the approval is not a condition of closing.Under the terms of the second agreement, clean energy company - China Three Gorges Corporation - has agreed to acquire Duke Energy's entire Brazilian business, consisting of eight hydroelectric plants and two small hydro power plants, for a total of $1.2 billion. These assets represent an accumulative installed capacity of 2,090 MW. | Duke Energy's International Energy segment has been underperforming for past few quarters, owing to ongoing draught conditions in Brazil, decreased demand in both Brazil and Latin America, as well as unfavorable foreign exchange rates hampering the company's results overseas. Consequently, in Feb, 2016, Duke Energy announced its near term plan of divesting its International Energy business segment, excluding the equity investment in NMC and give more emphasis on growing its operations in the domestic front.Management expected this sale to improve the company's risk profile and enhance its ability to generate more consistent earnings and cash flows over time.In the business world, there lies no value in retaining non-profitable assets. Considering the widespread volatility prevailing across Latin America, as well as persistent fluctuations observable in oil price amid skepticism of an OPEC production cut, it has become quite difficult for energy stocks to survive, especially in low-demand regions like Latin America.Inevitably, Duke Energy's future prospects in its international business segment are bleak, at least in the near term. Hence, a divestment strategy is a wise option to adopt. We believe, with this sell out, the company will now be able to focus on nurturing its core domestic business, wherein it has recently completed the $1.8 billion worth Piedmont Natural Gas takeover.Notably this latest buyout will increase the company's total regulated business mix to over 90%, thereby supporting its earnings and dividend growth objectives. Moreover, the acquisition will be accretive to its earnings in 2017.Duke Energy currently carries a Zacks Rank # 3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks in the utility sector include DTE Energy Company  , Edison International  and Xcel Energy Inc.  . All the three stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see  .DTE Energy has witnessed a 0.6% rise in its last 5 days' stock price. This company's current year consensus estimate improved 0.8% in last 7 days.Edison International has witnessed a 1.08% rise in its last 5 days' stock price.

he Q3 earnings season is picking up pace with 116 S&P 500 members having already reported their results. Reported earnings were up 3.3% year over year on 1.8% higher revenues. This will probably be one of the busiest weeks of this earnings season, with 810 companies (including 171 S&P members) lining up to release financial results.For the remaining index members, projections are of a 0.1% improvement in earnings on 1.5% higher revenues despite the expectations of a 72.6% plunge in earnings on 12.2% deterioration in revenues for the Oil & Energy sector. Notably, this could be the first quarter to record positive earnings growth after five quarters of back-to-back declines.Seven out of the 16 sectors in the Zacks coverage universe are expected to witness earnings decline this season. However, utility is among the remaining nine sectors that are expected to record growth in the positive territory this season. Read more details in our weekly Earnings Preview report.Let us now focus on the utility sector, which is characterized by its defensive nature and domestic orientation.Stringent emission control laws have spurred the demand for clean burning sources of energy like natural gas and renewables, lowering the usage of coal in electricity production. Per recent projections by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the share of natural gas in the electricity generation mix will increase to nearly 35% in 2016, reflecting growing preference for the fuel Utility.This sector is known for its capital-intensive nature. This is because these companies need huge capital for setting up generation facilities, and transmission and distribution infrastructure. They also require considerable funds for upgrading the existing systems to meet emission control standards.Because of their capital-intensive nature, utilities have been benefiting from the rock-bottom interest rate environment. However, talks hinting at a rate hike before the end of the year could hamper the growth momentum of the sector. Nevertheless, we expect warmer-than-normal weather in the U.S. during the third quarter to boost sales to a large extent.In the third quarter of 2016, sector earnings are expected to be up 5.7% on 4.6% higher revenues.Let's take a look at a few utilities that are scheduled to report quarterly numbers on Oct 27. reported a positive earnings surprise of 28.57% last quarter.

 will release third-quarter 2016 financial results before the market opens on Oct 27. Last quarter, this electric and natural gas utility's earnings recorded a negative earnings surprise of 4.88%.Let's see how things are shaping up at the company prior to this announcement.Above-average temperatures in its service territories in the third quarter are expected drive top-line growth. Further, the company is confident that its cost management initiatives will pay off in the quarter.Moreover, unemployment rates lower than the national average in its service territories indicate improving economic fundamentals, which is expected to add to Xcel Energy's top line. | Our proven model does not conclusively show that Xcel Energy is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here, as you will see below. The company has an Earnings ESP of -1.14% because the Most Accurate estimate stands at 87 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 88 cents. Though Xcel Energy's Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP, its negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are a few stocks in the utility space worth considering on the basis of our model, as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:CMS Energy Corp.  scheduled to report earnings on Oct 27.

"he coal industry continues to fight a very difficult battle, with challenges being flung from all quarters, domestic and international. In the U.S., declining  , stringent regulations and additional impetus to solar and wind power generation through the extension of tax credits are steadily driving away utility operators from coal.Jittery development in key global markets and higher production countries like Australia and Indonesia, and, importantly, a stronger greenback, are making the export market fiercely competitive for U.S. coal players.The new Clean Power Plan, unveiled in Aug 2015, calls for CO2 reductions of 28% by 2025 and 32% by 2030, from 2005 levels. This is slightly stricter than the draft proposal wherein the EPA had proposed total CO2 reduction of 29% by 2025 and 30% by 2030. Utilities like  (NEE) and  (D) are investing consistently to increase their green generation portfolio.Another operator in this space, DTE Energy (DTE) is planning to wind down its old coal-fired electricity generation units. Meanwhile, the company will add increase the share of natural gas and renewable energy in its generation portfolio in order to its carbon footprint over the long run. This stock has surpassed earnings estimates in three out of the last four quarters.It currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see  .Failing to cope with the continuous fall in demand and declining prices of coal, some coal miners have filed for bankruptcy. The latest on this list is Peabody Energy, preceded by names like Arch Coal Inc., Patriot Coal, Alpha Natural Resources and Walter Energy. These companies tried all possible means to remain solvent, but we have to accept the harsh reality that coal demand is down and almost out.In response to the anti-carbon drive, utility operators are shutting down coal-based power plants and are directing fresh investments toward constructing natural gas facilities and adding more renewables.U.S. coal production during the second quarter of 2016 was 160.5 million short tons (MMst). This reflects a decline of 7.2% sequentially and 24.4% year over year.Per a release from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the decline in U.S. coal production is expected to continue through 2016, with output expected to tumble 19.1% or by 171.1 MMst from the 2015 levels.Here are some of the severe headwinds that the coal industry is up against: Coal has been losing its importance as a fuel source over the last few years, particularly in the U.S., vis-à-vis other sources that are much less harmful to the environment. Concerns over the emission of greenhouse gases and global climate change have resulted in the formulation of new legislations and policies which emphasize the use of environment-friendly fuel sources, particularly in the power sector.This has considerably slowed down the expansion of coal-fired capacity in the power sector, with utility companies now building new natural gas-fired plants and resorting to alternative sources of energy generation like wind, solar and hydro power.The final version of the Clean Power Plan will ensure that coal consumption for power production in the U.S. will go down from the present level, unless the utilities pour more money to upgrade existing plants. (XEL) has already reduced carbon dioxide emissions during power generation by around 22% since 2005 and  (AEP) has eliminated over 5,500 megawatts (MW) of coal-fired capacity. NextEra Energy's unit, Florida Power & Light Company decided to purchase a 330-MW coal-based power plant with the intention of phasing it out gradually to lower carbon emission.Due to such legislative stringency, coal usage in electric generation is expected to witness a decline this year. In fact, the EIA forecasts coal consumption in power generation of 673 MMst, down 9.1% from 2015. A major substitute for coal in energy generation is another fossil fuel - natural gas. Coal is being dumped in favor of natural gas, which due to extensive exploration and production and a shale gas boom in onshore U.S., is seeing significantly lower prices than in the past.Natural gas is usually an attractive choice for new generating plants because of its relative fuel efficiency, low emissions, quick construction timelines and low capital costs. This trend is encouraging power generators to not only convert their existing plants to gas-fired ones but to build new units.The EIA expects natural gas to contribute to 35% of the total generation in 2016, while coal represents 30%. However, in 2017, the share of natural gas is expected to dip to 34% while coal's inches up 31%.Besides power generation, clean burning natural gas is being utilized in new projects in the fertilizer and chemical sectors. Apart from natural gas, the coal industry has been losing a major share of its electric generation demand to renewable sources of energy.The EIA report reveals expectations of a 6.3% year-over-year increase in renewable energy consumption to 10.513 Quadrillion Btu in 2016 and a 3.7% rise to 10.533 Quadrillion Btu in 2017.These renewable additions will eat into coal's share of electricity generation. Production of power from renewable sources is supported by most of the U.S. states though there is no national consensus regarding the percentage of renewables in the total energy mix. However, the Clean Power Plan will encourage energy conservation and efficiency plans, use of renewables and clean alternative technologies for lowering air pollution.The extension of the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for solar and Production Tax Credit (PTC) for wind will drive further additions in renewable generation units at the cost of coal. Making use of the government support, NextEra Energy expects to bring on-line nearly 2,400-3,800 MW of new wind projects over the 2017-2018 timeframe. Besides competition from renewables and natural gas, U.S. coal producers are also affected by rising export from Indonesia and Australia and a stronger dollar, which is making this commodity dearer in the international markets. International players enjoy the benefit of low mining and transportation costs, which also make their coal cheaper than their American peers.According to the EIA, weak coal demand, lower international coal prices and higher output of other coal exporters have jointly led to a decline in coal exports from the U.S. In fact, in 2016, U.S. coal exports are expected to tumble by 19.5 MMst (down 26%), while in 2017, it will decline by 2.5 MMst (down 5%). Capital-intensive coal projects are gradually losing favor among primary funders like banks and financial institutions. Bankers like  (BAC),  (C) and  (MS) are distancing themselves from coal projects and are rather getting involved in natural gas-based power projects.In '  ,' we have focused on the factors that can drive the industry forward.However, the continuous fall in demand and soft prices have stretched the financial capabilities of coal miners. Many of these leading companies are being put under the ""self-bonding"" test. Self-bonding is a government program that allows producers of coal to economically insure their clean-up costs in case of a bankruptcy.At present, we will advise investors to stay away from  (WLB), which not only has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), but has also registered negative earnings surprises thrice in the last four quarters. In addition, its projected loss per share in 2016 widened to $1.53 from a loss of 83 cents in the last 60 days.To overcome the difficult times and remain viable, coal producers are idling coal mines, lowering headcount, delaying capital expenditure plans and even resorting to sell their mines. Despite these initiatives, coal producers are bracing themselves for an extended down-cycle, as demand for coal is not going to improve radically any time soon.Beyond this Industry Outlook, would you like to see Zacks' best recommendations that are not available to the public?

n response to a federal lawsuit and a statewide legislation,  has announced plans to remove nearly 5 million tons of coal ash from three basins at the Buck Steam station in North Carolina.In 2014, the Southern Environmental Law Centre filed a lawsuit against Duke Energy citing the toxic impact of ash produced from coal-fired power generating facilities. Coal ash contains a high percentage of toxic metal compounds, which gradually seeps into groundwater and contaminates it.Duke Energy is also working to comply with 2015 General Assembly legislation, which requires coal-based companies to install at least three recycling facilities for processing coal ash, each with a minimum annual capacity of processing 300,000 tons of coal ash. Duke Energy is presently assessing the locations for the second and the third recycling units.Duke Energy is making substantial investment in technology at the Buck Steam station to process coal ash into concrete for ultimately manufacturing cement. Ash generated at the Buck facility contains a very high proportion of carbon, which makes it unsuitable for use in manufacturing cement. Thus, the company has to install the necessary technology for making the by-product usable in cement manufacturing. | Note that this plan has two-fold benefits - it is both environment-friendly and will generate substantial income thanks to the recycling facility's proximity to several major cement markets.Duke Energy's efforts to expand its renewable asset base in light of the increasingly stringent environmental regulations have been commendable. In Apr 2016, the company raised its 2020 renewable energy goal by 33% on the back of continued growth in renewable energy. The company expects to own or acquire 8,000 megawatts (MW) of wind, solar and biomass capacity by 2020, marking a substantial increase over the 2013 target of 6,000 MW. The company is also committed to the construction and expansion of the scale of its solar and wind projects across the U.S.Among the utilities that are making significant investment in renewable energy, NextEra Energy, Inc.  , NRG Energy, Inc.  and Xcel Energy Inc.'s  have been noteworthy.Beyond this Analyst Blog, would you like to see Zacks' best recommendations that are not available to the public?

"ith interest rates in the basement and likely to stay there for some time, investors have, for good reason, flocked to dividend-paying stocks. But demand has pushed up the prices of many popular payers to possibly unsustainable levels. These stocks could be vulnerable to steep declines.People who can live off of their dividend income and can ignore share-price fluctuations may not have to worry much about a market reversal. After all, given enough time, the price of a good company will eventually recover. But investors who can't stomach a downturn--even if it proves temporary--may want to lighten up on some overpriced  .We've identified five dividend payers that look overvalued and that you should consider unloading. Keep in mind that if you own these stocks in a taxable account, selling could generate capital gains, on which you might have to pay income taxes.Symbol: Price: $61.03Market capitalization: $18.8 billionAnnual dividend rate per share: $1.25Dividend yield: 2.0%Price-earnings ratio: 20Investors have taken comfort in Campbell Soup and the comfort foods it produces for more than a century. But Campbell, which makes its eponymous soups, Pepperidge Farm baked goods and Prego pasta sauces, among other things, is a mature company with stagnant sales. It essentially has been able to generate modest earnings gains by cutting costs. And although analysts see earnings rising by 6% in the fiscal year that ends in July 2017, they expect revenues to inch up by just 1%.Tepid growth notwithstanding, Campbell's shares have returned 24% over the past year. The stock, which boasted a dividend yield of 4.2% at the end of 2012, now pays just 2.0% (yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend rate by the share price). That's less than the 2.2% yield of Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the 2.6% yield of the average consumer-staples stock. Moreover, Campbell hasn't raised the payout since 2013. And at 20 times estimated year-ahead earnings, Campbell's P/E is higher than the overall market's P/E of 17.SEE ALSO: Symbol: Price: $98.95Market capitalization: $12.7 billionAnnual dividend rate per share: $1.42Dividend yield: 1.4%Price-earnings ratio: 27Church & Dwight, maker of Arm & Hammer and OxiClean products, has long been a stock market star, thanks largely to the company's ability to turn modest upticks in sales into impressive profit gains. The stock's price has doubled since October 2012. But over that period, the dividend rate has climbed only half as much, from 96 cents per share to the current $1.42. As a result, the yield is now just 1.4%. Meanwhile, earnings have climbed just 11% annualized over the past four years, and analysts expect slightly slower growth over the next few years. The stock sells for a rich 27 times estimated earnings.Simon Shoucair, an analyst at Value Line, says Church & Dwight is a fine company, but at today's price, he waves investors away from the stock. ""Those seeking to buy and hold should look elsewhere,"" he says.SEE ALSO: Symbol: Price: $76.50Market capitalization: $23.3 billionAnnual dividend rate per share: $2.68Dividend yield: 3.5%Price-earnings ratio: 19Shares of the big New York City-based utility have delivered un-utility-like results lately, soaring 34% since June 2015. Like most utilities, Con Ed is a slow grower. Earnings have climbed at an annualized pace of 3% over the past five years, and analysts see them edging up at just 2% annually over the next few years. Meanwhile, the dividend has risen at annual rate of just 2.2% over the past five years. With a P/E of 19, the stock looks precarious, says Travis Miller, director of utilities research at Morningstar.Moreover, regulators in New York, where Con Ed does the bulk of its business, are rethinking the utility industry rulebook. In a state already known for tough regulation, the risk of even tighter standards makes Con Ed's rich valuation seem foolhardy, says Miller. He suggests that investors step to the sidelines until the regulatory outlook clears up.Symbol: Price: $52.48Market capitalization: $29.3 billionAnnual dividend rate per share: $1.24Dividend yield: 2.4%Price-earnings ratio: 23Shares of Sysco, the nation's leading distributor of food and food-related equipment and supplies to restaurants, hospitals and other institutions, have been on a tear. Year to date, the stock has returned 29%, far outpacing the overall market's advance. Because the share price has been climbing much faster than Sysco's dividend, the stock, which yielded nearly 4% at the end of 2013, now pays 2.4%.Sysco is a steady grower. Earnings from operations rose 10% in the fiscal year that ended June 30, and analysts see a similar increase in the current fiscal year. To be sure, Sysco's predictable earnings and healthy balance sheet provide comfort to risk-averse investors. But Value Line analyst Robert Greene says the stock's sizzling performance, which has pushed up the P/E to 23, leaves little room for near-term price appreciation.SEE ALSO: Symbol: Price: $42.42Market capitalization: $21.6 billionAnnual dividend rate per share: $1.36Dividend yield: 3.2%Price-earnings ratio: 19Xcel Energy is the parent of utilities that provide electricity, natural gas or both in the central U.S.--Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, Texas, Wisconsin and the Dakotas. The company has done a good job of working with regulators to produce steady profits, and it in turn has rewarded investors with regular (though modest) dividend hikes.But the geographic regions Xcel's utilities serve aren't growing much, so they're likely to produce tepid gains in both revenues and earnings. The company is now waiting to hear whether Minnesota regulators will approve rate hikes that could help fuel future earnings and revenues, but that decision isn't likely to be made for another year.Yet, like many other utilities, Xcel's stock has been booming--the shares have roared ahead 33% since June 2015. Morningstar's Miller says the stock's price is 26% higher than he thinks the company is worth. And Value Line analyst Paul Debbas says the stock's long-term total-return potential is ""negligible.""QUIZ: The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@5 Dividend Stocks to Consider Selling@2016-08-24@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/5-dividend-stocks-consider-selling-2016-08-24
n Aug 18, 2016  we issued an updated report on  .Rising debt levels and operational risks are headwinds for Xcel Energy. However, the company's long-term investment plans will strengthen operations and help serve its expanding customer base more reliably and efficiently.Recently, Xcel Energy reported second-quarter 2016 operating earnings of 39 cents per share, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 41 cents by 4.9%. However, reported earnings were on par with the year-ago quarter figure. Meanwhile, Xcel Energy's second-quarter revenues of $2,499.8 million lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,530 million by 1.2% and also declined marginally from the prior-year quarter level of $2,515.1 million.The company's long-term debt has witnessed consistent growth from the 2011 level of $8.8 billion to the second-quarter 2016 tally of $13.1 billion. Rising debt levels translate into higher interest cost burden, which eats into the company's margins. Xcel Energy's debt/capital ratio stands at 55%, compared to the industry average of 49.8% and the S&P 500 level of 41.9%. Note that the higher the debt relative to its capital, the higher the financial leverage and risk of default. | Compliance with stringent environmental regulations hampers Xcel Energy's cash flows. Even though the company is gradually shifting to alternative energy sources, coal remains a primary fuel for power generation. The company generated 43% of its total electricity from coal-fired plants in 2015. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) finalized Clean Power Plan requires carbon emissions from the power sector to be reduced by 32% by 2030 from 2005 levels. To meet the new emission standards, Xcel Energy will have to invest substantially in pollution control measures at its power generation facilities.Nevertheless, signs of economic improvement are prominent across Xcel Energy's service territories, especially in Minnesota, in comparison to the entire nation. The consolidated unemployment rate at the company's service territory was 3.4% in June, below the national average of 4.9%.The company witnessed customer additions of 1% in the second quarter. Market optimism continues to drive the company's performance.Xcel Energy carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Some better-ranked stocks in the utility space are Korea Electric Power Corp.  , Spark Energy, Inc.  and DTE Energy Company  . Both Korea Electric and Spark Energy sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while DTE Energy is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"n recent trading, shares of Xcel Energy, Inc. (Symbol: XEL) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $42.62, changing hands for $42.96/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 8 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Xcel Energy, Inc., but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $36.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $48.00. The standard deviation is $4.138.But the whole reason to look at the  XEL price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with XEL crossing above that average target price of $42.62/share, investors in XEL have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $42.62 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Xcel Energy, Inc.:

ith earnings releases coming in thick and fast, nearly 87% members of the S&P 500 index will have revealed financial numbers for the quarter by the end of this week. The utility sector, known for its inherent stability, will be in focus this week, as many companies operating in the space have lined up to declare quarterly results.Note that a domestic orientation makes utilities immune to the impact of a strengthening dollar. However, the performance of these companies depends greatly on weather patterns. Above-average temperatures in the second quarter of 2016, therefore, aided the performance of the majority of utilities operating in the U.S. The steady drop in unemployment rates should further boost results of the sector this quarter.So far, 317 S&P 500 members have released second-quarter results, accounting for 73.5% of the index's total market capitalization. Total earnings for these companies have declined 3.3% due to 0.9% lower revenues. In spite of the bleak year-over-year comparisons, an impressive 72.9% managed to beat on earnings, while 53.6% surpassed top-line expectations.As per the latest  , the general outlook for the utility sector remains bullish on the back of the projections of a 20.4% year-over-year surge in quarterly earnings, compared to the S&P 500's anticipated 3.4% drop over the same period, including the results of the energy sector. On the other hand, revenues at the utility sector will grow 5.2%, compared to the S&P 500's 0.4% dip.Encouraged by a bullish outlook and positive fundamentals, particularly the low-rate scenario, let's take a look at some utilities that are scheduled to report earnings on Aug 3:Energy producer  , a Zacks Rank #3 stock, possesses one of the largest British Thermal Unit production capabilities among the integrated utilities operating in northeastern U.S. Our proven model does not conclusively show that Dominion Resources is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

iversified energy company  announced that its unit Dominion Virginia Power received approval from the State Corporation Commission on Jun 30 to build three utility scale solar energy facilities in Virginia. The addition of these solar energy facilities is part of the company's Integrated Resource Plan to increase renewal energy in its generation fleet and lower the usage of coal.The three solar facilities will be located in Isle of Wight, Louisa and Powhatan counties and will employ a total of about 800 workers during the construction phase, which is expected to take about six months to complete.In addition, these solar facilities will have a cumulative economic impact of $74 million from the 2015 planning phase to the 2017 completion of the projects. | Per the Integrated Resource Plan, the company aims to add 400 megawatt (MW) of solar facilities in Virginia within 2016 to 2020. Dominion also aims to add 600 MW of solar facilities in North Carolina by 2017.The objective of this Resource Plan is to lower the usage of coal in the fuel mix, utilize more clean energy sources and meet the requirements of the Clean Power Plan.In Aug 2015, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency released the final version of the Clean Power Plan. The plan calls for CO2 reduction of 28% by 2025 and 32% by 2030, from 2005 levels. The Supreme Court ruling in Feb 2016 temporarily stayed the implementation of the plan and blocked the efforts of the U.S. administration to lower global warming by regulating emissions from coal-fired power plants.Even though the plan has been temporarily stayed by the Supreme Court, utilities have been taking proactive measures to lower their dependence on coal (the most guilty for emissions) for electricity generation. Apart from Dominion, utilities like Xcel Energy Inc.  and American Electric Power Co., Inc.  among others have taken steps to curtail their carbon footprint.Dominion Resources currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in the utility space is Duke Energy Corporation  , currently carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"he coal industry continues to fight a very difficult battle, with challenges being flung from all quarters, domestic and international. In the U.S., declining  , stringent regulations and additional impetus to solar and wind power generation through the extension of tax credit are steadily driving away utility operators from coal.Jittery development in key global markets and higher production countries like Australia and Indonesia, and, importantly, a stronger greenback, are making the export market fiercely competitive for U.S. coal players.The new Clean Power Plan, unveiled in Aug 2015, calls for CO2 reductions of 28% by 2025 and 32% by 2030, from 2005 levels. This is slightly stricter than the draft proposal wherein the EPA had proposed total CO2 reduction of 29% by 2025 and 30% by 2030. Utilities like  (NEE) and  (D) are investing consistently to increase their green generation portfolio.Failing to cope with the continuous fall in demand and declining prices of coal, some coal miners have filed for bankruptcy. The latest on this list is Peabody Energy, preceded by names like Arch Coal Inc., Patriot Coal, Alpha Natural Resources and Walter Energy. These companies tried all possible means to remain solvent, but we have to accept the harsh reality that coal demand is down and almost out.In response to the anti-carbon drive, utility operators are shutting down coal-based power plants and are directing fresh investments toward constructing natural gas facilities and adding more renewables.Per a release from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), U.S. coal production in May 2016 was 50 million short tons (MMst), down 28% from May 2015. Coal production declines are forecast to continue through 2016, with output expected to decline 17% or 155 MMst from 2015 levels.Here are some of the severe headwinds that the coal industry is up against: Coal has been losing its importance as a fuel source over the last few years, particularly in the U.S., vis-à-vis other sources that are much less harmful to the environment. Concerns over the emission of greenhouse gases and global climate change have resulted in the formulation of new legislations and policies which emphasize the use of environment-friendly fuel sources, particularly in the power sector.This has considerably slowed down the expansion of coal-fired capacity in the power sector, with utility companies now building new natural gas-fired plants and resorting to alternative sources of energy generation like wind, solar and hydro power.The final version of the Clean Power Plan will ensure that coal consumption for power production in the U.S. will go down from the present level, unless the utilities pour more money to upgrade existing plants. (XEL) has already reduced carbon dioxide emissions during power generation by around 22% since 2005 and  (AEP) has eliminated over 5,500 megawatt (MW) of coal-fired capacity. NextEra Energy's unit Florida Power & Light Company decided to purchase a 330 MW coal-based power plant with the intention to phase it out gradually to lower carbon emission. A major substitute for coal in energy generation is another fossil fuel - natural gas. Coal is being dumped in favor of natural gas, which due to extensive exploration and production and a shale gas boom in onshore U.S., is seeing significantly lower prices than in the past.Natural gas is usually an attractive choice for new generating plants because of its relative fuel efficiency, low emissions, quick construction timelines and low capital costs. This trend is encouraging power generators to not only convert their existing plants to gas-fired ones but to build new units.The EIA expects natural gas to feed 34.4% of total generation, while coal will fuel 29.9% of total production in 2016. The EIA however forecasts the share of natural gas to fall slightly to 33.3% and coal to rise to 30.9% in 2017.Besides power generation, clean burning natural gas is being utilized in new projects in the fertilizer and chemical sectors. Apart from natural gas, the coal industry has been losing a major share of its electric generation demand to renewable sources of energy.The EIA report reveals renewables used in the electric power sector to increase by 13.0% in 2016 and by 3.3% in 2017. These renewable additions will eat into coal's share of electricity generation. Production of power from renewable sources is supported by most of the U.S. states though there is no national consensus regarding the percentage of renewables in the total energy mix. However, the Clean Power Plan will encourage energy conservation and efficiency plans, use of renewables and clean alternative technologies for lowering air pollution.The extension of the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for solar and Production Tax Credit (PTC) for wind will drive further additions in renewable generation units at the cost of coal. Making use of the government support, NextEra Energy expects to bring on-line nearly 2,400-3,800 MW of new wind projects over the 2017-2018 timeframe. Besides competition from renewables and natural gas, U.S. coal producers are also affected by rising export from Indonesia and Australia and a stronger dollar, which is making this commodity dearer in the international markets. International players enjoy the benefit of low mining and transportation costs, which also make their coal cheaper than their American peers.The EIA release sums up that weak coal demand, lower international coal prices and a higher output in other coal-exporting countries have led to a decline in U.S. coal exports. U.S. coal exports are expected to decrease by 8 MMst each in 2016 (down 10%) and 2017 (down 12%). Capital intensive coal projects are gradually losing favor among primary funders like banks and financial institutions. Bankers like  (BAC),  (C) and  (MS) are distancing themselves from coal projects and are rather getting involved in natural gas based power projectsIn ""  "" we focused on the conditions which are expected to drive the industry forward.However, the continuous fall in demand and soft prices have stretched the financial capabilities of the coal miners. Many of these leading companies are being put under the ""self-bonding"" test. Self-bonding is a government program that allows producers of coal to economically insure their clean-up costs in case of a bankruptcy. At present, we will advise investors to stay away from  (AHGP), which not only has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) but has registered negative earnings surprises in the last four quarters.To overcome the difficult times and remain viable, coal producers are idling coal mines, lowering headcount, delaying capital expenditure plans and even resorting to sell their mines. Despite these initiatives, coal producers are bracing themselves for an extended down-cycle, as demand for coal is not going to improve radically any time soon.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Let's see how things are shaping up at the company prior to this announcement.Xcel Energy's first quarter earnings are expected to benefit from rate increases approved in various jurisdictions in the previous year. However, weather had a negative impact of 7 cents on fourth-quarter 2015 earnings and we expect warm temperatures to again have a detrimental effect in the first quarter.Amid increasing regulatory pressure, Xcel Energy has resorted to cost reduction initiatives, which are expected to benefit first-quarter results like it did last quarter. The company is proactively lowering its fuel mix for electricity generation. In 2015, coal accounted for 43% of its fuel mix, down from 56% in 2005, which is further expected to go down to 31% in 2030.The above chart indicates that Xcel Energy was able to deliver a positive surprise in only one out of the last four quarters.

"Chicago, IL - March 08, 2016 - Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses the Coal, (Part 3), including  and Industry: Coal, part 3Link: The coal industry continues to flight a very difficult battle, with challenges being flung from all quarters, domestic and international. In the U.S., declining  , stringent regulations and additional impetus to solar and wind power generation through the extension of tax credit are steadily driving away utility operators from coal.Jittery development in key global markets and higher production countries like Australia and Indonesia and importantly a stronger greenback are making the export market fiercely competitive for U.S. coal players.The new Clean Power Plan, unveiled in Aug 2015, calls for CO2 reductions of 28% by 2025 and 32% by 2030, from 2005 levels. This is slightly stricter than the draft proposal wherein the EPA had proposed total CO2 reduction of 29% by 2025 and 30% by 2030.Failing to cope with the continuous fall in demand and declining prices of coal, a few coal miners have filed for bankruptcy. The latest in the list is Arch Coal Inc., preceded by names like Patriot Coal, Alpha Natural Resources and Walter Energy. These companies tried all possible means to remain solvent but we have to accept the harsh reality that coal demand is down and almost out.In response to the anti-carbon drive, utility operators are shutting down coal-based power plants and are directing fresh investments toward constructing natural gas facilities and adding more renewables.A recent release from Peabody Energy (  ) indicates that U.S. utility coal demand will decline by nearly 40 to 60 million tons based on projected plant retirements and lower natural gas prices. The decline in demand, combined with an expected significant reduction in utility stockpiles and lower exports, is projected to result in a 150 to 170 million ton decline in 2016 U.S. coal shipments.Per a release from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), U.S. coal production in Jan 2016 was 59 million short tons (MMst), a 7% (4 MMst) decrease from Dec 2015 and the lowest monthly production since Jul 1983. Production declines are forecast to continue in 2016, with coal production expected to average 834 MMst, a 6% decline from 2015.Here are some of the severe headwinds that the coal industry is up against: Coal has been losing its importance as a fuel source over the last few years, particularly in the U.S., vis-à-vis other sources that are much less harmful to the environment. Concerns over the emission of greenhouse gases and global climate change have resulted in the formulation of new legislations and policies which emphasize the use of environment friendly fuel sources, particularly in the power sector.This has considerably slowed down the expansion of coal-fired capacity in the power sector, with utility companies now building new natural gas-fired plants and resorting to alternative sources of energy generation like wind, solar and hydro power.The final version of the Clean Power Plan will ensure that coal consumption for power production in the U.S. will go down from the present level, unless the utilities pour more money to upgrade existing plants.Xcel Energy Inc. (  ) has already reduced carbon dioxide emissions during power generation by around 22% since 2005 and American Electric Power Co., Inc. (  ) has eliminated over 5,500 megawatt (MW) of coal-fired capacity. A major substitute for coal in energy generation is another fossil fuel - natural gas. Coal is being dumped in favor of natural gas, which due to extensive exploration and production and a shale gas boom in onshore U.S., is seeing significantly lower prices than in the past.Natural gas is usually an attractive choice for new generating plants because of its relative fuel efficiency, low emissions, quick construction timelines and low capital costs. This trend is encouraging power generators to not only convert their existing plants to gas-fired ones but to build new units.The EIA's forecast of U.S. natural gas consumption averages 76.4 billion cubic feet/day (Bcf/d) in 2016 and 77.3 Bcf/d in 2017, compared with 75.4 Bcf/d in 2015. Increases in industrial sector natural gas consumption will drive total consumption growth in both these years.Besides power generation, clean burning natural gas is being utilized in new projects in the fertilizer and chemical sectors. Apart from natural gas, the coal industry has been losing a major share of its electric generation demand to renewable sources of energy.The EIA report reveals that electricity generation from renewable sources is projected to increase to 18% by 2040 in the U.S. with renewables accounting for 9.8% of total power consumption in 2014. Production of power from renewable sources is supported by most of the U.S. states though there is no national consensus regarding the percentage of renewables in the total energy mix. However, the Clean Power Plan will encourage energy conservation and efficiency plans, use of renewables and clean alternative technologies for lowering air pollution.The extension of the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for solar and Production Tax Credit (PTC) for wind will drive further additions in renewable generation units at the cost of coal. Besides competition from renewables and natural gas, U.S. coal producers are also affected by rising export from Indonesia and Australia and a stronger dollar, which is making this commodity dearer in the international markets.The EIA release sums up that weak coal demand, lower international coal prices and a higher output in other coal-exporting countries have led to a decline in U.S. coal exports. U.S. coal exports decreased 23% year over year in 2015, falling to 75 MMst. The current global coal market trends are expected to continue, and coal exports are forecast to decline by an additional 8 MMst (11%) in 2016 and by 2 MMst (3%) in 2017.In ""  "" we focused on the conditions which are expected to drive the industry forward.However, the continuous fall in demand and soft prices have stretched the financial capabilities of the coal miners. Many of these leading companies are being put under the ""self-bonding"" test. Self-bonding is a government program that allows producers of coal to economically insure their clean-up costs in case of a bankruptcy.To overcome the difficult times and remain viable, coal producers are idling coal mines, lowering headcount, delaying capital expenditure plans and even resorting to sell their mines. CONSOL Energy Inc. (  ) recently announced that it will sell its Buchanan Mine in southwestern Virginia and certain other metallurgical coal reserves to Coronado IV LLC for $420 million. The company also took the hard decision of suspending its dividend to counter weak coal.Despite these initiatives, it is going to be a very difficult phase for the coal producers as demand for coal is not going to improve radically any time soon.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"oday, I want to tell you about a low-risk, high-yield  that has delivered huge market-beating returns to our Cabot Dividend Investor subscribers over the past 18 months. But first, a story about something remarkable that happened on my recent visit to New Zealand…One month ago, at 3:31 in the morning, in Christchurch, New Zealand, I was shaken out of a sound sleep by an earthquake that measured 4.3 on the Richter scale.It felt as though a couple of strong men were shaking the bed. I didn't panic; my first thought was regret-that I had missed the start of the earthquake by being asleep!But the experience did make me thankful that I live in a place where earthquakes are extremely rare.So what was I doing in Christchurch, which is far from a tourist hot spot these days?My Christchurch story starts back in September 2008-near the nadir of the financial crisis-at a meeting of fellow publishers in Chicago.One of the attendees had come all the way from New Zealand. And seeing that it's such a long trip, he had brought his wife too, and they were making a tour of the U.S.To make a long story short, when they were in the Boston area, my wife made a delicious home-cooked meal for them (on a cold and rainy autumn night). And we've stayed in touch ever since. So, given that we were heading to Sydney, Australia last month for a family wedding, it only made sense to stop in New Zealand, too, to see them at their home in Christchurch.And, given that Christchurch has had some serious earthquake activity in recent years, it made sense to bone up on the subject.The main facts are these:On September 4, 2010, a 7.1 magnitude earthquake occurred, centered 25 miles from Christchurch, 6 miles deep. No deaths were directly attributed the quake.Six months later, on February 22, 2011 there was a 6.3 magnitude earthquake, centered just 6 miles southeast of the center of the city, and only 3 miles deep.In that earthquake, 185 people died, 115 of them in the collapsed Canterbury Television Building. More than 6,000 people were injured. More than 1,000 buildings were rendered unfit for use. And more then 10,000 people subsequently moved out of the city (which had a population of 386,000).Five years later, Christchurch is still rebuilding. But it still has an excess of empty lots-there's no shortage of parking. And plenty of people are still arguing with their insurance companies.And, it still has aftershocks, like the one we experienced. In fact, in the five years since the big one, there have been some 10,017 measurable aftershocks!On the afternoon that we arrived in Christchurch, our friends gave us a tour of the downtown, so we could see firsthand where they each used to work. Sort of. Both their buildings are now gone-plus, the publishing company was forced to work out of their house for 18 months, as rents in Christchurch went sky-high following the earthquake.We also saw the ChristChurch Cathedral, built between 1854 and 1904, which now looks like this-and may or may not be completely demolished.And we saw its temporary replacement, the Cardboard Cathedral, which looks like this inside.Bottom line, there's still a lot of work to do. Still, people in Christchurch are careful-because they don't feel as secure as most of us. They don't put good glassware on shelves. They have emergency supplies at hand-just in case another big one hits. And they're careful to keep their phones charged.Interestingly, both my research and my personal experiences illuminate a key characteristic of people in the aftermath of such a disaster. Those people with strong social networks often grow stronger, as they deal with a ""common enemy,"" while those with weak social networks grow less resilient, more anxious.With more than 10,000 aftershocks, it's totally understandable!So, are there any compelling investment opportunities in New Zealand?Given that the country's economy still has a large agricultural component, and that a ""brain drain"" has been a problem in recent decades, no.On the other hand, the complete collapse of commodity prices around the globe in recent years does make me eager to spot a nascent uptrend in despised commodities that have been discarded in the panic selling of recent months.Coal, for instance.Last week the news that  might go bankrupt made big headlines, and I like that. It's headlines like that that make  .Unfortunately, none of the Cabot analysts are recommending coal yet.A quick look at the group tells me that  may be the best prospect, given the stock's liquidity and the company's ability to keep on making a profit.But that's a high-risk play right here. So instead, I'll just keep an eye on that and a few others.A more prudent investment, meanwhile, would be  , the utility that provides mainly electricity (and some natural gas) to customers ranging from North Dakota to Michigan to Texas. The dividend stock currently yields 3.2%, and subscribers to Cabot Dividend Investor have racked up a gain of 36% in the stock over the past 18 months.Sincerely,Timothy LuttsChief Analyst, Cabot Stock of the Monthand Publisher of Cabot Wealth AdvisoryThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@An ‘Earth-Shattering’, Low-Risk Dividend Stock@2016-03-28@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/earth-shattering-low-risk-dividend-stock-2016-03-28

Both show a pickup in annual earnings estimates amid acquisitions and improved economies in states where they operate.WEC provides electricity and natural gas to customers in Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan and Minnesota. It was formed last summer after Wisconsin Energy acquired Chicago-based Integrys Energy for $9.1 billion.Profit for 2015 likely rose 4% to $2.73 per share, and analysts expect earnings to rise a further 7% this year.""The economic condition in WEC Energy's service territories is improving sturdily, which has led to higher demand from residential as well as industrial and commercial customers,"" Zacks Equity Research said Dec. 4. It has a hold rating on the stock.WEC has risen for four of the past five weeks as it works on a cup-with-handle base with a 53.98 buy point.WEC's long-term dividend growth rate is a solid 15%. The annualized payout of $1.82 per share yields 3.4% at the current share price, above the S&P 500 average of 2.2%. On Dec. 3, WEC said that it would boost the quarterly payout by 8.2% to 49.50 a share.Xcel operates in the Midwest as well as in Colorado, New Mexico and Texas.

ooking today at week-over-week shares outstanding changes among the universe of ETFs covered at  , one standout is the First Trust Morningstar Dividend Leaders Index Fund (Symbol: FDL) where we have detected an approximate $41.6 million dollar inflow -- that's a 4.1% increase week over week in outstanding units (from 41,150,002 to 42,850,002). Among the largest underlying components of FDL, in trading today Caterpillar Inc. (Symbol: CAT) is off about 1.2%, PPL Corp (Symbol: PPL) is up about 0.5%, and Xcel Energy, Inc. (Symbol: XEL) is higher by about 0.1%.  The chart below shows the one year price performance of FDL, versus its 200 day moving average:Looking at the chart above, FDL's low point in its 52 week range is $12.31 per share, with $24.51 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $24.45. Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@FDL, CAT, PPL, XEL: ETF Inflow Alert@2016-02-23@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/fdl-cat-ppl-xel-etf-inflow-alert-2016-02-23
nvestors eyeing a purchase of Xcel Energy, Inc. (Symbol: XEL) stock, but tentative about paying the going market price of $36.69/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the June put at the $35 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $1.15. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 3.3% return against the $35 commitment, or a 8.4% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to XEL's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $35 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Xcel Energy, Inc. sees its shares decline 5.2% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $33.85 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $1.15 from $35), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 8.4% annualized rate of return.Interestingly, that annualized 8.4% figure actually exceeds the 3.5% annualized dividend paid by Xcel Energy, Inc. by 4.9%, based on the current share price of $36.69. And yet, if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downside because the stock would have to lose 5.17% to reach the $35 strike price.Always important when discussing dividends is the fact that, in general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Xcel Energy, Inc., looking at the dividend history chart for XEL below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 3.5% annualized dividend yield.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Xcel Energy, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $35 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the June put at the $35 strike for the 8.4% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Xcel Energy, Inc. (considering the last 253 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $36.69) to be 19%.

In other words, if we look at the number of call buyers and then use the long-term median to project the number of put buyers we'd expect to see, we're actually seeing more put buyers than expected out there in  so far today.  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Commit To Purchase Xcel Energy At $35, Earn 8.4% Annualized Using Options@2016-01-26@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/commit-purchase-xcel-energy-35-earn-84-annualized-using-options-2016-01-26

"Chicago, IL - November 17, 2015 - Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses the Coal, part 3, including  (  ),  (  ),  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ).Industy: Coal, part 3Link: The Coal Industry is facing dual challenges -- firstly, rising competition from natural gas and alternate energy as a substitute energy source and secondly, regulatory rulings to lower emission which will inevitably lead to a curtailment of coal power generation.In Aug 2015, the new Clean Power Plan was unveiled, which calls for CO2 reductions of 28% by 2025 and 32% by 2030, from 2005 levels. This is slightly stricter than the draft proposal wherein the EPA had proposed total CO2 reduction of 29% by 2025 and 30% by 2030.In response to the anti-carbon drive, utility operators are shutting down coal-based power plants and are directing fresh investments toward constructing natural gas facilities and adding more renewables.A recent release from Peabody Energy (  ) indicates that utility coal demand will decline by nearly 100 million tons in 2015, primarily due to lower  , while U.S. coal shipments are projected to decline 90 million tons in 2015 from 2014 levels. The coal major expects demand to deteriorate further in 2016.A release from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce also has a bearish stance on thermal coal, going forward. The report quoted that over the 2011 to 2030 time frame, more than 150 gigawatts (GW) of power plants will be taken out of production and more than 50% will be coal-fired units. The release also predicts nearly 360 GW to be added from 2011 through 2030, with the majority of units using natural gas, wind and solar photovoltaics (PV) to generate electricity.Arch Coal Inc. (  ) echoes a similar sentiment. The company believes that natural gas prices and the likely implementation of new environmental regulations this year could actually lower domestic demand for thermal coal by 95 million tons in 2015.Per a release from U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), lower domestic coal consumption and reduced exports will result in an 89 million short ton (MMst) decline in U.S. coal production in 2015. The report also indicates that U.S. coal production will decrease by 28 MMst (3.0%) in 2016. The annual average coal price sold to the electric power sector averaged $2.36/MMBtu in 2014. The EIA expects the delivered coal price to average $2.25/MMBtu in 2015.Here are some of the severe headwinds that the coal industry is up against: Coal has been losing its importance as a fuel source over the last few years, particularly in the U.S., vis-à-vis other sources that are much less harmful to the environment. Concerns over the emission of greenhouse gases and global climate change have resulted in the formulation of new legislations and policies which emphasize the use of environment friendly fuel sources, particularly in the power sector.This has considerably slowed the expansion of coal-fired capacity in the power sector, with utility companies now building new natural gas-fired plants and resorting to alternative sources of energy generation like wind, solar and hydro power.The final version of the Clean Power Plan will ensure that coal consumption for power production in the U.S. will go down from the present level, unless the utilities pour more money to upgrade existing plants.Florida Power & Light Company (""FPL""), a unit of NextEra Energy Inc. (  ), filed a petition with the Florida Public Service Commission requesting for the approval to acquire Cedar Bay Generating Plant in Jacksonville. FPL had a long-term power purchase agreement with the owner of this 250 MW coal-based facility. The objective of the request was to acquire the plant and gradually phase it out of operations.Xcel Energy Inc. (  ) has already reduced carbon dioxide emissions during power generation by around 22% since 2005 and American Electric Power Co., Inc.

"enOn Energy Inc, an affiliate of  , has entered into agreements to sell two of its power plants for a total consideration of $138 million.As part of its ongoing strategy of portfolio optimization, NRG Energy is selling its 525-megawatt (""MW""), waste coal-fired Seward power plant in Pennsylvania to a Robindale Energy Services unit and the 352-MW, natural gas-fired Shelby County power plant in Illinois to The Woodlands-based Rockland Capital. Under the terms of the contract, NRG Energy will continue to operate and maintain the Seward generation unit on behalf of Robindale Energy.The company estimates maintenance expenditure of these two plants to amount to $17 million which, by divestment, the company can avoid and funnel those funds for supporting its long-term objectives. Additionally, the company intends to utilize the proceeds to pay down debt and improve its cash flow. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2016.NRG Energy has been systematically pursuing asset monetization. In the past one year, NRG Energy has sold a 50% interest in Sabine Cogen, L.P. and Petra Nova Parish Holdings, LLC.The company is currently assessing the market for selling a majority stake in ""GreenCo"" Runway and marketing certain assets in Portland and Avon Lake Unit 9 for sale. It has already received a favorable response to these efforts.However, NRG Energy along with its peers Alliant Energy Corporation  , Xcel Energy Inc.  and FirstEnergy Corp.  is vulnerable to the increasing stringency of government regulations on curbing carbon dioxide emissions during power generation. In order to comply with government regulations, NRG Energy has to invest substantially in developing low-emission facilities, which will inevitably raise operating costs and eat into margins.NRG Energy carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

 is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2015 results before the opening bell on Jan 28, 2016. Last quarter, Xcel Energy posted a positive earnings surprise of 5%, with an average beat of 2.30% in the trailing four quarters. Let's see how things are shaping up for the fourth quarter.Minneapolis, MN-based Xcel Energy is a major electricity and natural gas company in the U.S. Through its subsidiaries, the company is primarily engaged in the utility business and has a presence in eight states.Xcel Energy has been investing substantially in its utility assets, transmission and development projects to increase service reliability and effectively meet rising electricity demand. This would also generate higher returns.The signs of economic improvement are also prominent across Xcel Energy's service territories, especially in Minnesota, in comparison to the nation on the whole. This could drive the company's financials this quarter.However, as coal remains a primary source of fuel for Xcel Energy's mode of power generation, it is having to invest in pollution control measures at its power plants to comply with regulatory pressures. This would increase the company's operating expenses, affecting margins. Other risks involving uneven weather patterns and operational hazards could impact its financial performance in the to-be-reported quarter.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Xcel Energy will beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat consensus estimates. That is not the case here as you will see below. Xcel Energy has an ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 41 cents. Xcel Energy's Zacks Rank #3, when combined with a 0.00% ESP, makes a surprise prediction uncertain this season.We caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some stocks in the electric utility space you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this season:Consolidated Edison, Inc.  has an earnings ESP of +3.77% and carries a Zacks Rank #3. It is slated to report earnings on Feb 18, 2016.Great Plains Energy Incorporated  has an earnings ESP of +10.53% and carries a Zacks Rank #3.

(  ) has already reduced carbon dioxide emissions during power generation by around 22% since 2005 and American Electric Power Co., Inc. (  ) has eliminated over 5,500 megawatt (MW) of coal-fired capacity. A major substitute for coal in energy generation is another fossil fuel -natural gas. Coal is being dumped in favor of natural gas, which due to extensive exploration and production and a shale gas boom in onshore U.S., is seeing significantly lower prices than in the past.Natural gas is usually an attractive choice for new generating plants because of its relative fuel efficiency, low emissions, quick construction timelines and low capital costs. This trend is encouraging power generators to not only convert their existing plants to gas-fired ones but to build new units.Electric generation through gas-fired plants is likely to become more competitive over the coming years given its abundant domestic availability and the regulatory threat hanging over the coal mining industry. A recent EIA report projects an 8% decline in coal consumption in the electric power sector in 2015.The EIA release also confirms that sustained low natural gas prices have favored natural gas generation this year. This has led to lower usage of coal for power generation and a significant increase in the natural gas share of total generation from 27.4% in 2014 to 31.6% this year, while coal's share declined from 38.7% to 35%. Apart from natural gas, the coal industry has been losing a major share of its electric generation demand to renewable sources of energy.The EIA report reveals that electricity generation from renewable sources is projected to increase to 18% by 2040 in the U.S. with renewables accounting for 9.8% of total power consumption in 2014. Production of power from renewable sources is supported by most of the U.S. states though there is no national consensus regarding the percentage of renewables in the total energy mix. However, the Clean Power Plan will encourage energy conservation and efficiency plans, use of renewables and clean alternative technologies for lowering air pollution.At present, 30 U.S. states and the state of Columbia have enforceable renewable portfolio standards or other renewable generation policies. These policies were designed to spread awareness and encourage the power generators to produce more from renewable sources.Per the EIA's latest reports, nearly 18 GW of wind generated capacity will come online in the U.S. in the 2014 to 2016 time frame, while new solar generation for the same period will be 9 GW. Hydro power generation is also expected to improve from present levels.The concept of community solar gardens is also gradually gaining traction in the country. These gardens are generation facilities located in or near a community served by a qualifying retail utility. SolarCity Corporation (  ) along with Minnesota-based solar developer Sunrise Energy Ventures announced plans to develop a series of up to 100 1MW (AC) community solar installations. Utilities like Xcel Energy are increasing their solar garden presence, paving the way for lower electricity bills. Besides competition from renewables and natural gas, U.S. coal producers are also affected by rising export from Indonesia and Australia and a stronger dollar, which is making this commodity dearer in the international markets.The EIA release sums up that weak coal demand, lower international coal prices and a higher output in other coal-exporting countries have led to a decline in U.S. coal exports. It projects coal exports to fall by 20 MMst to 77 MMst in 2015.In ""  "" we focused on the conditions which are expected to drive the industry forward.However, the continuous fall in demand and soft prices have stretched the financial capabilities of the coal miners. Many of these leading companies are being put under the ""self-bonding"" test. Self-bonding is a government program that allows producers of coal to economically insure their clean-up costs in case of a bankruptcy. While Peabody Energy cleared the self-bonding test, which undoubtedly eases some of the financial stress that was building on this coal company, review results are pending for Arch Coal.To overcome the difficult times and remain viable, coal producers are idling coal mines, lowering headcount, delaying capital expenditure plans and even resorting to sell their coal mines. Despite all these initiatives, it is going to be a very difficult phase for the coal producers as demand for coal is not going to improve radically any time soon.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

inneapolis, MN-based  firm has made a mark of its own in the electric utility space through its widespread operations and a solid customer base. The company currently operates primarily through its regulated utilities which lend a long-term growth potential.However, considering the nature of this industry, electric and natural gas utility businesses are impacted by changes in weather patterns which, in turn, weigh on their performance. In addition fluctuating commodity prices could also lead to more volatility in earnings.The recent earnings estimate revision activity for Xcel Energy has been mostly to the downside. The company currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) but going further things could definitely change given the company's recently released earnings results.Investors should note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter of 80 cents per share has remained same over the last 90 days.Coming to the earnings surprise, Xcel Energy has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in just one of the trailing four quarters with an average negative surprise of 0.07%.Going below we have mentioned some of the vital information from this just-revealed announcement: : Xcel Energy beats on earnings in the third quarter.

 data by Another thing that might please Buffett is that Xcel Energy doesn't operate in regions that are currently being disrupted by solar energy. He's having headaches in Nevada, where  shut down rooftop solar installations, much to the chagrin of homeowners and solar companies. But that shutdown won't last long, and if enough customers flood to the solar industry, it could lead to declining revenue long-term for the company. In Minnesota, where I live, the threat of going solar isn't a big concern for utilities, and a utility like Xcel Energy won't see much in the way of competition for many years to come. One thing that Warren Buffett likes to see in companies is the willingness to make tough decisions, and  has not shied away from controversial moves. Just this month, theutility company said that it expects to shut down its Pilgrim Nuclear Generating Station in Plymouth, Mass., by mid-2019, citing poor market conditions, reduced sales, and rising operational costs. This followed a similar decision to close its Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Plant at the end of last year, as cheap natural gas is making nuclear power less cost-effective, especially in light of the costs of maintaining aging plants.Entergy's recent moves have made it more reliant on its regulated electricity-transmission business, under which it has 2.8 million customers in Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi. Yet the company still has a substantial presence in electricity generation, which includes nuclear, hydroelectric, and fossil-fuel powered plants. Given the opportunities for growth in the fast-growing Southern U.S., Entergy has high hopes for expansion in the region, and combined with its willingness to be smart about pulling the plug on unprofitable and challenging operations, the company could well appeal to Buffett in his broader utility plans. When you look at a map of Berkshire Hathaway Energy's overall holdings, there are a couple of patterns that emerge.Image: Berkshire Hathaway.Of course, there are the basics of a typical Berkshire Hathaway business: They are well run companies with strong returns. However, there's one other component that has been very noticeable. Many of those electric utilities happen to be in places with high potential for utility-scale renewable energy projects, and most of them have very large interstate transmission line projects that could be used to move that renewable power to centers of demand.That is part of the reason why I think the next utility in Berkshire Hathaway's sights is  , the owner of Arizona Public Services. Pinnacle West is awfully similar to NV Energy: It has a long history of profitability with an average return on equity for the past 20 years of 9.68%; it has a very strong balance sheet; the state has lots of potential as a utility-scale solar producer; and it's building out large interstate transmission lines into California.Those last two are very intriguing traits. When you consider that California imports about 30% of its electricity from neighboring states, and it  . In fact, Berkshire Hathaway Energy and Pinnacle West have already formed a joint venture called Transcanyon, which is designed to pursue more interstate transmission lines across the Western U.S. And I'm guessing you can bet which markets those transmission lines would be designed to serve.Pinnacle West by itself would be a prototypical Berkshire Hathaway company. But the added bonus of being in an opportune place to supply California with renewable energy should put it high on Berkshire's buy list.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

 will release third-quarter 2015 financial results before the market bell on Oct 29, 2015. The company reported a negative earnings surprise of 2.5% in the previous quarter. Let's see how things are shaping up at Xcel Energy prior to this announcement.Xcel Energy, at the end of 2014, generated nearly 45% of its electricity from coal-fired units. The company needs to step up its investments to lower emission levels and meet the standards of the new Climate Action Plan.To that end, Xcel Energy continues to invest in green power generation assets. The company's clean energy strategy includes increasing the use of renewables and energy efficiency programs, as well as modernizing and retiring plants.The warmer-than-expected temperature during the third quarter will have a positive impact on utility demand.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Xcel Energy is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here. : Xcel Energy has an Earnings ESP of 0.0%.

ouisville Gas and Electric Company and Kentucky Utilities Company, subsidiaries of Allentown, PA-based  , have executed an agreement with energy provider Paringa Resources Limited for the future purchase of coal from the proposed Buck Creek No.1 mine, beginning from 2018. The contract is worth $220 million.The contract, spanning over seven years, is subject to meeting certain construction milestones in the development of the Buck Creek mine in the first two years that is in 2016 and 2017. Failure to meet the conditions will result in termination of the contract.Per the terms, Paringa Resources will deliver 750,000 tons in 2018 and 1,000,000 tons each year from 2019 to 2022 at a fixed sales price based on FOB (Free-on-Board). The mine's direct barge connectivity to the Green and Ohio River System provides a substantial transportation benefit.The contract comes as a surprise at a time coal producers are idling their mines, lowering headcount, delaying capital expenditure plans and even resorting to selling their coal mines in response to the anti-carbon drive. A release from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce also has a bearish stance on thermal coal, going forward. The report quoted that during 2011 to 2030, more than 150 gigawatts (GW) of power plants will be taken out of production process and more than 50% will be coal-fired units. The release also predicts nearly 360 GW to be added from 2011 through 2030, with the majority of units using natural gas, wind and solar photovoltaics to generate electricity.Despite this fact, coal still holds an advantageous position due to its wide availability and lower cost compared to other fossil fuels and renewable sources of energy. The importance of coal in the fuel source chain is far from over. For the aggressively growing and energy hungry Asian economies, coal seems to be the most popular source of power generation in spite of the inroads being made by renewables (read:  ?).CONSOL Energy  with its thermal coal marketing strategy continues to see success by contracting additional volumes and building a portfolio that targets power plants expected to not only survive but increase electricity generation in spite of the stringent regulatory environment.As for the utility companies, they are taking due measures to cut down on the carbon footprint. Xcel Energy Inc.  has already reduced carbon dioxide emissions during power generation by around 22% since 2005 and American Electric Power Co., Inc.  has eliminated over 5,500 megawatt (MW) of coal-fired capacity Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

n Nov 13, 2015, we have issued an updated research report on  . The company's ongoing investments in expanding its infrastructure projects and steady focus on broadening its renewables base are expected to act as growth catalysts going forward. Additionally, economic development in the company's service territories is also expected to favor the company. However, stringent environmental regulations are a potential headwind.Xcel Energy recently posted third-quarter earnings of 84 cents per share, outpacing both the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the prior-year figure. Revenues of $2,901.3 million missed the estimates but increased on a year-over-year basis owing to higher electric revenues.Xcel Energy has been investing substantially in its utility assets, primarily in generation, transmission and distribution projects, which will improve its service reliability and provide higher returns in the forthcoming years. With the current pulse in the U.S. market favoring green energy, Xcel Energy has been steadily diversifying its portfolio to include more sustainable and cleaner sources of energy. The company plans to add 1,800 MW of wind energy, 1,400 MW of large-scale solar units across its service territories over the long term and retire two of the three Sherco coal-fired units.Economic development in the company's service territories has resulted in customer additions. The company's performance is also expected to get a boost from economic growth.In spite of adding renewable assets, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Clean Power Plan will require Xcel Energy to invest substantially in pollution control measures at its power generation facilities. This will inevitably raise operating expenses, thereby affecting margins. Uncertain weather patterns, operational risks and hazards are other concerns.Xcel Energy carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Some of the other stocks worth considering in the same industry are Korea Electric Power Corp.  and Huaneng Power International, Inc.  , each carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and Exelon Corporation  , carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Shutterstock photoU tility stocks have been hit hard for nearly six months. Are they now making a comeback? Judging by IBD's Utility Leaders screen, the rebound is visible, but in a mild way.Twenty-three names recently made the computer-generated list (see a partial list in the table to the left). That's sharply up from just one or two stocks that made the list in the first week of July.However, many of these stocks have not rallied back above the critical 200-day moving average. That's a sign of price weakness.Today's column focuses on five names with annualized dividend yields of 2.9% or more and share prices that are showing more oomph. All five have traversed back above the 200-day moving average, a key long-term support level.Consolidated Edison (  ) (4.1% yield, one of the best among Utility Leaders) hit a year-to-date low of 56.86 in mid-June, then rebounded 13%. The stock has been carving out the right side of a long cuplike base. The utility provider in the Northeast boasts an excellent 3-year Earnings Stability Factor of 1 on a scale of zero (highly stable) to 99 (highly volatile).Xcel Energy (  ) (3.7% yield) has marked several days of nice gains in heavy volume since June 10. That's helped boost the stock's Accumulation/Distribution  to a B. The utility serves Texas, Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota and a few other states. The 3-year stability factor is 2.Analysts have boosted Xcel's 2015 and 2016 EPS growth views to 3% and 6% respectively.Northwestern (  ) (3.6%) is cooling off after staging a seven-day rally. The 3-year stability factor is 5. Wall Street sees EPS rising 6% this year and 8% in 2016. Its quarterly dividend has climbed 43% to 48 cents a share vs. 33.5 cents in 2009.CMS Energy (  ) (3.4%) has notched four quarters in a row of falling earnings. But profit is seen rebounding 30% in Q3 and 6% for the year.NextEra Energy (  ) (2.9%) has been working on a long saucer base.

" business wing of Albuquerque, NM-based  , Public Service Co. has filed a modified settlement agreement with New Mexico Public Regulation Commission (""NMPRC""), requesting the closure of two (Units 2 and 3) of four coal-fired units in the San Juan Generating Station (""SJGS"") by the end of 2017.The petition also includes the installation of emission control technology on the remaining units in the station. The move is essentially in compliance with the federal regulations under the Clean Air Act and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (""EPA"") Clean Power Plan.The request filed earlier had been through much criticism because of the costly federal plan designed to reduce the regional haze. However, with support from the EPA and the state, the new agreement is formulated in a cost-effective way for broader environmental benefits.Two key elements of the agreement as outlined by PNM Resources include a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (""CCN"") to run the two remaining units (Units 1 and 4), and another CCN for the 134 megawatt (""MW"") Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station as a replacement power source for the closed units.In the wake of President Obama's proposed Clean Power Plan (finalized now), the utility industry in the U.S. has been witnessing a changing landscape over the past couple of years as many coal units were either divested or phased out of service.The final version of the Clean Power Plan calls for CO2 reduction of 28% by 2025 and 32% by 2030 from the 2005 levels. This came a tad stricter than the draft proposal, wherein the EPA had proposed total CO2 reduction of 29% by 2025 and 30% by 2030.In the context of environment friendly initiatives, the company's peer, Xcel Energy Inc.  has reduced CO2 emissions during power generation by around 22% since 2005. On the other hand, American Electric Power Co., Inc.  has eliminated over 5,500 MW of coal-fired capacity.PNM Resources currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked electric utility is Empresa Nacional de Electricidad S.A.  , sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"lectric utility company,  and Maryland Heights, MO-based renewable energy development company SunEdison, Inc.  have entered into an agreement for establishing a joint venture (""JV"") for the Four Brothers solar project in Utah.The Four Brothers project is a 420 megawatt direct current (MWdc) or 320 MW alternating current (""AC"") facility, developed by SunEdison. The project is fully funded and presently under construction with expected in-service in mid-2016. This venture has secured a 20-year power purchase agreement with Berkshire Hathaway Energy's subsidiary - PacifiCorp (A-/A3).Including funding for construction, Dominion will invest about $500 million to acquire 50% of cash equity and 99% of tax equity in Four Brothers, as per the JV terms. A balance of $150 million will be pitched in by SunEdison to complete the project.The solar project will generate enough electricity to power 90,000 homes in Utah. Moreover, the project will, to an extent, help the economy by creating 500 constructions jobs and producing $66 million in direct property and income taxes over 20 years.Thanks to Obama's Clean Power Plan, venturing into green energy has become a viable and worthwhile option for many power producing companies. The final plan calls for CO2 reduction of 28% by 2025 and 32% by 2030, from 2005 levels. This is slightly stricter than the draft proposal wherein the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had proposed total CO2 reduction of 29% by 2025 and 30% by 2030.Dominion has heavily invested in its merchant solar portfolio in the past few years and has set a 625 MW solar portfolio target by the end of next year. Moreover, Dominion's eighth annual Citizenship & Sustainability Report recently revealed that the company's expansion of green footprint has helped a great deal in reducing its carbon intensity. The company has cut down on CO2 emissions per unit of electric output from its generating fleet by 28% from 2008 through 2014.Dominion's peer, Xcel Energy Inc.  has also reduced CO2 emissions during power generation by around 22% since 2005.Dominion Resources currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

"esterday the White House released the final version of the Clean Power Plan, a firm step to lower emission from power plants. The U.S. is responsible for nearly 17% of the world's annual greenhouse gas emissions and coal based power plants are the primary source of this contamination. As it is, U.S. coal producers have been under tremendous stress over recent times and this new plan will come as an added blow.Per the Clean Power Plan, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) calls for CO2 reduction of 28% by 2025 and 32% by 2030, from 2005 levels. This is slightly stricter than the draft proposal wherein the EPA had proposed total CO2 reduction of 29% by 2025 and 30% by 2030.The final version lays out state-specific interim and final goals for each state, based on these limits and each state's mix of power plants.The new plan will encourage energy conservation, energy efficiency plans, use of renewable and clean alternative technologies for lowering air pollution and other adverse impacts of energy production. This ambitious EPA program aims to boost electricity generation from renewable sources and create new job opportunities in the process.A recent release from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects that lower domestic demand and shipments will lead to a decline in coal production of 75 million short tons (MMst) in 2015. The EIA not only claims that this decline will be widespread across all coal-producing regions but also sees no respite in 2016 with production remaining on par with the prior year.Thanks to the shale gas boom, coal has steadily been losing ground to cheap natural gas in the U.S. electric utility industry. Per the EIA, coal-based power generation is expected to average 36% in 2015, down from 39% in 2014. In spite of that coal is still the largest source of electricity production in the U.S. The Clean Power Plan has thus been devised to brutally change the fuel generation mix over the next decade.As a prelude to what is to come we saw natural gas surpassing coal in the fuel mix this April only to give way to coal again. But with the White House bent on the most severe climate policy ever, coal will have a long hard battle ahead.Sensing what is to come and exploiting cheap  , utilities have already started to lower their exposure to coal based production. Xcel Energy Inc.  has reduced carbon dioxide emissions during power generation by around 22% since 2005 and American Electric Power Co., Inc.  has eliminated over 5,500 megawatt (MW) of coal-fired capacity.The Clean Power Plan will make sure that U.S. coal stocks continue their southward journey. They've already come under severe pressure from the international slowdown, particularly in China, leading to cascading demand for the fossil fuel. This has invariably led to a drop in prices and intensified competition.This new plan will create further headwinds for the leading coal operators of the U.S. namely Peabody Energy  , Arch Coal  , Cloud Peak Energy  and CONSOL Energy  . Prices of all these stocks have dropped significantly year to date.In this highly challenging environment, coal miners have cut down overall cost through mine closure, slower production rates and layoffs. The new plan would compel the operators to take more stringent measures if they have to remain viable.Ironically the new plan has talked of thousands of job creation in the renewable energy sector, but what about the probability of job loss of thousands of people tied to the coal industry for their daily bread.This plan actually has the potential to push some more U.S. coal operators to the brink of bankruptcy. Walter Energy and Alpha Natural Resources have already filed for bankruptcy protection. We would not be surprised if a few more U.S. based coal operators file for bankruptcy protection in the coming days and months.The U.S. alone will not succeed in this ""War Against Pollution"" unless other nations also come forward with equal dedication and purpose to lower emissions. The biggest polluter - China - has committed to lower its pollution level beyond 2030 and add more renewables to its electricity production.But back home, is the Clean Power Plan a last nail in the coffin for the U.S. coal producers? Are we ready yet to sacrifice coal for a cleaner environment? The opinion on this is rather mixed. As much as we would like a cleaner tomorrow, let's not forget that it was coal that ushered in the Industrial Revolution in the past and still is the most affordable source of meeting modern energy needs.There is no denying that old and outmoded coal-based U.S. power plants will have to go out of circulation but the utility operators will have to invest in new carbon capture technology to realize the full potential of this cheap and abundant fossil fuel.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"iversified energy company  reported second-quarter 2015 operating earnings of 53 cents per share, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10.4%. Earnings also improved 8.2% year over year.The upside was driven by higher earnings at the Regulated Transmission business on the heels of incremental cost of service and rate base recovery at American Transmission Systems.Including one-time items totaling 9 cents, FirstEnergy's GAAP earnings were 44 cents per share, up 193.3% year over year.FirstEnergy generated total revenues of $3,462 million in the second quarter of 2015, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,347 million by 3.4%. Revenues however dipped 1% year over year.Though the regulated distribution and transmission business benefited the top line, the competitive energy services segment was a laggard.FirstEnergy's total electric distribution deliveries were 35,083 thousand megawatt-hours (""MWH"") in the reported quarter, reflecting a marginal decline of 0.3% year over year. The slight decline reflects lower usage by customers to some extent due to energy efficiency mandates.FirstEnergy's total expenses in the second-quarter came in at $2,867 million, down 4.2% from $2,995 reported in the second quarter of 2014.For the second quarter 2015, FirstEnergy reported an operating income of $595 million, up 18.5% year over year.Interest expenses in the reported quarter were $282 million, reflecting a 7.6% increase from $262 million a year ago.FirstEnergy's cash and cash equivalents were $94 million as of Jun 30, 2015, up from $85 million as of Dec 31, 2014.Cash from operating activities in the quarter was $797 million, comparing favorably with $714 million generated in the year-ago quarter.Long-term debt and other long-term obligations as of Jun 30, 2015 were $18,570 million, down from $19,176 million at 2014 end.FirstEnergy reiterated the 2015 operating earnings projection between $2.40 and $2.70 per share. GAAP earnings guidance for 2015 was reduced to $2.13-$2.43 per share from an earlier projection of $2.17-$2.47 per share.Third-quarter 2015 operating earnings are expected at 82-92 cents per share while GAAP earnings are expected at 76-86 cents per share.DTE Energy  reported second-quarter 2015 operating earnings per share of 76 cents, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 84 cents by 9.5%.Exelon Corporation  reported second-quarter 2015 adjusted operating earnings of 59 cents per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 51 cents by nearly 15.7%.Xcel Energy Inc.  recorded operating earnings of 39 cents per share in the second quarter of 2015, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.FirstEnergy posted solid results with both the top and the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Since last year, this utility made quite a few large-scale investments at its subsidiaries for enhancing electric reliability and has planned an outlay of about $2.9 billion for 2015. FirstEnergy operates one of the largest transmission networks in the U.S. and is witnessing incremental revenues from investment in its transmission units.FirstEnergy is switching its assets from competitive generation to regulated operations.

Costs shrunk primarily due to lower cost of natural gas sold and transported and reduced expenses from electric fuel and purchased power.Operating income for the quarter increased 6.5% year over year to $422.8 million.Total interest charges and financing costs, after Allowance for funds used during construction (""AFUDC""), increased 6.8% year over year at the end of the second quarter of 2015 to $138.1 million.Total debt as of Jun 30, 2015, was $13 billion out of which long-term debt was $11.9 billion.In the second half of 2015, Xcel Energy plans to issue first mortgage bonds worth $800 million through its two subsidiaries - NSP-Minnesota and Southwestern Public Service Co.Xcel Energy reiterated its 2015 earnings guidance in the range of $2.00-$2.15 per share.On a weather-normalized basis, the company expects retail electric utility sales to increase 0.5% and natural gas sales to decline about 2%.Various operating expenses such as depreciation expense, property taxes and interest expense are expected to rise over 2014 levels.The company expects to deliver long-term annual earnings per share growth of 4-6% and targets a dividend payout ratio between 60-70%.DTE Energy  reported second-quarter 2015 operating earnings per share of 76 cents, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 84 cents by 9.5%.Exelon Corporation  reported second-quarter 2015 adjusted operating earnings of 59 cents per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 51 cents by nearly 15.7%.Pepco Holdings Inc.  reported second quarter 2015 earnings from continuing operations of 23 cents per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 20.7%.Owing to fluctuating weather patterns, the financial results of these utilities also tend to be volatile. Xcel Energy's second-quarter 2015 results failed to impress with both earnings and revenues missing expectations.In early 2015, Xcel Energy filed a resource plan with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission proposing to reduce carbon emissions by 30% by 2020 and 40% by 2030. Moreover, as per a corporate social responsibility (""CSR"") report release last month, Xcel Energy has reduced carbon dioxide emissions by 22% from 2005 levels.These aggressive targets will not only help in meeting state mandates but also assist the company in providing clean energy and reliable services to its customers.Xcel Energy currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

hareholders of Xcel Energy, Inc. (Symbol: XEL) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 3.8% annualized dividend yield can sell the December covered call at the $35 strike and collect the premium based on the 50 cents bid, which annualizes to an additional 3.8% rate of return against the current stock price (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ), for a total of 7.7% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $35 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but XEL shares would have to advance 4.6% from current levels for that to happen, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 6.1% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Xcel Energy, Inc., looking at the dividend history chart for XEL below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 3.8% annualized dividend yield.Below is a chart showing XEL's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $35 strike highlighted in red:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the December covered call at the $35 strike gives good reward for the risk of having given away the upside beyond $35. (  ). We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Xcel Energy, Inc. (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $33.43) to be 18%.

inneapolis, MN-based  is slated to report second-quarter 2015 earnings results before the opening bell on Jul 30, 2015.Last quarter, Xcel Energy posted an 8.00% negative earnings surprise. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Currently, Xcel Energy is in a transformational phase, switching its fuel source from coal to natural gas and renewables. The company has already reduced carbon dioxide emissions during power generation by around 22% since 2005. Xcel Energy's investment in natural gas operations is not only helping its customers to save on their electric bills but is also improving the company's margins.Signs of economic recovery in Xcel Energy's service territories are also resulting in an uptrend in large commercial and industrial revenues at some of its subsidiaries. The economic revival is likely to have a positive impact on second-quarter results.However, the performance of electric utilities is to a large extent subject to weather patterns that season. Xcel Energy's service territories in the northeast witnessed moderate temperatures in the second quarter which might have resulted in lower electric sales.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Xcel Energy will beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat consensus estimates. That is not the case here as you will see below. Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -7.32%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at 38 cents, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 41 cents. Xcel Energy has a Zacks Rank #3 which when combined with a -7.32% ESP makes an earnings prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some stocks in the utility industry you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this season:Consolidated Edison, Inc.  has an earnings ESP of +1.56% and a Zacks Rank #2.Entergy Corporation  has an earnings ESP of +1.77% and a Zacks Rank #3.UIL Holdings Corporation  has an earnings ESP of +7.14% and a Zacks Rank #3.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

e expect  to beat expectations when it reports second-quarter earnings on Jul 29, 2015, after the markets close. Last quarter, it posted a positive earnings surprise of 5%. Meanwhile, the company has topped earnings estimates in three of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 8.66%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Our proven model shows that SolarCityis likely to beat estimates because it has the right combination of two key components. , which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, stands at +1.86%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate is pegged at a loss of $1.58 per share while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is at a loss of $1.61 per share. This is a meaningful indicator and signifies a likely positive earnings surprise. SolarCity has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) and #3, when combined with a positive ESP, have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. Meanwhile, the Sell-rated stocks (#4 and 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of SolarCity's Zacks Rank #3 and +1.86% ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat.SolarCity is currently pursuing multiple growth ventures and marketing ploys to strengthen its presence across the nation. In the second quarter, the company partnered with Minnetonka-based solar developer Sunrise Energy Ventures to create the largest community solar program in the country. The new community solar program will offer renters, schools, municipalities and other current Xcel Energy  customers the benefit of purchasing renewable energy without installing solar panels on their properties.The California-based company had launched MyPower solar loan offering in Oct 2014 in eight states and subsequently extended this facility to a number of other states. The latest launch was made in Rhode Island and Nevada.SolarCity continues to intensify its residential business. The company's installations in the first quarter more than doubled year over year to 139 megawatt. The addition of customers every quarter boosts the top line of the company in the quarters that follow.Other stocks in the solar space that also have the right combination of positive earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank include:JinkoSolar Holding Co., Ltd.  , an Earnings ESP of +27.71% and a Zacks Rank #3.Vivint Solar, Inc.  , an Earnings ESP of +1.52% and a Zacks Rank #3.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"ill the old days return to the coal companies or is it just a passing chimera? When the Supreme Court suggested earlier this week that the Environmental Protection Agency (""EPA"") will review its Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (""MATS""), it brought a glimmer of hope for some coal and utility companies in the U.S.In a 5 to 4 majority, the Supreme Court deduced that the EPA did not properly consider the cost before crafting the mercury emission standards for the power companies.Finalized in 2012, this rule requires coal-fired electric companies to shell out about $9.6 billion per year to install scrubbers and other pollution control equipments to clean up mercury and other toxic air pollutants whereas the quantifiable benefit can be valued at only $4-$6 million. However, the EPA argued that looking from a different perspective, the estimated yearly benefit of this regulation is $26-89 billion considering that it would also reduce other pollutants which are lung damaging and fatal.While the regulation will remain in place for now, the EPA has to do a further cost-benefit analysis to ""decide within limits of reasonable interpretation"" how to account for costs. The final decision of the matter rests with the DC Circuit Court.An amendment under the 1990 Clean Air Act in 2012, this rule was set for coal and oil-fired power plants with a capacity of 25 megawatts or greater to reduce hazardous air pollutants. The companies were given a time period of three years to achieve compliance.EPA's analysis demonstrated that this was sufficient time for most, if not all, sources to comply.Since the regulation came into force three years back, a number of power companies have either shut their old coal-fired units or converted their facilities to natural gas based plants. These companies have already installed scrubbers and spent millions of dollars on other technologies to comply with the standards. For instance, Xcel Energy Inc.  has already reduced carbon dioxide emissions during power generation by around 22% since 2005 and American Electric Power Co., Inc.  has eliminated over 5,500 megawatt of coal-fired capacity.However, some of the companies who received a grace period for coming into compliance may benefit if the rule is reviewed. But then, they only account for maybe 1 or 2% of the entire U.S. power industry.Since coal units have historically been the major polluters, acts like MATS and Clean Power Plan were introduced especially keeping in mind the environmental damage caused by this fossil fuel.Obama's Clean Power Plan proposal to bring down overall carbon emission from power plants was the first-ever major measure taken in the U.S. with respect to climate change. However, this painted a grim picture for the coal companies as many of them had to idle their mines, lay off employees and resort to other cost cutting measures to survive. The use of clean burning and cheaper natural gas for power production further added to the severity of their struggle.As more and more utilities started retiring their coal units, the major U.S. coal companies like Peabody Energy Corporation  and Arch Coal Inc.  , to name only a few, started drawing losses in almost every quarter. Share prices of these companies have sunk a minimum of 85% in the past two years.Per a U.S. Energy Information Administration report, if the Clean Power Plan goes into effect as it is, coal would account for only 25% of the total electricity generation in 2030 in the U.S. as against 45% in 2010. Coal productions in major basins will receive a hard blow with the western basin suffering the most. However, with the favorable Supreme Court ruling, coal companies still have some hope to cling onto.If the MATS rule is implemented without any major revision by EPA, a major concern is that who will bear the burden of such a large sum of investment. As is the case in the utility industry, all major investments are reimbursed from the rate payers through a rate increase mechanism. This cost aspect of the MATS rule should also be given due importance.It is yet to be seen what the DC Circuit Court has in mind for EPA's MATS. Most utilities who have made all the preparations for the enactment of the standards will hardly be affected if the rule is struck down. On the other hand, coal players who have become the proverbial whipping boy since the fossil fuel turned out of favor will have some reasons to celebrate.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"hicago, IL - July 17, 2015 - Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses the Coal (Part 3), including  (  ),  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ).Industry: Coal (Part 3)Link: The EIA's recent release indicates that lower domestic demand and shipments will lead to a decline of 75 million short tons (MMst) of coal production in 2015. The release also projects that coal production will decline in all coal-producing regions while 2016 production will remain near 2015 levels.Arch Coal Inc. (  ) echoes a similar sentiment. The company believes that  and the likely implementation of new environmental regulations this year could actually lower domestic demand for coal by 80 million tons in 2015.Per EIA, coal consumption for generating electricity will decline by 7% in 2015 from 2014 levels. The average cost of coal for electricity generation fell from $2.39 per one million British Thermal Unit (MMBtu) in 2011 to $2.36/MMBtu in 2014. The EIA expects the delivered coal price to average $2.29/MMBtu in 2015 and $2.30/MMBtu in 2016.Environmental Legislations: Coal has been losing its importance as a fuel source over the last few years, particularly in the U.S., vis-à-vis other sources that are much less harmful to the environment. Concerns over the emission of greenhouse gases and global climate change have resulted in the formulation of new legislations and policies which emphasize the use of environment friendly fuel sources, particularly in the power sector.This has considerably slowed the expansion of coal-fired capacity in the power sector, with utility companies now building new natural gas-fired plants and resorting to alternative sources of energy generation like wind, solar and hydro power.Florida Power & Light Company (""FPL""), a unit of NextEra Energy Inc. (  ), filed a petition with the Florida Public Service Commission requesting for the approval to acquire Cedar Bay Generating Plant in Jacksonville. FPL had a long-term power purchase agreement with the owner of this 250 MW coal-based facility. The objective of the request is to acquire the plant and gradually phase it out of operations.Xcel Energy Inc. (  ) has already reduced carbon dioxide emissions during power generation by around 22% since 2005 and American Electric Power Co., Inc. (  ) has eliminated over 5,500 megawatt (MW) of coal-fired capacity.Natural Gas Substituting Coal: A major substitute for coal in energy generation is another fossil fuel -- natural gas. Coal is being dumped in favor of natural gas, which due to extensive exploration and production and a shale gas boom in onshore U.S., is seeing significantly lower prices than in the past.Natural gas is usually an attractive choice for new generating plants because of its relative fuel efficiency, low emissions, quick construction timelines and low capital costs. This trend is encouraging power generators to not only convert their existing plants to gas-fired ones but to build new units.Electric generation through gas-fired plants is likely to become more competitive over the coming years given its abundant domestic availability and the regulatory threat hanging over the coal mining industry. A recent EIA report projects a 7% decline in coal consumption in the electric power sector in 2015. Lower natural gas prices are the primary factor behind coal's growing unpopularity.Competition from Alternative Energy Sources: Apart from natural gas, the coal industry has been losing a major share of its electric generation demand to renewable sources of energy. The EIA expects renewables used in the electric power sector to grow by 1.8% in 2015.Production of power from renewable sources is supported by most of the U.S. states. At present there is no national consensus regarding the percentage of energy to be generated from renewable sources.Even in the absence of a clear national policy on carbon emission, there is no doubt that state legislators are laying more stress on renewables. At present, 30 U.S. states and the state of Columbia have enforceable renewable portfolio standards or other renewable generation policies. These policies were designed to spread awareness and encourage the power generators to produce more from renewable sources.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"ource: SunPower.A dark reality in the solar industry is that in the U.S., cheap, clean energy from the sun has been reserved mostly for wealthy homeowners and is out of reach for millions of lower-income Americans. According to a recent paper from The George Washington University Solar Institute, households in the top 60% of income in the U.S. account for 95% of all residential solar installations.That's partly due to the fact that lower-income Americans often rent instead of own a home that could install solar, and it represents a disparity in the industry. With the cost of solar energy from your roof now lower than buying energy from the grid in many parts of the country, why leave 40% of households almost entirely out of the market?Source: SolarCity.There's at least some movement in trying to change this solar disparity. This week, the White House proposed a number of measures to ramp up what's called community solar projects. Solar plants that are built in open spaces but where customers can buy energy at lower rates than from the grid.  (NYSE: XEL)  in Minnesota and received 914 MW of bids (of which they'll build much less).In Xcel Energy's plan, customers in Minnesota will be able to buy energy for 13 cents per kWh from the solar gardens and Xcel Energy will provide a credit of 14.7 cents, leading to 1.7 cents per kWh in savings for those who participate. The program will be open to renters or others who can't install solar themselves.The Obama administration's plan is to bring a similar program to more states, making it possible for lower-income people to participate in the solar industry. On top of that, it raised the goal of installing solar on subsidized housing developments to 300 MW from a 2013 goal of 100 MW by 2020. The previous goal was reached after just two years, so the increased target may become obsolete soon as well.Solar is a booming business nationwide, but this could bring an entirely new market into the fold. That's good for the industry's exposure to customers and for market growth overall.Bringing solar energy to more people is great news, but how will investors take advantage?The easiest way is by owning developers that will build community solar farms and sell their electricity to utilities.  was one of the largest participants in the Minnesota bids and plans to build 100 MW of solar projects in the state. and  are the two other developers to watch in this space, although they haven't entered it yet. SunPower is one of the largest developers in both residential and commercial solar and Vivint Solar is transitioning into commercial solar projects, which would be similar to community solar gardens.Unlike residential or commercial projects, community solar gardens should come with lower default risk because the utility is essentially the intermediary in the transactions. As long as the structure is built correctly, there should be little default risk, meaning an attractive return for solar companies.If the Obama administration has its way, this will be a huge market for the solar industry, which is great news for lower-income energy customers and solar investors.One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World Wide Web to bed. And if you act quickly, you could be among the savvy investors who enjoy the profits from this stunning change.

ooking at the universe of stocks we cover at  , in trading on Wednesday, shares of Xcel Energy, Inc. (Symbol: XEL) were yielding above the 4% mark based on its quarterly dividend (annualized to $1.28), with the stock changing hands as low as $31.97 on the day. Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return. To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) back on 12/31/1999 - you would have paid $146.88 per share. Fast forward to 12/31/2012 and each share was worth $142.41 on that date, a decrease of $4.67/share over all those years. But now consider that you collected a whopping $25.98 per share in dividends over the same period, for a positive total return of 23.36%. Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.6%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 4% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable. Xcel Energy, Inc. (Symbol: XEL) is an S&P 500 company, giving it special status as one of the large-cap companies making up the S&P 500 Index.In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Xcel Energy, Inc., looking at the history chart for XEL below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 4% annual yield.    According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, XEL makes up 3.43% of the PowerShares DWA Utilities Momentum Portfolio ETF (Symbol: PUI) which is trading lower by about 0.5% on the day Wednesday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@XEL Crosses Above 4% Yield Territory@2015-06-24@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/xel-crosses-above-4-yield-territory-2015-06-24

 announced that its principal subsidiary, Consumers Energy, has made plans to start a new community solar program called Solar Gardens. It will develop renewable energy sources with help from Michigan residents.The objective of the program is simply to develop and increase the usage of renewable energy in Michigan. Through Solar Gardens, Consumer Energy aims to develop up to 10 megawatts (MW) of solar energy in the Michigan communities it serves. The first locations could be selected this summer with electricity generation expected next year.Community solar programs can cater to a wide gamut of customers interested in utilizing renewable energy but unable to do so for some reason or the other, like the building in which they reside may not be fit for solar module installation. These community solar programs will lower dependence on grid energy and help minimize carbon emission.Per GTM Research and SEIA's Q1 2015 U.S. Solar Market Insight Report, currently only 66MW (DC) of community solar projects are in operation in the U.S. Without a doubt, there is immense scope of and requirement for promoting community solar programs in the country.Recently, SolarCity Corporation  announced that it will form a partnership with Minnetonka-based solar developer Sunrise Energy Ventures to create a large community solar program and develop up to 100 MW community solar installations in Minnesota.

"oal consumption in the U.S. is expected to increase 0.2% per year til 2040, according to a long-term energy report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (""EIA""). However, the Clean Power Plan proposed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (""EPA""), which calls for a cutback in carbon emissions during power generation by 30% by 2030 from 2005 levels, could see lower demand for coal in the U.S. going forward.In response to the anti-carbon drive, utility operators are shutting down coal-based power plants and are directing fresh investments toward constructing natural gas facilities and adding more renewables.A release from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce also has a bearish stance on thermal coal, going forward. The report quoted that during 2011 to 2030, more than 150 gigawatts (GW) of power plants will be taken out of production process and more than 50% will be coal-fired units. The release also predicts nearly 360 GW to be added from 2011 through 2030, with the majority of units using natural gas, wind and solar photovoltaics (PV) to generate electricity.The EIA's recent release indicates that lower domestic demand and shipments will lead to a decline of 75 million short tons (MMst) of coal production in 2015. The release also projects that coal production will decline in all coal-producing regions while 2016 production will remain near 2015 levels.Arch Coal Inc. (  ) echoes a similar sentiment. The company believes that  and the likely implementation of new environmental regulations this year could actually lower domestic demand for coal by 80 million tons in 2015.Per EIA, coal consumption for generating electricity will decline by 7% in 2015 from 2014 levels. The average cost of coal for electricity generation fell from $2.39 per one million British Thermal Unit (MMBtu) in 2011 to $2.36/MMBtu in 2014. The EIA expects the delivered coal price to average $2.29/MMBtu in 2015 and $2.30/MMBtu in 2016.Environmental Legislations: Coal has been losing its importance as a fuel source over the last few years, particularly in the U.S., vis-à-vis other sources that are much less harmful to the environment. Concerns over the emission of greenhouse gases and global climate change have resulted in the formulation of new legislations and policies which emphasize the use of environment friendly fuel sources, particularly in the power sector.This has considerably slowed the expansion of coal-fired capacity in the power sector, with utility companies now building new natural gas-fired plants and resorting to alternative sources of energy generation like wind, solar and hydro power.Florida Power & Light Company (""FPL""), a unit of NextEra Energy Inc. (  ), filed a petition with the Florida Public Service Commission requesting for the approval to acquire Cedar Bay Generating Plant in Jacksonville. FPL had a long-term power purchase agreement with the owner of this 250 MW coal-based facility. The objective of the request is to acquire the plant and gradually phase it out of operations.Xcel Energy Inc. (  ) has already reduced carbon dioxide emissions during power generation by around 22% since 2005 and American Electric Power Co., Inc. (  ) has eliminated over 5,500 megawatt (MW) of coal-fired capacity.Natural Gas Substituting Coal: A major substitute for coal in energy generation is another fossil fuel -- natural gas. Coal is being dumped in favor of natural gas, which due to extensive exploration and production and a shale gas boom in onshore U.S., is seeing significantly lower prices than in the past.Natural gas is usually an attractive choice for new generating plants because of its relative fuel efficiency, low emissions, quick construction timelines and low capital costs. This trend is encouraging power generators to not only convert their existing plants to gas-fired ones but to build new units.Electric generation through gas-fired plants is likely to become more competitive over the coming years given its abundant domestic availability and the regulatory threat hanging over the coal mining industry. A recent EIA report projects a 7% decline in coal consumption in the electric power sector in 2015. Lower natural gas prices are the primary factor behind coal's growing unpopularity.Competition from Alternative Energy Sources: Apart from natural gas, the coal industry has been losing a major share of its electric generation demand to renewable sources of energy. The EIA expects renewables used in the electric power sector to grow by 1.8% in 2015.Production of power from renewable sources is supported by most of the U.S. states. At present there is no national consensus regarding the percentage of energy to be generated from renewable sources.Even in the absence of a clear national policy on carbon emission, there is no doubt that state legislators are laying more stress on renewables. At present, 30 U.S. states and the state of Columbia have enforceable renewable portfolio standards or other renewable generation policies. These policies were designed to spread awareness and encourage the power generators to produce more from renewable sources.As per the EIA's latest reports, nearly 18 GW of wind generated capacity will come online in the U.S. in the 2014 to 2016 time frame, while new solar generation additions for the same period will be 9 GW.The concept of community solar gardens is gradually gaining traction in the country. These gardens are generation facilities located in or near a community served by a qualifying retail utility. Last month SolarCity Corporation (  ) along with Minnetonka-based solar developer Sunrise Energy Ventures announced plans to develop a series of up to 100 1MW (AC) community solar installations. Utilities like Xcel Energy are increasing their solar garden presence, paving the way for lower electricity bills.Rising Competition and Stronger Dollar: Besides competition from renewables and natural gas, U.S. coal producers are also affected by rising export from Indonesia and Australia and a stronger dollar, which is making this commodity dearer in the international markets.The EIA release sums up that weak coal demand, lower international coal prices and a higher output in other coal-exporting countries have led to a decline in U.S. coal exports. It projects coal exports to fall by 10 MMst to 87 MMst in 2015.In ""  "" we focused on the conditions which are expected to drive the industry forward.However, the continuous fall in demand and soft prices have stretched the financial capabilities of the coal miners. Many of these leading companies are being put under the ""self-bonding"" test by the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality's Land Quality Division (""LQD""). Self-bonding is a government program that allows producers of coal to economically insure their clean-up costs in case of a bankruptcy. Alpha Natural Resources (  ) failed to qualify for the self-bonding test, Peabody Energy Corporation (  ) cleared it, while review results are pending for Arch Coal.To overcome the difficult times and remain viable, coal producers are idling coal mines, lowering headcount, delaying capital expenditure plans and even resorting to sell their coal mines. Despite all these initiatives, it is going to be a very difficult phase for the coal producers as demand for coal is not going to improve radically any time soon.As a glimmer hope, the Republican midterm election win last year might keep the coal lobby still alive and kicking in the national debate about the judicious use of this fossil fuel.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"ource: First Solar.Minnesota isn't known as a state with an abundance of sunshine, but it is becoming an early adopter in the community solar gardens movement that's slowly growing around the country. These community projects are usually small (around 1 MW) solar installations built around a city that allow renters, school districts, and businesses to buy the solar energy, usually in lieu of installing solar panels on their own roofs.In 2014, just 21 MW of community solar came online, according to GTM Research, compared to 6,201 MW of total solar installed nationwide.2015 is expected to be a much bigger year, with 115 MW installed and 18.1 MW in Minnesota alone.  , the electric utility that dominates Minnesota, is expecting that 80 MW of community solar gardens will be installed by the end of 2016, a rapid adoption for a state not used to getting electricity from the sun. And some of the biggest players in the industry will be early movers in Minnesota's solar push.Most of SolarCity's installations are on residential rooftops, so community solar is a new business. Source: SolarCity.The first two movers in the Minnesota community solar market are  and SunShare. SolarCity announced this week that it will partner with Minnesota-based developer Sunrise Energy Ventures to build ""up to one-hundred 1 MW(AC) community solar installations."" Customers will be able to buy power from the solar gardens for 13 cents per kWh, and Xcel Energy will credit the subscriber for 14.7 cents per kWh, meaning customers save 1.7 cents per kWh by participating in the program. The program will launch in 2016, and as a Minnesota resident, I'll be an early adopter.SunShare is partnering with cities like Starbuck and Cologne, who will buy power from their community solar developments.These solar projects are an interesting way to bring solar energy to people who don't own homes that can support solar. But the drivers aren't the same market forces that have caused a solar explosion in recent years.Even SolarCity's release announcing its solar gardens point out a drawback of Minnesota's community solar program. It's ""mandated by law,"" not driven by market forces.The 14.7 cent per kWh figure I quoted above is well over the average retail Minnesota electricity bill of 11.5 cents per kWh. In states like California and New York, SolarCity can offer customers power purchase agreements that are lower than their cost of electricity, meaning the market, not mandates, are driving adoption growth.This isn't to say the community solar program will be bad. But installers will have to lower costs in the future to make the program competitive long term. Otherwise, this will be a building boom, and the Minnesota solar industry will bust in 2017, when the investment tax credit falls from 30% to 10% for commercial projects, effectively making them about 25% more expensive.Minnesota may be leading the way in community solar, but it actually makes a lot more sense in states with higher electricity costs, more sun, or both. California (17 cents per kWh), New York (19.2 cents per kWh), Nevada (13.6 cents per kWh), and Florida (11.6 cents per kWh) would all benefit from this type of solar installation.GTM Research predicts that community solar will grow to a 534 MW per year business in 2020. If that happens, this will be a big market for solar companies to adopt. But policies on the state and local level are needed to make that happen. At least Minnesota is taking steps to see if community solar will be a hit. Will more follow?One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World Wide Web to bed. And if you act quickly, you could be among the savvy investors who enjoy the profits from this stunning change. Experts are calling it the single largest business opportunity in the history of capitalism...  is calling it ""transformative""... but you'll probably just call it ""how I made my millions.""

"n May 18, 2015, we have issued an updated research report on  . TECO Energy's investments in infrastructure development projects backed by a stable liquidity will allow it to provide reliable and efficient services to its expanding electric and natural gas customer base. However, stringent environmental regulations, fluctuating weather patterns and volatile commodity prices might deter growth.TECO Energy's earnings in the first quarter of 2015 were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate while total revenues surpassed the same. The robust Florida economy and contributions from the New Mexico Gas Co. (""NMGC"") acquisition boosted this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock's performance.Synergies from the acquisition of New Mexico Gas Intermediate, the parent company of NMGC, and a gradual economic recovery in Florida will likely drive performance in the future as well.TECO Energy's growing customer count drives its results. The company has consistently added customers over the last several quarters. During the first quarter, the customer count at the Tampa Electric business increased 1.7% from the prior-year level, while the PGS division witnessed a 2% rise. Improvement in the job market and rollout of the new single-family building permits backed by a gradual recovery in the Florida economy will increase demand for utility services, thereby boosting prospects for TECO Energy.TECO Energy follows a systematic capital investment program. In 2014, the company invested around $715 million, up 34.2% year over year. The company plans to spend a total of $3.03 billion between 2015 and 2019, including a rough $740 million allocated for 2015. A major chunk of the fund is intended for Tampa Electric to strengthen its electricity distribution and generation activities.On the flip side, TECO Energy's operations are subject to regulatory compliance. Any change in regulations might either interrupt its operations or require the installation of equipment at its facilities, thereby increasing operating costs. Utility businesses depend largely on weather conditions and TECO Energy is no exception. TECO Energy's businesses are also sensitive to commodity prices. Any change in the price of coal, natural gas and other commodities could impact the company's financial performance, including operating costs and margins.Other favorably ranked stocks in the same industry are PG&E Corporation  , DTE Energy Co.  and Xcel Energy Inc.  , each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

lectric utility provider,  is scheduled to report its first-quarter 2015 earnings results before the opening bell on Apr 30, 2015.Last quarter, Xcel Energy posted a 14.71% positive earnings surprise. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Minneapolis, MN-based Xcel Energy is a major electricity and natural gas company in the U.S. Through its subsidiaries, the company is primarily engaged in the utility business and has a presence in eight states.Signs of economic improvement are prominent across Xcel Energy's service territories. The consolidated unemployment rate in the company's service territories was below the national average in 2014. Moreover, jobs in these regions grew at a rate of 2.3% in 2014 compared with the nation's growth of 1.9%. This could drive the company's financials this quarter as well.A leader in delivering clean energy, Xcel Energy is taking sturdy actions to reduce carbon emissions. In early 2015, Xcel Energy filed a resource plan with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission proposing to reduce carbon emissions by 30% by 2020 and 40% by 2030. These aggressive targets will not only help in meeting state mandates but also assist the company in providing clean energy and reliable services to its customers.However, the company has over the years divested nearly all of its non-regulated businesses which make the company even more dependent on the authorities. Other risks involve uneven weather patterns that could lead to unstable earnings.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Xcel Energy will beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat consensus estimates. That is not the case here as you will see below. Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -9.80%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at 46 cents, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 51 cents. Xcel Energy has a Zacks Rank #3 which when combined with a -9.80% ESP makes an earnings prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing nega Here are some stocks in the utility industry you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this season:Wisconsin Energy Corp.  has an earnings ESP of +2.44% and a Zacks Rank #2.Pepco Holdings, Inc.  has an earnings ESP of +14.82% and a Zacks Rank #3.PG&E Corporation  has an earnings ESP of +11.77% and a Zacks Rank #3.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

GAAP earnings were 42 cents per share compared with 74 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. The difference between GAAP and operating earnings in the reported quarter was due to the charge associated with the North Anna power station and offshore wind facilities, charges associated with liability management, future ash pond closure expenses and some other one-time items.2014 operating earnings were $3.43 per share, up 5.5% from 2013 earnings of $3.25 per share. The year-over-year improvement was due to higher contribution from its regulated gas and electric businesses, earnings from Marcellus farmouts, higher merchant generation margins, and benefits from investment tax credits.Dominion's operating revenue of $2.97 billion in the fourth quarter missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.03 billion by 2.02%. The fourth quarter revenue also decreased nearly 8.1% year over year.The decline in the top line was primarily due to lower contribution from Dominion Generation, marginally offset by a stronger Dominion Virginia Power and Dominion Energy.2014 total revenue of $12.46 billion was also lower than the prior year revenue of $13.1 billion by 4.9%.Dominion Virginia Power recorded net income of $136 million or 23 cents per share in the fourth quarter of 2014, up 4.5% year over year.Dominion Energy recorded earnings of $195 million or 34 cents per share, up 14% year over year.Dominion Generation's earnings were $307 million or 52 cents per share, up 21.8% year over year.Corporate and Others incurred a loss of 25 cents per share, much wider than the year-ago loss of 14 cents.Total operating expenses in the quarter decreased 9.7% year over year to $2.14 billion.

inneapolis, MN based utility  (  ) announced that its board of directors has approved of an increase in the quarterly dividend rate by 2 cents. The revised quarterly dividend will be 32 cents, payable on Apr 20, 2015, to shareholders of record at the close of business on Mar 17, 2015.Due to this increase, the annualized dividend amounts to $1.28 per share, up 6.7% from the prior rate. The current annualized dividend yield is 3.5%, higher than the industry average of 2.14%. The increase in distributable income speaks of the company's successfully executed investment growth strategy.The Xcel Energy management understands the importance of sharing profits with its stakeholders. The company has fixed a long-term dividend payout target of 60-70%, which we believe is on par with other operators in the utility space. In addition, the company aims to increase its dividend annually in the range of 5-7%.Xcel Energy's diverse generation mix and focus on producing power from renewable sources will help the company to lower carbon emission. The ongoing improvement in the economic condition in its service territories is also driving sales.Xcel Energy's earnings have surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two out of the last four quarters, with a positive average earnings surprise of 2.47%. The company aims to increase its earnings annually in the range of 4-6%.Cash flow from operating activities at the end of the first nine months of 2014 was in excess of $2 billion. Increased electricity rates in its service territories have worked in favor of the company. We expect Xcel Energy's strong cash flow generating capability (generated cash flow from operations of more than $2 billion annually in the past three years) to help fund incremental dividends.Xcel Energy currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the space include Huaneng Power International, Inc. (  ), Pinnacle West Capital Corporation (  ) and Consolidated Edison, Inc. (  ). Huaneng Power sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while Pinnacle West Capital and Consolidated Edison, Inc. have a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Utility services play an important role in the economic system of any nation. Like every other sector, the demand for utility services fluctuates with the health of the broader economy. The extent of demand for electricity, gas and water varies with the swings of the economy, but these companies providing basic services can never go out of business. This is their most basic fundamental strength.Utility stocks are also considered as a safe investment bet given the regulatory nature of business and domestic focus. The capital intensive utility sector has done well in the last 12 months aided by lower interest rates and an ongoing improvement in the U.S. economy that led to more jobs and higher housing unit completion.Per a release from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, nearly 883,000 housing units were completed in 2014, increasing 15.5% from 2013 levels. This data combined with the U.S. Energy Information Administration's (EIA) projection of a 1.1% and 0.9% respective increase in electricity generation in 2015 and 2016 bodes well for the utility sector going forward.The utility industry has evolved over the decades with increasing industrialization and population growth spurring power demand. However, the price for this unrestricted expansion in the utility space has been heavy, particularly in terms of greenhouse gas emissions. The U.S. government has, over the years, formulated stricter regulations to lower emissions. In Jun 2014, the U.S. Environment Protection Agency (EPA) proposed the Clean Power Plan to lower carbon emission from power plants by 30% by 2030 from 2005 levels.The utilities on their part have proactively responded to these criticisms, investing in technologies to meet stringent environmental regulations. As a blessing in disguise, they've been compelled to develop new technologies to produce power at cheaper rates and boost their renewable portfolio. Also, the shale boom in the U.S., supported by the clean burning nature of natural gas, has resulted in its increasing uptake for power generation. An EIA report projects natural gas based generation rising from 27.3% of total generation in 2014 to 28.1% in 2016.The U.S. economy is showing consistent signs of improvement - the unemployment rate came down to 5.6% in Dec 2014 from the highs of 6.7% in Dec 2013. The U.S. GDP is expected to grow by 2.6% in 2015. The improvement in economic conditions will have a positive co-relation with demand for utility services.From an investment perspective, utilities provide assured returns in an uncertain .

 (  ) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2014 results before the opening bell on Jan 29. Last quarter, Xcel Energy posted a negative earnings surprise of 3.95%. Let's see how things are shaping up for the fourth quarter.Minneapolis, MN-based Xcel Energy is a major electricity and natural gas company in the U.S. Through its subsidiaries, the company is primarily engaged in the utility business and has a presence in eight states.Xcel Energy's earnings are highly dependent on constructive regulatory outcomes for rate cases. In early 2014, North Dakota Public Service Commission approved an annual base rate increase of 4.9% for three years starting from 2013.The sign of economic improvement is also prominent across Xcel Energy's service territories, especially in Minnesota, in comparison to the nation on the whole. This could drive the company's financials this quarter.Despite management's target to curtail costs, Xcel Energy's growing operation and maintenance expenses are a drag on the bottom line. Other risks involve stringent environment regulations and uneven weather patterns that could lead to unstable earnings.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Xcel Energy will beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat consensus estimates. That is not the case here as you will see below. Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -8.82%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate is 31 cents per share while the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at 34 cents. Xcel Energy's Zacks Rank #2 when combined with a -8.82% ESP makes an earnings beat difficult to predict.We caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some stocks in the electric utility space you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this season:PNM Resources, Inc. (  ) has an earnings ESP of +8.70% and a Zacks Rank #2.PG&E Corporation (  ) has an earnings ESP of +3.70% and a Zacks Rank #2.Wisconsin Energy Corp.

inneapolis, MN-based Xcel Energy Inc. (  ) firm has made a mark of its own in the electric utility space through its widespread operations and a solid customer base. The company currently operates primarily through its regulated utilities which lend a long-term growth potential.However, considering the nature of this industry, electric and natural gas utility businesses are impacted by changes in weather patterns which, in turn, weigh on their performance. In addition, U.S. Government's focus to lower carbon emission from power plants could impact Xcel Energy as it produces a major portion of its electricity from coal- fired units.Estimate Trend & Surprise HistoryXcel Energy missed on both the earnings and revenue Estimates in last quarter. Moreover, the recent earnings estimate revision activity for XEL has been mostly to the downside. The company currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Coming to the earnings surprise, Xcel Energy has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four quarters. However, due to wider negative surprises in the last two reports, the company's average surprise beat is at a negative 0.35%.Going further things could definitely change given the company's recently released earnings results.

Our consensus called for fourth-quarter EPS of 34 cents, and the company reported EPS of 39 cents (these figures take out stock option expenses).Revenue: The company also surpassed the revenue estimates in the fourth quarter. Xcel Energy posted revenues of $2,928.6 million in the quarter, compared to our consensus estimate of $2,876 million.Key Stats to Note: Xcel Energy's total electric sales increased 0.5% in the fourth quarter compared with the prior-year period. However, the utility's natural gas sales declined 0.9% in the quarter from last year.Stock Price: Shares were down 0.74% ahead of the report and remained inactive following the release.

Focus on adding renewables will help the company achieve its target of curbing carbon emissions. However, rising operating costs and tighter environmental legislations might limit the company's profitability.Minneapolis, MN-based Xcel Energy continues to invest substantially in its utility assets to provide reliable services to its customers and effectively meet rising electricity demand. The company's capital outlay from 2015 through 2019 is set at roughly $14.5 billion of which a large part is directed toward transmission and natural gas.This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company is currently diversifying its generation portfolio with emphasis on renewable sources. The company has already reduced carbon dioxide emissions during power generation by around 20% since 2005.Xcel Energy has set a target of adding 600 MW of wind energy to its portfolio by 2020 and 187 MW of large-scale solar energy by the end of 2016. These ventures will further aid the utility in reducing carbon emissions from its electricity generation plants.Moreover, positive economic fundamentals across Xcel Energy's service territories are an added encouragement. The consolidated unemployment rate at its service territory is lower than the national average.On the downside, unfavourable regulatory outcome, changes in weather pattern and stricter environmental laws still pose a threat to the company's operations.Other well-ranked stocks in the electric utility space include Huaneng Power International, Inc.

" (  ) recorded operating earnings of 73 cents per share in the third quarter 2014, falling short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 76 cents by nearly 3.9% and also lagging the year-ago earnings by 5.2%. Earnings declined on account of unfavorable weather.Xcel Energy's total revenue increased 1.7% year over year to $2,869.8 million in the reported quarter.Quarterly revenue, however, missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,108 million by 7.7%. Revenue from this segment increased a marginal 0.6% year over year to $2,616.3 million. Revenue from the Natural Gas business escalated 16.7% to $239.6 million. Segment revenue of $16.8 million in the reported quarter decreased 1.5% from $17.1 million in the year-ago period.Total operating expenses climbed 2.2% year over year to $2,204.1 million. The increasing costs can be attributed to a rise in cost of natural gas sold and transported, program expenses and depreciation and amortization charges.Operating income increased a slight 0.1% year over year to $665.7 million.Total interest charges and financing costs, after Allowance for funds used during construction (""AFUDC""), decreased 1.4% year over year at the end of the third quarter 2014 to $133.3 million.Total debt as of Sep 30, 2014, was $12.4 billion out of which long-term debt was $11.5 billion.In Mar 2014, Xcel Energy issued $300 million of 4.30% first mortgage bonds due Mar 15, 2044.

 (  ) is set to report its third-quarter 2014 earnings results before the market opens on Oct 30, 2014. Last quarter, it had delivered a negative earnings surprise of 4.88%. Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Xcel Energy continues to invest in several transmission, generation and distribution projects. For the next five years, the company plans to spend a total of nearly $14.1 billion. To focus on its transmission ventures, the company recently formed two TransCos - Xcel Energy Transmission Development Company, LLC and Xcel Energy Southwest Transmission Company, LLC.The company's stable financial position and systematic capital investment strategy are expected to boost the company's forthcoming performance.However, stringent environment regulations, extreme weather patterns and several operational risks may deter growth. The U.S. administration's stringent regulations on coal usage are our major concern. In Jun 2014, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency proposed the Clean Power Plan to curb carbon emissions from the power sector by 30% by 2030 from 2005 levels. Though Xcel Energy is currently following several initiatives to diversify it generation mix, coal remains its primary fuel for generating power. If the proposal is approved as it is, Xcel Energy will have to invest more to cut pollution from its power generation facilities. This will likely increase the company's operating costs.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Xcel Energy is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Xcel Energy has an ESP of 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate both stand at 76 cents per share, making the difference 0.00%. Xcel Energy carries Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).We caution against stocks with Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Consolidated Edison, Inc. (  ) has an Earnings ESP of +2.80% and a Zacks Rank #2.Duke Energy Corporation (  ) has an Earnings ESP of +0.66% and a Zacks Rank #3.Dynegy Inc.

 (  ) touched a 52-week high of $32.99 per share on Oct 15, with a traded volume of 6.6 million shares. The shares finally closed a tad lower at $32.22 per share.Xcel Energy posted positive earnings surprises in three of the last four quarters although missing out in the most recent quarter by 4.9%. The average earnings beat of the company in the last four quarter is 0.97% and the long-term earnings growth rate is 4.16%.The company continues to invest in infrastructural upgrades with an estimated capital expenditure of $2.9 billion in 2014. Over the next five years, Xcel Energy plans to invest $14.1 billion in transmission, generation and distribution projects.In addition, Xcel Energy is expanding its generation mix to include more renewables. With the U.S. market leaning towards green energy, Xcel Energy's large-scale clean energy projects will prove beneficial in the long run. The company has set a target of reducing carbon emission by 30% by 2020. The company is expected to complete its two wind projects in 2015 and it has also issued request for proposals for installation of 100 MW of solar power by 2016.This drive to spur renewables is now seen to be an industry-wide phenomenon. In the face of stringent government regulations, utility companies like Exelon Corp. (  ), Duke Energy Corp. (  ) and NRG Energy, Inc. (  ) are also stepping up their renewable energy portfolio.The economy in Xcel Energy's service territory has witnessed significant improvement when compared with the nation as a whole. This optimism in the market converts to higher sales and better performance for the company.Xcel Energy also looks attractive in terms of valuation, as its price-to-earnings ratio of 16.36 is at a discount to the industry average. The dividend yield of 3.67% also beats its peer average. The overall liquidity position is favorable at $1.5 billion.Minneapolis, MN-based Xcel Energy is an electricity and natural gas company, with operations in eight states. The company through its four regulated utility subsidiaries serves about 3.5 million electricity customers and almost 1.9 million natural gas customers.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

nvestors considering a purchase of Xcel Energy, Inc. (Symbol: XEL) shares, but cautious about paying the going market price of $37.38/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the September put at the $35 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of 25 cents. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 0.7% return against the $35 commitment, or a 1.1% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to XEL's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $35 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Xcel Energy, Inc. sees its shares fall 6.9% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $34.75 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the 25 cents from $35), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 1.1% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Xcel Energy, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $35 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the September put at the $35 strike for the 1.1% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Xcel Energy, Inc. (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $37.38) to be 15%. For other put options contract ideas at the various different available expirations, visit the  page of StockOptionsChannel.com.In mid-afternoon trading on Thursday, the put volume among S&P 500 components was 711,214 contracts, with call volume at 711,214, for a put:call ratio of 0.72 so far for the day, which is above normal compared to the long-term median put:call ratio of .65. In other words, if we look at the number of call buyers and then use the long-term median to project the number of put buyers we'd expect to see, we're actually seeing more put buyers than expected out there in options trading so far today.  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Commit To Buy Xcel Energy At $35, Earn 1.1% Annualized Using Options@2015-01-22@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/commit-buy-xcel-energy-35-earn-11-annualized-using-options-2015-01-22
tility services play an important role in the economic progress of a nation. Like every other sector, the demand for utility services fluctuates with the health of the broader economy. Demand for electricity, gas and water does vary with the swings of the economy, but these companies providing basic services can never go out of business. This marks their most fundamental strength.The utility industry has evolved over the decades with increasing industrialization and population growth spurring power demand. But electrical utilities have primarily relied on coal-fired units that have increasingly come under pressure, both from the government and strident pro-environment groups.Utilities have responded to these criticisms, investing in technologies to meet stringent environmental regulations, as solar energy investments by NRG Energy (  ) and others shows. As a blessing in disguise, they've been compelled to develop new technologies to produce power at cheaper rates and boost their renewable portfolio.The shale boom in the U.S., supported by the clean-burning nature of natural gas, has resulted in its increasing usage for power generation. A number of major utilities like Minneapolis-based Excel Energy (  ), Houston-based Calpine (  ) and many others have closed down coal-based generation plants and replaced them with cleaner burning natural gas powered facilities.From an investment perspective, utilities have traditionally been the safest bet amid market fluctuation due to their defensive nature of operations. Besides offering steady returns, utilities diligently share profits with their shareholders through regular dividend payments.The U.S. economy has improved substantially from last year with the Fed gradually scaling back its bond-buying program. The latest release from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that 45 states and the District of Columbia saw a decline in the unemployment rate from the prior year, while three states witnessed rising unemployment.Moreover, per a report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), total electricity consumption in the U.S. will increase from 3,826 billion kWh in 2012 to 4,954 billion kWh in 2040. This reflects an average annual growth rate of 0.9%. Supported by a strengthening economy and rising demand, utilities have room for growth going forward.Utilities are investing substantially in infrastructure upgrades and adding more renewables to their fuel mix. These operations are capital intensive, for which they often have to take recourse to the capital markets to raise funds. The Fed, in its latest policy meeting, maintained its prior stance, saying that rates would stay low for a longer period. The rock-bottom interest rates and the Fed's reassurance about keeping them low for at least the near term will bode well for utilities.Within the Zacks Industry classification, Utilities are a stand-alone sector, one of 16 Zacks sectors. The rural wire-line telephone companies are also grouped within the Zacks Utility sector, but the three major industries within this sector include Electric Power, Gas Distribution and Water Supply.The Utility sector's defensive attributes reflect the group's lack of correlation with the broader market/economy. Of course, the sector's reputation as a dividend payer also adds to its perceived defensiveness.We rank all of the more than 260 industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook for the constituent companies in each industry. This ranking is available in the Zacks Industry Rank. http://www.zacks.com/rank/industry.phpThe way to look at the complete list of Zacks Industry Rank for the 260+ industries is that the outlook for industries with Zacks Industry Rank of #88 and lower is 'Positive,' between #89 and #176 is 'Neutral' and #177 and higher is 'Negative.'After scanning the Utility sector, we find three prominent industries under it in the first two categories. Gas Distribution has a Zacks Industry Rank #71, Water Supply has a Zacks Industry Rank #92 and Electric Power has a Zacks Industry Rank #146. Overall, our present outlook on this industry is Neutral.In the second quarter of 2014, total earnings for the Utility sector were up 12.3% on 3.1% higher revenues.In the third quarter, total earnings from the utilities are expected to be up by 8.8% on 3.5% revenue growth. The year-over-year decline in the unemployment rate in the majority of U.S. states and consistent investment by the utilities to strengthen their existing infrastructure will boost performance going forward. The infrastructure improvement drive across the sector will not only bring more system reliability but also meet the growing demand for utility services given the expanding customer base.For 2014 and 2015, earnings from this sector are expected to increase at rates of 9.1% and 4.9% year over year. In 2014, the Utility sector is expected to surpass the S&P 500 growth of 8.0% but lag the 2015 projection of 12.0%.For more information about earnings for this sector and others, please read our '  ' report.Stocks in the Utilities sector have been strong performers lately, with prices for companies in the sector up more than +12% year to date, roughly double the pace for the S&P 500 index as a whole in that time period. This is inline with the sector's historical track record, as the attractiveness of Utility sector stocks increases in periods of market anxiety. We would expect this trend to continue in the near-to-medium term as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

Besides offering steady returns, utilities diligently share profits with their shareholders through regular dividend payments.The U.S. economy has improved substantially from last year with the Fed gradually scaling back its bond-buying program. The latest release from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that 45 states and the District of Columbia saw a decline in the unemployment rate from the prior year, while three states witnessed rising unemployment.Moreover, per a report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), total electricity consumption in the U.S. will increase from 3,826 billion kWh in 2012 to 4,954 billion kWh in 2040. This reflects an average annual growth rate of 0.9%. Supported by a strengthening economy and rising demand, utilities have room for growth going forward.Utilities are investing substantially in infrastructure upgrades and adding more renewables to their fuel mix. These operations are capital intensive, for which they often have to take recourse to the capital markets to raise funds. The Fed, in its latest policy meeting, maintained its prior stance, saying that rates would stay low for a longer period. The rock-bottom interest rates and the Fed's reassurance about keeping them low for at least the near term will bode well for utilities.Within the Zacks Industry classification, Utilities are a stand-alone sector, one of 16 Zacks sectors. The rural wire-line telephone companies are also grouped within the Zacks Utility sector, but the three major industries within this sector include Electric Power, Gas Distribution and Water Supply.The Utility sector's defensive attributes reflect the group's lack of correlation with the broader market/economy. Of course, the sector's reputation as a dividend payer also adds to its perceived defensiveness.We rank all of the more than 260 industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook for the constituent companies in each industry. This ranking is available in the Zacks Industry Rank. http://www.zacks.com/rank/industry.phpThe way to look at the complete list of Zacks Industry Rank for the 260+ industries is that the outlook for industries with Zacks Industry Rank of #88 and lower is 'Positive,' between #89 and #176 is 'Neutral' and #177 and higher is 'Negative.'After scanning the Utility sector, we find three prominent industries under it in the first two categories. Gas Distribution has a Zacks Industry Rank #71, Water Supply has a Zacks Industry Rank #92 and Electric Power has a Zacks Industry Rank #146. Overall, our present outlook on this industry is Neutral.In the second quarter of 2014, total earnings for the Utility sector were up 12.3% on 3.1% higher revenues.In the third quarter, total earnings from the utilities are expected to be up by 8.8% on 3.5% revenue growth. The year-over-year decline in the unemployment rate in the majority of U.S. states and consistent investment by the utilities to strengthen their existing infrastructure will boost performance going forward. The infrastructure improvement drive across the sector will not only bring more system reliability but also meet the growing demand for utility services given the expanding customer base.For 2014 and 2015, earnings from this sector are expected to increase at rates of 9.1% and 4.9% year over year. In 2014, the Utility sector is expected to surpass the S&P 500 growth of 8.0% but lag the 2015 projection of 12.0%.For more information about earnings for this sector and others, please read our '  ' report.Stocks in the Utilities sector have been strong performers lately, with prices for companies in the sector up more than +12% year to date, roughly double the pace for the S&P 500 index as a whole in that time period. This is inline with the sector's historical track record, as the attractiveness of Utility sector stocks increases in periods of market anxiety. We would expect this trend to continue in the near-to-medium term as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

n Sep 5, we have issued an updated research report on  (  ). The company's stable financial position and systematic capital investment strategy are expected to boost the company's forthcoming performance. In addition, payment of dividends at regular intervals is appreciable. However, stringent environment regulations, over-dependence on weather patterns and several operational risks could act as growth deterrents.This Zacks Ranked #3 (Hold) stock's second-quarter 2014 earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate while revenues beat the mark. On a year-over-year basis, the bottom line decreased primarily due to higher expenses. However, quarterly revenues saw an uptrend on the back of increased electricity and natural gas returns.Xcel Energy maintains a steady financial profile with total available liquidity of approximately $1.5 billion. The company's operating cash flow in the first half of 2014 was around $1 billion. A favorable financial position will allow the company to follow its capital spending program.Xcel Energy continues to invest in its several transmission, generation and distribution projects. For the next five years, the company plans to spend nearly $14.1 billion. As of Jun 30, 2014, Xcel Energy invested $0.82 billion on five transmission projects under its CapX2020 program. To focus more on transmission ventures, the company recently formed two TransCos - Xcel Energy Transmission Development Company, LLC and Xcel Energy Southwest Transmission Company, LLC.Apart from utilizing funds for growth ventures, Xcel Energy's strong cash generation capacity enables it to share the profit with its shareholders in terms of paying regular dividends. This initiative will help the company attract more investors to the stock.On the downside, the U.S. administration's stringent regulations on environmental issues are our major concern. In Jun 2014, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency proposed the Clean Power Plan to curb carbon emissions from the power sector by 30% by 2030 from 2005 levels. Though Xcel Energy is currently following several initiatives to diversify it generation mix, coal remains its primary fuel for generating power. If the proposal is approved as it is, Xcel Energy will have to invest more to cut pollution from its power generation facilities. This will likely increase the company's operating costs.Other better-ranked stocks in the sector include ALLETE, Inc. (  ), CMS Energy Corporation (  ) and Consolidated Edison, Inc.

"Source: Exelon.Investors have been hunting for a ""magic metric"" for as long as stock markets have existed. Of the myriad metrics around, return on equity, or ROE, has become a favorite first stab for judging a company's worth. But for the wise investor, there's a clearer calculation out there -- one that can ultimately separate the winner stocks from the losers. Let's look at two utilities that offer giant dividends --  and  -- to see which is worth its weight. Return on equity measures the percentage of net income that is returned to shareholders. In this case, Exelonmanages an 8.2% ROE, while Xcel Energy ups the ante to 10.1% .Nearly a century ago,  delved deeper to get at the questions investors really want to know. This extended DuPont model splits ROE into five ratios, each of which tells an interesting investment tale.Here's how the ratios stack up for Exelon and Xcel Energy:
  
Source: Data from  .Xcel leads innearly every category . The utility sets itself up for success with a strong starting point -- its pre-interest pre-tax margin is a full 3 percentage points higher than Exelon's. While that number is partially determined by corporate practice, it's also steeped in regulation.In the company's latest second-quarter earnings report, roughly 80% of Xcel Energy's electric margin improvements came from retail rate increases across six states. This alone added $38 million to its coffers for the quarter.For the same quarter, lower realized energy prices put a crimp in Exelon's unregulated generation earnings, which accounted for just over 50% of its total adjusted earnings.When it comes to taxes, Xcel also seems to be on Uncle Sam's good side. The utility scored a solid 0.04 points higher than Exelon Corporation. This metric reveals the other side of pre-tax margins, and Xcel has managed to hang on to its lead.As slow-moving mega-corporations, asset turnover isn't an all-important indicator, but interest burden is essential. Utilities take out massive loans to cover large infrastructure projects, and Exelon is losing more of its money to interest expenses than Xcel. Xcel also recently announced it plans to shave an additional $5 million off interest expenses for fiscal 2014. That's small money, but it tells investors that Xcel isn't looking to expand its interest burden; its lower equity multiplier reaffirms that message. This breakdown provides the complete story for the 1.9 percentage point difference between two companies' ROE. Xcel Energy enjoys a fatter margin, a faster business, smaller loan payments, and lighter taxes. For dividend stock investors, the current 0.1 percentage point difference between Exelon's 4% yield and Xcel's 3.9% makes the case even more compelling. Long-term investors can expect Xcel to do more with your money -- and give you more in return.

n Jun 12, we have issued an updated research report on  (  ). The utility operator is poised to benefit from large-scale investments directed primarily at generation, distribution and transmission operations. The company's CapX2020 transmission program has made excellent progress and it has already completed the 230-Kilovolt (Kv) transmission line in Minnesota.These projects will offer substantial support to Xcel Energy's large-scale generation operations and help provide service reliability to customers.However, coal still holds a major share in Xcel Energy's generation mix, which will make its coal-fired units subject to strict environment legislations. Moreover, rising operation and maintenance expense might limit the company's profitability.Xcel Energy, a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, got off to a flying start in the first quarter of 2014 with both earnings and revenue beating the Zacks Consensus Estimates. The severe winter weather drove up power demand, which in turn boosted sales. On a year-over-year basis, quarterly top and bottom line also reported impressive growth.The continued market optimism in Xcel Energy's service territories and positive rate revisions at its North Dakota and New Mexico service zones should support the company's revenue stream. In addition, Xcel Energy's series of clean energy projects will prove beneficial in the long run given the current pulse in the U.S. market favoring green energy.The company expanded its renewable generation capabilities by 11% from 2005 through 2013 and further intends to broaden green generation's share to 27% by 2020.Nonetheless, Xcel Energy needs to watch out for market price volatilities and operational risks associated with explosion, leak and mechanical setbacks at natural gas transmission and distribution operations.Other better-ranked utility players include  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ).

"ne of solar power's sticking points is a relatively high price tag when compared to fuels like natural gas and coal. However, as solar costs head lower, that dynamic could be changing -- at least at the utility level. The basics of solar are pretty simple: turn the sun's rays into electricity. There are, however, different methods for doing that. For example, some utility-scale solar systems reflect the sun's rays onto what amounts to a giant pot of water. When that water boils, it creates steam that is used to create energy. Photovoltaic systems, meanwhile, turn the sun's rays directly into electricity -- like a solar calculator, only much bigger.And then there are variations on these themes. For example, the types of solar panels that giant rooftop solar installer  installs sit on a customer's roof and don't move. That means they can only be put up where the sun shines and where rooftops are in a good location. Some utility scale systems, however, use arrays of solar panels that track the sun. The bases turn through the day and/or the solar panels tilt to get the best angle. That's high tech!(Source: ReubenGBrewer, via Wikimedia Commons)However, better technology costs more money. And the prices of more basic systems are coming down. As a case in point, SolarCity's installation costs have dropped nearly 30% in two years. And the company expects more savings to come.  , which installs rooftop solar but works more at the utility level, noted that 2013 was the second consecutive year that it was able to reduce its solar panel manufacturing costs by 20%. And, like SolarCity, SunPower expects costs to come down even further as it builds more up-to-date manufacturing facilities. And this is where things start to get interesting. Having the best solar technology may not make the most cost effective solar installation. SolarCity installs stationary solar systems because it wouldn't make financial sense to put rotating and tilting panels on someone's roof. Utilities are willing to pay the extra cost if it increases solar output or makes solar a more available resource -- during peak consumption times, for example.But a recent round of bidding on solar projects for  suggests that may not be enough to overcome cheap panels anymore. Xcel, which has made a huge commitment to wind power, has an agreement with Geronimo Energy to build a $250 million solar project, called Aurora, that includes tilting arrays. Only now Xcel appears to be suggesting that it can get cheaper solar power without any bells and whistles.According to the utility, more than a dozen solar projects from a recent request for proposals came in with power priced at $0.085 per kilowatt hour or less. That's pretty cheap. In fact, Xcel reportedly sent a letter to state regulators saying that these proposals are ""significantly less expensive"" than Geronimo Energy's Aurora proposal.(Source: Ahsanul Hoque, via Wikimedia Commons)Xcel isn't allowed to say exactly what the Aurora project costs, but significantly less expensive pretty much spells it out. The company wants to ditch Aurora and go with the cheaper option. Needless to say, Geronimo isn't happy about this development.Betsy Engelking, a vice president at Geronimo, recently told  that ""Xcel is trying to make comparisons between two different solar resources."" Engelking pointed out the benefit of the tilting solar arrays it planned, and provided ""a financial assurance to Xcel about delivering electricity when customer demand spikes."" But if simple stationary solar costs so much less, Xcel could just put more of it up to compensate. Xcel Energy is right in the thick of this cost/benefit analysis. And the math is only going to get more and more interesting as solar prices fall further. It's almost inevitable, since photovoltaic solar panels are essentially chips, which Moore's law suggests just keep getting cheaper. Then there's also the issue of scale and expertise. As more solar goes up, experience allows for increased efficiency and lower costs.At some point, and that may be now, it doesn't make sense to bother with better but more expensive because cheap is, well, so cheap that better can't compete. It looks like now is the time to reexamine solar costs, and Xcel may be the litmus test.You already know record oil and natural gas production is changing the lives of millions of Americans.

" (  ) recorded operating earnings in the first quarter 2014 of 52 cents per share, up 4 cents from the year-ago quarter and also beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4%.The earnings outperformance stemmed from higher electric and natural gas sales due to severe cold weather that drove demand, as well as from favorable rate increases in several service territories. This was partially offset by escalating operation and maintenance cost as well as property taxes.Xcel Energy's revenue jumped 15.1% year over year to $3,202.6 million in the reported quarter. The sharp year-over-year upturn was due to encouraging electric and natural gas returns from the company's NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin service areas.Quarterly revenue also outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 11.2%. Revenue from this segment surged 10% year over year to $2,302 million. This was mainly due to a 4.8% rise in residential electric sales. Revenue from the Natural Gas business also registered a substantial increase of 31.4% to $879.7 million on account of rising U.S. gas prices. Segment revenue of $21.2 million in the reported quarter is almost in-line with $21.1 million of the year-ago period.Total operating expenses of Xcel Energy climbed 16.3% year over year to $2,708.6 million. The escalating costs can be attributed to a 42% rise in cost of natural gas sold and transported, compounded by a 15.4% rise in electric fuel and purchased power costs.Operating income rose 8.7% year over year to $494 million as magnitude of increase in revenue outweighed the magnitude of increase in cost.Total interest charges and financing costs, after Allowance for funds used during construction (""AFUDC"") decreased 1% at the end of first quarter 2014 to $129.5 million.Long-term debts as of Mar 31, 2014, were $11.2 billion.

(  ) posted first quarter earnings of 23 cents marginally surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 22 cents.Xcel Energy continued its good run by reporting both top- and bottom-line beats in the first quarter of 2014. The harsh winter weather proved to be a crucial demand driver that helped the company to book solid sales.The constructive rate outcomes in the North Dakota and New Mexico service regions will fetch profitable returns in the coming quarters.

lectric and natural gas provider  (  ) and solar cell manufacturer  (  ) have decided to extend their ties by developing yet another solar photovoltaic (PV) plant in Colorado. Per the agreement, these companies will develop a 50-megawatt solar PV power plant in Colorado's San Luis Valley.Earlier, these companies had jointly developed a 19 MW Greater Sandhill plant in operation since 2010 and a 30 MW San Luis Valley Solar Ranch operational since 2011. Xcel Energy's sustained efforts to boost its green generation basket will help meet the state of Colorado's renewable energy standard of 30% by 2020.In fact, the power generated from this new solar plant will be slightly more than the combined production from the two solar power units mentioned above. SunPower - a subsidiary of  (  ) - will start construction from 2015. The new plant will come online in 2016. The expected total power generation from these three solar plants will be capable of providing electricity to 26,500 Colorado homes.For the project, SunPower will design and build a SunPower Oasis Power Plant system. Once online, this new solar unit will offset almost 127,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions and contribute towards a greener environment.Xcel Energy presently has about 80 MW of utility-scale solar and approximately 188 MW of customer-sited solar generation in Colorado. In 2013, Colorado Public Utility Commission granted permission to Xcel Energy to add more solar power to its portfolio. The commission approved an addition of 170 MW of utility-scale solar generation through power purchase agreements.Xcel Energy, a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, reported earnings of 52 cents in the first quarter of 2014, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4%. The company reiterated its 2014 earnings guidance in the range of $1.90 to $2.05 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.99 per share, near the midpoint of the guidance range.

 (  ) reported adjusted earnings per share of 14 cents which declined 36.4% from the year-ago quarter. Earnings nominally beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 13 cents.The earnings downturn in the reported quarter was due to unfavorable weather in its service territories and lower transmission revenues.Quarterly revenue was $686.3 million, down 0.1% from the year-earlier period. Revenue in the reported quarter also fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.4%. The revenue downturn was attributable to declining electricity sales volume from the company's retail segment.Total regulated electricity delivered in the quarter fell 1.7% to 6,862 Gigawatt-hours (GWh) from 6,978 GWh in the year-ago quarter.During the quarter, retail electricity sales decreased 6.5% to 5,612 GWh from 6,001 GWh a year ago. The decline was due to lower electricity consumption by business as well as residential customers.On the cost side, fuel and purchased power costs climbed 8.3% to $249.8 million from the year-ago quarter. The company's operations and maintenance (O&M) expenses however decreased 4.6% year over year to $212.9 million due to a decline in employee benefit costs.Operating income dropped 13.5% year over year to $75.2 million in the first quarter. The cost increase combined with lower revenues ate into profitability.As of Mar 31, 2014, Pinnacle West's cash and cash equivalents were $103.4 million versus $9.5 million as of Dec 31, 2013.Long-term debt as of Mar 31, 2014, was $3,045.6 million compared with $2,796.5 million as of Dec 31, 2013.The company generated $249.2 million in cash from operations during the quarter, increasing 17.4% year over year.Capital expenditure increased 13.4% year over year to $207.5 million.Pinnacle West estimates earnings in 2014 in the band $3.60-$3.75 per share.

In addition, the company's effort to seize the growing opportunities in the solar market through its large-scale AZ Sun program will bode well for future growth.Pinnacle West presently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Pinnacle West Earnings Beat Ests by a Penny - Analyst Blog@2014-05-02@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/pinnacle-west-earnings-beat-ests-by-a-penny-analyst-blog-2014-05-02
"n the latest look at the underlying components of the S&P 500 ordered by largest market capitalization, Xcel Energy, Inc. (Symbol: XEL) has taken over the #276 spot from Alcoa, Inc. (Symbol: AA), according to  .Market capitalization is an important data point for investors to keep an eye on, for various reasons. The most basic reason is that it gives a true comparison of the value attributed by the stock market to a given company's stock. Many beginning investors look at one stock trading at $10 and another trading at $20 and mistakenly think the latter company is worth twice as much - that of course is a completely meaningless comparison without knowing how many shares of each company exist. But comparing market capitalization (factoring in those share counts) creates a true ""apples-to-apples"" comparison of the value of two stocks. In the case of Xcel Energy, Inc. (Symbol: XEL), the market cap is now $15.62 billion, versus Alcoa, Inc. (Symbol: AA) at $15.60 billion.Below is a chart of Xcel Energy, Inc. versus Alcoa, Inc. plotting their respective size rank within the S&P 500 over time (XEL plotted in blue; AA plotted in green):    Below is a three month price history chart comparing the stock performance of XEL vs. AA:Another reason market capitalization is important is where it places a company in terms of its size tier in relation to peers - much like the way a mid-size sedan is typically compared to other mid-size sedans (and not SUV's). This can have a direct impact on which mutual funds and ETFs are willing to own the stock. For instance, a mutual fund that is focused solely on Large Cap stocks may for example only be interested in those companies sized $10 billion or larger. Another illustrative example is the S&P MidCap index which essentially takes the S&P 500 index and ""tosses out"" the biggest 100 companies so as to focus solely on the 400 smaller ""up-and-comers"" (which in the right environment can outperform their larger rivals). So a company's market cap, especially in relation to other companies, carries great importance, and for this reason we at  find value to putting together these rankings daily.According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, XEL and AA collectively make up 3.10% of the Guggenheim S&P 500 Pure Value ETF (  ) which is lower by about 0.7% on the day Tuesday.At the closing bell, XEL is down about 0.2%, while AA is down about 1.6% on the day Tuesday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Xcel Energy Now #276 Largest Company, Surpassing Alcoa@2014-05-06@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/xcel-energy-now-276-largest-company-surpassing-alcoa-2014-05-06

ooking at the universe of stocks we cover at  , in trading on Friday, shares of Xcel Energy, Inc. (Symbol: XEL) were yielding above the 4% mark based on its quarterly dividend (annualized to $1.20), with the stock changing hands as low as $29.92 on the day. Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return. To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) back on 12/31/1999 - you would have paid $146.88 per share. Fast forward to 12/31/2012 and each share was worth $142.41 on that date, a decrease of $4.67/share over all those years. But now consider that you collected a whopping $25.98 per share in dividends over the same period, for a positive total return of 23.36%. Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.6%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 4% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable. Xcel Energy, Inc. (Symbol: XEL) is an S&P 500 company, giving it special status as one of the large-cap companies making up the S&P 500 Index.In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Xcel Energy, Inc., looking at the history chart for XEL below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 4% annual yield.    According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, XEL makes up 3.95% of the PowerShares DWA Utilities Momentum Portfolio ETF (Symbol: PUI) which is trading up by about 0.5% on the day Friday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Xcel Energy (XEL) Shares Cross 4% Yield Mark@2014-03-28@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/xcel-energy-xel-shares-cross-4-yield-mark-2014-03-28
tility operator  (  ) filed a request with Minnesota state regulators for adding 150 megawatts (MW) of solar energy to its generation portfolio by the end of 2016. By capitalizing on the benefits of large-scale operations, management plans to keep the costs low for its customers.Adding renewable power will allow Xcel Energy to meet the Renewable Portfolio Standard of Minnesota. The state requires Xcel Energy to source 31.5% of total generation from renewable sources by 2020.Of the total renewables mandate, 24% of energy should be generated through wind, 1.5% to come from solar energy, another 1% optional from wind or solar and the remaining 5% to be met by other eligible renewable sources. Xcel Energy will require 300 MW of solar energy to meet the renewable energy standards.Xcel Energy's 150 MW solar projects will have an installation deadline of Dec 31, 2016. This will allow the company to benefit from the solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) effective until December 31, 2016. This policy encourages investors in solar construction with multi-year tax incentives and reduces tax liability for individuals as well as corporates purchasing qualified solar technologies.The company plans to fund a portion of this expansion by issuance of new public offerings and the rest through Xcel's Renewable Development Fund. Along with this expansion, Xcel Energy has plans for additional large-scale solar acquisition by 2017 - 2018 for fulfilling Minnesota's renewable standards for solar energy.Xcel Energy currently holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The year-over-year upturn was due to encouraging electric and natural gas returns primarily due to the implementation of new rates in various jurisdictions.Quarterly revenue also outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,626 million by 2.2%. : Revenue from this segment was up 3.5% year over year to $2,298 million. : Revenue from the Natural Gas business registered an 8.2% increase to $369.7 million. Segment revenue of $18.3 million in the reported quarter increased 3.5% from $17.7 million in the year-ago period.Total operating expenses climbed 5.1% year over year to $2,287.9 million. The escalating costs can be attributed to an 11.7% rise in cost of natural gas sold and transported, compounded by a nearly 3% rise in electric fuel and purchased power costs.Operating income was down 1.2% year over year to $397.2 million as the revenue increase was outweighed by spiraling costs.Total interest charges and financing costs, after Allowance for funds used during construction (""AFUDC""), decreased 5.3% year over year at the end of the second quarter 2014 to $129.3 million.Total debts as of Jun 30, 2014, were $12.6 billion out of which long-term debt was $11.8 billion.In May 2014, Xcel Energy issued $300 million, 4.125% first mortgage bonds due May 15, 2044.

 . (  ) will release its first quarter 2014 financial results before the market bell on May 1, 2014. In the prior quarter, this utility reported a positive earnings surprise of 3.45%. Xcel Energy currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Let's see how things are shaping up at Xcel Energy prior to this announcement.The ongoing improvement in the U.S. economy and the cold spell in Xcel Energy's service territories are expected to have a favorable impact on first-quarter results. The company also stands to benefit from the new rates that have been implemented in some of the states of its operation.However, rising operating expenses could offset to some extent the expected gains and impact margins. In fact, in 2013, operating expenses increased at a higher clip than revenues. Xcel Energy guided that 2014 expenses will also increase from 2013 levels.Accordingly, our proven model does not conclusively show that Xcel Energy is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  (Expected Surprise Prediction) and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. This is not the case here. This is because the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 50 cents, resulting in a 0.00% ESP. : Xcel Energy's Zacks Rank #2 combined with a 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult. We caution against stocks with Zacks #4 and #5 Ranks (Sell rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some companies tied to the Electric utility industry worth considering on the basis of our model, which shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter. (  ) has an earnings ESP of +28.57% and carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). (  ) has an earnings ESP of +7.61% and carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

"n Dec 27, 2013, we have reiterated our Neutral recommendation on the utility provider  (  ). The company currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The Neutral stance takes into account higher cost of compliance in the wake of strict environmental regulations and volatility in commodity prices. We have at the same time identified several positives, including a steady effort toward expanding the renewable portfolio along with strengthening the traditional generation asset base, which will act as important growth drivers.In third-quarter 2013, Xcel Energy's operating earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. However, quarterly results were a penny lower than the prior-year figure primarily due to higher operating and maintenance expenses, and lower demand as a fallout of cooler weather.Xcel Energy's operations are subject to a number of legislative requirements, as well as environmental regulations, relating to emission of greenhouse gases, and air and water quality. Changes in environmental regulations are expected to impact the company's cost of operations.On the positive, Xcel Energy continues with its systematic investments in transmission infrastructure to deliver reliable energy to its customers. The company plans to spend $13 billion over the next five years, of which 30% will be allocated to the development of transmission infrastructure and 26% to generation projects. The company's transmission projects under the CapX2020 program are progressing well, which will act as a catalyst in the future.In addition, the company is currently focusing on developing its renewable portfolio and intends to add up to 1,900 megawatts (""MW"") of wind resources over the next 20 years. The company has already received approvals from several federal commissions to construct new projects. Timely completion of these ventures will enable Xcel Energy to fulfill government mandates on renewable generation requirements and provide uninterrupted, clean electricity to its customers.Stocks worth considering in the utility sector include  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ). While Westar Energy holds a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), The AES Corporation and Alliant Energy carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Neutral on Xcel Energy - Analyst Blog@2013-12-30@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/neutral-on-xcel-energy-analyst-blog-2013-12-30
e expect diversified utility company  (  ) to beat expectations when it reports fourth-quarter 2013 results on Jan 30, 2014.Our proven model shows that TECO Energy is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of key factors. The  (Expected Surprise Prediction), which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +4.76%. This is meaningful and a leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for this company. The stocks with Zacks Ranks of #1, 2 and 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. The Sell rated stocks (#4 and 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of TECO Energy's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and +4.76% ESP make us confident of a positive earnings beat on Jan 30.In Sep 2013, TECO Energy's subsidiary Tampa Electric Company received an approval from the Florida Public Service Commission to increase the monthly rates of the residential electricity customers. The regulated utility providers recoup their investments from the customers through the filing of rate hike. The timely sanction of rate-hike request will encourage the utility company to invest more to upgrade its asset base. These initiatives will enable the company to provide uninterrupted services to its customers.In addition, gradual improvement of economy at the state of Florida including housing market recovery, a decrease in unemployment rate and creation of new jobs will influence the consumers to pay utility bills on time and create opportunities for addition of new customers to its portfolio. These factors will fuel TECO Energy's future performance.TECO Energy is not the only company looking up this earnings season. We also see likely earnings beat coming from other utility providers.

The quarterly figure also lagged 7.8% from the year-ago profit of $1.03.NextEra Energy recorded GAAP earnings of 75 cents in the fourth quarter compared with $1.02 per share in the year-ago period.NextEra Energy anticipated its 2013 earnings to be in the upper half of its guidance range of $4.70 to $5.00 per share. The earnings for the year came in at $4.97 per share, on the higher end of the guidance range. The bottom line was 0.4% higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.95 and 8.7% higher than the prior year.A strong finish of the financial year is attributed to the company's effective execution of development projects, continual customer additions and service start-up of renewable contracted projects.GAAP earnings for 2013 were $4.47 versus $4.56 in the previous year. The difference between operating and GAAP earnings, during the year, was due to a 13 cents impact from unrealized mark-to-market loss from non-qualifying hedges, 80 cents impact from impairment, 1 cent loss of Spain solar project and 44 cents gain from discontinued operations.NextEra Energy's total operating revenue for fourth-quarter 2013 was $3.63 billion, up 7.6% from $3.37 billion reported in the year-ago period. Reported quarter revenue lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.88 million by 6.5%.Total revenue of $15.1 billion in 2013 missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.56 billion by 2.7%. However, the topline was 6.2% higher than the year-ago figure of $14.2 billion.Total operating expenses during the quarter increased 13.1% year over year to $2.98 billion. This was mainly due to 5.9% and 15.3% increase in other operations and maintenance expenses as well as taxes other than incomes taxes, respectively.The increasing expenses had a negative impact on operating income of the company.Total operating income in the quarter decreased 12.4% year over year to $0.64 billion.Interest expenses in the fourth quarter of 2013 were $0.29 billion increasing 21.8% from $0.24 billion from the year ago period. The increase in the interest expense was due to the increase in the debt level of the company compared to previous year.Net earnings in the quarter were $0.41 billion versus $0.43 billion in year ago quarter. : Revenue for fourth-quarter 2013 was $2.54 billion versus $2.33 billion in the prior-year quarter, reflecting an increase of 9%.Net earnings for the quarter were 57 cents versus 61 cents in the year ago quarter. The 6.5% year over year decline was primarily due to transition costs associated with Project Momentum. This initiative was taken to improve productivity. : Revenue in the fourth quarter was $0.99 billion, up 2.5% from $0.96 billion in the year-ago quarter.Net Earnings for the quarter were 40 cents versus 42 cents in the year ago quarter. The 4.8% year over year decline was primarily due to higher corporate general and administrative expenses, partly offset by greater contributions from new investments. : Revenue for fourth-quarter 2013 was $99.0 million, up 35.6% from $73.0 million in the year-ago period.In the reported quarter this segment negatively impacted earnings per share by 2 cents, compared to no impact in the comparable quarter of the prior year.Cash and cash equivalents as of Dec 31, 2013 were $438.0 million, increasing from $329.0 million as of Dec 31, 2012.Long-term debts as of Dec 31, 2013 were $23.96 billion versus $23.17 billion as of Dec 31, 2012.Cash flow from operating activities in the 2013 was $5.09 billion increasing 27.7% compared with $3.99 billion in 2012. Free cash flow in 2013 was $2.41 billion, which we believe will help the company to distribute regular dividends.NextEra Energy anticipates 2014, earnings to be in the range of $5.05-$5.45 per share.NextEra Energy continues to project compounded annual earnings growth rate of 5% to 7% through 2016 with 2012 as the base period.The company presently has a backlog of nearly 785 Megawatt (MW) of solar projects in U.S., which it intends to complete within 2016.NextEra also has a backlog of 466 MW wind project in Canada, which it aims to brings online with 2015. .

e expect utility service provider  (  ) to surpass our expectations when it reports third quarter 2013 earnings results before the market bell on Oct 24.Our proven model shows that Xcel Energy is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. The  (Expected Surprise Prediction), which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is at +1.32%. This is a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for shares. The company currently retains a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with Zacks Ranks of #1, #2 and #3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. The Sell rated stocks (#4 and #5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Xcel Energy's Zacks Rank #3 and +1.32% ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat this quarter.Xcel Energy delivered straight earnings surprises in the last four quarters with an average beat of 7.20%. We believe the company will maintain its earnings streak on the back of positive rate changes in Colorado, Wisconsin, South Dakota and Texas businesses.In addition, the service initiation of Xcel Energy's Monticello nuclear plant after the outage is anticipated to boost operations. The currently favorable renewable climate in the U.S. will also support the company's unrelenting green energy expansion efforts. Furthermore, Xcel Energy is poised to benefit from the progress of its CapX2020 transmission project.Xcel Energy is not the only firm looking up this earnings season.

 (  ) announced its intention to take over the proposed 150 megawatt (MW) wind park located in the north-central region of North Dakota. The company is currently seeking approval from the state regulators for the Border Winds project.Xcel Energy has not disclosed any estimated costs for this project. The wind program was previously planned by Sequoia Energy in 2005 and a site plan was sanctioned by the regulators in 2011. The project was expected to be concluded by 2012.However, Sequoia Energy failed to start any construction work during the period. Xcel Energy jumped on the opportunity to add the wind asset as the project permit is valid for four years and has the provision of asset transfer to another company.Xcel Energy will team up with RES America Development Inc., a business wing of Renewable Energy Systems Americas Inc. (RES Americas), for the development of the project. RES Americas will supervise the construction phase and will return the ownership to Xcel Energy once it is completed.The wind park located in Roulette County includes 66 turbines spread over 50 square miles of land and shares its border with Manitoba. Construction tasks are expected to commence next year with a projected conclusion slated for 2016.Last month, Xcel Energy joined forces with RES Americas to develop a 200 MW wind facility close to Austin, Minn. It also applied for approval for two other projects to the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission and the North Dakota Public Service Commission.The Border Winds project will increase North Dakota's total wind capacity by 9% to 6,200 MW. The state already has about 20 wind farms in the pipeline for development. Xcel Energy has been generously adding wind assets which will help the company to reach its 30% renewable capacity goal in the long term.The clean and cost saving nature is what drove Xcel Energy to expand its wind portfolio. These steps look well timed especially with the benefits of production tax credits getting an extended term.Furthermore, electricity generation from renewable energy is projected to rise to 16% by 2040, as per Energy Information Administration's prediction. Although coal and natural gas will offer stiff competition owing to their abundance, renewable energy will catch up steadily. Xcel Energy with its renewable focus is likely to gain from this positive dynamics.The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

 's (  ) operating division, Southwestern Public Service Company, in an effort to boost its renewable portfolio is seeking approval from the New Mexico regulators to procure 700 megawatts (MW) of wind capacity via three power-purchase agreements.The agreement with  (  ) entails wind energy purchases from separate facilities in Oklahoma, Texas and New Mexico, which will increase Xcel Energy's wind capacity by 14%. The deal includes buying 199 MW from NextEra Energy's Mammoth Plains Wind Energy Center in Dewey and Blaine counties, Okla., 249 MW from the Palo Duro Wind Energy Center in Hansford and Ochiltree counties, Texas and 250 MW from Infinity Wind Resources/Roosevelt Wind Ranch in Roosevelt County, N.M.These purchases will reduce fuel costs for customers in Texas and New Mexico. Xcel Energy estimates the deal will lead to savings of $590.4 million over 20 years. The additional contracts are expected to double its wind asset base and will bring the total Texas-New Mexico wind capacity in excess of 2,200 MW.The latest initiative comes on the heels of the extension of the wind production tax credits, which prompted Xcel Energy to make such a move. The company stated that the price per megawatt-hour of energy produced by wind generation is lower than that of natural gas.Xcel Energy already has a lofty wind energy capacity of 1,500 MW in its asset basket which is linked to its Texas-New Mexico transmission and distribution network. It procures over 600 MW through contracts from the network, which stretches across the Panhandle and South Plains provinces of Texas, six eastern and southeastern counties in New Mexico and parts of Oklahoma and Kansas.Of late, Xcel Energy has been on a wind power procurement spree as is evident from its May 2013 plans for adding roughly 550 MW of wind capacity in Colorado in the period 2013 to 2016. The latest bid will help the company achieve the renewable generation goal of 30% by 2020.With increasing preference for clean energy and government legislation to increase renewable generation, we believe alternative resources will continue to put pressure on fossil fuel based power generation.

" (  ) announced that it will collaborate with RES America Developments Inc., a business wing of Renewable Energy Systems Americas Inc., (RES Americas) to develop a 200 megawatt (""MW"") wind park near Austin, Minn.The Pleasant Valley Wind initiative is a part of Xcel Energy's proposed 600 MW wind power goal in its Upper Midwest service territory. The project is located close to the company's Grand Meadow wind program.RES Americas will construct and develop the project, which once completed will be handed over to Xcel Energy. The construction work is projected to be completed by late 2015, while developmental undertakings are expected to run through 2014.Following the request for proposals, in Feb 2013, the company applied for regulatory approval for Pleasant Valley besides two other projects to the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission and the North Dakota Public Service Commission.Xcel Energy has been bolstering its renewable asset basket to reap the benefits of the production tax credits. With these initiatives, the company will be able to deliver wind electricity at reasonable rates to its customers. Consumer bills will see an estimated reduction of $180 million.Moreover, the programs will generate power that will adequately serve around 180,000 residential homes. These endeavors will also lead to fuel cost savings for Xcel Energy. In addition, the multiple wind projects are expected to curb carbon emissions by 1.2 million tons annually in the Upper Midwest region.Lately, Xcel Energy has been offering bids in several states like New Mexico, Colorado and Texas to expand its wind portfolio. It recently sought sanction from the New Mexico regulators to procure 700 MW of wind capacity via three power-purchase agreements from  (  ). These wind power bids will help Xcel well to achieve its carbon emissions minimization target of 30% by 2020 from 2005 levels.Another key factor expected to drive the renewable zeal is the Obama Climate plan which called for increasing reliance on renewables and natural gas based energy source in the future. We believe this plan will encourage Xcel Energy to up more renewable projects.Xcel Energy carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

any stocks will reach their ex-dividend date next Tuesday, which is significant for investors as the seller of the stock on that date, not the buyer, receives the most recent dividend.A stock must be bought one day before the ex-dividend date to claim any dividends that have been announced but not yet paid. The company determines on the record date, which usually occurs two days after the ex-dividend date, which shareholders qualify for the dividend. Shareholders listed as holders of record after the record date then receive their dividend on the date of payment established by the company. Those purchasing right before the record date forfeit the dividend and normally get the stock for a reduced amount.It may seem an anachronism in this era of high frequency trading, but the dividend rate rules are in force since it can still take up to three business days for transactions to be credited to and settled in an investor's account.Below are five stocks that schedule June 18 as their ex-dividend date.

Earnings also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 20.9%.Earnings outperformed on the back of higher electric and gas margins owing to a severe winter, lower interest expense and constructive rate cases in Colorado, South Dakota and Wisconsin.GAAP earnings were 48 cents per share compared with 38 cents per share in the year-ago period. The disparity between GAAP and pro forma earnings can be attributed to a net loss of 4 cents from miscellaneous costs.Revenue increased 8% year over year to $2,782.8 million in the reported quarter.

e expect utility service provider  (  ) to surpass our expectation when it reports first quarter 2013 results on May 2.Our proven model shows that Xcel Energy is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. Expected Surprise Prediction or ESP (Read:  ), which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is at +4.65%. This is a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for shares. Note that stocks with Zacks Ranks of #1, #2 and #3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. The Sell rated stocks (#4 and #5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Xcel Energy's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and +4.65% ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat on May 2.Xcel Energy's high-end midstream projects, disciplined cost-control initiatives and competitive power rate offerings are expected to be the key factors triggering a positive earnings surprise.Consistent earnings surprises in the last four quarters resulted in an average beat of 5.79%. Given the positive dynamics we expect the same trend to continue in the first quarter as well.The operational start-up of the Bemidji-Grand Rapids Transmission line under its CapX2020 program will continue to support Xcel Energy's growth. Moreover, the company's aggressive investments in renewable generation especially wind will bode well for Xcel Energy given the favorable climate for renewables in the U.S. currently. With prices below the national average owing to its technological efficiency, the company is well positioned to reap gains from the market.Xcel Energy is not the only firm looking up this earnings season.

However, the quarterly result surged 6.9% from the year-ago profit of $1.01.The year-over-year improvement largely reflects changes in the rate plans of the company's utility subsidiaries. Again, the effects of normal winter weather as against the milder winter in the year-earlier quarter also contributed to earnings growth.On a reported basis, the company registered earnings of 66 cents per share compared with 95 cents in the year-ago quarter.Consolidated Edison reported quarterly operating revenue of $3,184.0 million, an increase of 3.4% from the year-ago quarter. However, the top line failed to match our expectation of $3,197.0 million by 0.4%.Of the total quarterly revenue, Electric revenues rose 5.2% to $1,958.0 million, Gas revenues climbed 15.0% to $742.0 million and Steam revenues jumped 26.2% to $332.0 million, while Non-utility revenues nosedived almost 51% to $152.0 million during the reported quarter.Con Edison's utility subsidiaries, Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc.

lectricity and natural gas company  (  ) decided to redeem all of its 7.60% Junior Subordinated Notes, due 2068, on May 31, 2013. The company has submitted a notice to the trustee to that effect and presently $400 million is outstanding from that series.Xcel Energy intends to finance the redemption through short-term borrowings from the market and also utilize a portion of its cash balance. The redemption price will be 100% of the face value plus interest accrued up to the redemption date.The financial strategy of Xcel Energy includes issuance of debt and equity securities to refinance retiring maturities, reduce short-term debt, fund construction programs, fund asset acquisitions and for other general corporate purposes. In 2013, the company intends to issue $1 billion in first mortgage bonds to fulfill the aforesaid objectives.Xcel Energy's debt-to-capital ratio at the end of 2012 was 56% versus 55% at the end of 2011. Xcel Energy issued bonds of different series during 2012 totaling $1.8 billion, which increased the debt-to-capital ratio.Besides issuing new notes to generate funds, the company and its subsidiaries also enter into credit agreements with banks to meet their financial requirements. These credit facilities have financial covenant requiring that the debt-to-total capitalization ratio of each entity be less than or equal to 65%. The time to time redemption of outstanding notes enables the company to fulfill this financial covenant.We believe the redemption of these notes and decision to issue shares in Mar 2013 will definitely aid the company to improve its debt-to-capital ratio.Xcel Energy carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

n Apr. 3, 2013, the shares of power transmission, distribution and generation operator  (  ) climbed to a new 52-week high of $30.07 driven by a string of successful midstream initiatives. Xcel Energy continued with its good run by reporting consistent earnings surprise in the past four quarters bringing the average surprise to 5.79%.Competitive power rate offerings, favorable outcomes from NSP Minnesota and NSP Wisconsin regulatory cases as well as tighter cost-containment efforts proved to be the key factors propelling the company's stock to a new high.In the meantime, the company's increasing focus towards creating a balanced generation assets met with success as it accomplished a generating capacity of 1,713 megawatt of wind energy in Colorado.With the current pulse in the U.S. market that favors clean energy, we believe Xcel Energy's target of 30% power generation from renewables by 2020 will sit well with the company's future growth objectives.Upon receiving regulatory consent, Xcel Energy's premier CapX2020 transmission project is expected to be the major highlight in 2013. Moreover, its infrastructure upgrade program will result in greater service reliability and help retain its customer base.Furthermore, a sound liquidity position will allow the company to fulfill its future financial commitments while stable credit ratings would further help Xcel Energy to raise debt and reduce borrowing cost.Presently, Xcel Energy carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

 (  ) announced a change in its plan for the proposed hike in electric rates originally filed in Nov 2012 with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. The fresh rate hike request reduces the extent of the hike asked for in the earlier application.As per the proposal, electric rate will now rise to around $220.0 million from the prior $285.0 million, which roughly translates into an overall rate hike of 8.2% from the 10.7% requested earlier. If approved, an Xcel Energy customer will witness a 10% increase in electricity bill compared to the earlier 12%. The company expects the rate of return on equity to remain the same at 10.6%.The rate decline move was a part of Xcel Energy's strategy to maintain a balanced growth objective by cushioning its customers from excessive cost pressure while simultaneously recovering investment costs.The company believes this even approach will help achieve a constructive regulatory outcome. If approved, the new competitive rates will come into effect from the first quarter of 2014. We note that from Jan 1, 2013, the interim rate increase has come into effect.The key alterations made in the new fillings include reduction of $35.0 million for the Sherburne County (Sherco) Generating Station Unit 3 and deferment of 2012 and 2013 costs. This will equalize the cost of the unit with its return to service by the end of the year. At present, the Sherburne facility is undergoing extensive repair works from the aftermath of an accident in late 2011.In addition, the company proposed another $8.0 million reduction for the expansion of power production in the Monticello Plant. This also includes the 2013 costs which have been deferred for later recovery, subject to the review of the commission. Lastly, a $9.0 million for leveling the impacts of the 2008 recession on pension expenses was proposed by the company.On the flip side, besides the Minnesota rate case the company has in store other rate fillings under review in North Dakota, South Dakota and New Mexico. This might be an overhang on Xcel Energy's operations. Presently, the company has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Other energy stocks that we presently prefer are Zacks Ranked #1(Strong Buy)  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ).Based in Minneapolis, Minn., Xcel Energy through its subsidiaries engages in the generation, purchase, transmission, distribution, and sale of electricity in the United States.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Xcel Energy Modifies Rate Request - Analyst Blog@2013-03-28@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/xcel-energy-modifies-rate-request-analyst-blog-2013-03-28
" (  ) announced positive results for its Request for Proposals (""RPF"") for expanding renewable generation assets in the state of Colorado. In response to the successful bid results, the company sought a proposal to supplement wind generation by 500 megawatts (MW) or by 25% in the period 2013 to 2016, subject to the approval of the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (""CPUC"").Although Xcel Energy fulfilled the necessary renewable standards required in the state, it believes the addition of greater wind assets will prove to be economically beneficial for its customers. Also, this will bring the total resource portfolio to 2,700 MW in Colorado.The major driving force behind the proposed wind asset additions is the extension of the Production Tax Credits (PTC) by the government. The company is laying much emphasis on its renewable endeavors. In Mar 2013, Xcel Energy issued an RPF for its 2013 All-Resource Solicitation to promote fossil fuel as well as renewable generation and is aggressively pursuing the CPUC for swift evaluation of the new wind proposals.On receiving the green signal, the company would start negotiations on Power Purchase Agreements in Jun 2013 and expects a final regulatory approval to come from CPUC sometime in October. This will give Xcel Energy ample time to advance its projects and reap the advantages of PTC.However, the review processes are arduous and the developers might face a time constraint. The extra 550 MW is projected to curb carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 1.4 million tons each year. Already achieving a 16% reduction, the current programs will place Xcel Energy on track to attain the 35% CO2 reduction mark by 2020 from the 2005 level.Besides Colorado, the company has issued RPF's in the Upper Midwest, New Mexico and Texas territories. We believe Xcel Energy will stand to gain from these multiple ventures given the currently favorable renewable market. In addition, it will allow the company to offer clean power at reasonable prices which will attract customer attention.Xcel recently attained record production capacity of 1 billion kilowatt-hours of wind energy. The company has $30 million in its Renewable Development Fund to further invest in renewable projects. This will certainly help Xcel to increase its green power generation.Nonetheless, abundance of coal and relatively cheaper natural gas will continue to provide stiff competition to renewables. Currently, Xcel Energy carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Utilities like  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ) are presently well placed with each holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Minneapolis-based Xcel Energy is a U.S. electricity and natural gas company, with operations in eight Western and Midwestern states.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Xcel Plans to Add Wind Assets - Analyst Blog@2013-06-03@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/xcel-plans-to-add-wind-assets-analyst-blog-2013-06-03

The yearly results surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 cents.The improvement in earnings in 2012 was driven by favorable rate outcomes, returns from continuous investments in its utility business and a lower effective tax rate.Xcel Energy's GAAP earnings for 2012 were $1.85 per share, up 7.6% from $1.72 per share recorded in 2011. The difference between ongoing and GAAP earnings in 2012 was due to a one-time prescription drug tax benefit of 3 cents.Xcel Energy's total revenue for fourth-quarter 2012 was $2.55 billion, down 0.7% from $2.57 billion reported in the year-ago period. The year-over-year decline in revenue was due to lower contribution from its Natural Gas segment.Reported quarter revenue fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 12.8%.Xcel Energy's total revenue for 2012 was $10.12 billion, down 4.9% from $10.65 billion reported in 2011. All the three operating segments of the company registered year-over-year revenue decline resulting in the overall shortfall.2012 revenue came short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.61 billion. Total revenue from this segment during the fourth quarter 2012 increased 1.1% to $2,010.9 million from $1,988.8 million in the year-ago period.The revenue from this segment during 2012 was down 2.8% to $8,517.3 million from $8,766.6 million in 2011.Electric revenues were largely impacted by the fluctuation in the price of natural gas, coal and uranium used in the generation of electricity. However, the fuel recovery mechanism, which allows the company to recover current expenses, came in handy. Otherwise revenues and margins would have been further affected by volatile input costs.Electric margin during the quarter and 2012 were up 4% and 2.5% from the comparable prior-year period, respectively Revenue at this segment during the quarter was down by 7.1% to $520.5 million from $560.1 million in the year-ago period.2012 revenue at this segment decreased 15.2% to $1,537.4 million from $1,811.9 million in 2011.

The decrease in total operating expenses was mainly due to a 12.6% decline in input costs for the generation of electricity.The decline in operating expenses benefited operating margins, which expanded 127 basis points year over year to 18% in 2012.Total interest charges and financing cost at the end of 2012 increased 0.6% to $566.3 million from $562.9 million at the end of 2011. The increase in expense was mainly due to higher long-term debt levels to fund investment in utility operations, partially mitigated by lower interest rates.Long-term debts as of Dec 31, 2012 were $10.1 billion versus $9.3 billion as of Dec 31, 2011.The company provided capital expenditure plans from 2013 through 2017. Capital spending for 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017 are $3.15 billion, $2.77 billion, $2.31 billion, and $2.5 billion respectively.

(  ) reported earnings of $1.03 per share in the fourth quarter, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 96 cents for the quarter.Xcel Energy reaffirmed its earnings guidance for 2013 in the range of $1.85-$1.95 per share. The guidance assumes normal weather pattern in 2013. The company guides weather-adjusted retail electric utility sales to increase 0.5% in 2013, while weather-adjusted retail firm natural gas sales is expected to fall by 1% from 2012 levels.Operating and maintenance expenses are expected to increase by 4% to 5% over 2012 levels, while depreciation expense is projected to increase in a range of $75 million to $85 million over the prior year.Interest expenses in 2013 are forecast to decrease by $30 million to $35 million from 2012.Notwithstanding the mixed results in 2012, we believe the long-term investments undertaken by the company will not only boost its generation capabilities but will also enhance the reliability of the service rendered.In hindsight, the favorable conclusion of a few rate cases during the year boosted the top line. The company still has a few pending rate cases.

 (  ) will release its fourth quarter 2012 financial results before the market bell on Jan 31, 2013. In the prior quarter, this electric utility reported an earnings surprise of 8.33%. Xcel Energy currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Let's see how things are shaping up at Xcel Energy prior to this announcement.The company will continue to benefit from its ongoing cost saving measures thereby boosting margins. As per a report from the U.S. Energy Information Admistration, near normal winter weather in the U.S. is likely to provide some benefit to the utlities in the fourth quarter.Xcel Energy produces nearly 80% of its electricity through coal and natural gas plants. The ongoing systematic capital investment will boost generation capabilities and enhance the reliability of its service.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Xcel Energy is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive earnings Expected Surprise Prediction (ESP) (Read:  ) and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. This is not the case here. The Most Accurate estimate stands at 28 cents and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is also in line at 28 cents, resulting in 0.00% ESP. Xcel's Zacks Rank #3 enhances the chances of a surprise; however the 0.00% ESP complicates the forecasting power making surprise prediction difficult.We note that Xcel registered an earnings surprise in last three quarters. Even so we caution investors against the stock going into the earnings announcement, as a Zacks earnings ESP of 0.00% lowers the possibility of an earnings surprise.Other companies you may want to consider on the basis of our model which shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter are as follows: (  ) has earnings ESP of +2.38% and carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). (  ) has earnings ESP of +22.12% and carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

" 's (  ) subsidiary, Interstate Power and Light Company (""IPL""), has received approval from The Iowa Utilities Board (""IUB"") for its natural gas base rate case that was filed in May 2012.With this approval, Iowa natural gas rate base is set at $254 million. IUB has sanctioned an increase in IPL's annual natural gas service revenue requirement of approximately $10.5 million and a 10% return on common equity. Also, IUB has approved IPL's Cost Management Plan. This plan will use tax benefits to credit customer bills and mitigate any impact on base rates for a period of three years. New rates are expected to be effective from the first quarter of 2013.Generally, cost of gas is passed on to customers on a dollar to dollar basis. On an average, cost of gas makes up 60% to 70% of the average residential natural gas bill. However, it has remained unaffected under this rate case proposal. Currently, due to lower gas costs, the average current residential bill is approximately 20.0%, down since the IPL's last rate case in 2005.Currently, the company is focusing on heavily expanding and developing its utility assets in the Iowa region. Recently, the company had filed two applications with the Iowa Utilities' Board for regulatory approval for the planned building of the 650 megawatt Marshalltown Generating Station (""MGS""). It expects a decision in the fourth quarter of 2013. The natural gas-fired Marshalltown unit is a $650-$750 million investment, which is expected to be a major revenue churner for Alliant Energy. Prior to this, the company had announced the completion of its Power Iowa project in Hardin County.The company expects this rate case to recover more than $70 million spent for infrastructure investments in natural gas distribution systems since the last case.The company seems to be focusing on the well-being of its customers and shareholders. Recently, its third-quarter  increased its annual dividend to $1.88 from the current target of $1.80.Based on stable economy, ability of IPL and WPL to earn their authorized rates of return, income tax benefits at IPL from tax initiatives, continuing cost controls and operational efficiencies and execution of capital expenditure plans, the company presently retains a short-term Zacks #2 Rank (Buy) like its peers  (  ) and  (  ).Headquartered in Madison, Wisconsin, Alliant Energy Corporation is engaged in providing regulated electricity and natural gas services to residential, commercial, and industrial customers in the Midwest region of the United States. The company, through its subsidiary, IPL engages in the generation and distribution of electricity, and distribution and transportation of natural gas in Iowa and southern Minnesota; and generation and distribution of steam in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.

lorida-based large-scale utility company NextEra Energy Resources LLC, a business wing of  (  ), brought online its Limon I and II wind energy programs in Denver, Colorado. NextEra joined forces with Colorado major,  (  ) in a long-term agreement to sell all the power from the twin projects.The facility owned and run by NextEra Energy has a total generating capacity of 400 megawatt (MW) which constitutes dual 200-MW projects covering an area of 55,000 acres in the Arapahoe, Elbert and Lincoln counties. A single facility comprises of wind turbines of 125 GE 1.6-MW capacities. Apart from this, the company constructed a 345 Kilovolt transmission line to connect the wind farms to the Missile Site substation in Arapahoe.The Limon facilities are NextEra Energy's fourth and fifth wind projects and are part of the company's mammoth 1,500 MW U.S. wind program. The aggregate installed capacity generation from these projects stands at 975 MW which is expected to power around 450,000 homes in Colorado on an average. The completion of the 1,500 MW program will bring NextEra's overall wind portfolio to approximately 10,000 MW by year-end 2012.NextEra engaged more than 300 workers during the peak construction period and estimates generation of roughly $130 million in state, local tax payments and royalties from this program within the first 25 years. The Limon endeavors will provide low-cost and clean energy services in the Colorado communities. Along with this, the programs are expected to contribute positively to the indigenous economy by creating job opportunities.We believe this long run arrangement will bode well with NextEra Energy's future business development goals. The company's consistent growth-via-investment strategy in renewables will spur near term top-line as usage of green energy is expected to increase in the U.S. market in the coming years.However, strong weather variations and uncertainty associated with cases related to airline tariff and proposed implementation of market rates on petroleum products could partially offset growth.NextEra Energy maintained its earnings expectation for 2012, in the range of $4.35−$4.65 per share. Similarly, the company upheld its pro forma earnings expectation for 2014 in the band $5.05−$5.65 per share.The Zacks Consensus Estimates for the fourth quarter and full year 2012 currently stand at 94 cents per share and $4.52 per share, respectively.

e reiterate our Neutral recommendation on  (  ). The Minneapolis-based electricity and natural gas company at present carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).We believe the company's successful cost-containment efforts and favorable outcomes of the NSP Minnesota and NSP Wisconsin rate cases will act as tailwinds in the upcoming quarters.Xcel Energy is expected to derive substantial benefits from its ambitious CapX2020 transmission program in Minnesota, which received regulatory approval. The Bemidji-Grand Rapids Transmission line, a part of CapX2020 was completed and the 230-Kv (Kilovolt) line has already come into service.The company is also striving to develop its renewable business. As of now it has added 1,713 megawatt of wind energy in Colorado. This will certainly complement Xcel Energy's future growth. The onset of production tax credits is expected to act as a major catalyst to the company's eco-friendly endeavors.Moreover, a sound financial position and maintenance of a favorable credit rating are other positives that could work in favor of Xcel Energy.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter 2013 is set at 41 cents per share, up an estimated 6.73% from year-ago earnings of 38 cents per share.While we believe Xcel Energy will perform satisfactorily in the coming quarters, other utility companies worth a look are  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ).

" (  ) or PSEG reported third quarter 2012 results before the opening bell today. During the quarter, operating earnings per share were 75 cents, above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 72 cents. However, it was lower than the previous year figure of 83 cents per share.In the reported quarter, GAAP earnings per share were 68 cents, up from 52 cents per share in the year-ago period.The variance of 7 cents between GAAP and operating earnings was due to a gain of 8 cents on nuclear decommissioning trust (""NDT"") Fund Related Activity and mark-to-market loss of 15 cents at PSEG Power.Revenue in the reported quarter was $2.40 billion, down from the year-ago figure of $2.62 billion. The top line was also lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $218 million.Residential electric sales were 4,640 million kilowatt-hour (Kwh) while Commercial & Industrial sales were 7,833 million Kwh in the reported quarter. Total sales were 12,549 million Kwh.Total operating expenses in the quarter under review were $1.81 billion, down 12.4% year over year. Lower revenues were offset by lower operating expenses, resulting in an operating income of $594 million, up 6.8% year over year. Segment operating earnings were $217 million in the quarter, down from $258 million in the prior-year period. The downside reflects lower prices for energy, partially offset by an increase in capacity prices.Production from Power's combined cycle natural gas fleet was up 17% year over year with a capacity factor of 67% versus 57% in the year-ago quarter. Production from the nuclear fleet increased 2% year over year with average capacity factor of 92% compared with an average capacity factor of 90.6% in the year-ago quarter. The segment generated operating earnings of $155 million, marginally up 0.65% year over year. The increase reflects a rise in transmission revenue, partially offset by unfavorable weather, increase in operating and maintenance expenses and depreciation expense. Segment operating earnings were $10 million, up from the prior-year figure of $8 million. The results reflect the continued benefits of a reduction in financing costs, partially offset by a decline in income on the lease portfolio from the divestment of leases in late 2011.Based on the current quarter's performance, the company expects earnings per share in the range of $2.25 to $2.50 for full-year 2012. The company expects double-digit compound annual growth in its regulated operations due to the Susquehanna - Roseland transmission line through 2014. Moreover, it expects the line to provide benefits in the long-term to New Jersey's economy.The company indicated that it is currently unable to estimate its losses from Hurricane Sandy, however, they would be material.Recently, one of the company's peers,  (  ) posted operating earnings of 78 cents per share for the third quarter of 2012, up 9 cents from the year-ago quarter and 6 cents from the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Xcel Energy reported total revenue of $2.72 billion in the reported quarter, down 3.9% from $2.83 billion in the year-ago period. The year-over-year decline was due to lower contributions from the Natural Gas and Electric segments. Reported quarter revenue was also lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.01 billion.During the quarter, the company's earnings could beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate, but the revenue fell short of our expectations. Going forward, Public Service's robust portfolio of regulated and non-regulated utility assets provides a steady earnings base and significant growth prospects over the long run.The company has been striving to optimize generation margins by improving cost-structure and through improvements in performance and reliability of its nuclear and fossil units. Management has taken several measures to improve financial stability and reduce the overall risk profile of the company. The company has been pursuing growth opportunities in the core U.S. market and is increasing capital allocation for projects that provide good risk-adjusted returns. Going forward, the low-cost nuclear fleet, assumed rate relief and added generating capacities will drive Public Service's earnings growth.However, we are concerned about the present unfavorable macro backdrop, the rising cost of coal, higher pension & financial costs, power-price volatility and the negative impacts from Sandy Hurricane.

" (  ), a diversified holding company, engaged in generation and distribution of electricity in the Wisconsin state as well as in the upper peninsula of Michigan, is slated to release its third-quarter 2012 earnings result before the market bell on October 31, 2012.Wisconsin Energy posted mixed results in its second quarter 2012 with pro forma income of 51 cents per share edging out the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 44 cents per share and year-ago earnings of 41 cents. Bottom-line growth was primarily driven by warm summer temperatures, lower operation and maintenance costs, as well as the company's effective share repurchase program.Although the company reaped substantial benefits from its ambitious ""Power the Future"" project, its top-line slid 4.7% to $944.7 million from $991.7 million in the year-ago quarter. Moreover, revenue fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $44.3 million. Lower-than-expected sales from the large commercial and industrial segment were responsible for the revenue shortfall.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter 2012 is 57 cents per share, up 3.6% from 55 cents reported in the comparable quarter, last year. At present, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings ranges from 56 cents to 58 cents per share.For full year 2012, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is $2.32 per share, 6.4% higher than its prior year-end earnings of $2.18 per share. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate is in the band $2.25-$2.38 per share.We see a few estimate revisions at this point. Out of a total of 8 estimates, 1 lone estimate moved north while none was revised downwards in the past 30 days for the third quarter. For the quarter, no movement was observed in the past week.A similar trend was visible for 2012 over the last month, with 1 out of the 14 estimates jumping up. The last 7 days witnessed no revision to the estimates.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter remained static in the last 7 and 30 days. For full year 2012 the consensus estimate inched up by a penny to $3.52 from $3.51 for the past month while it was unchanged in the past week.With respect to earnings surprises, Wisconsin Energy has registered favorable earnings in the all of the past four quarters. The earnings surprise in the last four quarter ranges from 1.4% to 16%. The average surprise over the last four quarter remained a positive 8.5%.Wisconsin Energy's growth accentuating projects like the biomass plant in Northern Wisconsin and its air quality control improvement initiative at the original Oak Creek will broaden its renewable energy portfolio. Also, the company's recent decision to convert the 280 megawatt (MW), coal-fired Valley Power Plant generation unit to natural gas would sit well with its growth initiatives. Moreover, a healthy dividend outlook and strong repurchase program will arrest investors' confidence.However, compliance with regulatory standards could lead to cost escalation and continued outages as well as weather variations are risks the company needs to watch out for.Wisconsin Energy operates in a highly competitive energy market and faces intense opposition from companies like  (  ) and  (  ).Currently, we are maintaining a long-term Neutral recommendation on Wisconsin Energy Inc.

lectricity and natural gas company  's (  ) operating earnings for the third quarter 2012 of 78 cents per share were up 9 cents from the year-ago quarter and 6 cents higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Earnings during the said quarter benefited from higher electric and gas margins due to different rate hikes becoming effective from 2012. The results were partially offset by higher property taxes and interest expenses.Xcel Energy's GAAP earnings for the reported quarter were 81 cents per share versus 69 cents per share recorded in the year-ago quarter. The three cent difference between operating and GAAP earnings in the reported quarter was due to a three cent gain from a tax benefit associated with federal subsidies for prescription drug plans.Xcel Energy clocked total revenue of $2.72 billion in the reported quarter, down 3.9% from $2.83 billion in the year-ago period. The year-over-year decline was due to lower contributions from the Natural Gas and Electric segments.Reported quarter revenue was also lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.01 billion. : Revenue from this segment declined 3.3% year over year to $2.53 billion from $2.62 billion in the year-ago period.Sales at this segment were largely impacted by the fluctuation in the price of natural gas, coal and uranium used in the generation of electricity. However, the fuel recovery mechanism, which allows the company to recover current expenses, came in handy; or else revenues and margins would have been widely affected by volatile input costs. : Revenue at this segment decreased 10.5% to $174.5 million from $194.9 million in the year-ago period. : Segment revenue in the reported quarter was $17.1 million versus $17.2 million in the year-ago period, reflecting a nominal decline of 0.6%.Total operating expenses declined 8% to $2 billion from $2.18 billion in the year-ago quarter. Higher expenses were mainly due to a 12.5% decline in electric power and purchased power expenses. The cost of natural gas sold and transported also dipped from the year-earlier period.Operating expenses, as a percentage of total revenue, decreased 343 basis points year over year, which positively impacted the operating results of the company. Operating income accordingly increased 10.6% year over year to $720.4 million from $651.5 million reported in the year-ago period.Total interest charges at the end of the third quarter 2012 rose 3.9% to $153.7 million from $148.01 million at the end of the third quarter 2011. Expenses rose on account of higher long-term debt levels to fund investment in utility operations, partially mitigated by lower interest rates.Long-term debts of the company as of September 30, 2012 were $10.1 billion while the debt-to-capital ratio at the end of the quarter was 56%.Excel Energy from time to time issues debt and equity to refinance debts, fund operations and for other general corporate purposes. During the third quarter of 2012 the company issued four series of bonds aggregating $1.6 billion, which were utilized for varied purposes.In October, the company issued $100 million of 30-year first mortgage bonds with a coupon of 3.70% to meet its financial obligations.Xcel Energy reaffirmed its earnings guidance for 2012 in the range of $1.75-$1.85 per share. The guidance assumes normal weather pattern for the remainder of 2012. The company guides weather-adjusted retail electric utility sales to likely remain flat in 2012, while weather-adjusted retail firm natural gas sales are expected to decline 1% from 2011 levels.The company expects GAAP earnings per share for 2012 in the upper range of $1.75 to $1.85.In 2012, operating and maintenance expenses of the company are estimated to increase 2% year over year. Depreciation expense is projected to increase in a range of $40 million to $45 million from 2011 levels.Interest expenses are forecast to go up in the range of $0 to $15 million, while the effective tax rate of the company is expected to be in the range of 34% to 35% in 2012.The company expects its 2013 ongoing earnings per share to be between $1.85 and $1.95. . (  ), competing with Xcel Energy, reported earnings of $1.02 per share in the third quarter 2012, below the year-ago figure of $1.07, but at par with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.The company reported net revenue of $4.15 billion in the third quarter, below the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the year-ago revenue of $4.33 billion.The company surpassed our expectation for three straight quarters in 2012. The earnings beat to some extent was aided by favorable electricity and gas rates. The cost control measures and warm weather conditions in its service territories also boosted the results.We believe the company will match its performance of the first nine months in the last three months of 2012 and will meet its earnings guidance per share for the year.Xcel Energy currently retains a short term Zacks # 3 Rank (Hold rating).Based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Xcel Energy is a U.S. electricity and natural gas company, with operations in eight Western and Midwestern states.

 (  ), an energy holding providing natural gas, electricity and other products and services, is slated to release its third-quarter 2012 earnings result before the market opens on October 25, 2012.Xcel Energy reported mixed overall performance in the second quarter of 2012 posting a net adjusted income of 38 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 35 cents per share and year-ago earnings by 2 cents. Higher electric margin, resulting from various rate hikes and warmer-than-normal weather across all its service territories were responsible for the bottom-line growth.Quarterly revenue suffered a setback as sales from the gas distribution business plunged by 24.1% along with a 4.3% drop in electric segment sales. Total revenue fell substantially by 6.7% to $2.28 billion from $2.44 billion in the year-ago quarter. Moreover, revenue was way below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.47 billion.Xcel Energy estimates earnings per share for 2012 to be on the lower end of the guidance range of $1.75-$1.85 per share. Operating and maintenance expenses of the company are expected to climb by 1% year over year, while depreciation expense is expected to increase in the range of $40 million to $50 million from 2011 levels.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter 2012 is 71 cents per share, up 3.08% from 69 cents reported in the comparable quarter, last year. At present, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings ranges from 68 cents to 75 cents per share.For 2012, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is $1.78 per share, slightly higher than its previous year-end earnings of $1.72 per share. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate ranges between $1.75 and $1.80 per share.For third quarter 2012, none of the 8 analysts providing estimates have revised their estimates over the last 30 days. A similar trend is witnessed from the 15 covering analysts for 2012 number over the last month.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter remained unchanged at 71 cents in the last 7 as well as 30 days. For 2012, the consensus estimate has also remained static at $1.78 for the past week and month.With respect to earnings surprises, Xcel Energy Inc. has reported favorable bottom-line performance in the previous two quarters of 2012 as well as in the third quarter of 2011, surpassing the corresponding Zacks Consensus Estimates. The fourth quarter 2011 earnings miss was however an exception. The earnings surprise in the last four quarter ranges from (3.3%) to 8.6%. The average surprise over the last four quarter remained a positive 3.5%.Xcel Energy has been a prominent player in the US energy market and is a pure play, fully regulated, vertically integrated electric and gas utilities with the potential to grow EPS 5%-7% over the long term. The company continues to be environmentally proactive, with its large-scale wind energy projects, its biomass plant in the Midwest and significant investments in pipeline and transmission businesses.Nonetheless, regulatory obstacles, inconsistent weather patterns and commodity price volatilities are certain generic limitations the company needs to watch out for. In addition, increased property tax of $24 million is expected to drag down the company's bottom-line by roughly $0.03 per share in 2012.Xcel Energy operates in an competitive energy market and faces stiff opposition from companies like  (  ) and  (  ).Currently, we are maintaining a long-term 'Neutral' recommendation on Xcel Energy Inc.

" 's (  ) Queen Creek Solar Farm project has started its commercial operations. The solar plant with a power generation capacity of 25.2 megawatt DC or 19 megawatt AC has been owned by PSEG Solar Source, a subsidiary of Public Service Enterprise Group.The solar power plant is located approximately 30 miles southeast of Phoenix spread on 148 acres of land. It has 90,000 crystalline panels operating on a single axis tracking system.In January 2012, PSEG Solar Source had completed the acquisition of the project developed by juwi solar Inc. (""JSI""). juwi solar has also served as the EPC contractor and will continue to provide operation and maintenance services to the project. Under a 20-year agreement, all the electricity generated from the project will be sold to Salt River Project (SRP). Moreover, it has begun taking power from the plant.The project will generate energy that will serve about 3,300 homes. Moreover, being eco friendly, the power generated from the project will be able to offset approximately 21,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions each year, which is equal to taking approximately 4,100 cars off the road.Public Service Enterprise continues to invest in projects that provide clean, emissions-free solar energy in order to meet solar and renewable targets and also have supportive local and state policies.Four other projects in collaboration with JSI that fall in line with the company's goals include: a 12.0 MW DC Wyandot Solar Farm in Wyandot, Ohio, a 15.0 MW DC Jacksonville Solar Farm spread over an area of 100 acres in Jacksonville, Florida and a 2.2 MW DC Mars Solar Garden facility located adjacent to the Mars Snackfood's US headquarters in New Jersey and the recently acquired 15 MW DC PSEG Milford Solar Farm in Milford, Delaware, which is under construction.Public Service Enterprise Group has a solid portfolio of regulated and non-regulated utility assets that offer a stable earnings base and substantial long-term growth potential. The company strives to optimize generation margins by improving its cost-structure and through improvements in performance and reliability of its nuclear and fossil units. Management has taken several measures to improve financial stability and reduce the overall risk profile of Public Service. This includes opportunistically monetizing assets that no longer are a strategic fit, reducing international exposure, significantly hedging future generation business and paying down debt.Public Service has been pursuing growth opportunities in the core U.S. market and increasing capital allocation in projects that provide good risk-adjusted returns.

e reiterate our Neutral recommendation on  (  ). The Minnesota-based utility posted mixed financial results in the third quarter 2012 with earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate while the revenue lagging it.We believe the company's $13.2 billion capex outlook for the timeframe 2013 to 2017 will help in executing its infrastructure upgrade program and also boost its pipeline and electric business. Xcel Energy's CapX2020 program is advancing well and is expected to contribute to near-term profitability.However, expenses related to the incremental property tax will continue to impact the company's bottom-line results in the upcoming quarters.

iverse power generator  (  ) is slated to release its second-quarter 2012 earnings results before market open on August 8, 2012.NRG Energy, Inc. reported a loss of 92 cents per share in first quarter 2012 compared with a loss of $1.06 in the prior-year quarter. This was due to mild weather, switching from coal to gas and outage at the STP unit 2. The quarterly loss was wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 11 cents per share.NRG Energy's total operating revenue of $1.86 billion in first quarter 2012 decreased 6.67% from $2 billion in the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year decline was due to lower commodity prices and mild weather. The quarterly revenue fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.46 billion.The operating expenses of the company increased 20.88% year over year to $2.03 billion due to higher cost of operations, and selling, general and administrative expenses; partially offset by a decline in development expenses.NRG Energy maintained its 2012 adjusted EBITDA expectation in the range of $1,825 million to $2,000 million, including wholesale and retail contribution in the range of $1,200-$1,300 million and $625-$700 million, respectively.The 2012 guidance for free cash flow was also reaffirmed in the range of $800 million to $1,000 million.The guidance takes into account normalized summer weather condition in the company's service territories.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter 2012 is 16 cents per share, an estimated decline of 65% from 46 cents reported in the year-ago quarter. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate ranges between a loss of 32 cents per share and earnings of 47 cents per share.The full year 2012 Zacks Consensus Estimate is 94 cents, up a projected 28.6% from 73 cents reported in the prior year. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate ranges between 52 cents per share and $1.20 per share.The past 30 days have seen two of the five estimates declining for the second quarter, while two moved in the opposite direction. There were no changes in the quarterly estimates in the last 7 days.For full year 2012, of the 8 available estimates, four estimates moved up while two estimates went down, in the last 30 days. There were no changes in the estimates in the prior 7 days.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter inched down by 5 cents in the last 30 days. However, for full-year 2012, the consensus estimate increased by 7 cents in the past 30 days. For the past 7 days, the consensus earnings estimates remained static both for the second quarter and full year 2012.With respect to earnings surprise, the company surpassed our expectation in three of the last four quarters, but widely missed the consensus in the last reported quarter.The earnings surprise in the last four quarters ranged from (736.4%) to 22.9%. The average surprise over the last four quarters is a negative 167.8%.NRG Energy has a diverse portfolio of electric generation facilities in terms of geography, fuel type and dispatch levels, which helps mitigate risks associated with fuel price volatility and market demand cycles. Besides, the company is working on its long-term strategy of divesting its non-core assets in order to focus on its retail electric business in core domestic markets.The company has been investing to develop its green generation portfolio and working to increase savings for its customers while maintaining a steady supply of power. The Board of Directors of the company announced its first ever quarterly dividend of 9 cents per share. We appreciate these initiatives taken by the company to boost its overall performance.NRG Energy follows a practise of selling forward a substantial portion of its baseload power. Any failure to meet its supply obligations under these long-term contracts may result in huge payments to the contracted party, increasing the company's financial burden. Like other regulated utility operators, this company too suffers from fluctuating weather conditions in its service territories.We have maintained our Neutral recommendation on the company.

"e reiterate our Neutral Recommendation on Minnesota-based  . (  ). The company posted mixed financial results in the second quarter 2012, with a bottom-line exceeding and top-line missing the corresponding Zacks Consensus Estimates.With a likely recovery in natural gas prices in the following quarters, Xcel Energy's recent natural gas related Brush asset acquisition will help propel near-term top-line growth.However, the company's requests for deferred accounting for incremental property taxes as well as for property tax rider were overruled by the Minnesota Commission. This will lead to expenses amounting to $24 million of incremental property taxes, thereby dragging down Xcel Energy's bottom-line by roughly 3 cents per share in 2012.This impact could be tempered by the favorable outcomes in the electric rate case in Colorado and South Dakota which will generate substantial revenue upside for the company in the near term.Going forward, the company's robust string of regulated investment opportunities will aid Xcel Energy to post solid results in the upcoming quarters. The company plans to make investments of $13.4 billion over a period of five years from 2012 through 2016. In addition, the company's agreement with  (  ) to expand wind resource generation by 400 megawatt (MW) would enhance future growth prospects.Nonetheless, increasing compliance costs from regulatory bodies and revenue volatility rising out of seasonal variations are periodic challenges that could limit growth opportunities for the company. Besides, with the implementation of stringent pro-environment laws, Xcel planned to idle some of its coal-fired plants like Arapahoe unit 4, which will impact the revenue performance in the long term.Xcel Energy expects earnings per share for 2012 to be on the lower end of the guidance range of $1.75-$1.85 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimates for the third quarter and full year 2012 for the company presently stand at 71 cents per share and $1.78 per share, respectively.Ohio-based  (  ), an Xcel Energy peer, faced with regulatory restriction by Environmental Protection Agency (""EPA""), depressing coal market outlook and moderate financial outcomes in the second quarter 2012, also closed down some of its coal-fired power stations.Xcel Energy is a U.S. electricity and natural gas company, with operations in eight Western and Midwestern states.

lectricity and natural gas company  's (  ) operating earnings for the second quarter 2012 of 41 cents per share were higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 35 cents and the year-ago results of 36 cents.The company's year-over-year growth in earnings was attributed to higher electric margin, resulting from various rate increases and warmer-than-normal weather across all its service territories.Xcel Energy's GAAP earnings for the reported quarter were 38 cents per share versus 33 cents per share recorded in the year-ago quarter. The difference between GAAP and pro forma earnings of 3 cents was due to certain one-time items.Xcel Energy's total revenue for second-quarter 2012 was $2.27 billion versus $2.43 billion reported in the year-ago period, reflecting a decline of 6.7%. The year-over-year decline in revenue was due to lower contribution from all its reporting segments.Reported quarter revenue was also lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.47 billion. : Revenue from this segment during the second quarter 2012 decreased by 4.3% to $2.03 billion from $2.12 billion in the year-ago period.Revenues at this segment were largely impacted by the fluctuation in the price of natural gas, coal and uranium used in the generation of electricity. However, the fuel recovery mechanism, which allows the company to recover current expenses, came in handy; despite a small dip in revenues and electric margins improved 3.9% year over year to $1.18 billion. : Revenue at this segment decreased 24.1% to $221.3 million from $291.6 million in the year-ago period. : Segment revenue in the reported quarter was $16.5 million versus $18.3 million in the year-ago period, reflecting a decline of 9.8%.Total operating expenses incurred by Xcel Energy during the second quarter decreased 10.1% to $1.87 billion from $2.07 billion in the year-ago quarter. The decrease in expenses was mainly due to an 18.1% fall in input costs used for generation of electricity.Operating expenses, as a percentage of total revenue, also decreased by 309 basis points year over year, which positively impacted the operating results of the company. As a result, operating income increased by 12.9% year over year to $405.7 million from $359.4 million reported in the year-ago period.Long-term debts of the company as of June 30, 2012 were $8.7 billion versus $9.3 billion as of June 30, 2011. During the second quarter, the company issued $100 million first mortgage bonds with a coupon rate of 4.5%.Xcel Energy from time to time issues debt and equity to refinance debts, fund operations and for other general corporate purposes. During the second half of 2011 the company plans to raise around $1.7 billion through the issue of bonds and unsecured notes.Xcel Energy expects earnings per share for 2012 to be on the lower end of the guidance range of $1.75-$1.85 per share. The guidance assumes normal weather pattern during the rest of the year.Operating and maintenance expenses of the company are expected to increase by 1% year over year, while depreciation expense is projected to increase in a range of $40 million to $50 million from 2011 levels.Interest expenses are forecast to go up by $10 million, while the effective tax rate of the company is expected to be in the range of 34% to 35% in 2012.Xcel Energy's competitor,  .

We believe a favorable outcome in these cases will surely expand the margins of the company.The company's decision to increase the dividend rate is also appreciable. During the quarter, the board of directors of Xcel Energy approved to increase the annual dividend payment rate by 4 cents.Based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Xcel Energy is a U.S. electricity and natural gas company, with operations in eight Western and Midwestern states.

"Shutterstock photo""And by the way, I like coal.""It takes courage to say that, and Mitt Romney's remark in Wednesday's presidential debate drew investors' attention.If Romney is elected president, how could income investors play a friendlier environment for coal?One way is coal-fired utility stocks. The Obama administration's Mercury and Air Toxics Standards rule gives coal-fired utilities until April 2015 to meet the new regulations. The cost of compliance is significant. In some cases, it will involve retirement of units.Meanwhile, Reuters recently reported that the decline in the price of coal and the rise over the past six months in natural gas prices have some utilities turning to coal to generate electricity.In April, the price of natural gas was less than the price of coal. Historically, coal is cheaper than natural gas, so the two commodities are back to a more normal relationship.Let's take a look at five companies with coal-fired units.Minnesota-basedXcel Energy (  ) has a dividend yield of 3.9%. The five-year EPS stability factor is a calm 3 on a scale of 0 to 99. EPS is expected to grow 3% this year. The stock is 6% off its 52-week high.North Carolina-basedDuke Energy (  ) has a dividend yield of 4.7%. The EPS stability factor is 6. Earnings are forecast to slip 2% this year. The stock is 8% off its high.Based in New Jersey,NRG Energy (  ) has a dividend yield of 1.6%. Because of losses in 2011, the stock lacks an EPS stability factor. Earnings of 95 cents a share are expected this year, up from a loss of $1.84 a share. NRG is near a new high and a 23.01 buy point in a flat base. The pattern also could be seen as a 14-month-long cup with handle with the same buy point.Ohio-basedAmerican Electric Power (  ) has a dividend yield of 4.2%. The EPS stability factor is 5. Earnings are expected to dip 2% this year. The stock is less than 1% off its high.Georgia-basedSouthern Co. (  ) has a dividend yield of 4.3%. The EPS stability factor is 3.

The top line was also lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $295 million.Residential electric sales were 3,052 million kilowatt Kwh while Commercial & Industrial sales were 6,857 million Kwh in the reported quarter. Total sales were 9,978 million Kwh.Total operating expenses in the quarter under review were $1.67 billion, down 9.9% year over year. Lower operating expenses were offset by a decline in revenue, resulting in an operating income of $433 million, down 30.2% year over year. Segment operating earnings were $110 million in the quarter, down from $186 million in the prior-year period. The downside reflects lower prices for energy and capacity.Production from Power's combined cycle natural gas fleet was up 10% year over year with a capacity factor of 57.0% versus 52% in the year-ago quarter. Production from the nuclear fleet was down 3% year over year with average capacity factor of 87.2% compared to an average capacity factor of 90.3% in the year-ago quarter. The segment generated operating earnings of $101 million, down 3.8% year over year. The decline reflects warmer-than-normal winter weather, an increase in operating and maintenance expense and depreciation expense partially offset by an increase in transmission revenue. Segment operating earnings were $4 million, down from the prior-year figure of $10 million. The results reflect lower earnings on leases.At the end of June 30, 2012, long-term debt was $7.4 billion compared with $7.06 billion at the end of December 31, 2011. Commercial Paper and Loans were $0.016 billion versus no Commercial Paper and Loans at the end of December 31, 2011.Based on the operational focus and expanded capital program that makes the company well positioned for the long term, the company reaffirmed its earnings guidance. The company expects earnings per share in the range of $2.25 to $2.50 for full-year 2012.Though both the top- and bottom-line results trended down in the reported quarter, missing our forecast, it was in line with management's expectations. The results demonstrate the company's effort to provide reliable service at a reasonable cost.Going forward, the company's robust portfolio of regulated and non-regulated utility assets offers a steady earnings base and significant long-term growth prospects. Moreover, approval of the $3.5 billion transmission investment program will improve the system's reliability and will help to maintain the state's commitment to renewable energy. The investment program also proves that the company remains focused on operational excellence and disciplined investment.However, we remain concerned about the increasing cost of coal, higher pension & financial costs, and power-price volatility.

The revised dividend is payable on July 20, 2012, to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 21, 2012.The new annualized dividend rate of the company will be $1.08, reflecting growth of 3.8% from the prior rate of $1.04. The dividend growth rate is at the top end of Xcel Energy's targeted annual growth rate of 2% to 4%. The previous increase in the quarterly dividend rate was on May 18, 2011, when the rate was increased to 26 cents from 25.25 cents.Xcel Energy continues to register strong financial performance and has accordingly raised the dividend payment rate by more than 3% annually for the last seven years. This has been possible because of systematic infrastructure investment and growth initiatives undertaken by the company. Xcel Energy has plans to invest $1 billion in Texas and New Mexico over the next five years, which we believe will add to its financial results.The company is a strong cash flow generator and boasts of a healthy cash balance. Xcel's net cash flow from operating activities in the first quarter of 2012 was $477.5 million, with $119.2 million used for dividend payouts.

The earnings beat in the last quarter was the highest at 26.87%.Public Service Enterprise Group has a solid portfolio of regulated and non-regulated utility assets that offer a stable earnings base and substantial long-term growth potential.

Also, the company has undertaken various cost management programs, which would likely reduce negative impacts of temperature fluctuations.However, increasing operating expenses and price fluctuations are most likely to aggravate on account of temperature volatility and continued investment in utility operations.Xcel Energy currently retains a Zacks #4 Rank, which translates into a short-term Sell rating.

"e reiterate our Neutral recommendation on  (  ). The company's first quarter earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the year-ago quarter earnings. This was primarily driven by robust recovery of fuel costs from power generation, decline in company's operation and maintenance costs and strong share repurchase activities.Wisconsin Energy's utility operations and implementation of business strategies requires substantial capital investments. From its cash balance of $18.1 million as of March 31, 2012, it is quite obvious that the company needs to have access to the capital markets, and banking and commercial paper markets under competitive terms and rates. Failure to utilize any of these markets might increase the company's cost of capital.Following the successful completion of the ""Power the Future"" (PTF) plan, Wisconsin Energy is now focusing on its smaller projects and upgrading existing plants. Presently, the company is involved in two major projects; the first deals with the construction of a 50-megawatt biomass plant in Northern Wisconsin, while the second is related to air quality control upgrade for the older coal-fired units. We believe an increase in the company's electric generating capacity and a renewed focus on core electric and gas operations will help drive earnings going forward.In terms of providing better return to shareholders, Wisconsin Energy adopted a new dividend policy to target dividend payout ratio of 60% of earnings in the year 2014. To achieve its objective, the company has already increased its quarterly dividend to 30 cents per share from 26 cents per share, which will result in a 15% increase in annual dividends. We believe this is a smart move to attract more investors in the future.On the flip side, the electric and natural gas utility businesses primarily depend on seasonal changes, which subsequently impact its financial results. Demand for electricity is often high in summer and winter months. Unusually mild winters and summers can adversely impact the company's operational results. Wisconsin Energy saw demand slackening in the first quarter of 2012 due to a mild winter. This in turn affected its top-line numbers.During the first quarter , Wisconsin Energy posted its 2012 earning guidance in the range of $2.24 to $2.29 per share. As per the Zacks Consensus Estimates, the company's second quarter and full year 2012 earnings are pegged at 44 cents and $2.28 per share, respectively.Wisconsin Energy Corporation currently retains a Zacks #3 Rank (short-term Hold rating).The company competes with  (  ).Based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Wisconsin Energy Corporation is involved with the generation, distribution and sale of electric energy and steam.

 (  ) announced its first quarter 2012 earnings of 74 cents in contrast to 72 cents per share in the year-ago quarter, indicating a surge of 2.7%. Earnings in the current quarter surpassed Zacks Consensus estimate of 73 cents per share.This earnings outperformance can be attributed to robust recovery of fuel costs from power generation, decline in company's operation and maintenance costs and strong share repurchase activities. These positives were partially offset by lower demand due to warmer temperature in the winter season.Revenue in the first quarter of 2012 was $1.19 billion down 10.5% from $1.33 billion in the year-ago quarter. Revenue fell short of Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.29 billion.The lower revenue was factored by weak customer demand owing to mild winter weather. The reasons for the fall in demand can be traced back to a 2.1% fall in electricity consumption by small commercial and industrial customers and 4.3% less residential electricity users from the year-ago quarter.Moreover, demand for natural gas among residential consumers dropped markedly by 24% from the comparable year-ago quarter.Total operating expenses in the first quarter of 2012 was $895.5 million down 13.3% versus $1,033.1 million in the year-ago quarter. The decline ensued from the cost of gas sold that fell 30.6% along with operation and maintenance costs, which dropped 8.6%.Total operating income was flat with the year-ago quarter. This was due the adverse effect of the revenue decline that was compensated by lower operating costs.Interest expense also witnessed a 7% decrease to $58.9 million from $63.4 million in the year-ago quarter, owing to lower long-term debt.Cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2012 was $18.1 million versus $14.1 million as of December 31, 2011.Long-term debt as of March 31, 2012 was $4,602.8 million versus $4,614.3 million as of December 31, 2011.Capital expenditure during the first quarter 2012 was $142.3 million compared to $135.5 million in the first quarter of 2011.The company earnings per share projection is in the range of $2.24 to $2.29 per share. (  ), a competitor of Wisconsin Energy, announced operating earnings for the first quarter of 2012 of 41 cents per share, down 4 cents from the year-ago quarter. It modestly surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 cents.Revenue fell 8.4% to $2,578.0 million in the reported quarter from $2,817.0 million in the year-ago period. The quarter's revenue also fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,832.0 million.Wisconsin Energy's earnings performance beat Zacks Consensus Estimate although poor revenues stuck out. The surge in its residential and industrial customer bases is a positive sign for the company.However, constraining factors like temperature fluctuations could lower demand for electricity and natural gas.Wisconsin Energy holds a Zacks #4 Rank, which translates to a short-term Sell rating.

"ver since the 2008 market collapse and financial crisis, many investors have been suffering from a fear of heights. Whenever the market goes on a nice upward run, they get fearful -- very fearful -- with the still-fresh scars of the '08 crash leading them to think that what goes up will certainly come down.That's what seems to be happening right now. With the market having a very strong first quarter, fears have arisen that things have been too good, and that sentiment has become overly bullish.I for one don't think it has. Valuations remain reasonable, and the gains in the market have been accompanied by some very real, significant improvements in the economy. New claims for unemployment have continued to fall lower and lower over the past three months, as have continuing claims. The manufacturing and service sectors have both continued to expand during the quarter, retail sales continue to grow, and the S&P 500 still trades for about 14.6 times trailing 12-month operating earnings and 16.2 times trailing 12-month as-reported earnings.Still, given the market's rise and the lingering scars of 2008, it's tempting at times like these to take the profits and bail on stocks. But keep in mind that trying to time the market is a dangerous game, and numerous studies show that most investors fail when they try to do it. If you really need to calm your nerves, however, I think a better option than bailing on the market altogether is to simply switch to some more defensive areas. That way you give yourself some downside protection, but you also stay exposed to stocks and can capture a good amount of the market's gains if stocks continue to flourish.With that in mind, I recently use my Guru Strategies -- each of which is based on the approach of a different investing great -- to look for some fundamentally strong stocks in more defensive sectors of the market. I found a number of intriguing plays; below are some the best of the bunch. These are the sort of stocks that should allow you to stay in the market, without staying up all night worrying about your portfolio. Utilities are traditionally a very defensive sector, and my James O'Shaughnessy-inspired growth model is finding a lot to like about this Minnesota-based electric and natural gas utility, which has operations in 8 Western and Midwestern states. The O'Shaughnessy growth approach looks for companies that have upped earnings per share in each year of the past half-decade, which Xcel ($13 billion market cap) has done, and which have a key combination of variables: a high 12-month relative strength, which is a sign that the market is embracing the stock, and a low price/sales ratio, which is a sign it hasn't gotten too pricey. Xcel has a very reasonable 1.2 P/S ratio, and a solid relative strength of 74, so it makes the grade. This Denver-based brewer makes some of the world's most popular beers, including Coors Light, Heineken, Amstel, Molson, and Carling. The $8.1-billion-market-cap firm is a favorite of my Peter Lynch-inspired strategy, which considers it a ""stalwart"" -- the type of big, steady company Lynch found offered protection in tough times. (And, let's face it, when times get tough, people still find a way to buy beer.)Lynch famously used the P/E-to-Growth ratio to find growth stocks selling on the cheap, and for stalwarts he added dividend yield to the growth portion of the equation. When we divide Molson's 12.4 P/E by the sum of its 12.3% long-term growth rate (I use an average of the three-, four-, and five-year EPS growth rates to determine a long-term rate) and dividend yield (2.8%), we get a yield-adjusted P/E/G of 0.82. That comes in comfortably below this model's 1.0 upper limit, sign that it's a bargain. An auto parts business like Virginia-based Advance ($6.4 billion market cap) can help you play defense because when times get tough, people are more likely to fix up their existing cars than buy new ones. And Advance did well during the Great Recession, upping EPS in both 2008 and 2009 -- in fact, it has increased earnings in every year of the past decade. It's a favorite of my Lynch-based model, which likes the firm's 22.6% long-term growth rate and 0.76 P/E/G ratio. My O'Shaughnessy growth model also likes Advance's history of persistent earnings growth, as well as its combination of a 1.04 price/sales ratio and 90 relative strength. The parent of discount retailers T.J. Maxx and Marshalls, Massachusetts-based TJX ($30 billion market cap) fared very well during the Great Recession as consumers flocked toward bargains. It's continued to do well during the recovery, and has upped EPS in each year of the past decade, part of the reason my Warren Buffett-based model is high on it. A couple more reasons: The firm has enough annual earnings that it could, if need be, pay off all its debts in less than a year, and it has averaged a 37.7% return on equity over the past decade.TJX also gets strong interest from my Lynch-based model, which likes its 21.5% long-term growth rate and 0.94 P/E/G, and my O'Shaughnessy-based growth approach, which likes the stock's combination of a 1.28 price/sales ratio and 94 relative strength. The diversified healthcare giant had a rough fourth quarter, barely eking out a profit amid the fallout from several product recalls. But it still upped revenues for the period -- and it has a lengthy history of success and still boasts a number of strong brand names. Healthcare firms often provide defensive protection to a portfolio, and my O'Shaughnessy-based value model thinks JNJ is a good bet. It looks for large firms with strong cash flows and solid dividend yields, and JNJ fits the bill. It has a $180 billion market cap and more than $65 billion in trailing 12-month sales; $4.66 in cash flow per share, more than three times the market average; and a solid 3.5% dividend yield.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Defensive Stocks to Help Protect From a Market Decline@2012-04-02@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/defensive-stocks-help-protect-market-decline-2012-04-02

The company is a frontrunner in the utility industry providing environmentally friendly efficient energy solutions to its customers in the U.S.The company keeps track of its growth momentum by reinvesting capital in infrastructural assets like transmission lines and electric poles. Besides, it constantly upgrades safety measures at its nuclear plant facilities to avoid unmitigated disasters. The company is also investing in renewable energy sources, especially wind, to diversify its portfolio and meet fresh renewable energy standards.Xcel Energy's financial results are subject to irregular weather patterns that influence the demand for electricity and natural gas. A mild winter in the first quarter 2012 affected the profitability of the company. Moreover, stringent environmental regulations undermine the company's utility operations.Other negatives that will keep the Xcel stock under a tight leash are uncertain outcomes on pending rate cases, commodity price volatility and supply bottlenecks associated with non-fulfillment of contractual obligations from third parties. 's operating earnings for the first quarter of 2012 of 41 cents per share were down 0.04 cents from the year-ago quarter.

lectricity and natural gas company  (  ) reported its fourth quarter and fiscal 2011 year earnings. During the quarter, operating and GAAP earnings were 29 cents per share, a penny below the Zacks Consensus Estimate and both were in-line with the earnings of the year-ago period.During fiscal 2011, the company reported pro forma and GAAP EPS of $1.72, above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.69. However, in fiscal 2010 pro forma EPS was $1.61 and GAAP EPS was $1.62.The earnings for fiscal 2011 met the company's expectation and were in the upper half of its guidance range of $1.65-$1.75. The results reflect higher electric margins due to weather and rate increases in various states. However, these were partially offset by expected increases in operating and maintenance expenses, depreciation, interest expense and property taxes.Xcel Energy clocked total revenue of $2.57 billion in the reported quarter, a marginal increase of 0.05% year over year. Reported quarter revenue was, however, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.8 billion.Revenue in the fiscal-year period was $10.7 billion, up 3.3% year over year but below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.9 billion. Revenue from this segment increased to $2.0 billion from $1.9 billion in the year-ago period.Segment sales were largely impacted by fluctuating natural gas, coal and uranium prices used in electricity generation. However, the fuel recovery mechanism, which allows the company to recover current expenses, offset the effect to some extent. Revenue at this segment decreased by 2.2% to $560.1 million from $572.4 million in the year-ago period. Segment revenue in the reported quarter was $19.5 million versus $19.9 million in the year-ago period, reflecting a nominal decline of 1.9%.In fiscal 2011, the company exceeded its energy efficiency and conservation program targets. Despite severe weather across service territory during second half of 2011, the company provided excellent customer service and reliability.Total operating expenses during the quarter declined by 0.9% to $2.22 billion from $2.24 billion in the year-ago quarter. During the fiscal year, total operating expenses were up 2.1% year over year to $8.9 billion due to capital investment in Xcel Energy's utility business.Despite the increase in operating expenses in fiscal 2011, the company believes that the recent decision of the D.C. Circuit Court to stay the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule will provide it more time to comply with the rule in a cost-effective manner in Texas. As a result, this will prevent its customers from being burdened by significant cost increases and avoid potential reliability concerns.Electric fuel and purchased power expenses was $920.3 million, down 0.5% y/y. Operating income accordingly increased by 6.7% year over year to $344.0 million from $322.4 million reported in the year-ago period.Total interest charges and financing costs at the end of the fourth quarter 2011 rose 4.8% to $145.8 million from $139.1 million at the end of the fourth quarter 2010. The increase reflects higher long-term debt levels necessary to fund investments in utility operations, which were partially offset by lower interest rates.Long-term debts of the company as of December 31, 2011 were $8.8 billion while the debt-to-capital ratio at the end of the quarter was 54%.During 2011, the company issued three series of bonds aggregating $700 million, which were utilized for various purposes.Xcel Energy expects its 2012 earnings to be in the lower half of the guidance range of $1.75-$1.85 per share. The guidance assumes normal weather pattern in 2012.The company guides weather-adjusted retail electric utility sales to grow in the range of 0.5% - 1% in 2012, while the weather-adjusted retail firm natural gas sales are expected to remain relatively flat year over year.Operating and maintenance expenses of the company are estimated to increase approximately in the range of 1% - 3% year over year while depreciation expense is projected to increase in a range of $60 million - $70 million in 2012.The company expects interest expense to be relatively flat in fiscal 2012.One of the company's peers,  (  ) reported its fourth quarter and fiscal 2011 results.

"nergy utility,  (  ) has decided to share more profits with its shareholders. The Board of Directors announced its intention to increase the quarterly dividend rate to 30 cents per share from the current payout of 26 cents per share.The new quarterly dividend of 30 cents is expected to be distributed on March 1, 2012, to shareholders of record on February 14, 2012. The new annualized dividend rate of $1.20 per share will reflect a growth of 15.4% from the previous annual rate of $1.04 per share.Wisconsin will need another $9.4 million per quarter to pay the increased dividend to its shareholders if the share count remains unaltered. Year-to-date free cash flow of the company is $215.4 million, which will support the increased payment.The dividend payout ratio of the company, trailing twelve months, is 43.6%. The company targets a dividend payout ratio of 60% by the end of 2015 and this hike is a step closer to that long-term goal.Wisconsin Energy has a consistent track record of paying quarterly dividends. The prior dividend of 26 cents was paid on March 2011 on a stock-split adjusted basis.Wisconsin Energy has been performing well and its earnings per share have exceeded our expectation in the preceding four quarters. On top of it Wisconsin's long-term ""Power the Future"" plan has been a major hit and added 3 cents to earnings in the third quarter 2011.The market also reacted positively to the dividend hike announcement. Yesterday's closing price of $33.26 reflected a 0.24% spurt from the previous day's close.We believe that in a highly regulated utility industry, consistent dividend payment is a sure shot way to keep the investors interested in the stock.

"ith an intention to recover costs,  (  ) filed an application to the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (""CPUC"") to increase electricity rates. The rates if approved in toto will result in a hike amounting to $141.9 million and will cover all expenses incurred as well as incremental taxes.The rate if approved will increase the monthly bill of a typical residential customer by $4.01 or 6% from the current level. However, in another filing, Xcel Energy had asked for a reduction in the consumer bill, as the company wants to pass on the savings from the cost of purchasing power from other providers to its customers. The net increase, after adjustments on monthly bill of a typical customer, is pegged at 4%.Any upward revision in electricity rates impacts all and puts an additional burden on the monthly budgets of the consumers. So, the commission takes time, holds public hearings and judges all conceivable factors before allowing rate hikes.Regulated companies like Xcel Energy have to work within the regulatory framework, pay taxes and incur infrastructure investment to ensure not only safe generation but the proper transmission of the same to customers. Since the last revision in electric rates in Colorado, the company has already invested $750 million in the development of its operation in the state to service its customers better.To safeguard its transmission systems, Xcel Energy incurred costs for removal of dead trees killed by pine beetles near its transmission lines and made payment for property taxes due to upgrades to its transmission and distribution systems. The company also incurred costs for maintenance of its distribution system since 2008, in addition to payments made to reduce air pollution under the state Clean Air Clean Jobs Act.We believe a reasonable rate increase is the only way to allow utility operators to recover increased fuel costs, fees, taxes and costs based on location. Customers in return get safer and more secure supply of electricity.Xcel Energy currently retains a Zacks # 2 Rank, which translates into a short-term Buy rating.

"()In the last month we've seen a good amount of market volatility. It's hard to know exactly what to do when the near future is wrought with uncertainly.All the same, the reigning theory on Wall Street is that stocks are selling at a steep discount, and there's rarely been such an opportune time to buy.We scoured the financial newsletters for their most interesting stock picks since the AAA to AA+ meltdown. We list the picks below as well as the advisors’ reasons.Do you think these stocks are attractive buy-in opportunities? Use this list as a starting-off point for your own analysis.According to Roger, Xcel Energy Inc. (), Southern Company () and Dominion Resources, Inc. () ""operate businesses that have time and again proved resistant to even the sharpest recessions."" Furthermore, these names have ""topped both Wall Street’s consensus expectations and the companies’ own guidance."" They have also raised dividends and serve expanding energy markets.Stericycle, INC. () is the nation's largest provider of medical waste services. Green writes that the company's services are essential for medical offices, whose industry holds steady in good times and bad, and functions within a highly regulated industry. ""There’s a confusing grid of state, local and federal rules for the disposal of medical waste and no indication that the growing list of restrictive standards will slow down."" With the expansion of medical services overseas and in the US (think aging baby boomers) Green sees a lot of growth opportunity for this company.In an unsettled market ""dividend safety takes top priority."" That's the advice of Band, who recommends Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. (), NextEra Energy, Inc. () and Piedmont Natural Gas Co. Inc. (). He recommends this trio of stocks for their high dividend yield and market stability. The two utility companies offer a 4% yield while PAA offers ""a juicy 6.7%""Soousen is no stranger to dividend value either. His recommendation: CenturyLink, Inc. (), a telecom company ""paying handsome dividends"" at a whopping 8.6% yield. ""Based in Monroe, La., CenturyLink is a Fortune 500 company and a leading provider of Internet, TV and voice services. It is the third-largest telecom company in the United States."" Rest assured, Skousen says, ""The dividend is secure, too. CenturyLink will earn about $2.75 a share this year and approximately $3 next year."" The company is also experiencing a wealth of inside buying: President and CEO Glen Post recently purchased 10,000 shares, an investment of $337,143.

nergy utility,  (  ) posted net operating earnings of 49 cents per share in the fourth quarter of 2011, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 47 cents per share. However, the results fell short of the year-ago quarter's operating earnings by 4 cents per share.Wisconsin Energy's fiscal year 2011 operating earnings were $2.18 per share compared with $1.92 per share reported in 2010. The results exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents.Earnings growth was driven by the positive contribution from the company's Power the Future plan. Commercial operation of the new second unit at the Oak Creek site, from January 2011, contributed to the upsurge in results.Earnings on a GAAP basis, for 2011 were $2.24 per share versus $1.93 per share recorded in 2010. The 6 cent difference between operating and GAAP earnings, for 2011, emanated from discontinued operations.Wisconsin Energy's total revenue in fourth-quarter 2011 was $1,113.2 million, compared with $1,089.8 million in the year-ago period, reflecting a growth of 2.1%.Reported quarter revenue marginally surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,101 million.Wisconsin Energy's total revenue for 2011 upped 2.2% to $4,486.4 million from $4,202.5 million reported in the prior fiscal year.Fiscal year 2011 revenue of the company was higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4,435 million.Total operating expenses during the quarter decreased marginally by 0.05% during the fourth quarter 2011, while for the fiscal year cost declined by 0.24% year over year. This resulted mainly from a decline in the cost of goods sold.For the fiscal year, operating expenses, as a percentage of total revenue, declined by 521 basis points year over year, thus benefiting the operating results of the company.The growth in revenue and the decline in costs drove fiscal operating income by 9.49% to $887.3 million from $810.4 million in 2010.Net interest expenses in 2011 were $235.8 million versus $206.4 million in 2010, up 14.2%. The incremental interest expenses can be attributed to a higher debt burden from the previous financial year.Cash and cash equivalent at Wisconsin Energy as of December 31, 2011 were $14.1 million.Cash from operating activities for 2011 was $993.4 million versus $810.4 million in 2010.Capital expenditure during the year was $830.8 million, which reflected a growth of $32.6 million from $798.2 million incurred in 2010.Long-term debt rose to $3,963.3 million from the prior-year level of $3,802.1 million, as of December 31, 2010.The company has been consistently paying dividends to shareholders. On January 2012, the company announced a quarterly dividend of 30 cents, which reflects an increase of 4 cents from the prior quarterly rate. This hiked quarterly dividend will be paid on March 1, 2012, to shareholders of record as on February 14, 2012.The new annualized dividend rate will be $1.20 per share reflecting a growth of 15.4% from the previous annualized rate of $1.04 per share. .

The results also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents.Not only did the company surpass our expectation, the rise in consumption of electricity by large commercial and industrial customers are positive signs for the company. Yet, an inkling of doubt remains with the decline in Utility Gas revenue in both the quarter and the fiscal year.Wisconsin Energy currently retains a Zacks #2 Rank, which translates into a short-term Buy rating.Based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Wisconsin Energy, through its subsidiaries, generates and distributes electricity in Southeastern, East Central, and Northern Wisconsin, as well as in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.
