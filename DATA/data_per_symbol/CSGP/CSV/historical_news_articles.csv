Looking back now, the last few weeks have been one of the biggest bonanzas investors have ever witnessed.Since the market bottom on March 23, the  has rallied as much as 35% in a little more than a month. The tech-heavy , meanwhile, gained as much as 40% since its bottom, and was even in positive territory for the year before a recent pullback.You don't have to look hard to find multi-baggers, either. Shares of , the online home goods seller, skyrocketed more than 800% from trough to peak in just a matter of weeks. , the fast-growing online used car dealer, surged 354%, and  , a wholesale food distributor and supermarket operator, has soared as much as 367%.Dozens of stocks have hit all-time highs, and the S&P 500 is now trading at levels seen as recently as last summer, while the Nasdaq hit marks from January. Given the dismal economic data and the uncertainty around the  pandemic, however, it's worth asking if stocks deserve to be at such elevated levels.Though I've made a few small purchases in recent weeks, I've been saving up cash to invest when the market's more favorable. Here's why investors could see better opportunities in the coming months.Image sources: Getty Images.The latest reason for investor euphoria is that states have begun to reopen their economies. It's true that a number of states have lifted stay-at-home orders, but the reality is that the post-lockdown economies in these states are barely recognizable. Social distancing is still  across the country, which means that a normal, functioning economy is impossible.In Texas, for example, restaurants in most of the state are limited to just 25% capacity for dine-in customers. A number of small business owners in these states are reluctant to reopen their businesses over fears of the virus (or that customers will stay away because of it), and polls show that most Americans are more worried about shutdown protocols being lifted too soon rather than too late. Schools remained closed in almost every state, and districts are formulating plans for remote learning in the fall, as students might still not be able to attend in person. The California State University system has already cancelled most in-person classes for the fall, and Los Angeles County, the nation's biggest, said its stay-at-home order would last at least through July.Without schools reopening broadly, which means not just kids returning to school but tens of millions of parents being freed from their duties as assistant teachers, a return to a normal economy is a fantasy.Image source: Getty Images.The tech industry deserves much of the credit for the stock market's rebound. The big five (, , , , and ) have all approached all-time highs, or even set them in recent weeks, and stocks in areas like cloud computing and e-commerce have surged as well. It's clear why: Tech has been mostly insulated from the effects of the pandemic, and some areas like e-commerce, video streaming, and gaming are even benefiting from it.That strength -- which may be more vulnerable than it looks -- has obscured the fact that a number of other industries have been devastated by the pandemic. Those include travel, entertainment, restaurants, retail, real estate, construction, manufacturing, finance/banking, agriculture, transportation, media/advertising, and energy, as well as the public sector and non-profits. Some of those are getting hit harder than others, but almost all have experienced record losses in recent weeks due to shutdowns and the impact of the pandemic. For some industries, business as usual won't return until social distancing measures go away. The CEOs of both and expect a full recovery for the airline industry to take two to three years, and Boeing CEO David Calhoun predicted that at least one of the major airlines would declare bankruptcy later this year.Restaurants and retailers will struggle to bring customer traffic back to normal levels as long as the virus is lurking, and no one knows when Americans will be able to pack sports stadiums or concerts again, or visit a place like Disney World, without strict coronavirus protocols.And while the tech sector makes up a significant percentage of the stock market's value, it  relatively few Americans. It can't carry the economy on its own.Image source: Getty Images.There's been a lot of talk among the financial media, politicians, and corporate chieftains about the recovery, but this crisis is still young. The initial impact only started weeks ago, and the second- and third-order effects are still developing. In the last crisis, housing prices actually peaked in 2006, but the unraveling didn't begin until 2008.We already know unemployment is at double digits and consumer spending is plunging, but the consequences of initial economic impacts and cultural shifts aren't fully clear yet. For example, what happens if work-from-home policies become permanent and corporations bail on high-priced office leases, as some have already announced? That doesn't just spell trouble for commercial landlords, but for pension funds, banks, and others holding those commercial mortgage-backed securities as well, as landlords could easily go into default. In total, office real estate in the U.S. was worth $2.5 trillion in 2018, and the industry looks much less secure than it did just a few months ago. With so many service workers now unemployed, there is a similar risk of collapse in the home rental market, worth $2.9 trillion according to Nareit and . Malls were struggling before the pandemic, and are particularly poorly suited to social distancing, putting them at risk of default. And the student debt bubble, which has soared from $300 billion in 2003 to $1.5 trillion in inflation-adjusted dollars, also looks ripe to burst with so many now unemployed. With campuses now shut down, the value and the future of a college education are being questioned now more than ever.Elsewhere, there's the risk of massive small business failures, as most have less than one month of cash on hand and can't survive more than six months of shutdown-like conditions. Then there's the prospect of another wave of infections that forces businesses to close and deals another setback to the economy.Right now, after more than a 30% bounce, the stock market is priced as if the risk from the pandemic is almost entirely in the past, and the best-case scenario is the most likely. While it may be true that the worst of the outbreak has passed in terms of the death toll, there's still plenty of economic risk ahead -- especially as the response to the outbreak and the reopening of the economy need to be carefully managed.Optimism never runs in short supply on Wall Street or corporate board rooms, but during this crisis the usual embellishment and positivity have turned into outright magical thinking. Don't be fooled by the market's recent rally. At these prices, there's a lot more that could go wrong than right.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Please refer to today's press release on how to access the replay of this call.And with that, I would like to turn over to our Founder and CEO, Andy Florance. -- Thank you, Sarah. That's a -- an unusual milestone to have a pandemic-enabled safe harbor statement. Hopefully, we could avoid that the rest of my life. So, good evening and thank you for joining us today for CoStar's first -- virtual first quarter 2020  or virtual food management team. The first quarter was really a composite quarter, with two normal months and one pandemic month. As with every business, the COVID-19 pandemic has upended normal operations. The pandemic operations in CoStar's -- the pandemic hit operations in CoStar's Beijing office first, giving us advance warning, and I'm sorry, I'm getting a bunch of beeps here. If we use teams, it beeps in my ears. So I'm sorry. The pandemic hit operations in CoStar's Beijing office first, giving us advance warning, and some time to prepare to transition a 100% of our North American and European operations to a digital dispersed remote workplace. Employee safety and continuity of operations for the sake of our investors, clients and our employees was our top priority.Our systems teams responded promptly, working around the clock to execute our emergency contingency of our plans. We're very grateful for their diligent efforts. We believe that 95% of CoStar staff has successfully transitioned to working remotely over the past six weeks at 90% productivity. These are stressful and disorienting times for our employees and I'm also grateful to them for their resilience and continued focus on our professional responsibilities. And it's OK, if our employees' kids periodically duck their heads into our many video conference calls.We're consistently keeping our customers and mission-critical needs front and center. At the same time, we continue to build and innovate for CoStar's and our clients' future after this disruption subsides. We believe that our products remain mission-critical to the vast majority of our clients even as they deal with pandemic-driven market disruptions. The commercial real estate industry will continue to operate, and to do so, we'll need to sign and renew leases, find investment opportunities, value properties, disposal properties, analyze markets, and very importantly, market vacancies to generate much needed revenue. In a time when people cannot readily visit properties in person, digital marketing becomes even more important. CoStar Group and our digital solutions are here to meet the industry's continuing need for high-quality data and highly effective digital marketing.In the immediacy of the initial phases of our prices, our clients are trying to assess what it all means and are trying to derisk. This means buying new information or marketing solution sometimes is not their first priorities initially. The clients of our clients are also putting things on hold and that's disconcerting to our clients. As I have communicated consistently over the years, in the initial phases of an economic disruption, let alone a global pandemic, our gross sales drop and cancellations rise initially. We are seeing some of that now. I want to stress that our business has always been really resilient through down cycles. In the 2008 recession, which was very hard on the commercial real estate industry, that was the only time our revenue ever contracted for even a quarter. And even then our revenue only dropped 1% in calendar 2009, 1%. We experienced a flat sales quarter followed by two quarters of declining sales, finishing with a slightly negative sales quarter after that cycle. Again, revenue dropped 1% in the worst year in our 34-year history.Sadly, in any economic cycle, some number of our clients' businesses will fail, some clients will exit the business for good, others will lose buildings to bankruptcy. We share their pain or deeply empathetic for any of our clients' businesses to come in this downturn. We have often seen clients going through bankruptcy organization now and continue to pay for their mission-critical services. As some building owners, lose their buildings, these buildings remain valuable assets through bankruptcy and new investors step into buy them and many of those investors purchase our services as they begin to operate their new purchases. The fact remains in every past cycle, the majority of our customers continue to operate their business and continue to rely on our services.Typically, sales of properties slowed dramatically for several quarters, two years or so after the disruption like this. Fortunately, we are not as heavily impacted by the property investment sales cycle. Our broker clients tend to drive a lot more of their revenue from leasing commissions. In the cycle, leasing pauses initially for quarters or so that tends to rebound sharply like a sharp V. This is the -- this is for the simple fact that any given time, the bulk of leasing activity is driven by leases expiring that need to be renewed. These expiration dates have no respect for an economic crisis and most companies remain in business and continue to need their facilities. So they sign leases even in a down cycle. And as they sign those leases, our clients earn commissions.I've asked our economists to use the wealth of information we have on past cycles and to run Monte Carlo simulations to estimate expected leasing activity over the next 12 months. We believe it will be close to a million leases signed in the next 12 months. We believe that these will generate more than $0.5 trillion of leasing value and more than $20 billion of commissions. While leasing has initially seized up, eventually, there's still a lot of business we've done in the back half of the year. This analysis refers to total leasing activity not growth in demand. We expect there will be a significant contraction of -- in demand overall, with the commissions are not normally impacted or were not normally impacted by that. Rates fall a little bit, didn't really hit the commissions too hard.In fact, with high leasing values and some contraction of demand, there is something like a game of musical chairs for building owners going on. There's a lot of leasing activity, but every time the music stops, there are few owners left without a critical tenant income, or by analog of chair. Marketing commercial space and apartments becomes even more important when it becomes harder when it's on a net vital revenue in a shrinking pool of tenants. The pandemic and social distancing make this economic downturn harder than other downturns. The physical leasing process of prospective tenants driving by properties, being signs and touring through the buildings, as in most cases, ground to a halt. Just when owners desperately need to promote their buildings and tour tenants to fill growing vacancies, the physical inspection of properties are becoming impractical.The digital marketing Apartments.com, LoopNet, Realla, Belbex, LandsofAmerica or BizBuySell offer to become a critical replacement for the loss of the traditional physical leasing process. Respective tenants can tour their options on Apartments.com, see what the buildings look like, use aerial drone videos to understand the area, use Matterports to walk through the apartments virtually, and even potentially use our online leasing tools to apply final lease and pay the rent without ever exchanging stacks of paper with a stranger.If Fortune 500 executives are touring potential new office space in a high-rise tower right now, I believe that it's much more likely they're in their PJs at home doing it on LoopNet rather than touring in person. It's much safer that way. I believe that this phenomena is why Apartments.com had its second-best sales month ever last month. And, in fact, if you exclude a convention sales month like NAA, it was our best sales month ever last month. Even as this happened, we achieved that best sales month, even after most of the country was locked down and our entire sales team was working from home. At this point, in April sales for Apartments.com is pacing ahead of April of 2019. To be clear, we expect that revenues overall may contract in the near term. But we feel that there are a number of drivers that make our business resilience, or even somewhat countercyclical over the course of the next year.With 34 years of experience running a company that provides economic insights through multiple cycles, there is no doubt that this pandemic has created more uncertainty than any other scenario I've seen. But the pandemic has created too much tragedy for too many. It has created serious economic uncertainty. Good thinkers I respect hold diametrically opposed outlooks. So from where we stand today, it's essentially unrealistic to predict with a certainty we need, what the detailed consequences of this pandemic will be on our business over the year to come. So, we will provide guidance for the next quarter, but not the full-year. However, we continue to believe that our data analytics and marketing tools will be among the most viable source of information leads and potential traffic for our customers. Therefore, we remain very confident in our business model and the role we play supporting the CRE industry. We're maintaining our investments to strengthen our position, both from a brand, as well as a product perspective, and believe that we will exit the present uncertainty in a stronger position than before.With that qualifying prologue, I want to continue and quickly review our Q1 results. I'm very pleased that in the first quarter, we delivered at the high-end of our guidance range across the board. CoStar Group's total revenue grew 19% year-over-year to $392 million. Across all of our service lines, our revenue growth was ahead of expectations with LoopNet revenues leading the pack at nearly 23% year-over-year growth. Apartments.com was strong with revenue growth just above 20%.In the context of significant investments we are making into the Apartments.com brand, this year's -- this quarter's net income was strong at $73 million. Adjusted EBITDA was solid at $124 million.During the course of the first quarter, our sales team generated $48 million in net new bookings, despite the pandemic's disruptive impact. Again, Apartments.com was the true stand out, achieving its second highest quarter ever of net new sales up 34% versus the prior year quarter. Fred Saint, Paige Forrest and the whole multifamily team delivered an amazing, resilient and adaptive performance throughout the first quarter. They never miss the beat. LoopNet had an exceptional start to the year also, but the CRE industry slowed little harder in March in reaction to the pandemic.Let's go into Apartments.com little deeper. In 2019, we invested approximately $150 million to market Apartments.com to consumers. We continue to feel that Apartments.com represents a huge market opportunity for CoStar Group and then we can achieve an outside return by increasing our investment in marketing Apartments.com to our previously communicated level of $250 million 2020. Our enhanced marketing campaign launched in March, just as renters began quarantining at home and they consumed unprecedented amounts of media. The initial results from the first monthly campaign were strong with 1.5 billion impressions, nearly doubled that last -- scene last year. The total visits to Apartments.com reached a new all-time high. Our unaided brand awareness also continues to climb with a new high of 35%. I believe Jeff did a fantastic job with the creative and we're really happy with the whole series of ads we're going to be able to present to consumers over the course of the months to come.After a dip in March, as quarantine efforts across America began, leads have recovered substantially and are now trending above the levels we saw at the same time last year. So without a doubt, our marketing investment is paying off and combined with the efforts of our sales force, we hope this will allow us to maintain good net new bookings levels.We continue to work diligently through all the required regulatory processes required before we can close on our acquisition of RentPath. The bankruptcy proceedings are following the expected course. In late March, no auction was held -- OK. That's a virtual  when the kids call you in the middle of the call and the call waiting hits your phone. Sorry. The bankruptcy proceedings are following the expected course. In late March, no auction was held because no qualified bidders came forward. From the public filings, we can see that the vast majority of the debt holders support the planned reorganization, which includes the contemplated sale to CoStar. The FTC review is ongoing and we expect a second request, which will extend the review on a time frame that is consistent with our previous estimates of three to 12 months from signing. As always, we respect the FTC process and will cooperate fully to provide the agency with all the information they need to perform their investigation. There is no additional information we can provide on the outlook for the process at this time.LoopNet started the year very dynamically continuing the positive usage of sales trends that we saw in the fourth quarter. As we and the rest of the country transitioned to home in early March, we experienced a drop off in daily average users that lasted for about a month. Over the past couple of weeks, we've seen a steady increase in users, just about back to last year's levels. More importantly, the number of searches now exceed last year's level and that's what counts for our customers.As I mentioned, LoopNet sales dipped as -- in March, as people transitioned to work from home. LoopNet sales have not yet shown a same resilience that apartment sales are shown. I think one thing to remember is the digital advertising value proposition has been well understood for many years now in the multifamily industry, whereas we are in the early stages of adoption for the commercial real estate industry. Ultimately, we believe that the current situation will actually accelerate LoopNet adoption. But it may take more time. I'm a huge believer that LoopNet will be an essential virtual solution for owners looking to win in outsized and important share of the hundreds of billions in commercial leasing dollars that are likely to occur this year. Right now, industry participants really need to know what's going on. They need to have the best information available for forecast, availabilities, listings and the pricing information that CoStar provides. We remain committed to continuously improving our user experience and the utility of our CoStar product. The CoStar Suite in particular, 2020 will be year of significant product development initiatives. We are deeply engaged with the back-end integration of the STR platform. As the year progresses, we plan to integrate STR into the CoStar product at the front-end as well.While CoStar operates in dozens of countries around the world, our product is not yet one seamlessly integrated, multi-lingual system -- multi-localized system. Well, on the short-term, commercial property sales volumes will fall dramatically, we expect those surge again in a year or so. Much of that investment activity will be multinational. In order to provide the most value and capture the most value from that opportunity, we want to provide our clients with a truly CRE global transaction analysis and marketing platform. We are hard at work on that initiative and expect to release the first phases of our global system in the third quarter of 2020. We expect to support a dozen or so languages by the end of the year. Ultimately, a customer from one country will be able to use one platform to seek, analyze and compare investments across multiple countries and cities.STRs clients are clearly one of the hardest hit segments for -- of our client base in this pandemic. Hoteliers definitely have had a hard time here. This downturn will be more damaging to them than 9/11 and the Great Recession combined. We expect that STR will likely see the drop in revenue and profit, but we expect the fall out to be relatively or comparatively mild. For our STR subscriptions, we have been able to handle about 80% of the client financial assistant request through payment deferrals. For the other requests, we have offered two- to three-month contract extensions that represent in total $300,000 in annual revenue. We also have $54,000 in annual canceled product subscriptions. At this point, it's remarkable but it suggests less than 1% of canceled revenue.STR subscribers are a key partners and the least likely to cancel their products. These are hotel operators that know the data is vital to understand the market and what is happening with their competitors as well. They also want to make sure they have continuity in reportings they're able to track as soon as recovery is beginning in their market.Due to the number of hotel closures in some markets, especially outside the US, we have a plan to continue to provide value to these subscribers even if we cannot report on market numbers for some period of time. We are providing custom analysis such as a deep dive on the average daily revenue declines that uncovered the fact that ADR declines were not from hotels slashing rates, but rather from a rapid shift in the mix of demand. The feedback from these clients in our exclusive content series developed for them has been overwhelmingly positive and underscores the importance and value of maintaining their contracts with STR.STR has the most risk associated with the ad hoc revenues. Ad hoc revenues are off but we expect that revenue will begin recovering in June. This is revenue that will come back, and the industry will begin recovery and development activity will restart, which will result in trend sales. Or if we have a prolonged downturn, there'll be trend sales happening with distressed assets or portfolio evaluations or dispositions.We are releasing for the first time tomorrow, monthly profit and loss analysis for US hotels. The data has continued to come even and even with so many hotels closed, and there's even more desire from hotels to see this profit-loss information. The entire industry is watching the recovery in China to hopefully shed light on what a recovery in their part of the world will look like. We have been reporting on China weekly and have now added a video series focused on China recovery that we're producing both in English and Chinese. As of last week, 90% of the hotels in China are open, and we have a couple of markets that are inching toward 50% occupancy. Overall, though, occupancy in China is at 35%, and that's certainly nowhere near the normal 70% to 75% occupancy we expect, but it's well up from the low of 10% occupancy a few months ago. Slow but measured recovery in a matter of months.Finally, I want to update you on the state of the commercial real estate economy overall. It's really still too early to empirically see the full and ultimate impacts of the pandemic on the commercial real estate industry. The data so far shows an unprecedented collapse in economic activity, jobless claims over the past four weeks have exceeded $26 million, and this figure would likely be higher if it were not for the overwhelmed application websites and offices. Most high-frequency economic indicators are showing unprecedented declines from manufacturing output, poor traffic to retail sales, consumer confidence. Consensus forecasts are calling for a 4% decline in GDP in 2020 and for the unemployment rate to approach 20%, levels not seen since the Great Depression. We're already seeing the effects of the outbreak on commercial real estate.Continuing with the hotel theme. Hotel revenue per available room is down more than 80%. We have simply never reported figures like that. The immediate impact is less profound in the other property types, though, thankfully. Our daily apartment rent series shows that asking rents have fallen by about only 1 percentage, since -- 1 percentage point since peaking on March 10. That's not much compared to what we've been seeing in hotels. But normally, we'd expect apartment rents to be up about 1% over the same period. But all in all, given everything, there's no problem there. But we believe that many Americans are active or looking for new apartments. And as we've seen, search activity at Apartments.com is exceeding pre-outbreak levels.In the commercial sectors, leasing volume over the past few weeks has fallen to about half of typical levels. And we expect it will fall further in May before it begins rising again in June or July. We expect the retail sector to be the hardest hit as many shops have closed due to the social distancing measures. Demand for retail space has already turned negative so far this year. Many shops, restaurants, bars and coffee shops, sadly may never reopen. Our forecasting models predict occupancy losses of as much as 300 million square feet, and that vacancy rates could rise 350 basis points to levels well above the peak of the last downturn. Rent losses could reach 15%, topping the 10% losses in 2009.Outcomes for office at this point will look less severe as vacancies are lower and construction is about half of the level in 2007. Still we expect occupancy losses ranging from 100 million square feet over four quarters to a 0.25 billion square feet over the next two years, compared with just 57 million square feet of the last downturn.Our models predict asking rent losses of 10% to 20% compared with 14% in 2008. Declines in effective rents will be larger as landlords offer concessions and TI packages to retain tenants. Demand for industrial has held better thus far. First quarter leasing set an all-time record. And while the pace of leasing has slowed mid-March, Amazon has leased more than 6 million square feet in April alone. I can't help it. I need to point out that Amazon is one of the single heaviest users of LoopNet, and we can see their staff looking at LoopNet at many of these properties they eventually lease. Need a commercial in there in the economic section to pay for the economics. Amazon has also announced that it's already hired 100,000 workers to cope with the demand and plans to hire 75,000 more. But even industrial will see occupancy losses and rising vacancies, demand falls even in our upside scenario. So positive absorption returns quickly and rents resume trend growth by the middle of next year.With negative net absorption will likely suppress the losses last downturn, the 2008 experience also gives us some confidence that leasing activity won't fall by nearly as much. In 2008, total leasing volume across the commercial property types was down just 7% from the pre-recession average, and 2009 was down just 4%, even as occupied space fell by more than 300 million square feet. By 2010, leasing was up 10% from pre-recession levels.In the capital markets, it's too soon to know the effect on deal volume, but initial indicators suggest investment activity could be down by as much as 50%. In the last downturn, deal volume fell by 75%. Swift and unprecedented action by the Fed in its shored up financial markets and thus far prevented the worst, but we expect prices to fall by at least 10% and potentially by as much as 30% or more. In the most dire outcome, prices remain at the depressed levels for the next decade.Our baseline scenario, though, predicts commission start to improve next year, while this prediction comes to pass, depends on containment of the outbreak and progress toward treatment and the vaccine, two variables that are almost impossible to predict and difficult to incorporate into economic models. What we can say with some certainty is that, many firms will fail, the rents will fall and vacancies will rise. But we also note that the day-to-day business of commercial real estate will continue as leases expire, tenants seek new space, brokers and landlords negotiate, borrowers refinance, lenders underwrite deals, appraisers determine value and opportunistic buyers come in strong looking for bargains, and Americans continue to look for new apartments.CoStar Group is on a strong foundation as we face the full impact of this pandemic. With 19% year-over-year revenue growth, $73 million of net income in the quarter and $1.9 billion in cash on the balance sheet, we had a great quarter in the overall context. Our staff has successfully transitioned to remote working. We believe that we will have a rich set of attractive acquisition opportunities ahead, and we're currently exploring a number of such opportunities. We continue to support our clients' mission-critical needs, and we're hard at work building the innovative products that will drive our future growth.At this point, I would like to turn the call over to our CFO, Scott Wheeler, for the much more interesting and entertaining section of the call. -- Well done, and thank you, Andy. And certainly, it was an unbelievable start to this year in so many ways. It's unlike anything I've ever seen. That's for sure. But I'm thankful that our CoStar teams are safe and productive, our business is performing well, and week by week we will continue to navigate through all of these changes. Financially, we're in a very strong position. We maintain a very conservative balance sheet, precisely for times like this, a time when we can continue to invest for the future and take advantage of new opportunities that come our way. We have $1.9 billion in cash. Our subscription revenue model is resilient and the services we provide are 100% digital, perfect for a time when person-to-person contact has been practically eliminated.Our business is much more diversified than it was in the '08-'09 recession, with 50% of our revenue now coming from online marketplaces as opposed to almost 100% from CoStar 10 years ago. On top of that, owners, property managers, institutional investors and lenders now represent our largest customer base, whereas we were much more heavily concentrated in the brokerage customer sector during the last downturn.But things are changing and over the past month and a half, we have financially become very, very granular. We watch daily metrics on contracts, on sales, on customer inquiries, customer retention, cash receipts, purchases and payments. This information, although valuable, does not tell us what the future holds, but it certainly provides insights for the multiple revenue scenarios we create in our financial models, of which even the absolute worst-case scenarios do not indicate any concerns with regard to liquidity or the ability to continue generating strong positive operating cash flows.Now, on to some color on the results. We had a great start to the year, with revenue in the first quarter up 19% over the first quarter of last year, while revenue growth in the first quarter, excluding the STR acquisition, was 15% year-over-year. CoStar Suite revenues grew 12% in the first quarter of 2020 versus first quarter of 2019 as expected.As the stay-at-home orders began in early March, we saw the daily sales and the new contract flow for CoStar decline, dropping to roughly half of the January and February levels by the third week in March. Coming into the last week of April, sales levels have stabilized and have improved slightly. We expect renewal rates to gradually soften in the month ahead, just as they did in the previous economic downturn. We discontinued all price increases in early March to our customers. Assuming these sales and renewal trends continue through May and June, we would expect the revenue growth rate for CoStar Suite to be in the 7% to 8% range for the second quarter of 2020.Revenue in our Information Services grew 72% year-over-year in the first quarter of 2020 to $32 million, and this includes our first complete quarter of results for STR. On a combined basis, STR and our real estate manager business represent approximately 80% of the revenue in Information Services. Both of these businesses have reoccurring subscription revenue, as well as one-time transaction or implementation fee revenue. The subscription revenues, which were 80% of the revenue in the first quarter, are stable, and as Andy said, will continue to be stable and actually growing both year-over-year and sequentially into the second quarter. This is encouraging as the global hospitality industry is certainly one of the hardest hit by these recent travel restrictions. Now, the transaction and implementation fee revenues have declined as customers delay purchases and planned implementations. Overall, we expect the reported revenue from Information Services to grow at a rate somewhere between 30% and 40% in the second quarter of 2020 compared to the second quarter of 2019.Multifamily revenue growth for Q1 remained really strong at 20% over the first quarter of 2019, which was exactly what we were expecting. Our revenue growth continues to be generated from both an increase in the number of properties that advertise with us, which was up 9% in the quarter, as well as growth in the average rate per property, which increased 11% in the first quarter as customers upgraded to higher level ad packages. Despite the disruptive events that occurred in March, multifamily had a phenomenal first quarter with their second highest ever quarterly bookings. Digital marketing has never been more critical than right now. So far in April, we see continued strong sales levels, which is sustained through the second quarter, would result in revenue growth of approximately 18% to 19% for the second quarter of 2020 compared to the second quarter of 2019.Commercial property and land revenue grew 20% year-over-year in the first quarter of 2020. Our LoopNet marketplace, which represents over 75% of the revenue in this sector, grew 23% year-over-year in the first quarter. Following very strong LoopNet sales in January and February, we saw sales volumes drop roughly in half, consistent with what you saw in CoStar Suite in the second half of March and the remainder of that levels pretty much through this time in April. With LoopNet user traffic and lead volumes improving week-to-week, we are optimistic that these sales levels could improve in the months ahead. We expect commercial property and land revenue growth rate to be approximately 10% to 12% for the second quarter of 2020 compared to the second quarter of 2019.Our gross margin came in at 80% in the first quarter of 2020, in line with expectations and we expect our gross margins to continue at that level in the second quarter. Our profitability was strong in the first quarter, with net income, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP EPS results all ahead of the guidance we issued in February. Overall spending levels came in below our first quarter expectations as we rapidly adjust into the business to respond to the stay-at-home orders and prepare for the anticipated negative effects in the economy. In some areas, our spending increased, including cleaning and sanitation of our offices, the technology costs for moving to remote environments. We also increased our bad debt reserves to reflect anticipated economic hardships in certain customer segments, such as hospitality, retail and small brokerage shops. Our vacation accrual actually increased the time offers deferred by of our employees.In other areas, of course, our spending decreased. This included travel, conferences, facility improvements, infrastructure-related initiatives that are not mission-critical to support our customers and our products. We froze non-essential hiring and compensation at the beginning of March, and we curtailed all discretionary spending.Our marketing spend increased year-over-year in the first quarter of 2020 by over $20 million as part of our previously announced multifamily growth strategy. It included the higher levels of search marketing, as well as the launch of our Apartments.com brand advertising campaign. This represented a significant increase over prior year spending levels and total marketing spend in the first quarter was just modestly lower than planned, primarily due to the timing of the spend as some of the expected advertising events such as the NCAA tournament were canceled. In addition, we pulled back on certain types of marketing that would not be effective when our customers are working from home such as direct mail or office visit gifts.As Andy mentioned, we intend to continue our increased investments in marketing as planned for the second quarter of 2020. Our digital marketplace tools are becoming more relevant and effective during social distancing, and now is not the time to pull back on marketing support for these investments.Cash and investment balances were approximately $1.9 billion as of March 31, 2020, up $857 million since the end of 2019. In March, we borrowed $745 million against our revolving credit line in order to prefund the expected RentPath acquisition and to increase cash reserves for other acquisition opportunities that could emerge in the near future. The remaining $120 million cash generated was due to strong cash from operations and other areas in the first quarter.Now, I'll look at a few of our performance metrics. At the end of the first quarter, our sales force totaled approximately 800 people. That's up 45 people from the first quarter of 2019 and down approximately 40 people sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2019. As we stopped hiring in March, sales force attrition is not currently being replaced with new hires. The majority of the attrition in the first quarter relates to the inside sales roles. In addition, we shifted a number of our best field customer service people into direct selling roles, resulting in little impact to our direct field sales teams for CoStar and multifamily. These levels are roughly equivalent to the fourth quarter, which is the slight decline.The renewal rate on our annual contracts for the first quarter of 2020 was in line with the rate we achieved in the fourth quarter at 90%. The renewal rate for the quarter of customers who have been subscribers for five years or longer was 95%, also in line with the renewal rate in the fourth quarter of 2019. As a point of reference, during the last economic downturn in 2008 and 2009, renewal rates for CoStar declined gradually over the course of about six quarters. Similarly, we could see declines in our renewal rates in the months ahead. Our second quarter 2020 forecast assumes that our 12-month trailing renewal rate will decline around 200 basis points from the current levels. Subscription revenue on annual contracts accounts for 83% of our revenue in the first quarter, in line with the fourth quarter of last year.Now, on to the outlook. And as indicated in our press release, and Andy mentioned, the uncertainty in the current environment, we're withdrawing full-year guidance and we're not going to be issuing new annual guidance at this time. We expect to resume our practice of providing annual guidance at some point in the future. We are able to provide estimates for the second quarter of 2020 as our subscription revenue model provides a reasonable forecasting visibility for the near term. Our approach to the second quarter revenue outlook assumes that the overall sales results observed for the first three weeks of April continue relatively unchanged throughout the end of June. Accordingly, we expect revenue for the second quarter of 2020 in the range of $387 million to $392 million, representing top line growth of around 13% at the midpoint compared to the second quarter of 2019.For the second quarter of 2020, we expect adjusted EBITDA in the range of $110 million to $115 million. This outlook assumes we will seasonally increase second quarter marketing spend in Apartments and in LoopNet, which will partially be offset by reduced spend levels in personnel and other operating expenses when compared to the first quarter.For the second quarter of 2020, we expect non-GAAP net income per share in the range of $2.02 to $2.12 based on 36.8 million shares.In summary, we delivered very strong financial results in the first quarter of 2020 and our business is on a very solid financial footing. Our teams are safe and productive. And we believe our information analytics and online marketplaces will become increasingly valuable to our customers in the months and the years ahead. Thank you for all of your support, and I look forward to updating you on our progress in July.With that, we will now open up the call to questions.[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Mario Cortellacci with Jefferies. Please go ahead. -- Hi. Thanks for the time. I hope all of you and all your families are healthy and staying safe. I was just curious, because we have limited insight into how Apartments.com has performed during the last downturn, obviously, it wasn't part of your financials. Just wondering if you can give us a little more insight into how that business reacted. And, I guess, I think the expectation is that, it's more of a consumer-type of business, so it would likely be more impacted. But any extra color or any more -- or background on the performance will be greatly appreciated. -- Sure. I've asked the executives who managed Apartments.com or similar companies that we acquired in the last downturn, and they have typically said that the Apartments.com does better in a downturn than in a really healthy market. So higher vacancy rates, mean there is more demand for leads and traffic in the leasing offices. So -- and point of fact, many people, executives believe that a really healthy market like we had a year ago is a bad environment to operate Apartments.com. Consumer behavior here is fundamental, it's like having a roof over year ahead. So, it's very resilient during a downturn. -- Great. And then just more of a longer-term question. I think we've done a lot of questions around, how the industry could structurally change on the commercial real estate side? I guess, just the working from home environment, do you think that impacts demand for commercial real estate longer term? I think, I heard you tossed out a number on just square footage of commercial real estate declining over the next two years. I don't know if I heard that correctly or maybe this has something to do with that. But do you think that this is a structural change in the industry that could happen longer term as more people work from home and there's just less demand for office space? -- Well, forgive me, I don't want to sound a flip, but after decades of having these sorts of discussions, I come across a little bluntly. I was in early cynic on the concept that co-working would take over the world. I'm a much bigger cynic on the fact that people going to want to continue working from home. And I actually think that -- I think there is a little knee-jerk where people say, oh gosh, everyone's going to work from home. I'm not seeing that. And in fact, I could actually make the argument that the potential downside of 0.25 billion square feet of demand going away in the office sector is really just driven by job losses. One person per 200 feet. But the demand for office space is very elastic to the price. So, the amount of space per person in Houston is dramatically larger than the amount space per person in London. So, as prices fall 28%, overall demand may go up, especially when companies are trying to figure out potentially over two years, three years how not to be sale over each other and want to spread out a little bit. But our staff in Beijing is thrilled to be back in the office. And I've never seen people like that happier. -- Great. Thank you so much. -- Yeah.Your next question comes from Peter Christiansen with Citi. Please go ahead. -- Thank you, guys, and Sarah, great to hear from you. Thanks for the opportunity to ask some question. Andy, do you think this economic shock will -- will you think about changing any of your products or services, whether it'd be features or perhaps the way it's priced or packaged? Do you think CoStar will need to change any of its products because of this economic shock? -- Yes. We are -- our product teams have probably initiated a dozen or more product changes to deal with the situation. If you go to LoopNet, you'll see a very prominent virtual tour button now on the home page. We now have an ability in LoopNet, where a broker can -- or two executives, a broker and a tenant or two executives can join each other on a LoopNet tour and actually initiate video-conferencing together in the LoopNet website as they view properties. We call that co-tour. There are probably a dozen or so of these sort of virtual leasing, more social distancing-type things that we're doing. And we're also ratcheting up the marketing. This is -- the one thing that happens in any one of these disruptions is typically behavior changes permanently. And so, we believe that there's a chance that people will come to value online marketing and real estate much more than they valued it before, and we're basically pulling all the strings and product features to try to capture that as quickly as we can.There's some other initiatives we're looking at, and maybe one or two acquisitions we're looking at, that are responsive to what's occurring right now and what we think will happen next year based on this cycle. So, we're -- I think probably 30% to 40% of what we're doing in product is around this situation right now. I don't think there's a lot changing in pricing. I think we never increased prices when the market is in disruption. But beyond that, I don't think there's a bunch of -- no big need to change pricing. Too long an answer there, I'm sorry. -- No. That's fine. And then, have you seen any new use cases for CoStar products? Have there been new clients that have approached you? Interested if anything's popped up. -- It's a little early for that, but I'm positive there will be. What you typically see is, money on the sidelines looking to move in on distressed properties. So that's already starting to ramp up as usual. -- Great. Thank you. -- Yeah.Your next question comes from Stephen Sheldon with William Blair. Please go ahead. -- Hi. Thanks. Andy, you made the comment that revenues could contract in the near term. So I know there's a lot of uncertainty out there. But generally, how much visibility do you have right now looking at potential revenue in the third and fourth quarters this year? Is there at least a meaningful likelihood that revenue in the second half of the year could be down organically? Or were you just saying that as a general possibility, but maybe not what we should expect at this point? -- I would reiterate that there's a lot of uncertainty right here. We don't know if we're going to be fully back at work, when, how. But I would not be at all surprised if there wasn't -- I would expect softness in revenue. I have to say that when I saw the Apartment sales numbers come in last month, I was shocked. When I'm seeing the sales numbers coming in this month, I'm shocked, and like, oh my gosh, the world is falling apart and we're selling a lot of online marketing. But yeah, I have to assume that some elements of our business, as with other downturns, will see softness. Cancellations will go up. We've had a number of customers ask for forbearance on their bills. We've probably negotiated some deferrals on about 160 customers on CoStar. We probably eliminated some user headcount at some sites, on 100 or 200 some sites roughly. But -- yeah, we have to prepared for that. It doesn't really change the long-term course. We would expect to pick back up if there's softness shortly thereafter. And we're going to be try to -- we're going to try to keep everything move in the right direction. But we certainly can't say that it won't go negative here or there. But again, when it went negative last time, it -- only one time ever in 34 years, on annualized calendar basis, it was 1% down. So I'll take that. If that's the hit we're going to take, I'll take that. But we're going to try to fight it. -- Okay. And then secondly, you had mentioned the potential global system that you plan to rollout in the third quarter for the CoStar Suite. Any thoughts on what that could mean for the CoStar Suite financially as we think about the next few years? -- Yes. It's a -- it's certainly not a pandemic-related investment. It's the long play. But you look at -- I think we -- when I look at the early days of CoStar, we were in a handful of cities. There was x demand for our products. As soon as we covered the majority of the United States, I felt that there was 4x the demand for our products because we were a way to transcend multiple markets and geographies in the United States. I believe that same opportunity exists on international level. Once we can start to stitch together our European point solutions into a consistent solution, along with the consistent solution in the United States and tie in some of our new assets in Asia into that same platform, I believe we'll be able to offer a lot more value.We will not be making massive investments in cycling up in Poland this year, obviously. But modest investments to start to build our network around the world. And we'll be doing things like if a customer subscribes to national data in the United States, they will automatically get global data. So someone in London will be able to search for sales opportunities in Toronto or in -- look at hotel information in Beijing, etc., etc. But we do think that we want to be well-positioned for what we think always happens in a cycle, which is a drop in investment sale activity, followed by a surge, which is multinational. And we want to really be able to build a -- really capture that global capital flow that's invested in commercial real estate. And it's making good progress. And we're lucky that our lead developer, Mike Fulkerson, there actually came to us from -- oh my gosh, how could I possibly remember that number one language software. What is it, Scott? If you're going to learn a new language what would you use? -- That is a good question. Maybe C+? -- Rosetta Stone? -- Rosetta Stone. -- Thank you very much. Right. Okay. Thank you. -- That comes from our General Counsel. Perfect guy to have running CoStar development as the guy who led development over at Rosetta Stone. -- Sounds good. Appreciate the color. -- We definitely have too many devices up on my screen on my desk. Now, I have like Rosetta Stone popping up on 16 bubbles on three screens.Your next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. Please go ahead. -- Hi, good afternoon. Appreciate you taking the question and all the color as usual. And Andy, I know it's a super fluid environment, and I'm just trying to qualitatively put the pieces together, especially you're trying to circle I think around the second quarter guide, which is pretty good, all things considered. And some of the qualitative commentary about how things -- how bad things could get. Again, just suppose it against what the peer means. I think you even acknowledge surprisingly strong sales on multifamily LoopNet. So, if you continue to do well, given the investments in LoopNet and given the countercyclical aspects of multifamily, should we infer that to the extent the numbers sort of get much worse comparable to the worst part to the '08-'09 downturn, that most of the downside risk exists in Suite? And I just wonder about the mechanics of that? -- Yeah. So, we -- sadly, I really do expect to see a lot of bankruptcies. And I remember clearly in '08, you had thousands of companies that were clients going bankrupt. So I imagine you're going to see some bankruptcies, you're going to see folks at the end of their career decide to step out at this point. So you'll see that -- we'll see that hit the CoStar Suite side, and that typically -- that will happen over X number of quarters, but you also see new buyers entering the market in the -- after a quarter or two, especially like vulture investors or opportunistic investors. You will see building owners go bankrupt. The only up -- the silver lining there is that they tend to -- they have in the past, tended to maintain their marketing plans through bankruptcy. Bankruptcy courts tend to approve that because they don't want the revenue stream to erode during the bankruptcy process.And then the thing that I remember clearly from the last several cycles is that, the new owner steps in, they just bought the asset for $0.50 on the dollar, they are flushed with cash and much of it flows our way. So, there -- I think that there will be friction throughout the system, but probably a little bit more on the brokers who step out of the business to go -- or go bankrupt on the CoStar side.[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Mayank Tandon with Needham. Please go ahead. -- Thank you. Andy or Scott, maybe one of you could answer this. In terms of the multifamily platform, I think, Scott, you mentioned that 11% of the growth last quarter came from some of the upgrades. Could you provide a little bit more color in terms of what those features are that the users are buying? And what does that mean for 2Q in terms of the contribution from the upgrade on the platform? Thank you. -- Yeah, sure. What I was referring to in the -- growth in the quarter was that the -- our clients are choosing higher level ad packages to purchase, which cost more per package. You may recall, last year, we announced that we were putting a Diamond Plus level for sorting to the top of the Diamond section. And then this last year, at the end of the fourth quarter, we also introduced Platinum and Gold Plus tiers as well to sorting to the top to those levels. Now, those aren't material parts of our sales right now. But they're just examples of when people want to get more exposure when they have additional vacancies they need to fill, then they can buy up to higher level ad packages to get more traffic and more leads. And we saw that in the first quarter, and that's what generated that 11% revenue growth from that price/mix effect.Your next question comes from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. -- Good morning. I'm sorry. Good evening, everyone. It's a long day. -- Can we start the call in the morning? It won't be that long. -- So, Signature Ads at LoopNet, that was a big focus of the sales conference in January. And the whole move from having LoopNet go from being a broker-focused, broker-driven to the owner-driven market. Are you seeing uptake on those ads moving from the broker price point at $35, $40, $60 per listing per month up to the $2,000 to $3,000 level for the owners? Is that taking place? -- Yes. -- And is that going to continue to drive the revenue? Because it sounds like the revenue on that division is going from around 20%, 22% expected revenue growth, about 10% to 12% revenue growth? -- Yeah, that's right. -- Yeah. So, before the pandemic hit, we saw some really good sales results in LoopNet Signature Ads. And then the pandemic hit and everything just basically stopped while people are figuring out what's going on. But the really good results of Signature Ads continues in January, February. And as much as anything, I think we saw some brokers who are more vulnerable pulling back some of their spending. And while it's -- there was a dip in search activity in LoopNet initially as we went into the pandemic in the United States, that activity has come back up and searches are now stronger than they were before. I think we need to clarify our message or evolve our message to the owners about the fact that they have -- the message is really solid for those folks. There will be hundreds of thousands to 1 million leases in the next year. There will be a contraction of overall demand. People are not driving by and seeing building signs, people not touring the buildings. We are continuously improving the immersive quality of marketing their buildings on LoopNet. And we think we will pick up revenue, and I think it will keep going.But we're being conservative right now because a lot of our revenue on LoopNet comes from small brokerage firms, and we think they will take an outside hit, but that's not really impacting the fact that we're going after a new market pretty aggressively, which is the larger institutional owners. And the amount of money they spend on an advertisement on a high-end LoopNet ad relative to their vacancy loss is about as levered as you can possibly be. You're looking at a $100 million vacancy loss, and you're looking at an ad that costs a couple of thousand bucks. So, I remain optimistic. I spent most of Sunday working on new marketing materials for LoopNet to try to adjust and focus, and I think we'll -- I'm still bullish about the potential there. But Mr. Wheeler, Dr. Wheeler, will be Dr. No, because we're seeing the low and being conservative. -- And Bill, we talked about the revenue per listing increasing in Apartments as people buy ads. In just Signature Ads alone, we saw from the fourth quarter, we were around $500 per ad in the fourth quarter, now we're a little over $700 per ad in the first quarter. And that's not price increases. That's people deciding to buy the Platinum and the Diamond level Signature Ads in more and more quantities as time is going on and as our sales force is really focused on those high-value properties. So it's starting to move up nicely from an average price perspective.Your next question comes from Ryan Tomasello with KBW. Please go ahead. -- Good evening, everyone, and thanks for taking the question. Regarding the expense base, can you talk about what levers you have to pull there going into the back half of the year? And how willing you'd be to pull them depending on how this all plays out over the next few quarters? And particularly with respect to the Apartment ad spend, can you clarify your comments regarding the intent to continue with that plan? Is that just with respect to 1Q, meaning the ad spend in the second half of the year could potentially be curtailed depending on how the environment unfolds? -- We -- at this point, as we've mentioned, so there are a bunch of different levers we can pull on cost structure. We have a lot of optionality there, but at this time, we don't have conditions that would merit contracting our spend dramatically. We actually have a lot of great growth drivers in the business and we are -- as we report this quarter, we're meeting our expectations. If things fell apart, certainly, we would react, but that's not what's going on.And when you look at the results we're having in Apartments.com, they're strong, and we believe that potential is still there. And we don't see a reason at this point to change our strategy. Our traffic to Apartments.com and our lead flow is at the highest level it's ever been. So across the board, almost all of our key sites are hitting the traffic numbers. And we think that there's a transition going on from more offline to more online. And this is an opportunity that we don't really want to change our course or our mission, given what the facts we have today. So, we're anticipating continuing the same investment we originally planned unless something changes.Your next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. -- Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. You withdrew your full-year 2020 guidance and only guiding one quarter out for now. Can you discuss your confidence level in achieving your previously disclosed 2023 targets? -- Those are always fun questions to ask, George, in the midst of an extremely uncertain environment. When we decided not to give 2020 guidance, George asks me for 2023 guidance. I kind of knew you were lurking out there, George. You can get to that. So, right now, we -- like we said, we've gotten the second quarter is what we're seeing so far. And clearly, we are focused on growing back at our historic levels as quickly as possible and continue to invest so that can snap back, and continuing to pursue acquisitions, which will help fill any of those revenue gaps that might be created by a temporary slowdown. Certainly, you either have to buy more acquisitions or you're going to have to get that revenue growth rate running up further in the out years. But mathematically, we can still get there. Again, we didn't tell you now what the length and the duration of the downturn is. You can't say it for certain. But that's not all we know about it so far. And as pace and directions change, we'll obviously keep that in mind. -- Uncertainty, clearly, is high right now. And -- but the -- and we don't have a reason to believe that it's not achievable at this point until facts change and there's -- or reasonably it's not achievable. I would actually say you could say if an element of that is organic, it would probably be more achievable to -- I'm sorry, or an element of that target is acquisitive for an acquisition, that may become easier to achieve those targets in this acquisition environment.Your next question comes from Brett Huff with Stephens. Please go ahead. -- Good afternoon, guys, and glad you're all well. Andy, I want to follow-up a little bit with you because I know you've been probably talking with a lot of your customers, and we've gotten a lot of questions on kind of the microeconomic decisions that, say, a multifamily owner or a commercial building owner who wants to sell or maybe is under duress or maybe wants to wait. Do you have any anecdotes that will help us get some insight into those decisions that folks are making and how, therefore, they're going to make decisions on whether they'll advertise on LoopNet or advertise in multifamily? You gave us a good example of the large multifamily owner with lots of vacancy risk, buying an ad for a few thousand dollars. But are there any more in the middle market or even any more for LoopNet that you could give us? Thanks. -- So in terms of -- I think there are two different questions there. One is the microeconomics and decision to market on LoopNet or Apartments.com. I think that math is really quite simple. Like if -- across the board, the economic trend is going to be just softness in leasing revenue. And when you hit softness in leasing revenues on big dollar items and traditional methods like broker parties or events or signs or people spinning the sign outside or walking through the building are all gone away, that beautiful print brochure is not going to be seen or touched by anybody. It's a no-brainer that the trend should be to digital marketing, virtual experiences, more Matterports, more drone videos and the like. So that's a no-brainer.And on the other element about decisions, how people are using our tools to try to decide should they sell, should they -- I think those trends are tsunami-like. And I think that -- I hope our clients use our data aggressively and trust the numbers to set their pricing realistically quickly to win at the game of musical chairs, i.e., sit down first if the data says you should sit down first because having a chair is better than having no tenant at all. So, I think that people should be using our data right now to really be realistic between -- and also to help coordinate between owner, lender and investor to make sure that they're all making that decision together with data as opposed to hope.And then on the part of investment sales, I feel that there's typically a big disconnect right now where it's going to be really difficult for people to -- sellers to reduce their expectations enough to meet where buyers are right now. So typically, that doesn't happen for a year to 18 months to 24 months. But we will build products and services to try to be there with strong offerings as that volume unleashes.Your next question comes from Sterling Auty with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. -- Yeah. Thanks. Hi, guys. So for my one question, I just want to go back to multifamily in terms of the comments that you made. Is it fair to say that you actually believe the bottom has already been put in, in multifamily? Or is there a potential that multifamily could see sequential contraction in the upcoming quarters? -- I think there's two questions. One is our experience selling advertising to multifamily, and then secondly, rates and occupancy levels and asset prices in the multifamily world. I believe that just by the nature of our business, we are somewhat insulated as to what happens with occupancies. We may be inversely correlated to what happens with occupancies. I think we're relatively independent of what happens with the rent. The rent fall so far are not material. And I think we're independent of what happens to asset values. So we may be somewhat negatively impacted by the fact there may not be a lot of new development over the next two years. But at this point, the sales are holding up strong because if you have tenants who are not paying rent and they were paying rent the month before, and you anticipate they may not be paying rent again in the future, you need to begin to backfill them. If you just had a large property deliver and it's got a lot of vacancy, then you may have -- I need to really pick it up.So I don't -- again, we can't really see beyond next quarters to what's going to happen in the economy. But right now, we feel pretty good about what's happening from Apartments.com's perspective and our experience. It could change, but right now, it's -- it has surprised me materially to the upside. Shocked me.Your next question comes from Joe Goodwin with JMP Securities. Please go ahead. -- Thank you for taking my question. Just one quick, on comment on the revenue -- potential revenue growth going negative. Can you maybe just give us some color on how you're thinking -- what quarter... -- Joe. Joe, I'm sorry. Could you speak up a little bit? It's very dim. Could you try again? -- Is that better? -- Yes, much better. -- Sorry about that. Thanks. -- Whole new you. -- Yeah. So, on the commentary around the potential of your revenue actually going negative growth. Could you maybe just give us some color around what quarter will likely be the bottom or at least how you're thinking about that? -- I would look at -- we don't know, but I would just look back to the worst we ever experienced in 30 years was '08-'09. And we had two quarters where it really materially fell. So that would be a quarter or two out on the CoStar side. But we -- this is a different cycle, and we have no idea when -- it's just too hard to predict past the quarter. But it typically wouldn't be -- if you were just taking exactly what happened in '08 and stick it right here, it would be third, fourth quarter. -- Yeah. The other thing, people -- what were seeing -- and to keep in mind is that, if you recall back in the last recession, it started to build -- the negative momentum started to build through '08 and then dropped pretty heavily at the end of '08, early '09. And so, it took a number of quarters for that to develop. What we're seeing happen here is that, when we hit in March, things dropped quickly, and they dropped within a week down to the levels I mentioned, half of the levels of sales, etc., which never happened before in the '08-'09. And then when we see what's happened since then, as Andy mentioned, we've seen volumes move up in traffic and leads on both LoopNet and Apartments.com. Apartments.com is up where it was before the downturn. We've seen CoStar in the last week and a half, we've seen the contracts pacing move up a bit in CoStar in the last week and a half. So we just saw this -- the cliff dropped quickly, and then it held there for a week or two. And then we've seen some build underneath it.Now, does that mean it's going to continue to build? Or is it going to drop again if something else happens in the economy? Or is it going to build faster? Like, we don't know, but the pattern is very different in this shock than what happened in '08-'09. But we're trying to take as many lessons as we can from it and then just see how this thing develops in a different pattern.There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to presenters for any closing remarks. -- Well, thank you very much for the first quarter -- joining us for the first quarter earnings call. I look forward to updating you this summer on the second quarter. And I hope you're all staying safe and well, and appreciate you all joining us here on the call today.[Operator Closing Remarks] --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''.  These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand.  Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).  Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

"Looking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. 	For the First Trust Lunt U.S. Factor Rotation ETF (Symbol: FCTR), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $22.00 per unit.


With FCTR trading at a recent price near $19.60 per unit, that means that analysts see 12.24% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings.   Three of FCTR's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Twilio Inc (Symbol: TWLO), CoStar Group, Inc. (Symbol: CSGP), and Amphenol Corp. (Symbol: APH). Although TWLO has traded at a recent price of $109.95/share, the average analyst target is 20.51% higher at $132.50/share. Similarly, CSGP has 20.40% upside from the recent share price of $593.60 if the average analyst target price of $714.67/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting APH to reach a target price of $97.11/share, which is 12.70% above the recent price of $86.17. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of TWLO, CSGP, and APH:  

   Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:

Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past.

	CoStar is a unique company in the real estate sector. It provides information, analytics and marketing to the commercial real estate sector.In a world where things have changed so swiftly in just a matter of weeks, the first thing businesses of all types are going to have to examine is how best to move forward.And one the biggest expenses on their books is real estate. Whether it warehouses, office buildings or anything in between, right-sizing space will be crucial. And CSGP is one of the best in this new and fast-growing business.The company has been around since 1987 and is headquartered in Washington, DC but serves not on the US and Canada, but the UK, Spain, Germany and France as well.The stock is up 33% in the past 12 months. More impressively, it’s up 7% year to date, a significant relative outperformer.Source: Shutterstock
	Chemed is an interesting union of two business divisions that aren’t necessarily sexy, but are durable and necessary. And the Cincinnati, Ohio, company has been around since 1970, so that durability should be self-evident.Its two divisions are VITAS and Roto-Rooter. VITAS offers hospice and palliative care using a team of professionals from doctors to clergy and volunteers. VITAS is the leading provider of end of life care and has nearly 50 hospice programs in 14 states and Washington, DC.Roto-Rooter is a franchise that offers plumbing services for commercial and residential clients. And it’s the largest of its kind in the US. It actually got its big start during the Great Depression, giving people a chance to start a necessary business with little training and a constant demand.The stock is up 42% in the past 12 months, and almost 3% year to date. These are two solid sectors that will continue to deliver. And Source: justplay1412 / Shutterstock.com
	Shopify is an online commerce platform for small and medium-sized businesses.Given the state of the economy and the soaring unemployment numbers, there’s a good chance many of those people out of work won’t have jobs to return to for quite a while.If you recall, this is what happened in 2008 and was the real power behind the ‘gig economy’ movement, when fee-for-services jobs blossomed for a new generation. You can expect the same thing to happen again.Many older workers will be replaced with younger, cheaper workers. And middle management will get replaced by productivity software and other structural moves.That leaves a lot of people looking for work in sectors built without those jobs for now. Starting a small business as a contract worker or turning a hobby into a business it what Shopify allows these workers to do.The stock is up a whopping 125% in the past year, and 25% year to date. It’s not cheap, but in this market you can afford to be patient or buy in over time.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com
	Lockheed Martin is the largest defense contractor in the world. Net sales for the company in 2019 were nearly $60 billion.When there is instability in the world – whether that comes as a virus or a repressive regime – defense companies stay busy. When there is significant geopolitical change brought on by rogue actors or power shifts among superpowers, defense companies stay busy.Needless to say, LMT workers do not have idle hands now, nor will they in coming years.Also, because these companies are so big – they have divisions all over the US – boosting defense spending is a win-win for politicians. It shows they’re tough and it also boosts the economy. In an election year, both are very important.The stock is still reasonably valued given its potential and it continues to perform. It’s up 19% in the past 12 months, and off a mere 4% year to date. Plus, it delivers a reliable 2.6% dividend. Growth and income is a hallmark of many of the stocks I recommend for Source: Shutterstock
	Costco is a major membership warehouse wholesaler that caters to everyone from small businesses to bulk shoppers, especially those with larger families.Everything is super-sized but the quality is usually top-notch, name brands are available and the size of the company means it has significant purchasing power for its house branded items.For example, it is one of the largest wine buyers in the world, so it can go to quality wineries and place massive orders for great wine at a bargain price. The same goes for most of its products.Also, given the runs on groceries and other essential items, its members-only status keeps down the crowds. And the super-sized items give consumers a head start on stockpiling.This is a company that is doing well now and will continue to thrive, as it did before the lockdown. The stock is up 26% in the past year and almost 6% year to date, with a 0.8% dividend.Source: Hairem / Shutterstock.com
	Nvidia is one of those companies that symbolizes the next generation in computing.Initially starting out as a builder of high-end graphics processing units (GPUs) for institutions, researchers and gamers, it is now one of the leading tech companies in the world.GPUs have become the game changer in so many of the new cloud-based industries that it went from a funky niche company to major player in a matter of a few years.Around 5 years ago, the stock was trading in the low 20s, where it had traded for years. Now, it’s trading near 290, and has a $172 billion market cap.But it has seen volatility, as many tech firms have. And the competition is heating up because they now see . But Nvidia is still leading the pack in robotics, drones, smart vehicles, big data, you name it.The stock is up 50% in the past year, and up almost 20% year to date. It’s a bit pricey, but for that kind of performance in this kind of market, a premium isn’t a surprise.Source: madamF / Shutterstock.com
	Next Era Energy is the world’s largest producer of wind and solar energy. It’s also a regulated electric utility in south Florida.This gives it both a growth engine and a solid base of regulated revenue. You see, the renewable energy it owns is sold to companies and other utilities for carbon credits to offset their dirtier fuel outputs. And now more companies are also seeing the advantages of having reliable power as the electrical grid becomes increasingly unreliable with no real interest in the federal government or industry to upgrade it.This is the current growth engine for NEE. However, its FPL (formerly Florida Power and Light) has been around a very long time and has a lock on the most dynamic and wealthiest part of Florida.

"[Editor’s note: “10 Stocks With Little or No Debt to Own for the Next 50 Years” was previously published in December 2019. It has since been updated to include the most relevant information available.]Surf the net and you’ll find lots of stories about the best stocks to own. Some will be for the next year, five years, or even 10 years. Very few, however, will offer up ideas for the next half-century. In part, that’s because investing today has become a “What have you done for me lately?” kind of business. Also, because so many companies have disappeared over the years, it’s futile to guess who’s going to stick around.The  had a tenure of 33 years in 1965. In 1990, that dropped to 20 years. By 2026, it’s forecast to fall to 14 years. In other words, the odds of you winning the lottery is almost as good as owning a stock that remains publicly traded for 50 consecutive years. Nonetheless, I’ve decided to give myself this challenge. The 10 stocks to own on my list have very little debt, a market cap greater than $10 billion, and sector-wise provide a reasonably diversified portfolio.Source: Shutterstock
	Linde (NYSE:), the UK-based supplier of industrial gases, gave back all of its 2019 gains and then some during the coronavirus slump, but looks solid otherwise.In October 2018, Linde and U.S.-based Praxair completed their  of equals that created one the world’s largest supplier of industrial gases with  and 80,000 employees around the world. The deal vaulted it ahead of Air Liquide (OTCMKTS:), the French provider of industrial gases. In the fourth quarter ending in December 2019, Linde had an operating profit of $.6 billion on revenue of $6.9 billion. Despite the $90 billion mergers, the company was able to sidestep the debt issue by doing an all-stock deal with Praxair. I would expect Linde to deliver double-digit annual returns for years to come. Source: Richard Frazier / Shutterstock.com
	Lululemon (NASDAQ:), the popular apparel brand that got its start making comfortable yoga pants for customers, has a brigh future ahead.This isn’t the first time I’ve included LULU stock in a list of long-term holds. In August 2016, I argued that LULU would be one of the  over the next decade. Three years in, it’s living up to the promise.As Forbes contributor Sergei Klebnikov recently pointed out, Lululemon has benefited from  through its own network of stores rather than selling its products wholesale to department stores and other third-party retailers.Between its healthy women’s business, a growing men’s business, an eCommerce segment that’s also rapidly growing, and its Asian stores selling its product like hotcakes, it’s easy to understand why it’s putting the rest of retail to shame. Source: calimedia / Shutterstock.com
	Hormel (NYSE:) is a food company focused on protein-based products, including the Hormel, Spam, Dinty Moore and Skippy Brands. While its 2019 return wasn’t Lululemon-like, it has delivered consistent returns for its shareholders. Over the past decade, it has generated an annualized total return of 18%. In its most recent earnings report, Hormel racked up .Hormel also paid an 11% dividend increase to 93 cents a share. That’s the 54th consecutive year HRL has increased its dividend and the 11th consecutive year it has increased its dividend by 10% or more. It might not be the most exciting stock to own, but it surely is one of the most consistent.

	If you’re familiar with CoStar Group (NASDAQ:), you know there’s money to be made with information. Specifically, CoStar makes money by providing the most comprehensive database of real estate information in the country. By being the best information provider around, CoStar shareholders did very well in 2019 with a total return of almost 75%. Over the past 15 years, CSGP has generated an annualized total return of 18.8%, double the total U.S. market. Last year, , a data analytics company that specializes in hotel information, for $450 million. With only $64 million in annual revenue, CoStar expects to grow STR by 20% annually by helping bring products to the market faster.As AI, machine learning, and data analytics become a regular part of business, expect CoStar to continue to grow at a considerable rate.  Source: michelmond / Shutterstock.com
	Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:) manufactures the da Vinci robotic surgical system that allows doctors to carry out minimally invasive surgeries for patients around the world. It’s  worldwide, with a majority sold to U.S. hospitals. However, the company’s international sales are multiplying. The systems aren’t cheap. That has allowed it to grow its revenues by 75% in the past four years. This has done wonders for ISRG stock, which has a nearly 22% total return year-to-date and 29.4% over the past 15 years. If there were a tech/healthcare stock that Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:,NYSE:) should have bought but didn’t, ISRG would be it. The company has a reasonably wide moat but continues to invest in research and development so that it stays ahead of its competition. In 2016,  of its revenue on R&D. In 2020 it’s projected to spend 11.6%, a 30% increase over four years. Owning ISRG over the long haul is a slam dunk.

	Biotech stocks, especially those developing clinical-stage drugs, scare the heck out of me. They don’t make any money, but they spend several years and many millions or even billions getting the product approved.That’s a lot of power riding in the hands of a small panel of experts. As a shareholder, you have very little control over the process. That’s why it makes sense to invest in large biotech firms such as Alexion Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:), whose Soliris drug is used  in adults suffering from paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and other related diseases. In the fourth quarter,  more than the same period a year earlier. Its successor drug, Ultomiris, is also doing well. As a result of this success, Alexion expects to make at least $10.25 per share in 2019 on a non-GAAP basis, significantly higher than its outlook at the beginning of the fiscal year. Up 15.7% year to date, expect bigger things from ALXN stock in 2020.  Source: Lissandra Melo / Shutterstock.com
	I picked Cummins (NYSE:) because it has one of the healthiest balance sheets of any large-cap company in the industrial goods sector. Currently, the company’s  is just  of its book value. By comparison, Caterpillar’s (NYSE:) is  of its book value. In October, I recommended CMI stock as one of “ Regardless of Q3 Earnings.” Although the maker of gas-powered generators doesn’t expect much sales growth in 2019, its EBITDA margin is likely to be 16.5% or more. As a result, you can be sure that it will have plenty of cash in the future to pay its generous dividend.

	Southwest Airlines (NYSE:), which  and tends to rely on Boeing (NYSE:) aircraft for its fleet, beat its peers over the past year by 795 basis points and 376 basis points over the past five years. There’s no question things are really dicey in the airline industry right now but Southwest is in the kind of financial position to ride it out.In April 2018, I recommended Southwest stock over Delta Airlines (NYSE:) because it’s  in tough economic times. While a recession in 2020 doesn’t look likely, I don’t see how any of the airline stocks hold a candle to Southwest. It ought to be Warren Buffett’s , but it’s not. For Berkshire fans, that’s a shame.

	Jack Ma co-founded Alibaba Group (NYSE:) in 1999. It wasn’t easy getting China’s largest e-commerce company up and running. Somehow, the former teacher managed to push through. Today, Ma is the wealthiest person in China, worth an estimated . He’s been so successful — Alibaba’s 2019 revenues were  with $12 billion in net income and $15.6 billion in free cash flow — that he has stepped away from the business to focus all his efforts on his . Only 55, Ma has lots of causes to keep himself busy these days.Meanwhile, the company continues to expand into various businesses outside its e-commerce core. These include financial services and the cloud. And by no means are these businesses dalliances.    “Alibaba first started its move into fintech in 2004 with the launch of AliPay. What started out as a simple way to secure online payments for Alibaba platform users has now expanded to become part of Ant Financial, the financial branch of Alibaba and the key to ,” InvestorPlace contributor Chris Markoch wrote last month.

	Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergei Brin announced Dec. 3 that they were stepping down from their executive positions at Alphabet (NASDAQ:, NASDAQ:), the holding company for its search engine business as well as all the other bets it’s made over the past few years. , Google Fiber, Verily, Sidewalk Labs, and Calico are but a few. Now that Google CEO Sundar Pichai is taking over as Alphabet CEO, some see the changing of the guard as an opportunity for Alphabet to get out of some of the expensive so-called “moonshots” it has been working on the past few years. Money-losing experiments, to boot. Google stock rose 2% on the news Page and Brin were passing the baton. “The question is, will they continue to  on these other bets? Under the new leadership, are they going to take a harder look at all of these businesses and start to try to focus more on ones that provide growth,” said Daniel Morgan, a portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company, which owns Alphabet shares worth over $100-million. “That would add extra excitement about the stock.”Whether Pichai decides to unload some of the moonshots or not, Google still generates all of its  in annual free cash flow from its advertising revenues. That’s not going to change. As long as it remains a leader in digital advertising, its stock remains worth owning for the next half-decade.   At the time of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.The post  appeared first on .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@10 Stocks With Little or No Debt to Own for the Next 50 Years @2020-03-19@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/10-stocks-with-little-or-no-debt-to-own-for-the-next-50-years-2020-03-19

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer period and instructions will be given at that time.

This is the AT&T operator. We do not hear any sound. -- I'm sorry. -- Can you hear us? -- Can you hear us now?Yes. -- Great. -- Okay, please let's continue. -- Okay, we'll get going here. So good evening and thank you for joining us in CoStar Group's fourth quarter and 2019 year-end earnings call. I'm very pleased that CoStar continued to deliver outstanding growth throughout 2019.CoStar Group's total revenue grew 17% to $1.4 billion for 2019, adding $200 million of revenue in the full year. We generate strong double digit growth across all our primary businesses with multi-family leading the way with 21% year-over-year growth. Fourth quarter revenue of $375 million was up 19% over the fourth quarter of 2018. The fourth quarter includes results from STR for the first time, which contributed $9 million of revenue since our late October 2019 close.Net income for the year was $315 million, an increase of 32% over full year net income of 2018. Our adjusted EBITDA crossed over the $0.5 billion mark this year and reached $507 million, an increase of 21% over the full year of 2018 with adjusted EBITDA margins improving to 36%, a 110 basis points increase over adjusted EBITDA margins in 2018. If you like nice round numbers that you can remember long after the call, our fourth quarter revenue annualized was $1.5 billion and our fourth quarter EBITDA was $500 million or $500 million on $1.5 billion growing.We grew our earnings and profitability during the year, while continuing to invest for future growth. In 2019, we increased the size of our CoStar field sales force by 20% and added 40 new mid-market sales positions in Richmond for multi-family. We increased the level of spending in digital marketing later in the year to grow our traffic and the lead flow of Apartments.com. Our product teams completed new signature ad packages in LoopNet, as well as the new digital tools for small property owners in multifamily, both of which we start selling in the fourth quarter.The highlight metrics for 2019 and operations for CoStar Group were impressive. Users viewed 6.3 billion pages on Apartments.com, commercial real-estate professionals conducted 40 million searches on CoStar, potential tenants visited LoopNet 131 million times, our clients, our researchers and software teams added 2 billion pieces of new content to our database in 2019. Looking ahead to 2020, we continue to invest in future growth. We're focused on the huge opportunity in the Apartments marketplaces, as well as LoopNet and the massive commercial real-estate market place. We believe the addressable market for residential rental and commercial real-estate marketing alone is over 10 billion and we have a unique opportunity for growth in the early stages in these marketplaces.We are also focused on commercial real-estate hospitality, information, analytics and software services. In 2020, we're also embracing and accelerating our international growth opportunity. We had an excellent sales year in 2019, adding nearly 210 million of net new bookings for the year, an increase of 24% over 2018. In the fourth quarter alone, we added 52 million of net new bookings. Our efforts to build online marketplaces and commercial real-estate are certainly paying off with almost 62% of our sales in 2019 coming from Apartments.com, LoopNet and our other market places, a trend we can expect to continue into 2020.Our Apartments.com sales team had a remarkable year in 2019. Following the integration of the ForRent acquisition in 2018, the team was at full strength and focused on growing throughout 2019. As a result, we ended the year with net new bookings, up over 45%. Congratulations to Paige Forrest and the entire Apartments team on a great year.The fourth quarter was a particularly impressive sales quarter for LoopNet. Historically, the last quarter of the year has been the lowest seasonal quarter for share readvertising. In fact when we acquired LoopNet, the revenues typically fell in the fourth quarter. While today, revenues typically grow in the fourth quarter, over the past five years fourth quarter LoopNet bookings have dropped sequentially, an average of 43% for the third quarter bookings levels. That was certainly not the case this year. As part of our rebuild and launch of the LoopNet signature ad products, we rolled out a sales contest for the fourth quarter that resulted in LoopNet bookings growing 80% over the third quarter of 2019 LoopNet sales. LoopNet signature ads grew almost 500% over the same quarter the previous year. Obviously, this is an outstanding result. I believe this is only the beginning of the LoopNet growth opportunity ahead. Our LoopNet market place had the strongest year yet in 2019 and we expect LoopNet to be a significant contributor to our growth in 2020. LoopNet revenue was $150 million in 2019, growing 18% over full year 2018, with fourth quarter revenue growth reaching 20%. Our strategy of rebuilding and launching LoopNet as a pure online marketplace is working. According to Google Analytics, average monthly unique visitors to LoopNet network reached 6.1 million in 2019, an increase of 16% over 2018. We believe that LoopNet has approximately 20 times the monthly unique visitors of the second most trafficked sites.In 2019, we redesigned and launched our dramatically improved signature ads for office space for lease. They're similar to the high-end quality ads on Apartments.com. Signature ads sort to the top of the results set are larger than the standard ads and contain much more marketing content than to the standard ads. The signature ads are featured prominently across multiple CoStar Group's CRE marketplaces, information solutions and newsletters. We also retarget LoopNet visitors as they move across the web; it's coming out this quarter. Our signature ad diamond level delivers 24 times more impressions than our basic ad tier. The signature ads on LoopNet present very high quality architectural imagery, including photographs shot by our professional photographers, drone videos and 3D walk-throughs. Our marketing consultants curate and provide rich content for the signature ads. In some, the signature ad features dramatically expand the reach, frequency and brand impact of our clients' property marketing.We're now working on building out similar detailed ad packages for the retail, industrial land, multifamily and investment sales sectors which we will launch across the year. These advertisements provide exceptional value for owners of commercial properties that need to fill vacant space or sell a building. Remember that these buildings and the vacant space in them can be worth millions, hundreds of millions, and even billions of dollars. By using Google Analytics and tracking the IP addresses of end users searching on LoopNet, we can see that many, if not most of the largest companies across the US are regularly searching for space on LoopNet and then signing multi-million leases with our clients. For example, we can see users originating from Amazon IP addresses and from IP addresses of similar mega companies viewing properties on LoopNet and then in the ensuing months we see them purchase or lease those properties. In some cases, we see major tenants giving a property on LoopNet months before their tenant-rep brokers first view the property. That suggested the tenant is finding the property first and sharing it with their broker. This should not surprise anyone, because that's exactly how the process now works today in residential real-estate.We believe that this is a seismic shift in how owners effectively market commercial properties. An owner now needs an effective strategy to market their property directly to the tenant. Traditionally or historically in commercial real-estate, the broker built a short list of potential properties for a major tenant to consider, and then closely accompanied that tenant on that all so important tour of those perspective properties. Owners marketing efforts have focused on making sure they made that brokers shortlist. They spend billions each year to accomplish that. Now it appears tenants are building their own shortlist online by themselves on sites like LoopNet and the first tour of the property occurs virtually online on LoopNet. In many cases the tenant will spend dramatically more time exploring the property virtually online than they will spend physically touring it before they sign a lease. To be clear, tenants will continue to use brokers to represent them, but the marketing realities are shifting dramatically. These are huge industry changes. We have thousands of examples, suggesting that tenants now find their space on LoopNet. We saw Facebook IPs viewing six new locations repeatedly on LoopNet and then Facebook later signed an estimated 670 million lease deals on those properties. Similarly, PwC executed seven lease deals in properties they viewed on LoopNet with a value of approximately $145 million. And there are many other examples, including a single ad on LoopNet for an office business park in Pennsylvania where we can see six of its new tenants viewed the properties on LoopNet first before they signed a lease.We're investing a lot of effort into training our sales team on the best way to communicate the value of marketing on LoopNet. It's often a good idea to run a contest to get a sales force's attention. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we ran a LoopNet sales contest that delivered very strong results. Our field sales force shortly thereafter sold 5 times the number of signature ads value in Q4 than they did in the quarter prior year. A year ago our sales team was focused on selling relatively lower cost LoopNet listing plans to brokers. Now they're shifting their focus to selling much more significant placements to the owners of the properties who have so much more to win from a successful lease. When we acquired LoopNet, the marketing potential of LoopNet was an afterthought and non-differentiated ads were often given away for free or sold to brokers for as little as a few dollars a month. I believe the average ad was about $14 a month back in 2011. We still sell very affordable and effective basic ads to brokers, but with the very valuable signature ads, the average price point is averaging almost $3000 per month. To preserve the value and impact of a diamond or platinum signature ad, we capped the inventory to three or 10 respectively per sub-market. While this preserves their value, it also creates scarcity. As a result, we're seeing some owners make some significant, but we would argue very wise investments in the signature ads in high profile sub-markets for important buildings.The Durst Organization owns and manages a fantastic 750,000 square foot office property in the Times Square sub-market New York. They are currently marketing 470,000 square feet of really nice space there. They know that major tenants are searching for their next spare on LoopNet and that top brokers search for their tenant space on CoStar. Durst wants to make sure that they have the biggest, most prominent presence on the Internet for the best building in Times Square. They locked in one of three diamond ad slots in Times Square for $11,000 a month on a six month agreement. They've locked in a number of other slots for other great properties at similar price points. You have to stop and think about that, that price point is almost 1,000 times the old price point for lower quality, undifferentiated ads. But I would argue Durst knows exactly the value of effective leasing. Leasing that space on a 10-year deal could generate $300 million to $400 million of revenue for Durst. Would you invest $66,000 for an effective marketing solution that could bring you a $400 million deal.The price points we're seeing for commercial office space ads on LoopNet are now thousands of dollars above the price points we achieved on Apartments.com; that makes sense. Major apartment development and lease may sign leases with the value of $10 million whereas a major commercial lease is worth hundreds of millions. There is a company based in Australia that we admire called REA Group that provides a commercial property market place there. Their commercial and developer depths on subscriptions generated AUD134 million in 2019. I believe that's basically an equivalent of an Australian LoopNet. The US economy is approximately 15 times larger than Australia's. If you scale the REA commercial business pro rate, it implies a $1.3 billion addressable size of market in the US for LoopNet. Overall, we believe we are seeing clear evidence that LoopNet represents a multi-million growth opportunity.Our Apartments business delivered a stellar year, achieving 21% revenue growth in 2019, making this the fifth consecutive year of revenue growth over 20%. According to comScore, our apartments.com network had almost 650 million visits in 2019, a 22% increase over visits in '18. We averaged over 20 million monthly unique visitors to our sites in '19, an increase of 15%. During the second half of the year, Apartments.com moved ahead of the seller rentals and monthly unique visitors and continues to attract more visitors than Trulia rentals, rent.com, HotPads, Apartment List, StreetEasy, Apartment Guide, Zumper, RENTCafe, ApartmentRating's, Rentals.com and many others that compete for renters in this space. When we acquired Apartments.com in 2014, they and the industry were largely focused on selling advertising to large apartment communities with more than 120 units. That was a huge loss, because approximately 65% of renters were rents in properties that are in buildings with less than 120 units. The industry was missing 65% of the potential market. That strategy was an artifact of the old print world where your volume of ads were limited by the maximum number of pages glue could hold together in a book. Today Apartments.com does not rely on glue, so we focus on selling marketing services to all sizes of rental properties.There's three major ways in which we're doing this. First, we're building tools that enable an owner of a single rental or small apartment to buy via e-commerce ad placements and comprehensive digital leasing tools. Second, we're building a large Richmond based sales team focused on selling into the mid-market apartment opportunity and single rental opportunity. And finally, we are accelerating our investment in apartments marketing to lift awareness for Apartments.com across all of these segments, single, rental, mid-market and large.In the fourth quarter of 2019, we began beta testing our online renter tools, which are aimed at facilitating and improving the customer and landlord experience for leasing smaller apartment buildings and rental homes. Our new online leasing tools give landlords the ability to create a listing, perform credit and background checks, create an exchange and sign leases and provide a platform for deposits and rental payments. These tools are offered free to landlords, independent owners as a way to drive consumer adoption and build a national network for digital leasing. In addition, we offer the option to purchase an ad on Apartments.com, which provides better placement and twice the leads as a free basic listing does. We launched a full national roll-out on January 15, 2020. The uptake has been very encouraging. So far, we already have nearly 17,000 active users of the digital tools. 2,000 landlords have purchased ads via E-commerce and over 2,000 potential renters have completed online applications. This is excellent adoption when you consider that we've yet to launch in any of our news supporting advertising campaign. I'm really pleased with the headway we're making and look forward to keeping you posted on our progress throughout the year.Our Apartment field sales force is an excellent one, but is nowhere near large enough to sell into millions of rental units in properties that are smaller than 100 units. The current sales force is doing an excellent work generating huge revenue growth in the 100 unit plus world and we want them to keep doing that. We've just launched the mid-market sales team in Richmond with 40 sales people. They are prospecting and selling into communities that are small, mid-sized or large in contrast to the field sales teams that are selling into huge communities. In the first few months, this new sales team is doubling their sales production each month. At this point, 84% of the team has achieved their first sales and 100% of the 1st October class is now selling. Top producer Morgan Rogers delivered 6,000 of net new monthly sales last month, which is more than 90% that the field sales team was able to achieve in January. In total, the group has sold 200 property ads. The vast majority of those properties they've sold were into properties with less than 50 units. Once we have the vast majority of this mid-market groups selling at their full potential, we plan to grow the team indefinitely, so long as it remains a clear positive ROI.Back in October we announced that we'll be stepping-up our Apartments.com marketing spend by an incremental $100 million to a spend level of approximately $250 million in 2020. Over the past few months, our team RPA and Jeff Goldblum have been working hard to build our 2020 marketing program. The '20 campaign will clearly be our biggest ever. Our plan is to deliver 10 billion impressions and 800 million renter visits, a significant increase over the 6 billion impressions and 650 million renter visits we generated in 2019. The expanded campaign is expected to drive our unaided brand awareness higher over the long-term. We currently fluctuate in the low 30% range for unaided awareness when our media campaigns are running. Our goal is to reach over 40% unaided awareness this year and eventually 50% as we continue beyond 2020.Once again, we have Brad Bellflower, inventor of the Apartminternet played by Jeff Goldblum leading our Apartments.com campaign. We plan to double the investment in TV, launching in mid-March and stay on the air through November, reaching 95% of households with more frequency than ever. We rent 10,000 TV spots in '19 and we plan to run 20,000 spots in 2020. We will air in Prime Time, Premieres, Finale's and top rated sports events, including the Summer Olympics and the NFL. We will focus again on reaching the cord cutter audience with 3 times the video on-demand through YouTube, Hulu and other streaming services.This year we have selected 37 of the top local apartment markets to provide increased local presence media and focus. These are the markets with the most growth opportunity for Apartments.com. We plan to increase our exposure in these key markets by 50% and include custom market specific TV versions of our advertisements. We will create our biggest digital presence targeting 2 billion impressions through display advertising and retargeting an increased presence on social media, making sure we're there whenever renters are online. Our marketing message for the first half of the year will focus great lengths on apartments -- we'll be looking at the great lengths that Apartments.com goes to, to make sure that renters will find their greatest number of rental options on Apartments.com.With 40 million people having found their next place on apartments.com, the campaign establishes Apartments.com as the most popular site for renting an apartment. Beginning in July, we'll launch the second half of our 2020 campaign, which will be focused on our new online renter applications tools, which we rolled out nationwide in January. The message is one of simplicity, that you can now apply for a new home with a single click. In one commercial, a man is devastated because the love of his life has just dumped him and told him to move out. A tear rolls down his cheek and lands on his iPhone hitting the rent-now button on Apartments.com. With the tear driven click, he rents the perfect apartment as he moves in he finds the next real love of his life. Isn't life grand?In 2020, we expect to invest $110 million to $115 million in paid search, approximately twice the run rate of the spend in '19. We are focusing on specific neighborhoods and appearing 95% of time in the top positions in Google searches. We've seen the benefit this has brought us in terms of increased traffic share over the past few months of '19. We intend to maintain this spend over the year. This magnitude of investment to keywords is efficient for three reasons. First, with our massive branding campaign, renters recognize Apartments.com and are more likely to click on it driving our cost per click down comparatively. Secondly, we currently appear in the number one SEO position on 20,000 important apartment keywords 90% of the time. When renters see us in both top organic and top page placement, we believe they recognize us as an authority, resulting in 4 times not 2 times, the clicks you would expect from two placements. Finally, we have a large number of apartment advertisers who are effectively pulling their resources through Apartments.com in order to afford the very expensive best keywords on Google.Two weeks ago we announced our agreement to acquire RentPath from Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The transaction is subject to the customary closing conditions, regulatory review, as well as approval by the bankruptcy at court. We are in the early days of the process, which could last anywhere from three months to 12 months. I want to emphasize that we believe our acquisition of the RentPath business, especially our ability to invest in their product and marketing represents the best way forward for all stakeholders. As we discussed earlier, given its crippling debt burden, RentPath was simply not able to buy enough traffic from Google or to build a consumer marketing brand to give their sites a recognizable brand.Apartments.com, RentPath and Zillow all relied to one degree or another on Google to drive traffic to their websites. The price of many popular apartment rental key words or SEM has soared over the past two years, climbing several hundred percent. For example, in '18, the keyword for Downtown Los Angeles apartments could be purchased for $0.42. By 2020, it's reached $7.56 for an increase of 714%. Apartments.com has enough budget resources, continuing to invest in these keywords and spread the cost out across a large customer base. By contrast, RentPath was priced out and resorted to purchasing a volume of keywords such as apartments for rent under $500 in Los Angeles. Out of 33,000 apartments for rent in LA, the other one I found for under $500 was an upper bunk in a group house in South Central LA. That is not the market institutional apartment advertisers are trying to reach with their dollar. In addition, RentPath's number one supplier Google is also competing directly against them for the same business.In contrast, we believe that synergies, efficiencies and scale we could gain from the combination will make it possible to continue to sustain more advertising and marketing to build more brand awareness and in turn generate an increased flow of quality leads for all of our customers. It's important to building enough scale, that we can build more direct traffic to our sites that are not subject to Google price increases. From where we stand today, the proposed timeline is not changed versus two weeks ago and we look forward to being able to welcome the RentPath websites and their team to CoStar before the end of 2020. RentPath has an excellent field sales team led by Arlene Mayfield. They've earned our respect as a very capable group of competitors with great relationships in the industry. As we grow our sales force to meet the opportunities we have in LoopNet, the Apartments, BizBuySell, LandsofAmerica and other marketplaces, we look forward to joining with them and the rest of the RentPath team as colleagues.This quarter we released a great new feature in CoStar that makes public record data on 33 million properties accessible through CoStar. This enables our users to see raw data on virtually every commercially zoned parcel in the US. They can search the public record data directly and see the record ownership, loan, valuation, data zoning and more. In total there are 150 attributes. The public record date is connected to the CoStar data on the same properties, making it convenient to cross reference the information. In the second quarter, we plan to add the ability to search lenders and their loan activity. In the third quarter, we'll integrate state corporation data to allow users to research who the people are behind the companies that own these properties. In the fourth quarter we'll have permit, planning, and in lean searches. This will allow users to monitor who is building the new properties, who is renovating and which companies are moving into new facilities or expanding. These features will be provided to our customers at no extra charge in order to enhance the value of our products, extend the reach of CoStar to more customers and renew more business.Since closing the acquisition of STR in October, I'm more positive than ever that STR and CoStar together can create significant value for all partnered participants in the hospitality sector and in the part of commercial real-estate that focuses on hospitality. We've had an overwhelmingly positive reaction from customers of both STR and CoStar. The STR customers recognize the technology and integrate product expertise that CoStar can bring and the CoStar multi-family customers would love to see STR create bench-marking products for the apartment industry. In addition, brokers, developers, lenders, appraisers and local government are excited about having access to high quality hospitality statistics within CoStar. It's great to see such a positive response, which further confirms our rationale for combining these two businesses.I'm also delighted by the enthusiasm and dedication of the STR team. Amanda Hite, CEO of STR told me recently that the reaction of her staff has been ecstatic and that they are all very confident about their future in the CoStar family. We are ecstatic as well. Combine the data and technology of STR with the data analytics and software from CoStar is one of our biggest development projects and priorities for 2020. We're working hard on completing the technology integration by the end of 2020, which will position us to focus on growing the combined business, which we believe is a potential $500 million addressable market, as outlined when we announced the acquisition four months ago.Finally, I'll conclude by reviewing where we stand in the commercial real-estate economy. Total investment to commercial and multi-family real-estate set a new record in '19, topping 650 billion for the first time. Fundamentals remain very healthy as well, with vacancy rates near record lows with limited construction. Despite the lack of space available though, leasing activity continues to rise and all property types posted rent gains for a 10th consecutive year, although the pace of rent gains has slowed slightly.In the multi-family sector elevated supply continues to meet with strong demand, both from renters and investors. The sector set a new record with nearly $190 billion investments in 2019 and the multi-family vacancy rate held steady at just above 6%. Many of these renters would likely have been home buyers in another time. Today, those single family home construction remains at very low levels relative to population, and urban apartment development has largely replaced the suburban subdivision as the new model of American housing. At present, we're tracking about 630,000 new apartment units under construction. We believe that most of these units, as well as the 330,000 units that delivered last year will be advertised on Apartments.com.In the office sector, large tech occupiers continue the lease large blocks of space despite single digit vacancy rates and limited new supply. However, the developments under way is largely concentrated in markets long considered to be supply constrained like New York, San Francisco, Boston, and Washington DC. In these markets, new office developments have fundamentally shifted the geography of office demand with major tenants leaving aging space and traditional CBDs for new space in Hudson Yards, the Boston Seaport, South of Market in San Francisco, and the Capital River front to say nothing of National Landing in Washington, DC.In the industrial sector, demand slowed in '19, but mostly because so little space is currently available. The vacancy rates rose over the year, but to just 5%, which is extremely low. Despite the ultra-low vacancies, leasing actually picked up, anticipating the coming wave of supply. Rent growth slowed, but at 5% it's still really strong, and investments set a new record at more than $120 billion.In the retail sector, gloomy headlines obscure the reality that retail vacancy rates are at historic lows and rents are rising in most markets. The wave of urban apartment development in markets large and small has left many downtown areas under retailed, relative to growing populations and in need of grocery stores and pharmacies to say nothing of restaurants and bars. The little supply is under way and some markets are even seeing a net reduction space as the front big boxes or malls are repurposed.Economic conditions support ongoing commercial and multi-family real-estate activity at similar levels. Economic uncertainty, particularly around trade, the coronavirus, and the 2020 election have brought interest rates back to historic lows, supporting investment real-estate even at very low cap rates, and ongoing economic growth and consistent job gains are driving demand for physical space. CoStar's Group products and services have become important tools for owners, managers and developers and investors to make quality choices and realize successful outcomes in any economic environment. Clearly, the coronavirus is becoming a factor in our economy. As a company, we're making preparations in the event of the outbreak impacts in areas where we have significant operations. Fortunately, we do not have factory floors, nor do we have to gather clients physically to provide our services. As we've already done in China, we're planning to disperse operations to work-at-home status if outbreaks occur in cities where we operate in.Before I hand it over to Scott, who is less concerned about that, I would like to acknowledge that our outstanding 2019 results would not have been possible without the hard work and dedication of all of our awesome CoStar team members. No matter where you are around the world or what part of the business you support, I'm very proud of the people that make CoStar a great place to work.I will now turn the call over to our metrics obsessed CFO, Scott Wheeler. -- Thank you, Andy. Give me just a second. Before I take the microphone, I must disinfect it with this little wipe which I have here to display my concern of the virus and other issues.All right. We had a great year in 2019. We reached $1.4 billion in revenue, exceeded $500 million in adjusted EBITDA and delivered over $200 million of net new bookings for the year. In addition, we acquired STR and off-campus partners in 2019 and we recently announced an agreement to acquire RentPath. It's great to see that we continue our very successful strategy of both double digit organic growth, coupled with highly synergistic acquisition programs. We certainly don't see either of these growth strategies slowing down any time soon.Our fourth quarter 2019 revenue was $375 million, growing 19% year-over-year and coming at $9 million above the high-end of our guidance range. Revenue growth in the fourth quarter excluding STR was 16% year-over-year. STR contributed $9 million in revenue in the fourth quarter, which exceeded the $3 million to $4 million of STR revenue expected. This is primarily the result of favorable outcomes from the deferred revenue purchase accounting adjustments. We've included the revenue from STR as part of our information services revenue sector.Looking at our revenue performance by services, CoStar Suite revenue growth was 13% for the full year of 2019 as expected and 14% in the fourth quarter of 2019 versus the fourth quarter of 2018. As we head into 2020, we anticipate CoStar Suite revenue growth will moderate somewhat as we have shifted the focus of our sales teams to ramp-up sales of LoopNet signature ad that Andy mentioned. The revenue growth rate for CoStar Suite in 2020 is expected to be approximately 11%.As Andy discussed, it's important that our field sales team learns how to sell high value ad packages directly to owners, even if it comes with a slight substitution effect in the near term on the CoStar side of the business. Over-time, we believe the relationships that the sales team builds now selling LoopNet to owners will pay off in sales of CoStar Suite subscriptions to those very same owners in the future. On a combined basis, looking at CoStar Suite and LoopNet together, the incremental LoopNet revenue in 2020 is expected to more than offset the anticipated slower revenue growth in CoStar Suite.Revenue in information services for the full year of 2019 grew 31% to $88 million. Excluding STR, the full year growth rate was 17% with CoStar Real Estate Manager growing 34% year-over-year. Revenue and information services for the fourth quarter of 2019 grew 52% versus the fourth quarter of 2018, which translates to around 3% revenue growth in the fourth quarter excluding STR. We expect reported revenue from information services to grow at a rate of 60% to 64% in 2020 with STR expected to contribute approximately $61 million to $63 million in revenue in 2020.Multifamily revenue growth for the full year 2019 remained strong at 21% versus 2018 and fourth quarter 2019 grew 20% over the fourth quarter 2018. Our multifamily revenue growth is split between an 11% increase in volume of properties advertising on the network and a 10% increase in average revenue per property. For the fourth quarter 2019 our average revenue per property reached $800 as our customers continued to buy higher value advertising packages for increased lead performance. We did not increase list prices for any of our multifamily advertising in 2019.Looking forward, we expect multifamily revenue growth to continue at approximately 20% for the full year of 2020. Our forecast assumes continued strong growth from our field sales team, selling into larger communities, with a growing contribution throughout the year from our mid-market sales teams. We assume minimal revenue contribution from smaller independent owners using our digital tools in 2020 as we focus on landlord adoption of these digital tools so we can build scale.Commercial property and land revenue grew 17% year-over-year for the full year of 2019 and 18% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Our LoopNet marketplace represents approximately 75% of the revenue in the commercial property and land products sector. As we continue to reposition LoopNet as a premium advertising solution to property owners, we're seeing growth rate accelerate. In the fourth quarter of 2019 LoopNet advertising revenues grew 20%, which is double the rate that LoopNet revenue was growing in mid-2018. For 2020 we expect growth rates for LoopNet to move up over 25% in the second half of the year. Commercial property and land sector is expected to deliver approximately 22% revenue growth for the full year 2020.Looking at our gross margins, we came in at 79% for 2019, up almost 2% versus 2018. This is a result of our very strong cost leverage. Our gross margin came in at 80% in the fourth quarter 2019, in-line with the margin we achieved in the third quarter of 2019. We expect our overall gross margins to move up to 81% in 2020.Net income for the full year of 2019 was $315 million, a 32% increase compared to the prior year. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $88 million, an increase of 5% or $4 million compared to Q4 2018. Our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 23%, while our effective tax rate for the full year of 2019 was 19%.Adjusted EBITDA for the full year of 2019 was $507 million, a 21% increase compared to adjusted EBITDA of $418 million for the full year of 2018. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 36% increased 110 basis points in 2019, compared to 2018. I'm pleased with our ability to increase profitability for the year and at the same time increase investments in our new product developments and the apartment search marketing that we did in the second half of 2019.Our fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of $142 million was approximately $7 million above the top end of our guidance range. Favorable revenue of $5 million from STR related to purchase accounting and other revenue favorabilities contributed to the positive variance.Non-GAAP net income for the full year of 2019 was $373 million or $10.19 per diluted share, above the high point of our guidance by $0.17 and an increase of 23% compared to full year 2018. Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter 2019 increased to $103 million or $2.82 per diluted share. We received an insurance settlement of approximately $11 million related to the Xceligent litigation in the fourth quarter of 2019, which we recorded in other non-operating income. We adjusted this settlement gain out of the non-GAAP net income.Non net GAAP net income also includes adjustments for stock based compensation and STR acquisition related expenses. Non GAAP net income for the fourth quarter assumes a tax rate of 25%, which does not include discrete items such as the impact of share based payment transactions.Our cash investment balances were approximately $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2019, which is almost identical to our cash balance at the end of 2018. We generated a little over $450 million in cash from operations this year and then we plunked it all down to by STR, it was a great way to use cash I think.Now, let's take a look at some performance metrics for the quarter, none of which include any performance metrics for STR, which we'll add later in this year. At the end of the fourth quarter of 2019 our sales force totaled approximately 844 people, up about 24 people from the third quarter of 2019, and up over 100 people from the fourth quarter of 2018. The sales force growth in Q4 was primarily in our multifamily mid-market sales teams. We expect to ramp up headcount in this team toward the target of 100 people later in 2020.We ended the year with approximately 275 sales people in our CoStar LoopNet sales team, an increase of 20% for the year, but a bit short of our goal to grow the team by 30% during the year. We expect to reach approximately 300 field sales reps in this team sometime in the second quarter of 2020, hopefully earlier rather than later.The renewal rate on annual contracts for the fourth quarter of 2019 was in-line with the rate achieved in the third quarter of 2019 at 90%. Renewal rate for the quarter for customers who've been subscribers for five years or longer was 95%, in-line with the renewal rate of 95% in the third quarter of 2019. Finally, subscription revenue on annual contracts accounts for 83% of our revenue in the fourth quarter, up approximately 1 point compared to Q4 last year.I'll now discuss our outlook for the full year and the first quarter of 2020. To be clear, our outlook does not include the impact of the proposed RentPath acquisition. However, we've included approximately $7 million of legal and other professional fees associated with the pending transaction. It included these costs in the non-GAAP adjustments to EBITDA and net income.I'll begin with the outlook for STR. As we've said previously, the business exited 2019 at a revenue run rate in the low $60 million range. We will lose a few million dollars of GAAP revenue in the initial quarters due to purchase accounting adjustments. For 2020, we expect that STR will contribute approximately $14 million in revenue in the first quarter of 2020 and approximately $60 million to $63 million in revenue for the full year.The purchase accounting impacts to revenue and EBITDA primarily impact the fourth quarter 2019 and the first two quarters of 2020. We expect EBITDA for STR to be between negative $7 million to negative $9 million for 2020, which includes significant retention bonuses paid by the seller, along with other acquisition related costs. After adjusting for these costs and other typical items like stock compensation, we expect adjusted EBIDTDA for STR of between $7 million to $9 million for the year.STR adjusted EBITDA is expected be roughly breakeven in the first half of the year and turning positive beginning in the third quarter, after we move past those purchase accounting adjustments. These estimated impacts to revenue and adjusted EBITDA from the acquisition of STR are included in the following consolidated outlook for 2020.We expect revenue in the range of $1.65 billion to $1.665 billion for the full year of 2020. This implies an annual growth rate of 18% to 19% over 2019. Excluding STR, we expect revenue growth rate of approximately 15% for the full year of 2019.We expect revenue for the first quarter of 2020 in the range of $387 million to $392 million. This represents approximately 18% to 19% growth compared to the first quarter of last year, and approximately 14% to 15% growth excluding the first quarter revenue contributions from STR. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of $520 million to $530 million for the full year of 2020, representing 3% to 4% growth versus the first full year of 2019.As we discussed on our third quarter results call this past October, we plan to increase our marketing spend for multifamily by approximately $100 million in 2020, bringing our total multifamily marketing budget up to approximately $250 million. Excluding the impact of STR which I just discussed, our organic adjusted EBITDA margin for 2020 is expected to be approximately 32%, down 400 basis points compared to 2019 as we discussed back in the October conference call.Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2020 is expected to be between $115 million to $120 million. We expect second quarter adjusted EBITDA to decline from the first quarter as we've seen in the past years, as the department's media campaign ramps up during the peak rental season with significant increases in adjusted EBITDA and margins in the third and fourth quarter. We anticipate our adjusted EBITDA margin for the fourth quarter of 2020 will be at or above the 38% adjusted EBITDA margin we achieved in the fourth quarter of 2019.In terms of earnings, we expect full year non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $10.20 to $10.40 based on 36.8 million shares. For the first quarter of 2020 we expect non-GAAP net income per diluted share in a range of $2.25 and $2.35 based on 36.7 million shares.In summary, we had a fantastic 2019 and we've set ourselves up for a great performance in 2020 and beyond. We believe that by continuing to invest aggressively in our business in the form of new products, marketing and acquisitions we're positioning the company for years of strong growth and attractive EBITDA margins.As I've said many times, our margin trajectory may vary considerably from year-to-year based on the timing of investments. However, I'm confident we're still on track to reach our long term goals of $3 billion in run rate revenue and 40% plus adjusted EBITDA margins in 2023.Having read all of those numbers, it is time to open up the call now for questions. -- So, we'll now turn over to the operator who will give you instructions for logging on, but we would also ask that you limit your questions to one question per person. If we have time, we'll cycle the queue back around. Operator, you may proceed.Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ryan Tomasello with KBW. Please go ahead. -- Good evening everyone. Congrats on the strong finish to the year. I wanted to ask about apartments.com. You know, clearly the platform continues to see strong momentum and it seems that the push into the middle market and the low end of the market holds promise, but I was hoping Andy that you can give us some color on your thoughts around how you frame the risk of competitive pressures in the market for lead generation. I think on the RentPath call you alluded to the position that Google has in that market in controlling renter traffic. So I was wondering if you see the risk of them increasing their stake in this market as a threat similar to what they've done in the online travel booking world? -- Sure. So certainly Google has a full position on controlling renter flow, the majority of renter flow. And then in the online travel world the OTA's like Bookings.com or Expedia has spent -- invested large sums of money to build direct traffic that are independent of Google intermediation. And frankly, while they have -- those hotel OTA's have taken a bit of a hit, they still have outstanding margins and are very profitable businesses.So we think that Google is a competitive factor there, growing revenue in the apartment space. People do make a decision between spending the money directly with Google or spending the money with apartments.com, but we believe we offer a number of advantages, have some strong client loyalty and we will continue to grow and thrive. And while we look at Google as providing a competitive element to the company, we also look at them as a very important partner. And we believe that our investments into Google keywords and other initiatives with them has been very fruitful. So nothing in life is without some risk, but we feel comfortable with it.Our next question comes from Sterling Auty with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. -- Hey, thanks. Hi guys, this Jackson Ader on for Sterling tonight. -- Hello, Jackson. -- My question is on the middle market sales. Now that that sales team is kind of up and running, how should we or how are you guys thinking about the unit economics for that particular segment? -- I believe it's running about an average of $320 per unit, something like that. -- That was definitely in the Silver Ads and overall it's about $440 per unit of what we sold so far and the largest mix of ads as we mentioned was in the silver level within some gold segments and platinum and diamonds then sold by the team. -- But don't get excited, because there's only tens of millions of opportunities down there in that segment.Our next question comes from Stephen Sheldon with William Blair. Please go ahead. -- Hi, thanks. And that was a lot of detail. Andy, there was a brief comment in your prepared remarks that you plan to accelerate international growth this year, so I wanted to get some more detail on that. I know you've been gathering data in the UK, I think Spain, Germany and France and have Realla in the UK that you've talked about using to gather public data and parts of Europe, but I guess first, do you have an update of scale internationally to more meaningfully monetize it at this point? And second, is the plan here to accelerate, I guess, data gathering maybe with STR's international footprint in EMEA and APAC. -- Yes, so STR does have a really strong international footprint leading with their leadership team then for HVAC and the 9Vietnam. It's a strong group, it's a great foundation to grow in.What we're thinking about in 2020, I do not believe we'll have a huge negative financial impact to drag on earnings or a material one. What it's really about is acknowledging the fact that we now have 500 staff and tens of thousands of users outside of the United States and multiple -- and dozens of different countries. I think we have users in probably 60, 70 some countries at this point.And so a lot of it is how we're thinking about providing the product and the service and delivering it. So as we pull STR and CoStar together, it's going to be important that both of those platforms support users in dozens of countries. We want to continue the work we began with apartments.com and make all of our products polyglot, ideally supporting both the English language and the local language in those products.We also want to make the movement between viewing data in various countries as seamless as possible. So today a user in London or a user in Madrid may look at our product as being very local to that town, and we believe there would be value in just opening up that system. If they are subscribing to their local country, we would let them see the international network.So that would be a pretty big change when an investment broker in London can see and compare a property in London or Edinburgh to a property in Toronto or Vancouver or New Mexico or Madrid. And so, that will be the first big change and we think it will have a pretty positive impact. That's the way Bloomberg has segmented their products. If you are a Bloomberg client you can see all over the world.We want to go that way, so people don't evaluate us as a single city player anywhere and that they can work in their native language. That's particularly valuable in investment sales area and in the analytics area where we think we can provide a lot of value.Our next question comes from Mario Cortellacci with Jefferies. Please go ahead. -- Hi. Thanks for the time. Because you're shifting the sales force focus from going from CoStar Suite over to LoopNet, could you just update us on how many CoStar customers are using LoopNet and vice versa? Or maybe just give us a little more a quick update on how much runway still exists there? -- So in particular you are talking about -- let's talking about the runway for both of them. Let's talks about the runway for CoStar and the runway for LoopNet. I plan to live for a very, very, long time and I will not live long enough to ever see the end of runway for either CoStar or LoopNet. So we just have -- I'm back in the place where I'm feeling like our CoStar sales force is smaller than the opportunity they're selling into, because that CoStar sales forces is a CoStar and a LoopNet sales force.There is very high overlap between the people who we're trying to sell CoStar to and to the people who would be -- would benefit from marketing on a LoopNet. So very, very high overlap both ways. I would think I don't have a hard number on that, but I would believe it's the majority.Now, some of the new particularly valuable customers to us for CoStar -- so an important area for us in CoStar is selling to owners that we are in the early stages of penetrating that opportunity. And they have high value, they pay higher numbers for CoStar, but a great avenue to reach them is to provide a marketing solution for them in LoopNet that's unique, and new and different and allows us to build a relationship with them, and then ultimately to expand that relationship to ride them information analytics.We believe that our offering is incredibly compelling to that owner universe on both sides. So I really mean that. I think it's a huge market. By the time we sell everybody in Czechoslovakia the CoStar subscription, we'll be in like 2320.Our next question is from Brett Huff with Stephens. Please go ahead. -- Good evening, guys. -- Hello, Brett. -- My question is, it seems that the guidance implies organically about 15% growth. And Scott, I think you give us that number. And by my math I think you guys end up the year pretty close to that in '19 give or take. First of all, correct me if I'm off at all, but I think I'm close. My question is, given that the ad spend is going ramp pretty dramatically through the year, why wouldn't we expect to see more revenue growth, especially in the back half of the year than we did, say, in 2019. -- I was asking Fred Saint and Paige Forrest the same question, but go ahead Scott. -- You're correct, we have about a 15% organic growth rate scheduled out for the year. We certainly see solid growth starting into the year. We had a great year selling in apartments at the end of last year. We'll start to get the ramp-up in the marketing stand. It starts in the mid to late March time frame and that's when our broadcast advertising will kick in, and then by the time we hit mid to late summer, we'll start to advertise more around the use of our one-click you know digital rental tools that Andy was mentioning.So we've built in really this year, we've built in a -- the 20% growth is almost entirely from our large directions field sales team in large Apartments. The amount of revenue that we're forecasting right now on the inside sales team is very small and we're really forecasting nothing coming from the value in the market place.So what we're doing this year is really building the brand, building the momentum, building the sales forces and those capabilities in mid-market and building the network in the small property space, with really revenue on to come. We'd love to see those develop rapidly in the first half and really take off in the second, but at this stage we're planning on really taking the large market and decent momentum into the mid-markets, but really much beyond that in our forecast right now.Our next question comes from Pete Christiansen with Citi. Please go ahead. -- Thank you, good evening. Great momentum, guys. I just want to follow-up on that last question. I know you don't provide an outlook for bookings, but how should we think about the cadence throughout the year? Is it something that starts picking up in 2Q, 3Q and just building from there or is it more of a hump? I know there's a lot of moving pieces hiring and all that other stuff, but how should we think about the cadence? -- I think the hiring starts to really advise the cadence, particularly with the combined CoStar LoopNet sales force, and then later in the year your building that mid-market sales force. That's really what's different than maybe what we've seen in the past. Otherwise you know we typically see, second quarter be a very strong sales quarter, third quarter a little bit less than that, and I think like we saw this year, fourth quarter which we just proved in the LoopNet we can actually sell advertising in the fourth quarter which hadn't really been the case in the past.I think both in Apartments and LoopNet you'll see fourth quarter strong quarters, and I think technically it would be our second strongest quarter in Apartments. So the bill will go in the sales headcount in general and then the others regular seasonality patterns will hold up for the year.Our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. -- Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. You're going after the middle-market and I/O subsegments of the multifamily space this year. You talked about launching tools, targeting smaller properties, building out your Richmond sales team and then also accelerating investments into Apartments marketing. Can you discuss how you plan to phase in these initiatives? How much growth acceleration in multi-family in general you expect from these initiatives, and then how your strategy aligns with your proposed acquisition of RentPath? -- Sure, so I don't think anyone ever taught me about phasing, we just do it all at once. Phasing is now. I mean we've been working on the I/O initiative for a long time, so that's been a year and a half or more of software development acquisitions and research. So we ran the first focus groups on that I/O product over two years ago in tweaking and adjusting the business model.Now it's in the markets, its national and we're seeing great traction. We are seeing revenue growth from it, because people are opting in a really good clip to e-commerce purchase of Advertising theses individual properties, buying an add-on on apartments.com. So that will track through the year.We are going to watch it really closely and grow it. I have been out talking to a lot of leaders, the biggest clients in the multifamily industry over the last couple of weeks and I have been surprised by their interest in those leasing tools, and participating in those programs. So we are going to also focus this year on potentially enabling more of our larger customers to put the leasing tools on apartments.com, so people can initiate a lease from apartments.com directly into our clients' back-end system.So that would make that tool work throughout the spectrum. That would have a good impact on revenue throughout the year. One of the highlights for me last week was I was meeting with one of our biggest customers, the President of one our biggest customers, who manages hundreds of thousands of units. He just bought a very small 10 unit property for himself, as a gaag I guess, I don't know, and he said he was shocked at when we got this property. He had no idea how to lease the property. He's got thousands of people for his big business, but he doesn't have the leases on property. So he's actually becoming a client for our online leasing tools for small property owners, which is helpful as we try to move it upstream.So the mid-market, we're being careful there because we're launching a new sales model. It involves bringing on a lot of relatively new people, both at the line sales person and the manager doing something kind of new. So we want to make sure they bring their skill sets fully up to development before we start scaling the group. We want to be careful that it doesn't scale too quickly and that we lose control of quality and then struggle to bring it back.So we're waiting till they're all up in producing at a good level and we've sort of worked out kinks and then we'll begin slow a measured growth through the year there, but that really is a group that could go from 40 to 100, from 40 to 200, from 40 to 300 over time, as it has a good ROI.Then how well that integrates in with what we are doing with the RentPath acquisition? Well, we had a lot of great products here with good growth and we are prospecting unfortunately a relatively -- e-commerce solutions are working at the I/O side, but we are prospecting a relatively small percentage of our target market and with the RentPath acquisition that would bring more sales resources into our organization, for both selling as Apartment industry and then also into the other market places that we're active in.So with the Apartments sales conference, one of things we did is, we began to present training materials on LoopNet in order to familiarize the Apartment sales team with that and we ended up a lot of interest with people who want to move in there. So hopefully we are able to close the RentPath deal and move some more people into the apartment side.The other thing RentPath helps support us with is that it enabled us -- RentPath -- probably the most important thing RentPath does for us is it enables us to enter a completely new market to us and that is this I/O market place, so the URL Rent.com is very valuable, in particular in our relationship and partnership with Google to build great SCO around words that people tend to associate with renting a townhouse, a house or a condo or a walk-up unit in a property.So we'll use RentPath and rent.com in particular as a vehicle to enter this new, smaller property market in which we're less than 1% penetrated right now. So that will be another helpful element to an acquisition there.Our next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. Please go ahead. -- Hey, good afternoon guys. I appreciate you talking the question. Andy, when you look at STR and the revenue you're generating this year, I think you said on the call when you bought it that you ultimately can -- that you can double the revenue growth there. When I look at the information services segment, this year STR looks like it might be down a little bit. I wonder if you can comment Andy or Scott on that and then sort of what that total segment growth should look like over time as STR ramps up? -- Yeah, let me cover the numbers on that sector. What you're seeing, which has been the fuel under info services has been real-estate manager for the last couple years. You may recall that that is comprised of both subscription revenue and then when they took all those big orders over the last 18 months they had a bunch of implementation revenue.Right now the implementation revenue is running down since we're past that wave, and the subscription revenue is growing. So underlying, we're expecting to see anywhere between 15% and 20% continued growth in information services sector after we get past that run off, which I think by the end of 2020 we will be, so that is sort of STR.But when we look at STR on a stand-alone basis, on a global enterprise they are growing around this 10% year-over-year, similar to what it was doing just before we bought it, and as you pointed out, we expect we'll be able to grow that revenue 20% or more. We'll need the year to get the technology integration that Andy mentioned done and just start rolling out some of the new products in a more meaningful way and so post 2021 is when we'll start to see that revenue ramp up, go higher in STR.Now, keep in mind when that starts to happen and it's integrated into a CoStar Suite platform that those revenue growth will show up in CoStar Suite and not in info services. So info services will continue in this 15% to 20% growth range with real-estate manager, risk analytics and a few other businesses powering that over the longer term and STR will start growing above 10% to 20%, but that that will shift up into CoStar Suite. -- So we've had a bit of time now to really get into the hood and work with the STR team, to really understand the opportunity better, and I think the product strategy is very clear and concise now.So STR has built a fantastic company, focused intensely on their relationships with the major hoteliers around the world, as well as the accuracy clean list and privacy of the benchmarking and the quality of how they do the benchmarking.And where there's a tremendous opportunity is to take a whole set of the spare tools that STR provides and pull them together into one seamless login, one interface, one system using a lot of technology that CoStar Group already has available to us, and also integrate that with the analytics, market analytics, market search functions, forecasting, property level data that CoStar Group has, put into one solution and you know as I look at that opportunity, I am very confident that when we go through that process, that technology path, we can produce a product that the customers will love, that will be an absolute next generation solution and hospitality information.How and when we monetize that exactly will evolve, but if you build a great product, that it's magnitude of order is more powerful and useful, it will pay off. But one just you know tactical thing is, we'll be able to sell to the non-hospitality world, analytic solutions for people trying to appraise property, buy and sell hotels, great quality market data and our CoStar sales force will be able to carry that product, and there is just a lot of people in the CoStar sales force, so with just a lot more bandwidth that is a doubling factor right there. But I feel very good about what we have right now there, but it's just a lot work and we don't mind that.[Operator Instructions] And we have a question from Mayank Tandon from Needham. Please go ahead. -- Hey, good evening. It's actually Kyle Peterson on for Mayank. Thanks for talking the questions. So it's great to hear about the LoopNet bookings, the momentum in 4Q; definitely impressive sequential growth there. I just want to see if you give us any color on kind of how the bookings momentum has been in January and February, just to kind of tease out, kind of how the momentum is -- can you -- Hello, we lost our good friend Mayank. -- I think we knew where he was going. He wanted to know if we had any insights on the booking momentum in the first quarter. Unfortunately we can't talk about booking or booking momentum in the first quarter until our first quarter conference call, which will be the third week or fourth week of April, Tuesday evening 5:00 PM and we'll be happy to update it then. Sorry, can't say much more than that. -- Alright, I'm going to let the cat out of the bag, we didn't sell in that. We did sell in that -- we solid some in January and we are still selling stuff in February. Okay, let's get our last question operator.And our final question is from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. -- Wow! Under the wire there. -- Very, close. Hello Bill! -- How are you guys doing today? -- Great! How are you doing today? -- I'm doing OK, I'm doing OK. Is that the Andy, the operator Florance. Hey, I thought it was, I thought it was -- so what's up? 54 minutes of prepared remarks. You can't come up with another six minutes of material of make it -- round it out to an hour, what's up with that? -- We are getting old. -- Alright, so a two part question if you will. So one is to ask if you could give us a little color on the sales incentives, specific sales incentives that you're giving for the LoopNet sales for us in 2020, a little color there; and then also if you could talk about how far you are from being able to actually score a lead for the Apartments owners and managers. -- Okay. So in terms of how we incent the CoStar sales force on LoopNet production, I will take a shot at that. Its approximately 20% of their billing book, so whatever they've got billing in a given month they get approximately 20% of it. And they get an accelerator toward their rate that they earned on their CoStar side once they cross -- I think it's 20,000 of monthly bookings and so that motivates them, that motivates them to quickly get to that base point.And, I think it doesn't count toward Presidents Club and things like that, but it's enough, it's an interlinked systems that's pretty attractive to them, and they'll be able to do quite well with it and as the do well, we'll do well too.And then the second question, it was not authorized to ask, but we'll answer it anyhow as we always do; leads scoring well. At this point we are -- you know one of the elements that we initially pursued with the online leasing tools was the fact that we could do better lead scoring. I think that is a long term investment for us.As we see more and more renters goes through our online application process and more and more people participate, we can help people understand right off the bat as they fill out their application, which other properties they are likely to qualify for or not qualify for. Just say, several at a time and help someone get to the right solution faster. And then you know that's sort of a win-direct way by educating the renter of scoring the leads coming in.And untimely enough people are participating in this, especially as we meet the needs of millions of college students using off-campus partners and we try to bring these tools into that environment as students come out of university and began renting their first off-campus housing. We'll build up a fair amount of information about those leads as they go into our clients' inbox.So the capabilities are there, but we're taking the long term on it.And there are no further questions in queue. Please continue. -- Bill, do you want to get back in line? With that we'll end the conference call. Thank you very much for joining us. Next time we're hoping to get a 60 minute prepared remarks or maybe a 45 minute. Thank you very much.[Operator Closing Remarks] --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --

There are 9 different analyst targets contributing to that average for CoStar Group, Inc., but the average is just that — a mathematical average.  There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $597.00.  And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $713.00.  The standard deviation is $36.41.


But the whole reason to look at the average CSGP price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes.  And so with CSGP crossing above that average target price of $636.78/share, investors in CSGP have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $636.78 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

Shares of commercial real estate data and analytics company  got a big lift this morning, rising more than 10% in early trading. The stock was still up about 9.6% as of 11:35 a.m. EST on Wednesday.The reason: CoStar announced Tuesday evening that it will purchase RentPath, an operator of rental property websites, out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy.  Image source: Getty Images.CoStar will pay $588 million in cash to acquire RentPath's business, which includes the Rent.com, ApartmentGuide.com, and Rentals.com websites. The sites list approximately 28,000 properties and attracted 21 million monthly visits and almost 9 million monthly unique visitors in 2019.RentPath generated approximately $227 million in sales and $47 million in adjusted EBITDA last year. But as CoStar explained in its statement announcing the purchase, RentPath failed because its heavy debt load prevented it from making the necessary investments for the transition from paper booklets listing apartments to the web.CoStar, with its $1.2 billion in net cash on the balance sheet and  ($413 million in  over the past year), has the money to make those needed investments, and combined with synergies with its own business, believes it can do better.Judging from today's price action, investors agree.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"nvestors eyeing a purchase of CoStar Group, Inc. (Symbol: CSGP) shares, but cautious about paying the going market price of $591.02/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal.  One interesting put contract in particular, is the July 2020 put at the $510 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $19.20.  Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 3.8% return against the $510 commitment, or a 6.1% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost).



Selling a put does not give an investor access to CSGP's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised.  And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $510 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price.  ().  So unless CoStar Group, Inc. sees its shares fall 13.7% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $490.80 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $19.20 from $510), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 6.1% annualized rate of return.



Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for CoStar Group, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $510 strike is located relative to that history:
  

   
The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the July 2020 put at the $510 strike for the 6.1% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks.  We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for CoStar Group, Inc. (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $591.02) to be 28%.

In mid-afternoon trading on Thursday, the put volume among S&P 500 components was 1.22M contracts, with call volume at 1.22M, for a put:call ratio of 0.74 so far for the day, which is above normal compared to the long-term median put:call ratio of .65.  In other words, if we look at the number of call buyers and then use the long-term median to project the number of put buyers we'd expect to see, we're actually seeing more put buyers than expected out there in options trading so far today.

"egendary investor Warren Buffett advises to be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful.  One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100.  A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.

In trading on Monday, shares of CoStar Group, Inc. (Symbol: CSGP) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 28.8, after changing hands as low as $542.41 per share.  By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) is 65.2.  A bullish investor could look at CSGP's 28.8 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.    The chart below shows the one year performance of CSGP shares:
   
   

Looking at the chart above, CSGP's low point in its 52 week range is $315.85 per share, with $639.41 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $543.57.

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. 	For the Invesco Russell 1000—Quality Factor ETF (Symbol: OQAL), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $32.45 per unit.


With OQAL trading at a recent price near $29.38 per unit, that means that analysts see 10.44% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings.   Three of OQAL's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Host Hotels & Resorts Inc (Symbol: HST), CoStar Group, Inc. (Symbol: CSGP), and NIKE Inc (Symbol: NKE). Although HST has traded at a recent price of $16.85/share, the average analyst target is 14.12% higher at $19.23/share. Similarly, CSGP has 11.63% upside from the recent share price of $566.73 if the average analyst target price of $632.62/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting NKE to reach a target price of $102.57/share, which is 11.10% above the recent price of $92.32. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of HST, CSGP, and NKE:  

   Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:

Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

In the company's most recently reported quarter, the third quarter, its revenue jumped 15% year over year to $306 million. Under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), net income rose 18% to $79 million, which translated to a 20% rise in earnings per share (EPS) to $2.15. On an adjusted basis, net income jumped 22% to $96 million, which translated to a 21% increase in EPS to $2.61. That result beat Wall Street's $2.52 consensus estimate.

"Surf the net and you’ll find lots of stories about the best stocks to own. Some will be for the next year, five years, or even 10 years. Very few, however, will offer up ideas for the next half-century. In part, that’s because investing today has become a “What have you done for me lately?” kind of business. Also, because so many companies have disappeared over the years, it’s futile to guess who’s going to stick around.The  had a tenure of 33 years in 1965. In 1990, that dropped to 20 years. By 2026, it’s forecast to fall to 14 years. In other words, the odds of you winning the lottery is almost as good as owning a stock that remains publicly traded for 50 consecutive years. Nonetheless, I’ve decided to give myself this challenge. The 10 stocks to own on my list have very little debt, a market cap greater than $10 billion, and sector-wise provide a reasonably diversified portfolio.	Linde (NYSE:), the UK-based supplier of industrial gases, has a total return of 32.2% year to date through Dec. 4.In October 2018, Linde and U.S.-based Praxair completed their  of equals that created one the world’s largest supplier of industrial gases with  and 80,000 employees around the world. The deal vaulted it ahead of Air Liquide (OTCMKTS:), the French provider of industrial gases. In the third quarter ended Sept. 30, Linde had an operating profit of $1 billion on revenue of $7 billion. Despite the $90 billion merger, Linde finished the quarter with just  for a debt-to-equity ratio of 23%. Linde was able to sidestep the debt issue by doing an all-stock deal with Praxair. Linde shareholders received 1.54 shares in the newly combined company for every share held. Praxair shareholders received one share of the combined company for every share held.I would expect Linde to deliver double-digit annual returns for years to come. 	Lululemon (NASDAQ:), the popular apparel brand that got its start making comfortable yoga pants for customers, has a total return of 90.5% year to date.This isn’t the first time I’ve included LULU stock in a list of long-term holds. In August 2016, I argued that LULU would be one of the  over the next decade. Three years in, it’s living up to the promise.As Forbes contributor Sergei Klebnikov recently pointed out, Lululemon has benefited from  through its own network of stores rather than selling its products wholesale to department stores and other third-party retailers. Between its healthy women’s business, a growing men’s business, an e-commerce segment that’s also rapidly growing, and its Asian stores selling its product like hotcakes, it’s easy to understand why it’s putting the rest of retail to shame. 	Hormel (NYSE:) is a food company focused on protein-based products, including the Hormel, Spam, Dinty Moore and Skippy Brands. Hormel stock isn’t lighting it up in 2019. It’s got a total return of just 6.3% year to date.While its 2019 return isn’t Lululemon-like, it has delivered consistent returns for its shareholders. Over the past decade, it has generated an annualized total return of 18%. On Nov. 25, Hormel announced its Q4 2019 report. For the year, Hormel had an  from $9.5 billion for an operating margin of 12.6%. Long-term, it expects to grow pre-tax earnings by 5-7% annually. At the same time it released earnings, Hormel also announced an 11% dividend increase to 93 cents a share. That’s the 54th consecutive year HRL has increased its dividend and the 11th consecutive year it has increased its dividend by 10% or more. It might not be the most exciting stock to own, but it surely is one of the most consistent.    	
		   	If you’re familiar with CoStar Group (NASDAQ:), you know there’s money to be made with information. Specifically, CoStar makes money by providing the most comprehensive database of real estate information in the country. By being the best information provider around, CoStar shareholders have done very well in 2019 with a year-to-date total return of almost 75%. Over the past 15 years, CSGP has generated an annualized total return of 18.8%, double the total U.S. market. Recently, , a data analytics company that specializes in hotel information, for $450 million. With only $64 million in annual revenue, CoStar expects to grow STR by 20% annually by helping bring products to the market faster.As AI, machine learning, and data analytics become a regular part of business, expect CoStar to continue to grow at a considerable rate.  	Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:) manufactures the da Vinci robotic surgical system that allows doctors to carry out minimally invasive surgeries for patients around the world. It’s  worldwide, with a majority sold to U.S. hospitals. However, the company’s international sales are multiplying. The systems aren’t cheap. That has allowed it to grow its revenues by 75% in the past four years. This has done wonders for ISRG stock, which has a nearly 22% total return year-to-date and 29.4% over the past 15 years. If there were a tech/healthcare stock that Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:,NYSE:) should have bought but didn’t, ISRG would be it. The company has a reasonably wide moat but continues to invest in research and development so that it stays ahead of its competition. In 2016,  of its revenue on R&D. In 2020 it’s projected to spend 11.6%, a 30% increase over four years. Owning ISRG over the long haul is a slam dunk.	
		   	Biotech stocks, especially those developing clinical-stage drugs, scare the heck out of me. They don’t make any money, but they spend several years and many millions or even billions getting the product approved.That’s a lot of power riding in the hands of a small panel of experts. As a shareholder, you have very little control over the process. That’s why it makes sense to invest in large biotech firms such as Alexion Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:), whose Soliris drug is used  in adults suffering from paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and other related diseases. In the third quarter, Soliris had worldwide sales of , 12% higher than the same period a year earlier. Its successor drug, Ultomiris, is also doing well. As a result of this success, Alexion expects to make at least $10.25 per share in 2019 on a non-GAAP basis, significantly higher than its outlook at the beginning of the fiscal year. Up 15.7% year to date, expect bigger things from ALXN stock in 2020.  	
		   	I picked Cummins (NYSE:) because it has one of the healthiest balance sheets of any large-cap company in the industrial goods sector. Currently, the company’s  is just  of its book value. By comparison, Caterpillar’s (NYSE:) is  of its book value. In October, I recommended CMI stock as one of “ Regardless of Q3 Earnings.” Although the maker of gas-powered generators doesn’t expect much sales growth in 2019, its EBITDA margin is likely to be 16.5% or more. As a result, you can be sure that it will have plenty of cash in the future to pay its generous dividend. Up 35.5% year-to-date, including dividends, it provides investors with an excellent balance between income and capital gains.       	
		   	Over the past 52 weeks, airline stocks have generated a total return of -1.3%. Over the past five years, they’ve averaged an annualized total return of 3.3%. Slightly better but nothing to write home about. Meanwhile, Southwest Airlines (NYSE:), which  and tends to rely on Boeing (NYSE:) aircraft for its fleet, beat its peers over the past year by 795 basis points and 376 basis points over the past five years. In April 2018, I recommended Southwest stock over Delta Airlines (NYSE:) because it’s  in tough economic times. While a recession in 2020 doesn’t look likely, I don’t see how any of the airline stocks hold a candle to Southwest. In the nine months ended Sept. 30, Southwest had , which isn’t half bad in an extremely competitive travel market. Over the trailing 12 months, its FCF is close to record highs despite the issues facing the 737 Max that continue to keep a chunk of the airline’s fleet on the ground. It ought to be Warren Buffett’s , but it’s not. For Berkshire fans, that’s a shame.     	
		   	Jack Ma co-founded Alibaba Group (NYSE:) in 1999. It wasn’t easy getting China’s largest e-commerce company up and running. Somehow, the former teacher managed to push through. Today, Ma is the wealthiest person in China, worth an estimated . He’s been so successful — Alibaba’s 2019 revenues were  with $12 billion in net income and $15.6 billion in free cash flow — that he has stepped away from the business to focus all his efforts on his . Only 55, Ma has lots of causes to keep himself busy these days.Meanwhile, the company continues to expand into various businesses outside its e-commerce core. These include financial services and the cloud. And by no means are these businesses dalliances.    “Alibaba first started its move into fintech in 2004 with the launch of AliPay. What started out as a simple way to secure online payments for Alibaba platform users has now expanded to become part of Ant Financial, the financial branch of Alibaba and the key to ,” InvestorPlace contributor Chris Markoch wrote last month. In October, I suggested that  despite it being rangebound over the past two years. Since then, it’s up more than 20%. Year to date it’s up 47.6%. Long-term, this could be one of the best stocks to own over the next half-decade.  	
		   	Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergei Brin announced Dec. 3 that they were stepping down from their executive positions at Alphabet (NASDAQ:, NASDAQ:), the holding company for its search engine business as well as all the other bets it’s made over the past few years. , Google Fiber, Verily, Sidewalk Labs, and Calico are but a few. Now that Google CEO Sundar Pichai is taking over as Alphabet CEO, some see the changing of the guard as an opportunity for Alphabet to get out of some of the expensive so-called “moonshots” it has been working on the past few years. Money-losing experiments, to boot. Google stock rose 2% on the news Page and Brin were passing the baton. “The question is, will they continue to  on these other bets? Under the new leadership, are they going to take a harder look at all of these businesses and start to try to focus more on ones that provide growth,” said Daniel Morgan, a portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company, which owns Alphabet shares worth over $100-million. “That would add extra excitement about the stock.”Whether Pichai decides to unload some of the moonshots or not, Google still generates all of its  in annual free cash flow from its advertising revenues. That’s not going to change. Google stock is up a respectable 33.3% year-to-date and 19.4% annually over the past five years. As long as it remains a leader in digital advertising, its stock remains worth owning for the next half-decade.   At the time of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.The post  appeared first on .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@10 Stocks With Little or No Debt to Own for the Next 50 Years @2019-12-09@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/10-stocks-with-little-or-no-debt-to-own-for-the-next-50-years-2019-12-09
ast week was rough in the markets, but not for all investors. More than 600 exchange-listed stocks hit fresh 52-week highs, and a few of the names hitting high-water marks might surprise you. ,  , and   bucked the market malaise last week to deliver new highs for their shareholders. Let's dive into each of these three winners to see why they're moving higher when the general market is going the other way. Image source: Carvana.The cult-fave restaurant chain hit another all-time high on Friday after posting blowout financial results and raising its guidance earlier this month. Revenue  in its latest quarter. The chain's brisk expansion has been at the heart of its double-digit top-line growth, but a 3.6% uptick in comps is also impressive in the cutthroat eatery space. Its profit of $0.27 a share was well ahead of the $0.23 analysts were targeting. Shake Shack also boosted its full-year guidance. Shake Shack trades at lofty multiples compared to most of its restaurant peers, but the stock continues to climb. The restaurant chain is making smart moves by teaming up with a  and third-party meal-delivery platforms to expand its brand awareness and reach, and for now investors are digging the stock as much as the burgers and titular shakes.  Auto retailing may not seem like a hotbed for growth these days. Cars last longer, and there's also a declining ownership trend among young people as mass transit and ridesharing markets improve. Against this backdrop you have Carvana growing as fast as some of its secondhand sports cars, cashing in on its next-gen business model and the iconic nine-story glass-enclosed auto vending machines that make some of its locations stand out. Growth at Carvana is shockingly good. Revenue soared 108% in its latest quarter,  to 22 quarters. There's some sweet scalability at play here, as total gross profit per unit has soared from $2,173 to $3,175 over the past year. Carvana is still posting losses as it ramps up its footprint across the country, but it's clear that the company is disrupting an otherwise sleepy industry -- and gobbling market share along the way.Providing commercial real estate information, analytics, and online marketplaces is paying off for CoStar Group -- even as a dicey economy and stubborn lending rates threaten to cool off the market. CoStar is still coasting higher after posting  last month. Revenue rose 16% in CoStar's second quarter, fueled by a 32% surge in bookings. The news was even better on the bottom line, as net income and earnings per share soared 44% to hit $44 million, or $1.70 a share. CoStar has consistently beaten Wall Street's earnings estimates over the past year, but last month's report brought its biggest beat in more than a year. CoStar also boosted its guidance, and that's always a good look during earnings season.  When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

There are 8 different analyst targets contributing to that average for CoStar Group, Inc., but the average is just that — a mathematical average.  There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $530.00.  And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $650.00.  The standard deviation is $40.879.


But the whole reason to look at the average CSGP price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes.  And so with CSGP crossing above that average target price of $614.62/share, investors in CSGP have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $614.62 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

"Image source: The Motley Fool. Q3 2019 , Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the CoStar Third Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, everyone joining by phone is in a listen-only or muted mode, and then later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, the conference is being recorded.I'll now turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Rich Simonelli, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. -- Thank you, operator, and welcome to CoStar Group's third quarter 2019 conference call everyone. Before I turn the call over to Andy Florance, CoStar's CEO and Founder; and Scott Wheeler, our CFO, I'd like to share some important facts.Certain portions of our discussion today may contain forward-looking statements, which involve many risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to differ materially from such statements. Important factors that can cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to those stated today in CoStar Group's October 22, 2019, press release on our third quarter results and in company's outlook and then CoStar's filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and our subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, under the heading Risk Factors.All forward-looking statements are based on information available to CoStar on the date of this call. CoStar assumes no obligation to update these statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure to the non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call, including non-GAAP net income, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and forward-looking non-GAAP guidance, are shown in detail in our press release issued today, along with definitions for these terms and they can also be found on the press release on our website, which is located at costargroup.com.As a reminder, today's conference call is being broadcast live and in color on our Investor Relations website. So, please refer to today's press release on how to access the replay of this call. Remember, one question, and if we have time permitting we'll requeue.But I'll now turn the call over to Andy Florance. Andy? -- Thank you, Rich. That was extremely well done. -- Thank you. -- Thank you for joining us for CoStar Group's third quarter 2019 . CoStar Group's total revenue was $353 million in the third quarter of 2019, an increase of 15% year-over-year. During the second quarter of 2019, CoStar Suite revenue moved through the $600 million annualized run rate mark. In the third quarter, Apartments.com moved past the $500 million annualized run rate mark and did so with a 20% year-over-year growth. This is outstanding sustained growth, considering we're in the six years -- six year of owning Apartments.com. But we expect there's much more to come.Multifamily is a huge opportunity. We estimate that total addressable market multifamily is somewhere between $8 billion and $10 billion. This is four to five times bigger than we initially estimated the multifamily opportunity was when we entered the space in 2014. Net income for the third quarter 2019 was $79 million, an increase of 34% over net income of $59 million for the third quarter of 2018. EBITDA was very strong for the third quarter of 2019, coming in at $113 million, an increase of 24% versus EBITDA of $91 million for the third quarter of 2018.Adjusted EBITDA margins moved to 37%, and we achieved 80% gross margin in the third quarter. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we expect to have over $1 billion in cash at year-end and no debt, even after the closing of the STR acquisition earlier today. We continue to show strong growth in profitability, while we continue to invest in the future growth of the company. I'm delighted with our ability to consistently deliver on both fronts. There's a massive opportunity in both the United States and abroad in information, analytics and marketing for commercial real estate. While I'm pleased that we are approaching $1.4 billion of revenue in 2020, we believe there are billions of dollars of opportunity not yet realized, so continued investment is optimal.We had another excellent sales quarter, generating $50 million in companywide net bookings, and increased 27% year-over-year in the third quarter. Our average net new sales of $52.5 million per quarter year-to-date in 2019 is 32% higher than the comparable period in 2018 when the average net new sales per quarter was $39.8 million. On the multifamily side of the business, the larger sales force we deployed in 2018 has delivered in a big way. In fact, both CoStar Suite and Apartments.com sales team each achieved more than 30% growth in net new sales in the third quarter of 2019 compared to the third quarter of last year.I'm optimistic that our sales levels will continue to be strong for the remainder of 2019, and can improve in 2020 as we are proactively increasing the size of our sales force, offering new products and services, and continue to grow share in our huge addressable market. We now have 280 field sales reps in production for CoStar Suite and LoopNet, and we look to add -- enter 2020 with about 300. In the third quarter of 2019, we identified and distributed list of 17,000 CRE owner as strong sales lease to our sales force. Each rep has a target owner list. We have been aggressively preparing our sales force to target and sale owners both LoopNet signature listings and more CoStar Suite.I'm pleased to announce that we closed on the acquisition today of STR for $450 million.

Integration of STR with the CoStar product will maintain absolute confidentiality while also allowing property owners, investors and service providers in the hospitality sector, a more holistic, aggregated view of industry at market levels. I've already had a chance to meet with the STR team in London. It's a great group. And tomorrow, I will be in Hendersonville, Tennessee to welcome hundreds of new employees to the CoStar team.I'm looking forward to working with our outstanding management team including: Amanda Hite, CEO, hello, Amanda; Elizabeth Winkle, Chief Strategy Officer; Robert Rosman, Managing Director and many other strong leaders as we get there. We believe that combining STR's superior hospitality service offering combined with the CoStar platform will benefit all industry participants as we work together to create valuable new and improved tools. I'm very pleased to report that one of the world's leading property companies, JLL has renewed its contract with CoStar with a five-year deal and a two-year renewal option. As you know, JLL recently completed its acquisition of HFF.Our contract for the combined entity is largely the two firms were paying individually since now all the brokers of JLL will add access to the National CoStar Suite data and analytics. We saw a similar phenomenon when [Indecipherable] confirmed that consolidation CRE can be beneficial to CoStar revenues, particularly when it combined and expense access to CoStar services. I want to update you on LoopNet where we are with that. Office buildings release have historically been remarketed from broker-to-broker via print brochures or email brochures. And owners seeking to lease up their building with higher broker would then distribute a few hundred flyers to other local brokers announcing the brokers' availability.The landlords' broker will generally affix a sign to the building announcing the space offered for lease. But that will only reach prospects who are already at the building. Given that some of this lease can be worth more than $150 million, this strikes me as a primitive way to market space. It's understandable in historical offline contacts as there are severe limits in the methods available to market office space. There could be tens of thousands of tenants within five miles of a typical office building availability with hundreds of thousands of potential decision influencers. Additionally, 20% or 40% of the tenants searching for space in the market are coming from outside that MSA. The size, distribution, and changing nature of the prospects have made them possible for owners to build effective direct mail or email marketing list.Ryan National TV, radio or newspaper campaigns for years so it takes the lease property is prohibitively expensive. Hence, the industry has relied on marketing through a double middleman model. On a $150 million lease an owner might pay $9 million in commissions, $7 million in free rank concessions, and $14 million in tenant improvements for a total marketing cost of $30 million. Even after investing that so much money, we estimate that office owners lose approximately $40 billion annually to excess vacancy. Smaller tenants occupy about 35% of U.S. office space, so most owners cannot pay a mortgage without them. Yet commission brokers are less motivated to pursue small deals. Therefore, owners rely on a double broker model face greater challenges marketing to small tenants. While WeWork has not being complete success, one of its growth drivers has been that it's mean massive unmet need for connecting smaller tenants to space.The Internet has created transformative opportunities to market commercial real estate online and LoopNet is fortunate to be a Ground Zero for that opportunity. LoopNet and its certain related sites are now generating 6.6 million unique visitors per month as reported by Google Analytics. This is a 16% year-over-year increase. No other CRE marketplace comes close to LoopNet. No other CRE website comes close to LoopNet. According to Hitwise, LoopNet has almost 2,000% more traffic than second most heavily trafficked website wework.com. For the 22,000 CRE keywords we prioritize, LoopNet holds the number one SEO position on Google, 86% of the time. The fact is that today millions of tenants look for office space online. We believe that LoopNet is the most effective way to market commercial space today because it offers unprecedented reach, strong frequency, and elevates the property's brand.We know LoopNet's effective marketing because tens of thousands of brokers pay to market to listings on LoopNet in order to reach tenants and users. We believe we can significantly expand the property's reach, frequency, and branding by sorting the top of LoopNet and CoStar just as we do in Apartments.com. This increases the ad size content and by repeating across our websites, it's growing net reach and frequency. We call these signature ads and we already can see they work. By tracing IP addresses, we can see major tenants viewing signature ads on LoopNet followed later by their brokers view in the same ads or content and CoStar, and then we see the tenants lease space in the property we believe that the tenant originally found on LoopNet. We see specific deals in the range of 0.5 million feet, so we see some huge deals this way.The owners of an office building have a much greater stake economic standard than the broker, so focusing our salesforce on selling these ads to owners directly in harmony with the brokers at price points about $2,500 a month. We have recently put in place more training incentives to drive sales for this goal. We have made great strides in improving the website over the past year to better fit our clients' branding goals. We have created richer content and signature listings including photography, reviews, bios, and graphics. The signature ads can have a hugely positive impact on marketing of building for as little as a few cents to a few dimes per square foot. When the owner already be investing $100 a foot in traditional cost and methods to lease up their space. So we're talking a point or two on additional cost to make the program more effective.We believe that marketing commercial real estate online will be a multibillion dollar opportunity. And that CoStar Group is well-positioned to capture major share of that opportunity. We expect that LoopNet will be a significant contributor to our 2020 sales growth. Turning to Apartments.com, Apartments.com is doing very well. Apartment's revenue is up 20% year-over-year. Net sales are up 30% year-over-year. And profit contribution has been growing rapidly as we continue to grow revenue. In July and August, the Apartments.com network reached an all-time high in unique visitors according to comScore. We had nearly 60 million visits in August 2019, an increase of eight million from August 2018.The Apartments.com network continues to pull further away from the competition by growing unique visitors, 10% year-over-year to $18.9 million in September, as reported by comScore. At the same time, RentPath saw a decrease of 4% in the same period. Our network had more than nine times the number of visits than Apartment List had and 2.6 times the visits that RentPath had. The Apartments.com network had more visitors than the Zillow Rental Network.We have just begun beta testing Apartments.com's, digital tenant screening, lease documents and rent payment system. Our first two markets are Santa Monica and Atlanta. It's only been two weeks so it's still very early, but the initial reaction exceeds our expectations. 36% of the landlords who added our listing on Apartments.com in a test period, elected to use our digital leasing tools, really happy with that number. We've already begun processing applications, screening renters and executing leases and collecting rent payments. Some of the owner and comments have included. It shows me the level of overall quality of the specific tenant, especially compared to other potential tenants in terms of reliability, trustworthiness, responsible, etc. Another owner said, it was more thorough than what I was expecting. Another said, I thought it was user-friendly and takes a holistic approach, and covered every detail we needed, and was quick and easy to use for both myself and my potential tenant. Finally another owner said, very easy and fast.Some of the renter comments, really quite simple, one, application. It was much easier than expected. Another one, it was extremely simple and fell secure submitting my information. And finally, it was fairly easy. I think it's good that the comments are so short. We expect to continue rolling out the tools throughout the rest of the year and into next year. There are hundreds and thousands of mid-sized and smaller apartment communities that we're now successfully selling to. To fully capture this opportunity, we are significantly expanding our apartment sales force, by building 100-plus person team enrichment, focused on this middle market opportunity.I had a chance to meet with the first team of 17 reps and managers last week. It's a very promising, highly motivated group with excellent support from our Richmond technical and administrative infrastructure. I'm very excited about the growth prospects that expand sales force can deliver going forward. During last quarter's earnings call, we reported that we thought we could provide our advertisers with more value, enhance our competitive advantage and generate a good ROI with more aggressive marketing investment behind Apartments.com. On our last earnings quarter call, we announced that we are increasing our marketing spend for the second half of 2019 by $10 million. We did that. And we increased the investment in the third quarter alone. We have analyzed the results. And we've achieved our desired outcomes.Beginning in August, we roughly doubled our investment in certain categories of Google keywords. And not surprisingly, we more than doubled our apartment rental click share compared to other top listing services, moving from 32% click share to 67% click share according to Hitwise. During the same time period, RentPath click share plunged from 35% to 17%. RentPath had been making up for weak SEO by buying SEM traffic. During the trial, RentPath moved from having more click share than Apartments.com to having one-forth of Apartments.com's click share. Apartment List had 24% of click share before it began, and their share dropped in half to 12%. We've also increased the number of times we're in the number one position in Google by nearly 600%. During the trial, we appeared the top 4 Google SEM positions, 95% of the time in our targeted neighborhoods.Given the success of the trial, the only humane thing to do is to immediately suspend the trials and widely deploy the increased investment to help millions of additional renters find a great apartment soon. We plan to continue to sustain an elevated level of SEM spending in the fourth quarter. By the end of the year, we will have increased our SEM spend by a total of $20 million in 2019 over our initial budget at the beginning of the year. We acquire Apartments in 2014 and since then we've grown profitable revenue organically and acquisitively. We expect to achieve a 5-year compound annual growth rate of 38% based on our 2019 forecast. We have grown from serving just over 17,000 apartment communities to serving well over 50,000; in fact 52,000.And industry that has historically only monetized large -- apartment communities we're very successfully selling marketing solutions to large, medium, small communities and even single-family rentals of which there are tens of millions. That shows this is a massive, massive opportunity. We are clearly in the lead position in the industry. We absolutely want across billion dollars of revenue Apartments.com soon and go well into the billions of dollars of revenue. Ultimately, we'd like to generate a billion plus of EBITDA from the apartment sector alone. In 2015, we showed our commitment to the industry with an unprecedented $100 million investment in the marketing Apartments.com with $100 million plus renters in the U.S. It was not initially very popular with everybody, but it clearly worked. It helped us grow our revenue from $85 million to $500 million. In the third quarter this year, we've have tested a more aggressive marketing investment and we like the returns.As we move into 2020, we plan to take Apartments.com to the next level again. We expect to increase our investment in marketing from approximately $150 million in 2019 to $250 million in 2020. That's a $100 million incremental increase in our marketing spend. This will bring our 2020 margin down, but we believe in the future, this investment will drive our revenue and margin of well beyond the investment we're making in 2020. Our $250 million 2020 Apartments.com marketing budget is expected to consists of much more aggressive search engine marketing, more aggressive TV and digital video marketing with the goal of moving our unaided awareness for the 26% to 33% range to the 50% plus unaided awareness range. We also plan to invest in marketing programs to support our digital leasing initiatives. Make hay, while the sun is shining. The sun is shining brightly and we intend to make a spectacular amount of pay.Have a legal update for you. On Xceligent, if you remember that, CoStar shareholders have invested billions of dollars to enable CoStar Group to build and acquire robust information systems in marketplaces that are invaluable to the commercial real estate industry. CoStar's ability to protect its intellectual property from misappropriation is a critical factor in our success. Over the course of those last several years, Xceligent as former officers and directors instructed contractors and employees to circumvent our security systems protecting CoStar Group's websites in order to steal an enormous fine intellectual property from CoStar Group.They repackage and sell that content as their own. This represented a fundamental threat to CoStar Group when we had to stop it. We relied on the protections of the U.S. copyright law in terms of use for website among other legal tools. We sued Xceligent and their contractors as a smokescreen Xceligent complained to the FTC and countersued complaining anticompetitive behavior. Based with an iron clad case against Xceligent for massive copyright infringement in November 2017, Xceligent's parent company DMGT returns investment Xceligent to zero after losing somewhere around $150 million investment of Xceligent. Xceligent was bankrupt.On the day DMGT announced the writedown, the loss of $150 million, its shares suffered a 23% drop, hitting a five-year low. I do not believe that DMGT was aware of scale of illicit things that Xceligent was doing. DMGT was just a string of investors and Xceligent over the course of the 20-plus years that lost millions, tens of millions or $100 million. We welcome the investigation including an audit authorized by the Federal Trade Commission to determine whether CoStar content was improperly add to Xceligent systems or vice versa. The massive investigation led by the FTC approved monitor conclude that Xceligent improperly derived, took nearly 38,500 images from CoStar's database. We believe this is a complete vindication of CoStar's allegation of Xceligent's unlawful activity.The Department of Justice appointed trustee to manage the now bankrupt the state of Xceligent. After the results, the FTC monitors investigation along with other overwhelming evidence of willful copyright infringement perpetrated by Xceligent under CEO, Doug Curry. The trustee has agreed to the entry of a judgment of $500 million against Xceligent in favor of CoStar Group for copyright infringement. This $500 million judgment would be the largest copyrighted image judgment in history and the third largest copyright judgment of any kind. The judgment is awaiting approval of the bankruptcy court overseeing Xceligent's bankruptcy and the court overseeing CoStar copyright suit.Because Xceligent is bankrupt and virtually without sellable assets, the total amount CoStar will recover under the judgment is only $10.75 million, which will be paid to us by Xceligent's insurers. Of course, I never put the word only in front of $10.75 million. The trustee has also agreed that Xceligent's countersuit against CoStar would be dismissed with prejudice. In connection with Xceligent's massive illegal operation, the directors and executives of Avion, Xceligent's foreign contractor in the Philippines have been charged and indicted on cyber crime charges brought by the Philippine prosecutors. In its paper that Philippine's DOJ stated, that Avion acted in concert with Xceligent management to commit the classic example of computer crime.In final judgment entered in Indian court in favor of CoStar, Xceligent's other foreign contractor Maxwell stated that it was misled by Xceligent, it's executives and managers including Xceligent's CEO, Doug Curry who personally visited the operation in India to supervise their work infringing CoStar's copyrights.Shortly after Xceligent's bankruptcy, Doug Curry started another competitive CRE, the information business called Intrepid that sales in the few weeks of launch. Apparently after that, Doug has started another CRE information business with several million dollars of funding from Moody's, a company you may have heard of. The scale of Xceligent's copyright infringement is unprecedented, sort of, history marker and CoStar Group is very grateful for the thorough efforts of the FTC appointed monitor in completing the massive audit of the copyright violations.I believe our investors will give us credit for aggressively defending their investment in CoStar against intellectual property theft. We have ultimately achieved favorable findings or judgments in this defense in federal court in the U.S., coming up on two in federal court, in court in India, before the Philippines Department of Justice, from the U.S. Department of Justice appointed trustee and monitor appointed by Federal Trade Commission, which sums up to five wins and zero losses in a pretty challenging case. A special thanks to our trial attorney Nick Boyle who did a fantastic job and entire teams at Williams & Connolly.Quick look at the commercial estate economy. Despite growing concerns around the economic outlook, commercial real estate activity continues to post-strong totals for leasing and investment volume. We believe this is justified given the sector's sound fundamentals. Vacancy rates remain near historic lows across all sectors and supply is generally limited. And the recent drop in treasury yields makes returns in commercial real estate, multifamily real estate all the more compelling. Investors may also view real estate as a defensive investment as trends in capital market and economic indicators have increased the probability of a near-term slowdown.In particularly, we note disruptions in trade, following manufacturing output and business investment, slowing demographic growth. Despite these headlines, however GDP growth and job gains have yet to show any meaningful slowdown and continue to support demand for commercial and multifamily real estate. The property markets apartment rent growth once again topped 3% nationally. We believe the on growing health of the apartment sector relates to the broad and growing shortage of housing in the United States.In particular, insufficient supply of new-for-sale housing units has limited homebuying and led to the unprecedented level of apartment demand. In response to this demand, the apartment construction has risen to levels not seen since the 1980s. CoStar tracked just over 300,000 units delivered over the past 12 months and we're tracking about 650,000 apartment units currently under construction. The large majority of these developers rely on the Apartments.com advertising platform to market those units.Investors continue to favor U.S. multifamily assets investment the sector's had a third quarter record this year topping $40 billion. In the office sector, leasing is consistently set new records despite single-digit vacancy rates and limited supply. Large tech firms have demand as they expand beyond their Bay Area and Seattle footprints. Rent growth however, has turned to just around 3%, well below typical gains in the past periods of expansion.Unlike past expansions however, suppliers limited less than 2% of the current inventory and concentrate a handful of markets. New York also stands out with 25 million square feet under way. We work -- unfortunately we'll leave New York a little bit vulnerable since they're heavily constraint in New York, but we don't think it's a big issue. We believe that measured rankings and low supply risk in the office sector helped insulate the market from potential economic reversal, and our base case forecast calls for steady rankings.In industrial sector ongoing changes in how consumers shop continue to generate record levels of demand for industrial space, despite vacancy rates around 5%. Developers are responding a record amount of industrial space as under construction, but rent growth continues to post gains about 5% year-over-year. The best among major property types investment sectors on pace to set another record. Disruptions to trade post some risk to the sector, we expect fast growing demand for local distribution space to provide same-day delivery of goods will help offset any slowdown.In the retail sector, negative headlines around store closings in e-commerce obscures the sectors to curb fundamentals. We estimate retail vacancies are below 5%, the lowest across the property types and construction under way amounts to less than 1% of current stock. The surge in space has results in low leasing absorption levels by demand for retail space from grocers, discounters, fitness clubs and experience retail is offsetting move-outs from department stores and big-box retailers.We expect the record levels of activity in commercial and multifamily real estate to continue. We expect the demand for CoStar Group's products and services to grow as we help owners, lenders, brokers and investors, property managers make quality choices and realize successful outcomes in any economic environment. We continue to generate strong momentum in 2019, and make important investments. I'm extremely excited about the rest of the year as we continue to execute on our long-term vision within a great company.At this point, I will turn the call over to our CFO, Scott Wheeler, and he will give you more detail on our earnings and our planned investments. -- Thank you, Andy. Well said. -- Thank you. -- It probably didn't seem like we took a break this summer. The third quarter delivering another great financial outcome, while initiating and closing our acquisition of STR took less than 12 weeks, but who's counting.Well, Andy mentioned a number of highlights of our third quarter results, including our second consecutive quarter of net new bookings of $50 million or more. We also had strong double-digit revenue growth, 50% year-over-year, which by the way, its 10 straight quarters of revenue growth of 15% or more and for all of you EBITDA lovers out there, another fun fact over the trailing four quarters. We amassed over $500 million in adjusted EBITDA, that's $0.5 billion, certainly a significant achievements for all of us here at CoStar.So, starting-off with revenue, which came in above the midpoint of our guidance range for the third quarter at 15% and for the year, we expect consolidated revenue growth of approximately 16% to 17%. Looking at revenue performances by services, CoStar Suite revenue growth was 12% in the third quarter versus the third quarter of 2018. Revenue growth rate for CoStar Suite expected to be approximately 13% for the full year of 2019.Revenue in our Information Services sector grew 11% year-over-year in the third quarter of 2019, primarily as a result of CoStar Real Estate Manager revenue growth of 19% year-over-year. As we get further past the lease accounting standard adoption dates, Real Estate Manager results include subscription revenue growth of 44% year-over-year in the third quarter, and the 20% drop in one-time implementation revenues. We expect Information Services revenue to grow at a rate of 20% to 21% on a year-over-year basis in 2019, which includes approximately $3 million to $4 million of STR revenue. More on our STR outlook a little later in the call.Multifamily revenue growth for the third quarter remained strong at 20% over the third quarter of 2018, the full year 2019 revenue growth for multifamily is expected in the 20% to 21% range. Commercial property and land revenue grew 17% year-over-year in the third quarter of 2019. Our LoopNet marketplace, which represents approximately 75% of the revenue in the commercial property and land sector, has seen continued strong growth numbers, even as we repositioned LoopNet into the premium advertising solution for property owners. There's a lot of work going on behind the scenes to implement our plans for LoopNet, as Andy mentioned, and this includes discontinuation of certain legacy products and contracts that are not in line with our strategy.Excluding these one-time impacts of discontinued products and contracts, the third quarter revenue growth rate of LoopNet would have been over 20%. We expect year-over-year organic growth in the commercial property and land sector to be about 16% for the full year of 2019, and looking forward to stronger growth rates from LoopNet as we continue to build that sector of our company. Our gross margins came in at 80% in the third quarter of 2019, slightly increasing from 79% gross margins we achieved in the second quarter of 2019. This is the result of strong cost leverage.Our revenues increased $9 million from the third quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2019, but our cost of revenues remained relatively unchanged sequentially. We now expect overall gross margins of approximately 79% to 80% for the full year of 2019. Operating expenses of $187 million for the third quarter of 2019 were slightly below our estimates and down from the $197 million in the second quarter of 2019, as a result of seasonally slower marketing spend in the third quarter. As mentioned during our last financial update in July, we increased our planned levels of marketing spend in the third quarter, which we expect to continue through the end of the year.Our third quarter adjusted EBITDA of $129 million represents an 18% increase compared to adjusted EBITDA of $110 million in the third quarter of 2018. It was approximately $2 million above the top end of our guidance range. Favourable personnel expenses were the main reason for the positive variance. The resulting adjusted EBITDA margin of 37% is 80 basis points above the 36% margin we achieved in the third quarter of 2018. Net income in the third quarter of 2019 was $79 million, an increase of 34%, or $20 million compared to the Q3 of 2018. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 21%, reflecting benefits associated with our share-based payment transactions and R&D credits.Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter increased 21% to $96 million compared to Q3 2018, or $2.61 per diluted share, includes adjustments for stock-based compensation, acquisition expenses, some restructuring costs associated with the organizational changes in Apartments.com and research that we discussed last quarter. Non-GAAP net income for Q3 assumes a tax rate of 25%, which does not include other discrete tax adjustment items.Cash and investment balances were approximately $1.4 billion as of September 30, 2019, up approximately $91 million since last quarter. And as you know, we closed on the STR acquisition today, so we expect our cash balance to be approximately $1 billion, somewhere around that at the end of 2019. Now let's take a look at some of our performance metrics for the quarter. We had another strong bookings quarter with net new sales of $50 million, an increase of 27% year-over-year for the third quarter. The sequential decline from the $59 million of bookings in the second quarter is a result of seasonal sales patterns, primarily in our online marketplace businesses.At the end of the third quarter, our salesforce totaled approximately 820 people, up about 40 people from last quarter and up almost 90 people from the third quarter of 2018. Most of this growth is in our commercial real estate sales team, which is focused on selling CoStar and LoopNet. We expect to continue growing the commercial real estate salesforce during the remainder of this year along with the ramp-up of our mid-market sales team in Apartments.com. Despite our sales team will grow to an approximate range from 880 to 890 by the end of 2019. The renewal rate on annual contracts for the third quarter 2019 was in line with the rate achieved in the second quarter of 2019 at 90%.The renewal rate for the quarter for customers who have been subscribers for 5 years or longer was 95%, also in line with the renewal rate of 95% in the second quarter of 2019. Subscription revenue on annual contracts now accounts for 82% of our revenue in the third quarter, up from 80% this time last year and flat compared to last quarter. I'll now discuss our outlook for the full year and the fourth quarter of 2019 beginning with the outlook for the STR acquisition. We expect that STR will contribute between $3 million to $4 million in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2019. Our revenue estimate is impacted by the negative accounting effect of deferred revenue that was on STR's books at the time of acquisition.STR's deferred revenue balances are quite significant relative to other acquisitions we've completed in the recent past. This is because STR builds and collects the full year amount for annual subscriptions in the first quarter of the calendar year. This is a that I'm particularly quite fond of, but it does reduce the accounting revenue post acquisition. Similarly, our estimate of adjusted EBITDA for STR in the fourth quarter is negatively impacted by the accounting adjustments for deferred revenue, so all the impact of integration costs. We expect the negative impact to adjusted EBITDA of approximately $5 million to $6 million in the fourth quarter as a result of the acquisition.These estimated impacts to revenue adjusted EBITDA from the acquisition STR are included in the revised outlook for 2019. As we look toward 2020, the results for STR will continue to be affected by the negative accounting adjustments for deferred revenue. For example, the current annual revenue run rate for STR of approximately $64 million would be reduced by an estimated $10 million of deferred revenue that carries over to 2020. This would result in a revenue outlook of approximately $55 million for STR in 2020 before any anticipated growth or integration changes.Similarly, the deferred revenue effects in 2020 flow through to the EBITDA for STR. We need time to develop the detailed plan for STR and the integration in 2020, but at this stage, we expect the acquisition to become accretive in the second half of the year and contribute positive EBITDA for 2020. Of course, these are all accounting results for STR, which in no way impact the economic attractiveness of combining CoStar and STR, which we've discussed previously.We continue to expect, as we said in the press release for the acquisition, that within the 3 to 4 years, our investments in new products and our focused on growth of the combined businesses will generate annual revenue growth above 20%, which is approximately 2 times STR's current growth rate and profit margins in line with CoStar's long-term goal of 40% plus adjusted EBITDA margins by 2023.Now I'll discuss the combined outlook for the company. We're raising our revenue outlook slightly to $1.385 billion to $1.391 billion for the full year of 2019 to include the estimated revenue from the STR acquisition. The outlook reflects revenue growth for the year between 16% and 17%. We expect revenue for the fourth quarter of 2019 in the range of $360 million to $366 million, representing topline growth in the range of 14% to 16% for the quarter versus Q4 2018.We expect adjusted EBITDA be in the range of $494 million to $500 million for the full year of 2019, which is relatively unchanged from our previous guidance except for the inclusion of the estimated STR results mentioned previously. We expect full year adjusted EBITDA growth of approximately 19% year-over-year with an adjusted EBITDA margin for the year of approximately 36%. Up approximately 70 basis points at the midpoint of the range compared to 2018, despite the negative short-term impacts of the STR acquisition.The fourth quarter of 2019 we expect adjusted EBITDA in the range of $129 million to $135 million. Included in our outlook for fourth quarter, adjusted EBITDA are the impacts of STR acquisition along with the increased level of marketing spend for Apartments.com. As Andy discussed, we've seen outstanding results from the increased spend levels and expect to continue investing in Apartments.com marketing at the higher level. The net result, the fourth quarter up, considering other costs offsets, with an incremental spend of approximately $5 million to $6 million for the fourth quarter of 2019.In terms of earnings, we expect full year non-GAAP net income for diluted share of $9.90 to $10.02, based on 36.6 million shares. For the fourth quarter of 2019, we expect non-GAAP net income per diluted share, in the range of $2.52 to $2.64, based on 36.7 million shares. Looking ahead, we believe that 2020 is the right time to increase our investment in marketing, to rapidly expand our multifamily business. Although, it's too early to provide detailed guidance for 2020, we expect overall adjusted EBITDA margins to decline by approximately 400 basis points in 2020, from the adjusted EBITDA margin outlook for 2019.In dollar terms, we will need to generate approximately $65 million of incremental profit to recover those 400 basis points. To put that in perspective, in 2019, we expect to add approximately $80 million of adjusted EBITDA. We believe that by increasing our marketing investment in 2020, the results in the form of increased revenue growth will improve our ability to reach our long-term goal of $3 billion as run rate revenue. And 40% plus adjusted EBITDA margins in 2020 to 2023.I'd like to add additional financial perspective to this investment, which is similar in size to the initial marketing investment we made, when we launched Apartments.com back in 2015. As many of you may recall, after we bought Apartments.com, we placed a big bet by investing $100 million in marketing, to go after what we believe at the time was a $2 billion addressable market opportunity. Looking at that now, it's hard to argue with the results, which indicate that this bet has clearly paid off. Since we launched Apartments.com, our multifamily revenues have grown from $160 million in 2015, to almost $500 million in 2019, an increase of 310%.During that same period, our annual Apartments marketing spend has grown from $130 million in 2015 to only $150 million in 2019. That's an increase of only 15% in total over four years. So revenue has grown 20 times faster than the marketing spend. I think that's pretty good leverage. Although, some might argue that we've actually underinvested in marketing, as we've grown this business. This year, as oppose to 2015, we are in a much stronger position to increase marketing spend, both operationally and financially than ever before, which increases our chance for even greater success.Our direct sales force is much larger and continues to deliver record sales level each year. Our site traffic leads the industry. Our data content is massive. And the addressable market opportunity that we see now is $8 billion to $10 billion, which is four to five times the size it was back in 2015. Also, back in 2015, our marketing costs represented 80% of the multifamily revenue. Now in 2019, they're only 30% of multifamily revenue. With this potential increase in our marketing budget of $100 million, we estimate that marketing would represent approximately 40% to 45% of multifamily revenue in 2020.CoStar is now big enough and growing fast enough to absorb investments of a size. If our growth continues in 2020 at the same rate as 2019, we could potentially add $200 million in revenue next year, which would be two times the potential increase in marketing. To summarize, now is the time to increase our multifamily investment. We believe the market opportunity is bigger and much easier to see them before. We have more assets at our disposal, and more experience to leverage these for success. Investment required is actually much smaller than before, relative to our size and scale. And we believe the returns will be bigger and faster, than in 2015.Overall, I believe our strong results and operational improvements have us well positioned for the fourth quarter and beyond. We're happy to have closed the STR deal so quickly. And once again, we want to welcome everybody at STR to the CoStar team.With that -- that was a mouthful -- we'll now open the call for questions.[Operator Instructions] Our first question from the line of Brett Huff with Stephens. Please go ahead. -- Good afternoon, guys. -- Hello, Brett. -- Hi, Brett. -- Scott, thank you for the sort of thoughts and justifications around the additional ad spend, that's super helpful. Can you just go through those -- go through that one more time for me? And then talk a little bit about, where does ad spend go from there?And Andy, you mentioned right after you guys did the first Apartments deals people are worried about it I think the worry was that, if this business in order to grow it require incrementally even more ad spend. Can you just give us your thoughts as you go forward that 20 times return is compelling, but just explain how you guys think about that long-term? Thank you. -- All right. Okay, Brett. Let me walk through that one more time so the financial perspectives around this thing. So, definitely we did the initial investment in marketing in 2015, $100 million. We had a report out that said that, the marketplace is $2 billion in size. And then, as you know, we worked through the large end of that marketplace. We've seen the opportunity in the mid-market, we've seen how the opportunity in the I/O large-scale market. And we know that, that estimate is now growing to between $8 billion to $10 billion opportunity. So, we think the $100 million to go after $2 billion, was a great move. We think the $100 million to go after the next $8 billion is an even better move. So, that was one important note.The other that -- the time when we made that investment, the total company multifamily was not nearly as bigger and stronger as we are now. So, we had $130 million marketing spend and that was 80% of the revenue. Clearly, we've grown that now to be almost $500 million in revenue and saw an incremental $100 million in spent against that fast-growing business. There's much lesser portion of the business, much less of a bigger bet. The other thing I think is important to notice is that, that we've now grown salesforce much bigger than it was before and produces a very high level. The site traffic has grown significantly. The amount of data we have, the amount of electronic feeds, all the strength of that site their to leverage into this next size of the market that will make that $100 million even much more effective they are like softening up the beach head before the troops all go in on the attack.And then I think when you look at just the ability the company now when we're growing as rapidly at $1.4 billion in revenue, we had couple of hundred million of revenue in year at our current growth rates. We've added over $110 million, $115 million in costs this year. So, adding investment in costs are just -- they are going to be bigger numbers, they scare people a bit, because they're big, but when you look at the relative size of the company, these are the best we should be making to keep increasing the scale and the growth on the topline. So, that's what I probably comment on. And let Andy add little more. -- Yeah. And Brett it -- it sort of, I express concern from the 2014 period where -- well, we have continuously invest -- increases these investments in marketing. One of the things that is unique about this industry is we are one of the only aggregators out there investing any material money into the industry. So, this is not something where we are doing it in a zero-sum game trying to keep-up with some other competitor. What we're doing is we're seeing that when people are aware of our products and services, they are tending to buy them and renew at a higher rate.And with an unaided awareness in the 20s to low 30s, there's still a lot of people who are not aware of the product and we want to make more people aware of the products and services that we can sell to more people. We also foresee this strategic advantage of investing ahead of the pack. We want to be -- we are confident and believe that we will be turning through a $1 billion revenue mark on Apartments at some point going beyond there. We want to be investing into that size of company not into what the industry was doing a couple of years ago.So, this is really driven by the fact that we now have much better numbers, metrics, ROI, analysis, SEM analysis. We have a good handle of what we can sell and who we can sell it to at what price points. And we just want to go capture the opportunity. It's a relatively small investment compared to what we think the upside game is. Some people think that there's a big opportunity in the Apartment sector. That would be one of us. And some people think there's not a big opportunity for apartment sector.But we believe there's a big one, so we're investing there. We're not being driven by an escalating tit for tat with a bunch of head-to-head competitors. We're not in a beer business or the car business or the insurance business, we're all alone in a multi-trillion dollar asset class. So we're pretty excited about, we think it's good.And our next question from Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. Please go ahead. -- Hi, guys. Good afternoon. -- Good afternoon, Andrew. -- Lots to absorb as usual. One of the things I think you touched on Andy in LoopNet is the changing behavior of commercial property owners and managers and more of a focus on online. What if you could provide a little texture around that, and why you think we're at a tipping point and what specifically you're doing at LoopNet to capture that opportunity. May not get as much air time or attention as that at the big marketing spend in multi-family, but it sounds like a structural change in the market you're addressing? -- Yes, it is. So I've had the good fortune to spend a couple of decades in the industry, and I was there back in a completely offline side then you see it move into unsophisticated online where there was an area where online marketing commercial real estate meant that you save $0.55 on a staff when you send your flyers, a PDF to the brokers and staff.But really what's happened is we could see as clear as day is you look at the traffic coming into LoopNet, LoopNet's got 80 some percent share of the folks looking for commercial property coming through. And we through reverse IPs and through Google analytics, we can get an idea of who these folks are and they're pretty much the Fortune 100, they're Walmart, they're Amazon, it's McDonald's, that's all the major tenants, it's the big law firms just like people are using the Internet and everything from dating to buying a house, to buying a car, buying insurance. Everything they do, people are looking for commercial real estate. And they should not -- Facebook is a client of ours, it should not surprise anybody that Facebook goes on the Internet to look for commercial space, right?But it does surprise the industry, because the industry is trying to figure out is locked into a historical marketing mindset of you can't market to end users. There's just too many of them. And it's just not possible in traditional methods to do it. But the whole digital folks searching out on the Internet rather than you going out and try to market to them, they come to you, and we're producing the tools where the owners could be visible when they come looking for them.So I'm very bullish on it. I think it is just an identifiable mathematical certainty that it's occurring, but -- and so we're going to push that and we're going to create awareness with folks how it's happening. And I think it's pretty interesting opportunity, because the broker, broker models pretty good at the 30,000 foot, 50,000 foot size, but it doesn't work so well when you get below 10,000 feet, and that's where the majority of transactions are.So we're going to push on it. We're going to see, I believe, we'll see success in it, and I'm pretty excited about it. But it doesn't happen overnight. We're rebuilding LoopNet. We can see it when you go look at the site, you can look at some office buildings for lease and at certain stage, you'll see that we're no longer presenting the data like to simply Craigslist where you're just presenting raw data. We're now paying attention to how the buildings are branded online and the image they present, and the image of the architect, the image of the owner, the image of the brokers.And so we're not just presenting them. We're controlling the kind of frequency they get by controlling where they sort, the size of placard, we're controlling the branding, the reach. And so I think we're producing what will be the most powerful marketing tools the industry has ever seen, and I think it's going to be exciting revenue opportunity. And it's pretty much I think about it half a day.Thanks. We'll go to Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. -- So congratulations on closing the STR deal. -- Thank you very much, Bill. -- So the question I have for you is on LoopNet. Maybe you could talk a little bit about the pricing asset being applied to the real estate brokers and then the pricing as it applies to the owners. And you gave the -- an update on the TAM for multifamily at 8 billion to 10 billion. I was hoping we could get an update on LoopNet TAM as well? -- Yes. So the -- again the way LoopNet was historically marketed. It was geared to brokers just because LoopNet one of the stand-alone company had no Research Department and needed to get content via the broker ads. So they would sell buckets of ads to brokers at super low prices. Brokers have a relatively small economic interest in the transactions. They typically -- the LoopNet as were purchased by broker who was pooling 1.5% of the economics themselves. And unlike in honor, the actual price achieved and the sale or a lease transaction isn't nearly as leverage for the broker as it is for the owner.So brokers have small budgets. Remember when we first picked up LoopNet part of the average ad price was $6 a building. We are now seeing owners who have 95% of deal economics, and who are willing to pay the sort of the top have walked -- videos of walked in building, want to pay for drone videos, willing to pay for larger placards. Those folks are willing to pay price points at 5,000, 6,000. Remember, we were selling ads to owners and print were up to 12,000 up to 50,000 a building.So we're just -- we're migrating and it's not something we're doing in conflict with the brokers. The brokers like what we're doing because the brokers get promoted since they're the ones representing this building. So the owners paying to promote their building get broader reach for the building and frequency in exposure and branding and that also carries that list brokers too. So it's sort of fun when you can be raising prices by shifting to a different segment with a different value proposition for what you're producing and not alienating anybody. So that's what we're doing.In terms of the TAM, we haven't really recalculated that but we're at -- we are under 200 million now on that. We were roughly about 160 million and the last calculated on this was between 2 billion and 2.5 billion -- top of the envelope version. So we haven't updated that lightly, but as we get further into the selling and we see the take rates and the full sales force behind the products that we launched over this next few months, we will probably be able to update that as we get into the -- mid part of next year. And that's just looking at the marketing side of it. There's -- there are a number of things we perceive industry we find valuable, like reducing their workload in sub 2,000-foot leases. So we're comfortable that it's a pretty big TAM, and that we have a lead on it.We have a question from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. -- Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. -- Hi. -- You're planning to increase your Apartments.com marketing spend by $100 million in 2020, which amounts to about 600 basis points of margin headwind. You mentioned earlier that you expect margins to decline by about 400 basis points next year. So can you discuss where you expect positive margin offsets to confirm? Whether it's from productivity gains or cost cutting elsewhere in the business? -- Yes. There's a certain amount -- George that we'll spend each year. You know outside of marketing, it's natural to the business. Heads we've added this year. Salary increases those things. They'll go into next year, but they won't go as fast as these increases in marketing. So our forecast now looks at around 36% margin at the midpoint for 2019. So if you take into account extra $100 million in marketing and then the rest of those costs will say personal cost and related nearly will grow nearly as fast. And so that will provide a bit of an offset.So in the end of the day we'd expect to have about that 400 basis point drop off the 36 as a rough guide. Now obviously, they'll be some variety around that when we get into specific planning and we'll share that in February. But that's really where we are. We don't see there needs to be a bunch of cost cuts out there. It's more of -- it's managing after we've done a nice bit of investing this year, our cost base into next year.Our next question will be from Pete Christiansen with Citi. Please go ahead. -- Good afternoon. Thanks, guys. Andy, how can you -- it's obviously, a huge step up in marketing spend here, make sense to lean in at this time, but how can you ensure you get the right efficiency when you're trying to target the eye or independent owner category versus the broader category? How do you ensure that you get that efficiency? What's the strategy more like... -- That's a really good question, and that is right on target. It's something I think a lot about. And I sort of have a simple answer, which is, we're not targeting the I/O strategy. We are -- we can look -- we're targeting general awareness. We're targeting making sure that we're capturing increasing percentage in share of the renters hitting Internet, regardless whether they go to institutional property or to a low-end property. That creates value and it's hard to -- and it's really not that easy to mess up on that. We have an experienced strong team on handling our SCM on Apartments. We have a good sense of what the good keywords are, good neighborhoods and the like. So, that one is a pretty safe investment. That's driving demand to our clients.Secondarily, we are -- we've broken open on this middle market opportunity. So we have gotten great penetration of the larger sized properties, really good institution at 100 unit plus to 200 unit plus, but we are selling 10,000 plus ads in an area that folks never really knew existed, which is the five units to 100 unit community. So, we are just trying to create general awareness for the person that's got a 30 unit apartment building, and softening the road for the hundreds of folks we got in the apartment sales force, selling exactly the same thing we've been selling successfully. So, it's just creating awareness in the same way for the same folks.Now as a derivative of that, it has a side benefit of supporting our I/O effort, because as they become aware of the site, you see that pickup rate where someone puts an apartment -- onto Apartments.com for lease. They select the renter tools. At this early stage, we're seeing 36% opt-in. So, just awareness -- general awareness of the site will support the I/O initiative. And when we run focused groups, we're getting positive feedback from both the renter and the small owner on what we're offering. We're getting extremely positive feedback from the renter.And so, our primary concern is just to make sure that we have a large pool of owners opting into the tools so that the renters can take advantage of them. So we're thinking a lot about it. A lot of it is very basic blocking and tackling, blocking and tackling of low risk and then what we're doing is we're fine tuning the messaging, creating awareness among the 300,000 folks with apartment buildings that we haven't sold too, and we hope to sell to over the next couple of years. So lot of money.And we'll go next to Ryan Tomasello with KBW. Your line is open. -- Hi. Good evening, everyone. The revenue profile of the businesses is obviously, involve a lot over the past three years, and it seems like that will definitely continue to be the case as Apartments.com's reach, expands the prospect for LoopNet owner initiative seems strong, and of course, the push into hospitality with STR.So Andy, I was hoping you could provide us with your updated thoughts on the resiliency of the business model through a downturn as these new businesses grow? And how your efforts to manage the revenue quality of the business are perhaps governing your decisions with respect to new investments across the CoStar platform? -- Sure. So, I mean, it's an important question. We are obviously, in a very mature cycle. I went through the market economics for CRE right now and they -- when you say they can't get better, they get better. And then they get better. So we're not seeing any weakness in the CRE industry however, just common senses says that we're not at the end of cycles.So, we -- one of the things I do like is that if you look at the CoStar information revenue stream, it is -- a lot of that revenue is now coming from banks and major owners. And when you go into a cycle, banks stepped up. They're buying typically. They don't reduce it. So, that is a stabilizing influence. And we are -- we continue having gone through 2008. We continue to discourage salespeople putting a lot of energy into plant, water and companies, and moving companies, and other companies that evaporate in the cycle. And we put effort into major owners, banks, investors, who tend to have more demand in the cycle.Now, we operated Showcase and we can observe LoopNet in a cycle. And there's a little bit of counter cyclicality there, where when you've got $150 million, but that looses a tenant, you're willing to spend thousands a month to try to replace that vacancy. And what we hear from people who have operated the apartment business through cycles is that, this is actually the worst cycle to be in, right. These are so low and, well, they can increase people's budgets, go up for marketing apartments. That makes sense.You do in a cycle get complete bankruptcies. But then, that's quickly followed by someone picking up the asset with an unlimited marketing budget, which is a wonderful thing to see. The STR revenue, we believe is very resilient. The renewal rates there are shockingly high. So we think there's some resilience there. And it's a basic operating metric being used by the hotels between their -- from their sales manager, general manager to the flags, brands and investors. It's something that is a utility. And it's not something that they have the optionality to shut off in a down cycle, even if -- unless they just simply don't exist anymore. So, we've done well in past cycles.We don't -- I think, we drop -- CoStar's sales drop 3% in 2008, which is remarkable, given the scope of it. And I think we're pretty diversified and pretty resilient when the next one comes. And there's the offsetting thought, which is, when you go into a cycle, it's a wonderful time to buy really good companies at a big discount, which we really look forward to.We'll go next to Mayank Tandon with Needham & Company. Please go ahead. -- Thank you. Good evening. I know that you give the margin guidance, but you could at least qualitatively talk about the revenue outlook for next year, just in the context of should we expect the growth to accelerate, given the investments or will that be more of a 2021 scenario? And then should we look at the 2019 growth rates across the different product lines, may be a baseline for 2020? -- Yes. Thanks, Mayank. It's always a tricky spot and we're in the third quarter. We don't have our specific guidance ready to forecast or budget prepared for 2020. I alluded in my comments to continuing growth next year like we've seen this year, which certainly what we've been planning for and investing for.And we expect certainly with the increased investments in marketing to help underpin that. What we more look out was, we gave that 5-year outlook previously, and obviously, when you make a new marketing investment, you want to be sure that the business one can absorb it, make it invested effectively, and then the outcomes of that will get us more assurance that we'll hit those goals. And I think as we work through that exercise, you could see just by the scale of the business were now you can invest $100 million and you may take a bit of a margin drag on that.But with the size and the speed of our growth, you could recover that margin drag within a year and then go back on top of it quickly in the second year out. Now these are all financial models. They're not plans or budgets yet. So I don't want to get out ahead of ourselves on what that means. But we certainly expect that these investments will continue the growth rates where we are and we want them to move us forward into the mid-later part of next year and really see the benefits of them into 2021. And so we have to invest now to get that to happen. Hopefully, that helps, give you some direction on how we think about it.Our next question from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. -- Yeah. Thanks. Hi, guys. -- Good evening, Sterling. -- Good evening. On the marketing, Andy, you've said the number of times that this actually is the tougher time of the multifamily cycle where occupancy rates are so high, vacancies are so low. So, is the incremental investment more tied to just where you think the competitive position is? So you can just take a disproportionate amount of market share because of the healthier competitors? And it's not about the cycle, or is it in preparation for to have vacancy rates rise in 2020 not only the competitive position but maybe get a little bit of a tailwind from the cycle as well? -- Sterling, it's -- the primary driver is not an upcoming sense of a cycle. Though that is true, you'd want to have greater awareness and broader share. It's more the first thing you said, which is, it's an open field. There is a clear massive transition from offline to online for the apartment industry. We're the leader and each time we gain more information about what the market looks like, we think it's bigger than we anticipated and we want to -- you use the word get disproportionate share, we don't believe in the word disproportionate share. We believe in the word a lot of share and nothing's disproportionate.We're just going to get a lot of share, and that we just think it's the -- relatively speaking it is a period or a time in the evolution of the industry where you can buy at the cheapest price you can possibly buy it. Just because no one's bidding for it really aggressively, no one's fighting for it really aggressively. We're, sort of, alone in this space right now, or we're not alone in this space right now, but people don't seem to be investing in it even though there's a lot of player's out there.We have a question from Stephen Sheldon with William Blair. Please go ahead. -- Great. Thanks. It's actually Josh on for Stephen. -- Hey, Josh. -- Hey. Just want to get your quick thoughts on the delayed timeline of ASC 842? And how it might impact Real Estate Manager results for the rest of the year? And then is there anything else that you guys are watching that could act as a headwind or tailwind to the adoption of that product over the near-term? Thanks. -- Yeah. Sure. The delay of the adoption certainly gives you a little bit of a trough now as people may back-off a bit. We think that will -- they will tick back-up next year when more of the requirements come in. The effect of that now is we believe we're losing that implementation revenue that the one-time that is going backwards. But it's nice to see the subscription piece still growing over 40%.So, we expect that will all moderate out in to the 15% to 20% growth range over time. And then, it's really the future growth for that business will be less dependent on the accounting teams, and what they do and more around how we integrate it with CoStar, and we provide more services and tools for their clients to use the rest of CoStar in managing their real estate portfolios. And that should fuel the growth of Real Estate Manager much longer and more effectively than the near-term effects of the accounting teams. -- Great. With that, I believe we have no more questions. And thank you very much for joining us for the third quarter earnings call. And we look forward to updating you on our progress at the year-end -- at year-end call in February. -- In February. -- It's a big thing. It's exciting. -- Happy holidays, everyone. -- Thank you, everyone, for joining us. And we won't see you until you're through Thanksgiving and the holidays, December holidays, Christmas, New Year's and everything else, but we'll see you soon.[Operator Closing Remarks] --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --

Additionally, management now expects adjusted EBITDA of $498 million to $505 million and adjusted earnings per share of $10.00 to $10.14, up from its prior forecast of $495 million to $505 million and $9.90 to $10.10. For the third quarter, CoStar's guidance includes:""Given our very strong results in the first half of 2019, we plan to raise the level of marketing investment in Apartments.com in the second half of 2019 accelerating the rate at which we are capturing market share,"" Florance said.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

So, make it a good one.I will now turn the call over to Andy Florance. Andy? -- Thank you, Richard. -- You're welcome. -- Thank you for joining us for CoStar Group's second quarter 2019 . In this, the week is the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 million landing, a slightly more impressive feat than our second quarter earnings, slightly.In the second quarter 2019, CoStar Group total revenue was $344 million, up 16% year-over-year. That's $7 million above the upper end of our guidance for the second quarter, so this is one of our biggest revenue beats.We had our best sales quarter ever, generating $59 million in the companywide net new bookings, an increase of 32% year-over-year. The primary driver behind our exceptional sales result was a much better-than-expected Apartments.com sales. Apartments.com net new bookings alone increased 122% year-over-year in the second quarter of 2019. In each of the past three quarters, Apartments.com has beaten all prior sales records for a quarter, with the second quarter of 2019 and the first quarter, Apartments.com net sales bookings were up 44%.In my experience, there are very few times when you get the monthly sales close numbers and are stunned by how big the number is. And this was one of those quarters repeatedly. The Apartments.com sales team is performing exceptionally well, is operating at the highest productivity level we've ever achieved. We expect to reach $0.5 billion annualized revenue run rate milestone for Apartments.com next quarter.This is a major milestone for us, given that we purchased Apartments.com in 2014, with only $86 million of revenue there. From that point of acquisition five years ago to now, we have grown Apartments.com at over 40% compound annual growth rate. We believe that we have every opportunity to continue this exceptional growth rate.CoStar Suite revenue growth was strong and crossed the $600 million revenue run rate in the second quarter. We now have over 150,000 individual subscribers to CoStar Suite. Net new bookings were up 26% from Q1 of this year. Our quarter-over-quarter US CoStar Suite revenue growth of 3.5% and our year-over-year US CoStar Suite revenue growth of 15.1% are right in line with our five-year averages.I find it valuable to look at the revenue generated by our core US sales force, our CoStar sales force, which is US CoStar Suite combined with LoopNet Premium Lister subscriptions. The quarter-over-quarter growth for this combination was 3.7% and the year-over-year was 15.7%. The 3.7% quarter-over-quarter growth rate is exactly our five-year average.The year-over-year growth number is above the five-year average of 15.5%. We are growing the CoStar sales force, which we believe will support future acceleration in bookings. We entered 2019 with 213 reps in production. We now have 262, and we hope to reach 300 reps selling CoStar and LoopNet by the end of the year.We hired approximately 50 additional sales reps that are going into production over the next three months. We believe that they will impact sales results about nine months after going into production. We saw strong sales of LoopNet Premium Lister product in the second quarter, with net new bookings up 46% quarter-over-quarter.Real Estate Manager net new bookings dropped 40% quarter-over-quarter and 6% year-over-year because the booking increases of the prior year had reached so high level of 400%. Overall, revenue growth was great for Real Estate Manager as total subscription revenue climbed 75% year-over-year and 24% quarter-over-quarter.Net new bookings for our land business was up 27% quarter-over-quarter and net new bookings for our business for sale marketplaces was up 36% quarter-over-quarter. It's important not to overlook the tremendous value of these smaller or mid-sized businesses CoStar Real Estate Manager lands and BizBuySell.This quarter five years ago, those three businesses combined had annualized revenue of $28 million. This quarter, they combined annualized revenue of $108 million. They have grown at a really impressive compound annual growth rate of 31% for five years. They're very profitable, and they have more than seven times or eight times the revenue that CoStar had in total the year we went public.We continue to focus on prioritizing and selling subscription-based services with high renewal rates over selling one-off services with non-reoccurring revenue. Subscription-based revenue has grown to comprise 82% of our overall revenue. As of the second quarter 2019, our trailing 12-month subscription revenue grew 25% year-over-year, which is faster than our revenue growth overall. And for the first time, we crossed a billion dollars of subscription revenue on a trailing 12-month basis. We continue to show strong growth in profitability. Net income for the second quarter 2019 was $63 million, an increase of 44% over net income of $44 million for the second quarter of 2018. EBITDA for the second quarter was $94 million, an increase of 45% versus EBITDA of $64 million for the second quarter of 2018.With strong cash flow, our balance sheet is stronger than ever, with $1.3 billion in cash and no debt. As reported by comScore, Apartments.com continues to pull further away from the competition as we increase our industry-leading position among Internet listing services by achieving all-time highs in unique visitors and number of visits.In the second quarter, the Apartments.com network had 175 million visits, up 21% year-over-year. The huge renter traffic we have built there is very valuable, particularly the clients with newly construct properties in the lease-up phase. Today, 70% of apartments that have delivered in the last two years are advertising with us.But some properties need more exposure and are willing to pay an additional fee to soar even higher up on our site to get more leads. To meet this demand, we have recently begun selling a new higher tiered advertising level called Diamond Plus, very creative naming. This ad package guarantees the advertiser placement in the top three search results in a given submarket.In the second quarter, we sold $6 million in Diamond Plus ads at an average of approximately 3,600 per month, with apartment communities in some markets paying as much as $7,500 per month. That's a new exciting price point for us. This stands in sharp contrast with our primary competitor, RentPath, who began advertising $99 a month ads if you buck social media with them. That price is 1.75th of our Diamond Plus price point. I think that tells you everything you need to know about the competitive landscape. Given the success of our Diamond Plus offering, we have decided to introduce a plus option in each of our platinum, gold and silver categories. We plan to offer the plus ads at fixed price with little to no discounting.In June, we purchased Off Campus Partners, a leading online multifamily marketplace service for student housing in the United States. There are over 17 million college students in need of housing near universities and they're paying approximately $100 billion in rent annually. Often their parents assist with these rent payments. We believe Apartments.com has a unique opportunity to develop a long lasting connection with students as they move into other stages in their lives to become renters Off Campus.Off Campus Partners enters into exclusive subscription agreements with universities to provide an Off-Campus housing listing service used by students, parents, faculty and staff. Currently, it has existing contracts with approximately 130 universities servicing over two million Off-Campus students. These units of university partners include the likes of University of Michigan, Harvard, VCU, Clemson, Berkeley, University of Pennsylvania and most importantly of all, an exceptional University Princeton.We believe that this massive market with tremendous opportunities for us to partner with more universities and attract more advertisers, especially small independent owners. The majority of Off Campus Partners' advertisers are independent owners who are excellent candidates for our new online leasing features such as screening applications, digital leases and payments, which we plan to offer next quarter on Apartments.com.We are also planning to release a student housing upgrade to our CoStar multifamily analytic solution. We believe this additional information will be very valuable to student housing, investors, property managers, lenders and developers.We had a strong Apartments.com sales success at the National Apartment Association Annual Conference in Denver this year held in May. It was attended by over 10,000 property managers who are our prime targets and prospects and clients. Once again, Apartments.com was front and center with an amazing presence, and we attracted more than 4,000 visitors to our booth. The Apartments.com sales force met with 916 property managers over the course of the two-day conference in Denver.As I mentioned, we bought Apartments.com in 2014, we had approximately 17,000 paying properties. Nearly 90% of those properties were from communities of 100 units or more. Today, we have just over 50,000 paying communities and nearly 13,500 of those properties are in a smaller 1 unit to 99 unit property size range. We have successfully grown our annual multifamily revenue from $86 million in 2014 to a run rate that we expect to reach $500 million later this year.During that time, we increased our penetration rate in the market six-fold from 2% to approximately 12%, or an average penetration growth of about 200 basis points per year. This has truly been an amazing success story as we lead the industry in revenue, lead generation for our clients and traffic. In the last 18 months, our Apartments.com sales have been accelerating as we added more salespeople.From the beginning of 2018 to today, we went from roughly 220 Apartments.com sales reps to 265, a 20% increase that generate a staggering 122% increase in net bookings year-over-year in the second quarter. This sales force is on fire and they have set all-time high bookings in the last three quarters in a row. We want to build on that incredible momentum, and plan to reinvest some of our outstanding performance or our outperformance back into the business to capture more market share more rapidly.With the current size of the Apartments.com sales force, they spend approximately 85% of their time with existing clients and only have about 15% of their time available to prospect for completely new clients. As a result, we estimate that our sales force has only made contact with 3.5% of our good new business prospects in the past 12 months. This means there are hundreds of thousands of apartment communities we could sell to that our sales team has not yet had the bandwidth to reach.We believe that we can dramatically increase our 12% penetration and add billions of revenue by among, other things, growing the sales force. It's obvious to us we need more salespeople, so we plan to add another 100 apartment salespeople into an outbound sales team based in Richmond, effectively increasing the size of our apartment sales team by nearly 40% to about 370 people.We do not believe this will require significantly more investment. We have offset most of the additional headcount costs by eliminating 120 researcher positions this month from Atlanta. Those researchers were community callers and were tasked with finding properties with availabilities that we would place on Apartments.com for free. They added tens of thousands of units a year. This was great for the property managers who didn't have to pay for these ads.Given the enormous amount of traffic on Apartments.com, these free ads which would serve below our paid ads would often generate more leads to these non-paying property managers, then those property managers would see from their paid ads on competing Internet listing sites. When we first relaunched Apartments.com, we needed to include this free content to draw renters in. But at this point, we have grown our content and traffic many times over and now no longer need to spend so much money giving valuable advertising away.We believe by adding 100 salespeople, we will add tens of thousands of paid community ads maintained by the advertisers rather than by researchers. In effect, we are exchanging researchers for salespeople and we think we'll end up with more data and more revenue. We believe the opportunity is gigantic. There are 345,000 mid-sized apartment properties in that 5 unit to 99 unit size range, and we estimate that we have less than 4% penetration in these properties. The opportunity is virtually untapped.The good news is that we've been successfully selling at this level, so there's a proven demand for our advertising solution. We feel the online leasing tools we plan to offer will further the appeal of Apartments.com to these mid-sized apartment communities.Intensified marketing is the second area where we intend to reinvest our outperformance back into Apartments.com in order to accelerate our market share capture. We see a clear path to providing even dramatically more lead flow into the industry than our competitors. And by doing so, we expect to achieve a compelling ROI and build a durable, long-term leadership position.Our primary competitors' balance sheet is the polar opposite of our balance sheet. RentPath has more than $0.5 billion of debt and is handcuffed with tens of millions of dollars in interest payments, so they do not have the ability to invest and to drive more lease for their clients the way we do.According to Debtwire, their first quarter 2019 adjusted EBITDA cratered, as it dropped 34.5% and it underscored their liquidity pressures. Their second lien has been trading below $0.20 on a $1. Given roughly in a 11% coupon on that second lien, yielding about $0.11 a year, a likely go-way payment would be achieved in a default or bankruptcy from the first lien holders paying the second lien holders $0.05 to $0.10. And yeah, there was some option value and number of people believe that the RentPath's second lien debt holders think there's about a year until RentPath could default, but who knows. But it seems like a good time to accelerate our investment in order to increase competitive pressure and capture more market share.LoopNet remains the clear number one site in commercial real estate for advertising properties for sale or for lease. In the second quarter, we averaged 5.8 million unique visitors per month, up 19% year-over-year. Historically, LoopNet has not materially monetized premium adds the way Apartments.com does. We're hard at work deploying to LoopNet a number of viable successful lessons we've learned from Apartments.com.We believe that in the future, these significant enhancements to LoopNet will allow us to dramatically accelerate our revenue growth there. We are making our premium, gold, platinum and diamond ads even more valuable. We're adding maps, demographic information, local transportation and more. We're also giving prominence and exclusivity to listing broker in our firm.Visually, we're featuring the premium ads with excellent photography, 3D walk-throughs and video. In addition to our efforts from our 160 field researchers who create visual content for LoopNet listings, we're in the process of adding a number of highly skilled professional architectural photographers who will bring these buildings to life in our ads. Our portfolio research team is helping to promote the LoopNet listings by adding original written content about the properties in the neighborhoods they're located.The landing pages continue to improve in functionality, appearance and content. We're adding content we believe will be valuable to LoopNet's target audience of tenants and small investors. You should head over to LoopNet in a few months as new enhancements roll-out over the course of the next year .I've been fortunate to witness first-hand an amazing transformation of the commercial real estate industry over the past 30 years. Digital marketing has moved from being virtually non-existent to being an absolutely essential necessity, a real critical part of selling or leasing properties .The good news for CoStar is that we own the most valuable digital real estate at the crossroads of commercial real estate and digital marketing. We have the largest audience of potential tenants, investors on LoopNet and the largest audience of brokers on CoStar. The commercial real estate professional needs to market their properties where this audience is.In the past, our researchers' primary value proposition to our clients was the information they gathered for them. While the data we gather is still the foundation of our business, the marketing opportunities our platform affords is becoming the prime value proposition we offer industry professionals.We used to reach out to brokers to collect most of our information. Now it's flipped and many brokers come online and bring listings to us. Brokers continue to adopt our CoStar Listing Manager tool, allowing them to update listings directly into the CoStar database. It has been nearly two years since we initiated Listing Manager and usage continues to increase.52% of all spaces were added online by users in the second quarter 2019. We now have over 41,000 power users who are updating their listings monthly. CoStar Listening Managers are providing greater convenience to our clients and at a much lower cost to us than our historical data collection methods.Our move to Richmond has been an amazing success and is transforming how we collect and present data. We're having more collaborative and productive conversations with our clients. This increases the quality of our data immensely and builds stronger relationships with our users. As a result, one of the recent changes we've made in the research department is updating the researchers titles to better reflect our marketing focus and expertise. The researcher job title is now Marketing Research Advisor.Additionally, as we further establish Richmond as our marketing researcher headquarters, all East Coast research opportunities are being consolidated into our Richmond office. We believe this will lead to better collaboration and synergies among the research teams and significant cost savings.In addition, since the development teams that build our research systems are in Richmond, this consolidation creates more opportunities for our marketing, research and technology teams to work hand in hand to build the most efficient back-end systems.We believe this will also create additional career growth opportunities for our Marketing Research Advisors. As a result, we are relocating the 145 Marketing Research Advisor positions currently in Washington DC and the multifamily research positions in Atlanta, to Richmond. We will soon have close to 950 people based in Richmond.Commercial real estate activity continues to grow. Leasing volume and investment activity in the second quarter of 2019 rank among the strongest quarters on record. We believe the high level of interest to be justified given the sector's sound fundamentals.Vacancy rates are in the single digits across all sectors and supply remains limited. And compared to low prevailing interest rates, returns in commercial and multifamily real estate offer compelling relative value. The US economy, at large, set a post-war record in the second quarter of 2019, reaching 105 months of consecutive job growth. And recent data releases show ongoing strength.In turn, US commercial real estate has enjoyed 36 quarters of positive demand among the longest periods on record. In the property markets, apartment rent growth has accelerated once again, posting gains about 3%. We believe the ongoing health of the apartment sector relates to the broad and growing shortage of housing in the United States.In particular, insufficient supply of new-for-sale housing units has limited homebuying and led to the unprecedented level of apartment demand. In response to this demand, the apartment construction has risen to levels not seen since the 80s.CoStar tracked about 300,000 units delivered over the past 12 months and we're tracking nearly 675,000 apartment units under construction. The large majority of these developments rely on Apartments.com to market those units.In the office sector, the national vacancy rate has fallen below 10% for the first time since 2000. In spite of the limited space available, leasing has consistently set new records as the large tech firms continue to expand beyond their Silicon Valley and Seattle footprints.New office construction has been limited but impactful. Mega projects at Hudson Yards in New York, the Seaport in Boston, South of Market in San Francisco and the H Street NoMa quarter in DC and the West Loop in Chicago, have upended gateway markets and forced landlords of traditional CBD product to compete for signature tenants.As a result, rent growth has trended at just 2%, despite the single digit vacancy rates. This is not to turn investors. Deal volume last quarter could set a second quarter record. In the industrial sector, demand remains at historically high levels, driven by the ongoing trend among toward same-day delivery, which requires regional local distribution close to population centers.However, vacancy rates appear to have bottomed out mid-heavy supply and have edged higher from the 5% low. Rent growth continues to trend above 5%, and investment continues to favor the industrial sector in those small for our -- for the development or redevelopment potential for infill product.Based on our property-level value estimates, we believe industrial prices rose by 7% year-by-year, leading all property types. In the retail sector, negative headlines around store closings in the shrinking share of brick-and-mortar sales obscures the sector's superb fundamentals. We estimate retail vacancies are below 5%, the lowest across the property types.And construction under way amounts to less than 1% of current stock, with the record levels of interest in commercial real estate and multifamily real estate to continue. To meet the complex needs of the industry, CoStar Group offers products and services designed to help owners, lenders, brokers, investors and property managers realize successful outcomes in any economic climate.We've had a tremendous start to 2019, with an exceptional second quarter. I'm extremely excited about the rest of this year as we continue to execute on our long-term vision within a great company.At this point, I will turn the call over to our CFO, Scott Wheeler, who will among other things, hopefully reiterate that net income for the second quarter was $63 million, an increase of 44% over the second. Our balance sheet is strong with $1.3 million in cash and no debt. And very importantly that we had our best sales quarter ever, with $59 million in bookings. But what CoStar investors ever get tired of hearing about all of that? -- That's a great story. Thank you, Andy. We certainly didn't have a terrific first half of the year, but I am going to try not to repeat that our net income for the second quarter was $63 million, an increase of 44% over the second quarter of '18. I also will not say again that our balance sheet is stronger than ever, with $1.3 billion in cash and no debt. And I'm certainly not going to tell people that we just turned in our best sales quarter ever with $59 million in bookings. That's your job.So, let me start with our revenue performance by services. CoStar Suite revenue growth remained strong at 14% in the second quarter of 2019 versus second quarter of 2018. Revenue growth rate for CoStar Suite is expected to be in the 12% to 13% range for the full year of 2019, modest improvement over our expectations we told you last quarter.Revenue in Information Services grew 33% year-over-year in the second quarter of 2019, primarily as a result of CoStar Real Estate Manager revenue growth of 57% year-over-year. This includes both the subscription revenue growth of 75% that Andy mentioned and the one-time implementation revenue growth of 25% for new customer implementations.The first half 2019 growth of Real Estate Manager exceeded our expectations, as companies continued to implement our solutions for the new lease accounting standards. As we move further past the lease accounting standard adoption dates, we expect growth rates for Real Estate Manager to slow in total for the second half of the year, as subscription revenues continue to grow but one-time implementation revenues will decline.Information Services revenue is now expected to grow at a rate of 15% to 17% on a year-over-year basis in 2019, which is 400 basis points above the growth rate range we indicated last quarter. Multifamily revenue growth for the second quarter remained strong at 15% over the second quarter of 2018, slightly higher than our expectations.As mentioned last quarter, we expected a lower growth rate in the second quarter as we have fully lapped the anniversary date of our ForRent acquisition and we have a negative effect of certain duplicative revenues and discontinued products from ForRent that were evident in our 2018 results.With the strong sales results this quarter, I'm increasingly confident that the multifamily revenue growth rates in the third and fourth quarters of 2019 will meet or exceed 20%. The full-year 2019 revenue growth rates for multifamily is expected in the 20% to 21% range.Commercial property and land revenue grew 16% year-over-year in the second quarter of 2019. All of our marketplace businesses including LoopNet, lands and business for sale are delivering solid growth in the mid to upper teens, which we expect to continue and increase in the second half of the year. Accordingly, we expect year-over-year organic growth in commercial property and land in the 17% to 19% range for 2019.Gross margins came in at 79% in the second quarter of 2019, slightly increasing from 78% gross margins we achieved in the first quarter of 2019. This is a result of very strong cost leverage. Our revenues increased $15 million in the second quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter, but our cost of revenue only increased $1 million sequentially. We now expect our overall gross margins of approximately 79% for the full year of 2019.Our operating expenses were $197 million for the second quarter of 2019, which was in line with our expectations, including the higher seasonal marketing spend we experienced in the second quarter. Our second quarter adjusted EBITDA of $110 million represents a 29% increase compared to adjusted EBITDA of $85 million in the second quarter of 2018.Second quarter adjusted EBITDA was approximately $8 million above the top end of our guidance range. Stronger revenue was the main driver of the positive variances. The resulting adjusted EBITDA margins of 32% is 220 basis points above the midpoint of our guidance range and 340 basis points above the 25.9% margin we achieved in the second quarter of 2018.Net income for the second quarter of 2019 of $63 million increased 44%, or $19 million compared to Q2 2018. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 21%, reflecting benefits associated with share-based payment transactions and R&D credits.Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter increased 35% to $82 million, or $2.23 per diluted share and includes adjustments for stock-based compensation, acquisition-related expenses and some restructuring costs associated with the organizational changes in Apartments.com and research that Andy mentioned. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter assumes a tax rate of 25%, which does not include discrete items such as the impact of the share-based payment transactions.We acquired Off Campus Partners in June for approximately $16 million subject to standard post-closing adjustments. We're currently working our product integration plans with Apartments.com as well as business and financial integrations. Although strategically important, the impact of the acquisition to our financial statements for 2019 is not material.Now, we'll look at some of the performance metrics for the quarter. As Andy noted, we absolutely crushed it in sales this quarter, with net new sales of $59 million. That's for Andy to talk about. This was exceptionally strong in multifamily. Also contributing to the big sales numbers this quarter were our two biggest industry conferences of the year, the ICSC Real Estate Conference and the NCAA Apartments Conference, both were in the second quarter.As you know, we don't provide guidance on future sales, given seasonal and other fluctuations quarter-to-quarter, but we're very focused on reinvesting for long-term sales and revenue growth. Suffice it to say, we're very happy with the sales results across the business and the direction in which we are heading.At the end of the second quarter of 2019, our sales force totaled approximately 779 people, reflecting growth in the CoStar Suite field sales force that we talked about last quarter. We expect to continue growing the CRE sales force this year, with the productivity of new sellers typically ramping up over the next nine months or so.The renewal rate on annual contracts for the second quarter of 2019 was in line with the same rate we achieved in the first quarter of 2019 at 90%. The renewal rate for the quarter for customers who've been subscribers for five years or longer was 95%, slightly below the renewal rate of 96% in the first quarter. This is the first quarter that we've included multifamily five-year subscribers, which is a reason for the modest dilution from Q1.Subscription revenue on annual contracts accounts for 82% of our revenue in the second quarter, up from 77% this time last year. The improvements are primarily the result of successfully migrating the ForRent customer base to our Apartments.com network, strong sales and annual contracts.I'll now discuss the outlook for the year and the third quarter of 2019. Based on the strong second quarter revenue and sales results, we are raising our revenue outlook for the year by $11 million at the midpoint to a range of $1.382 billion to $1.390 billion for the full year of 2019. This outlook reflects revenue growth for the year between 16% and 17%, up from the 15% to 16% we indicated last quarter.We expect revenue for the third quarter of 2019 in the range of $350 million to $354 million, representing top line growth in the range of 15% to 16%. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $498 million to $505 million for the full year of 2019, which is relatively unchanged from our previous guidance.As Andy discussed, exceptionally strong results and the market position of our multifamily business has us convinced that now is the time to reinvest increased revenue back into the business. [Indecipherable], we increased our marketing spend in the forecast for Apartments.com in the second half of 2019 by approximately $10 million.Consistent with our previous guidance, we expect adjusted EBITDA growth of approximately 20% year-over-year, adjusted EBITDA margins for the year of approximately 36%, up around 110 basis points in the midpoint of the range. For the third quarter of 2019, we expect adjusted EBITDA in a range of $123 million to $127 million. Margins are expected to increase sequentially in the third and the fourth quarters.In terms of earnings, we expect full-year non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $10 to $10.14, based on 36.6 million shares. Certainly great to see the $10 per share numbers coming into view this year, which if achieved would present compounded EPS growth of over 30% per year since 2016. For the third quarter of 2019, we expect non-GAAP net income to diluted share in a range of $2.44 to $2.52, based on 36.6 million shares.Overall, our CoStar team delivered a phenomenal first half of 2019. We're very well positioned to continue our strong revenue growth trajectory, to increase the level of growth investments for the future and continue to expand margins.With that, we will now open the call for questions.[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Peter Christiansen with Citi. Please go ahead. -- Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. And Rich, you are right about that replay. I had a question about the -- Andy, I think you were talking about, there is a portion of the Apartments.com network that is getting free ads, that is shutting off now, obviously, because of the success you've had on driving lead growth. Has that happened? Is that going to happen? And then when is that going to happen? What's the timeline? And what are you kind of expecting for those free ads turning into paid ads? -- So it's happening in phases. Some of it has happened. When we first relaunched, we were running free ads for communities at all sizes on, up to 250 units, be it [Phonetics] properties over 100 units. And as we started building up more and more content and more and more traffic, we started eliminating free ads above 200 units at above 150 units, at 100 units. And we just keep on bringing that level down. And as we do that, a significant number of those folks decide to go ahead and sign-up for Apartments.com and not lose that lead flow.So the communities below 100 units, that will roll out over the course of the remainder of the year and we will be trying to build up that inside sales force fast quickly enough to be able to pursue the leads that, that generates. So it will be flexible, but it will be six months to 12 months to eliminate the freeze below 100. Now we won't -- we will continue to carry the very small communities for free for quite some time. So the condo for rent, to the house for rent, the real small stuff. And I also want to reiterate that our second quarter had $59 million in bookings.And our next question is from Brett Huff with Stephens. Please go ahead. -- Good afternoon, guys. Congrats on a nice quarter. -- Thank you, Brett. -- Thanks, Brett. -- Great to see the bookings power that can be generated. I know that this had some real positives in the conferences and things like that helping. But one of the questions we get a lot is, as we look forward, the bookings should kind of trend higher. They've been kind of around the $50 million range, up until this quarter.As you look out in order to sort of think about supporting the growth rate that you guys have talked about over your long-term guidance, the Street is sort of baked in what looks to be, you need maybe $65 million or so a quarter starting sometime next year in order to drive the kind of revenue in the out years. How should we think about the sustainability of this $59 million number? Or should we expect it to come down a little bit because it was particularly good? And then just continue to rise. And if it rises, can you tell us what the drivers of that? Because I know some sales, some pricing, give us some sort of view into how those bookings probably rise over time? Thank you. -- Sure. So, I'm very excited about the Street expectations for bookings in the 60s next year, and I look forward to those earnings calls. It will be exciting. And we will repeat successful results throughout the earnings call. But the -- there are a number of different things that give you tailwinds as you go in to try to achieve those higher numbers.Like, we obviously don't know small fluctuation nuances from quarter-to-quarter. So the bookings next quarter, it could go up a little bit, it could go down a little bit. And it's not necessarily terribly material, which way it goes of slight increments. But the trend, I feel comfortable with expectations that it goes up. Again, growing the CoStar sales force materially, yeah, it is a big driver. There is no shortage of opportunity. So, penetration rates for the advertising on LoopNet, new products in LoopNet, taking owner product out there, new multifamily product, student housing, analytics on the CoStar side, a lot of opportunity there.Adding a 100 salespeople to Apartments.com, the expectation is that they would sell something and that would also drive the opportunity. And as we increase the marketing, we will increase the lead flow. And then looking at the numbers, our ability to successfully sell product to 200 unit communities, 100 unit communities, 75 unit communities, 50 unit communities, 40 unit communities, 30 unit communities, 10 unit communities, means that we've got a huge marketplace to sell to, and adding additional salespeople is going to give us that ability to go address that opportunity. And then the land business, the BizBuySell business and CoStar Real Estate Manager continues to hit on all cylinders. So, there is a lot of good tailwinds there and so we're not really shy of those expectations next year.Our next question comes from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. -- Good afternoon, everyone. -- Hi, Bill. -- So, I wanted to ask on the apartment side. If you could talk a little bit about the end-to-end digital solutions for the small landlords. Specifically, what services you're going to be providing there? The beta testing, how is that going and then what will the Q4 roll-out look like? -- Thank you, Bill. So, we're -- I'm actually on my way up to -- I'm just in from Tokyo, if you can't tell that I'm a little jet lagged. Heading up to Chicago for focus groups on that over the next couple of days, we're going to be interviewing small landlords tenants on that whole new products. So, that new product is providing an end-to-end leasing solution within Apartments.com, where someone marking their property at Apartments.com can elect for online leasing, which means renters can apply directly, digitally using our applications on Apartments.com for an apartment.We screen them for credit, criminal and prior evictions. If the landlord wants to move forward with the tenant and wants to move forward, they can enter into a digital lease on Apartments.com and then we can facilitate the rent payments on Apartments.com. We believe this will be particularly appealing to the smaller landlords that don't have these sorts of solutions.We also think it will be appealing to the renters because our price points for doing an online application is typically half of what the normal fees are and we are providing portability to the applications. So, a renter who applies to one property on Apartments.com can use that same application nearly instantly for any other community within 30 days.So, it's pretty exciting and we are going to be looking at how that reaction is going. But it's early. We're just rolling it out this quarter. We'll know more after the focus groups. But one of the things that I'm -- we're looking at now is we think it will have a big impact not just on the folks running a single house or condo, but we think it will be really helpful in helping us to sell more advertising to the middle-market, the folks with 20 units, 40 units, 50 units. And that will be sold through our inside -- the new inside sales force where they'll be really aggressively going after that sector.So it's -- it's rolling out in four, I think we added one more markets. I think it's rolling in five markets in the third quarter. And based on that, we will gear it up to additional markets in the fourth quarter, but we haven't really finalized how many. And one of the things we want to do is build up that inside sales team. So, we really focus our energy on the markets we're rolling it out in intensely, so that the -- there is enough people participating in the program that, that renter application portability between multiple communities has enough scale and mass that's particularly valuable. But we will tell you more -- we'll report in on the third quarter call. On the year-end call, we'll have more color on it. It's still little early. But man, it was a lot of work.Our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. -- Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. Commercial property and land revenue growth in the quarter decelerated to 16% year-over-year from 17% in 1Q despite easier year-ago comps. Can you discuss reasons for this moderation and maybe elaborate on your efforts to go after the institutional customer channel at LoopNet marketplace? -- So the -- so the sales outlook, George, is still strong for the LoopNet business. The differences you're talking about, we only moved the forecast to $1 million or $2 million in any quarter and you get a percent change on this business because the numbers aren't really that big. What we're still seeing is really good sales through the CoStar sales force or LoopNet, and Andy mentioned some of these Premium Lister sales that we're getting.And we continue to sell the signature ads. You get different fluctuations in cancels from quarter-to-quarter, which sometimes does get a little higher or then they back off. So depending on the timing of those, we tweak the forecast and tend to take a more cautious approach going out. But we're still very positive about the changes we're making and how that sales force can create momentum in the second half. -- Also, our big initiative there, which is really the premium gold, platinum and diamond levels, has not effectively rolled out and that will be coming in the next couple of quarters. So, we're having a big conference pulling together. Our senior sales leaders are beginning to walk through the sales process for selling those Apartments.com like ads on LoopNet. And you're not seeing any revenue associated with that right now and that's a future revenue stream, so there will be upside.Our next question comes from Tom -- I'm sorry, Ryan Tomasello with KBW. Please go ahead. -- Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the question today. Andy, just in terms of LoopNet rebranding on your recent comment and the owner focus, can you give us some color on what the go-to-market strategy will be in the education process? Will this be more of a gradual education process, or are you targeting more of a focus launch.And if so, do you think that the sales force is rightsized following the year-to-date growth? And if there are perhaps any efficiencies in partnering with your existing broker clients for a sales effort to align interest and more quickly reach this very valuable owner client? -- Sure. So, one of the things I did not mention, going into detail on was, we have been reorganizing the CoStar sales force a bit in order to get ready for selling these premier LoopNet owner-oriented ads, the sort of upper end ads. And what we've done is, we've identified about 65 sales people across our network, who are the more senior folks and were assigning the top owner prospects to them.We're pulling them together for a couple of days of training. So far we haven't really -- we haven't done that. We're just beginning that process. It's relatively straightforward. The value proposition is pretty straightforward. And I think that we will get adoption or the sales force will pick, the specialist salespeople will pick this up pretty quickly and we really be relying on them to take that forward. I would expect that over time with success there, we'll feel that 65 is not quite the right number and we'll probably want to grow that team a little bit. But I think we'll take one step at a time. A little bit of success with the 65 people would be a lot of success to our bookings numbers.The second part that you mentioned there about partnering with our broker clients is exciting. In the past, we have partnered with our broker clients to basically wholesale or resell advertising to their owner clients and allow them to offer discounts and give them some rebates for volume. And we've had some discussions with some of our brokerage clients about allowing them to resell those LoopNet ads owners.It's a win-win for everybody, the broker, the owner and us. And it is similar to what happens with Apartments.com. So, often when we're selling an advertisement for an apartment community, Greystar, Greystar is acting on behalf of an owner who we don't really know who they are. But they're just authorized to make the purchase and Greystar through volume gets a better price for their owner.So, we'd be looking for the same thing to happen in CoStar, LoopNet, but it will be something that would be happening next year. But we've gotten really positive feedback from folks like CBRE and some others on that opportunity. And it's not unprecedented. Again, not only on the Apartments.com side, but also CoStar Real Estate Manager where a lot of our sales there are -- is white labeling from folks like JLL and CBRE and Cushman & Wakefield, who basically steer their clients into CoStar Real Estate Manager. -- And thanks for joining us, Ryan. Glad to have you. Thanks for starting coverage.Our next question is from Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. Please go ahead. -- Hey, guys. Good afternoon. -- Good afternoon. -- I missed that bookings number. So -- -- It was $59 million. -- We'll get to the offline. -- Thank you for asking. Just under $60 million. So, we're not saying. -- Yeah. In all seriousness, one of the things that strikes me is the success you've had building out your sales force without -- from we can tell from the outside looking at really sacrificing productivity. Can you speak a little bit about what the gating items are to continuing to build sales? I mean, we're in a full employment economy. These are not sort of simple products as I would think. It's a fairly sophisticated sale. I mean, kind of what's the secret sauce and what do you worry about in terms of being able to continually expand the sales organization? -- Well, for me, my primary concern is typically, we are an organization that changes a lot. So, as we -- we don't stay the same. Most sales organizations do exactly the same thing for 10 years in and out. They don't change a lot. Things like refocusing the sales team against the smaller communities to an online leasing, refocusing the info salespeople toward a new ad opportunity in the LoopNet side, that's a lot of change and that requires a big organization to adopt change. And that's just -- that's heavy lifting, that's probably our single biggest gating item.I was meeting with a couple of tech people yesterday. We were at CES and some other companies and they were talking about having challenges hiring salespeople. Knock on wood, we've been able to keep a really good pipeline of high-quality salespeople coming in the door and we have not seen problems with being able to find those folks.So, you can see that in the 50 plus recent hires on the CoStar side. And then I also -- we're going to be -- and hiring in Richmond. I feel confident there. We invest a lot into the Richmond marketplace. We have a big brand there and we've been successful in meeting our hiring requirements there. So, we're always looking to try to improve our sales training and try to give them more experiences and developing ongoing training.But we like the productivity numbers we're seeing, the productivity numbers per salesperson. Apartments.com is exceptional right now. And if we can keep that through -- going through an inside sales team, we'll be really happy with that result. So the main issue is just continuously reshaping the organization, things like dividing the Apartments and the CoStar teams into separate management lines. That's the main challenge.Our next question comes from Stephen Sheldon with William Blair. Please go ahead. -- Great. Thanks. This is actually Josh Lamers on for Stephen. -- Hello, Josh. -- Hey there. Over the last few quarters, you guys have provided some helpful data points on the Apartments upsell and LoopNet 2.0. But I was hoping you could frame for us what you view is the bigger opportunity over the next two years or three years. And if there's time, what you see are kind of the main factors driving demand for the higher-priced ads in a high occupancy environment? Thanks. -- Yeah. I would like -- and you ask, which of my children are my favorite and that's a tough one. So, I'd like to say that Apartments.com is awesome and LoopNet is awesome and they both have trends of upside. But you have to say, you have to respect Warren Buffett. And one bird in the hand is better than two in the bush. And Apartments.com is on fire right now and it's happening.What's driving demand for the up-sell, when you see folks adopting rapidly, price points at $3,600 and $7,500 a month where the average had been $770, what's going on there is we are just delivering the traffic and the lead flow. We've got massive traffic in lead flow. It's working. And we're hearing, like in a focus group, I was in two weeks or three weeks ago in Dallas, property managers who are building a lot of new -- putting a lot of new units out there are finding that everybody in say, Dallas Uptown is now buying our Diamond ad and it's hard to stand out. Like in -- they're looking to spend more to stand out more when they're in lease-up.And so with so many people buying in Apartments.com, people with higher demand are willing to pay more. And when you think about what's at stake for them as they launch a $200 million community in the lease-up, they don't really care if our ad cost a $1,000 or $10,000. They're in a nine-month lease-up period and we are the source for the majority of their communities.So, we've kept our -- frankly, we've kept our pricing very aggressive and our price per lease and our price per lead is very low. And they're very happy with it. And if they want more, they're willing to fork out money. So the upside is, we are -- these plus categories where within silver, gold, platinum and diamond, we're going to enable people to pay to sort higher within the categories, I think we will generate a lot of revenue. And then again just bringing out the online leasing tools and going after the mid-market will be big.LoopNet, I'm highly confident about, but it's -- it is still in development. It's still early days. But we're very familiar with everything about that LoopNet area and feel like it's a clear opportunity and remain very optimistic about it.Our next question comes from Sterling Auty with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. -- Yeah. Thanks. Hi, guys. And -- -- Sterling. -- We really appreciate all the detail that you gave on the call. So, thank you very much. Quick question on the CoStar Suite. When you look at the growth year-over-year, how would you characterize? I know you gave us a rough estimate of the number of subscribers. But how much of that growth is coming from increases in user count versus maybe the best way to put it is increase in average revenue per subscriber? -- Most of it is new subscribers. There is a little bit more. There is a slight increase in average price point per user. So, we're getting -- we're being a little more thoughtful about looking at some of the dramatically underpriced accounts and bringing them up a little bit closer, not all the way in the list, we are bringing up a little closer list.So, I'd say the shift is mixing -- the mix is shifting a little bit between price point. It's a little bit more of that than there has been in the past but nothing crazy. We're talking about instead of 3% average price increase, it might be 6% or 7%. -- Got it. Thank you. -- Yeah.Our next question is from Pat Walravens with JMP Securities. Please go ahead. -- Hi. This is Joe Goodwin on for Pat. -- Hi, Joe. -- Hey guys. Just a quick question. Andy, how's the environment for CoStar to do more M&A? Any commentary you can provide us there. And then I have another question after that. -- So the question was what does M&A environment look like? So, we're -- it's very active. There's a lot going on there. We are -- at any given point, we're looking closely at probably a dozen companies. We are being selective, continue to be selective. So if valuation doesn't appear to be rational to us, we're not doing any sloppy deals that way.But we do have a pipeline and we are working through it. And some of it is smaller deals like Off Campus Partners and then there is some -- there are some larger things in the pipeline. But again, they don't occur until they occur because we have a great track record across 20 acquisitions, 30 acquisitions of not having any big goose. And we will continue to be very careful as we go forward. But we're not going to change our ways of continuing to make good acquisitions.Our next question is from Scott Buck from B Riley. FBR. Please go ahead. -- Hey. Good afternoon, guys. A bit of a follow-up there. I'm watching the cash balances continue to climb quarter after quarter, how are you prioritizing uses? And will we see at some point maybe some repurchase activity or a potential dividend? Thanks. -- Thanks, Scott. Our priorities right now are the acquisition pipeline that we just talked about, putting money back into organic spend as much as possible. Clearly, we're still going to generate net positive cash, but our intention is to put that back into acquisitions. We'd love to see some more rational price discussions in the marketplace on deals right now. But we know they're out there and they're big enough to use that cash. So, it's just a matter of time, I think we'll do that.Right now we're not considering any share buybacks or dividends as there is still so much opportunity in this growing digital marketplace transformation, that it is better to be holding it for some of the near-term and then using it when we have those opportunities.[Operator Instructions] -- Great. Well, thank you all for joining us for the second quarter call and we look forward to getting together with you again in the third quarter. And thank you very much.[Operator Closing Remarks] --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --

Shares of  were rising to the next level in the first half of the year, gaining 64% according to data from . The commercial real estate specialist gained on a strong fourth-quarter earnings report, a bullish outlook for 2019, and an improving market environment.The stock has gained steadily throughout the year with its biggest surge coming on its February earnings report. data by CoStar got a boost along with the rest of the market in January, as stocks bounced back from the December sell-off. Early in the month, the company also signed its first contract with CBRE, the world's biggest commercial real estate brokerage, meaning that CoStar's research and products are now used by all of the top 10 U.S. commercial real estate brokerages. Image source: Getty Images.In late February, CoStar's biggest gains of the year came after the company reported  on Feb. 26, gaining 11.8% the following day as quarterly revenue jumped 24% to $316 million, and adjusted earnings per share from more than doubled from $1.25 to $2.81, ahead of estimates at $2.53. Profits surged as the company continues to build scale and benefit from past acquisitions and as it cut back on marketing spending in the quarter. Apartments.com and Loopnet had particularly strong performances.Management also set an ambitious long-term goal, projecting revenue of $3 billion by 2023, up from $1.2 billion in 2018 or equivalent to a compound annual growth rate of 20%, and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 40%. For 2019, the company forecast revenue growth of 15%-16% to $1.37 billion to $1.38 billion and called for adjusted EPS of $9.80-$10.00, up from $8.28 in 2018.The stock gained slightly over the next several weeks but then dipped briefly when the company's first quarter report came out. Results were strong again, however, as revenue rose 20% to $328 million, ahead of the company's guidance, and adjusted EPS rose from $1.65 to $2.53, topping estimates at $3.44. However, investors may have been disappointed with second-quarter guidance calling for just 13% revenue growth.  The commercial real estate market remains strong and growing, a key catalyst for CoStar, and the company has continued to forge partnerships with the likes of JLL, Buxton, and Barclay Street. Though CoStar trades at a premium, the company looks primed for continued growth with its strong network of brands and leadership in commercial real estate analytics.

"The importance of good corporate governance has become elevated in recent decades in the wake of increased regulatory compliance responsibilities following high profile corporate governance disasters; increasing global economic uncertainty; and the complexity of doing business in a rapidly evolving marketplace. Business schools, research and professional business firms, and professional associations alike are writing about—and attempting to quantify—the value and qualities of good governance. One of the world's largest independent  firms——has taken a novel approach to analyzing the strength of corporate management teams by assessing companies' stewardship of investor capital. Nasdaq recently spoke with Brett Horn of Morningstar's Equity Research team to find out more about the purpose and methodology behind Morningstar's Corporate Stewardship Rating Program and what it takes for a company to achieve ""exemplary"" status.A: Morningstar's corporate Stewardship Rating assesses management's stewardship of shareholder capital. Essentially what we're trying to answer when we look at stewardship is whether the actions and strategies of corporate management are well suited to drive long-term shareholder value—or not. 
We have three stewardship ratings: exemplary, standard and poor. The majority of companies included in our stewardship coverage earn a ""standard"" rating. What we are doing with ""exemplary"" and ""poor"" ratings is identifying companies that we think are outliers in terms of the strength or weakness of management. 
While we believe that stewardship is a material factor that investors should consider, it is just one component of evaluating investment potential. A company with exemplary stewardship could still be a ""poor"" investment even if the evaluation is correct, and vice versa for a company with a poor stewardship rating. 
A: Capital allocation is the primary factor Morningstar evaluates when rating companies on stewardship. 
We review management investment strategy and valuation, both external and internal. A company with ""exemplary"" stewardship will be one that has an M&A history of making investments and acquisitions that support its competitive advantages and core business, while divesting underperforming or non-core businesses. We assess whether the company is paying a reasonable price for acquisitions. We determine if management is investing sufficiently to take advantage of all the value creative opportunities that are in front of it. We also evaluate whether management is over-investing and moving into areas where the returns are not going to be sufficient relative to the company's cost of capital. 
We analyze how companies approach balance sheet structure to determine if they have reached optimal financial leverage—conservative, but not too conservative. We evaluate how they return capital to shareholders. We review accounting practices to determine if a company's accounting methods are aggressive or potentially deceitful, which is obviously going to be a negative. 
We also look at executive compensation, specifically at the incentives and the targets that management is awarded and whether those are appropriate targets to align management's interest with shareholders in the long-run. 
A: There are a number that come to mind: 
Founder and CEO Andrew Florence has navigated the company from its start-up days to its IPO in 1998. Since the IPO, the company has gone from $14 million in revenue to an expected $1 billion+ estimated for 2018. While acquisitions have complemented the existing platform recently, organic growth has been the main driver over the past two decades. The proprietary data CoStar has built out puts it light years ahead of its competition, and places a wide moat around the business. 
Costco is a great example of a company that plays the hand that they've been dealt very well. The company has built up a very big footprint but stayed firmly within its circle of competence. Costco has prudently reinvested in the business, while also returning excess cash to shareholders. Management has also developed a winning culture that promotes below-average employee turnover, as the attrition rate is 6% among employees who have been there over a year—as opposed to attrition rates of 50% or greater in the general retail industry. 
Fiserv is a bank technology company that was built by numerous acquisitions since their founding which left a very decentralized management system. CEO Jeff Yabucki came in and centralized the company's operations, which led to material cost savings and margin improvement. We're also impressed by its stellar M&A track record. The relatively recent acquisition of Open Solutions greatly improves its real-time processing capabilities, which appears to be the future for bank software providers. In addition, it appears Fiserv got Open Solutions on the cheap since the price mostly consisted of the assumption of debt. 
Management has done well to leverage the company's size to capitalize on the firm's ability to provide more consistent and rapid part availability. The benefits of the firm's broad store and distribution network, as well as management's operational prowess, have pushed returns on invested capital higher over the last five years, with returns increasing from 14% in 2011 to 23% in 2016. O'Reilly's leadership has transformed the company from a regional player into a top-four national chain, acting quickly to develop and capitalize on significant long-term brand and cost advantages. 
Management's strategy of providing deep levels of relationship-based banking has been unchanged since its founding, and bankers are compensated not only on the amount of assets they bring up, but how much they retain over time. The bank's focus on low costs as well has paid off, as it typically locates offices on the upper levels of buildings versus the more expensive street-level locations. Signature has undoubtedly been one of the most successful banks in the nation over the past 15 years, in large part because of Signature's straightforward business model and the nimbleness of its executives. 
To date, Steel Dynamics remains one of the most efficient steelmakers, not just in the U.S., but also on a global basis. Management is quick to attribute its success to its employee compensation strategy which, modeled after Nucor's approach, effectively treats employees as managers by motivating their performance via weekly and monthly production bonuses. 
A: It's the flip side of everything that would earn a company an exemplary rating. Poor stewardship companies are negatively impacted by short-sighted investment strategies or value-destructive acquisitions. For example, maybe a company has a very attractive core business, but if they make acquisitions that stray from core competencies or don't benefit from similar competitive advantages, their long-term returns are most likely going to be poor. Or a company that makes acquisitions that represent good sense strategically, but pays dramatically too much for them, will similarly dilute long-term returns. 
Other examples of poor stewardship include aggressively investing internally in projects that are not going to earn necessary returns; too much leverage; over-aggressive accounting; or compensation targets that are tied to a matrix that would not correspond well with long-term value. 
We also look at the extent to which a company is a good day-to-day operator. A company can't create shareholder value if it has frequent operational and execution missteps like industrial accidents, poor customer service, or product recalls. 
Morningstar's Stewardship Rating differs from ISS QualityScore in a few ways. QualityScore evaluates the extent to which the company's management adheres to standard corporate governance practices. Morningstar's Stewardship Rating is evaluating management's strategy and the likelihood that management's actions will improve or deteriorate long-term returns. 
QualityScore is a quantitative numerical score that ranks companies, whereas the Stewardship Rating does not explicitly rank order management teams against peers within their industries but against ideal stewardship. We're not trying to figure out if one management team is slightly better than the other; we are focused on identifying particularly strong or particularly weak management teams.

Andy? -- Rich, that was authentic, and moving -- thank you. -- You're welcome. -- Thank you all for joining us for CoStar Group's fourth quarter 2018, and year-end . The first number I wanna focus on is our adjusted EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter, which was 44%. By achieving that strong margin, we have successfully accomplished an important financial goal. Five years ago, in 2014, we set two key long-range financial goals for 2018. One was to achieve $1 billion in annual revenue, and the second was to reach 40% adjusted EBITDA margin for the fourth quarter of 2018. Today, five years later, with a $1.2 billion in revenue for the full year 2018, and a 44% adjusted EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter, our team is pleased to have solidly delivered on both of those goals.Delivering this sort of consistent growth is on-target with our long-range record of good growth. Since 2011, we've achieved a 25% compound annual revenue growth rate, which is in line with our 20-year compound annual growth rate of 25%. For the full year of 2018, our adjusted EBITDA margin was 35%, over 600 basis points of improvement over 2017. EBITDA in 2018 was $351 million, an increase of 48%, compared to $237 million for 2017. Net income was $238 million in 2018, compared to $123 million in 2017, a 94% increase.The past five years have proven that we can grow the top line, expand margins, and still make significant growth investments into the business. Some of those recent investments include the Richmond Research Center, expanding and marketing the Apartments.com network, growing our sales team, integrating the CoStar LoopNet databases, and expanding our Canadian and European businesses. Our most significant growing investments are product and software development; those investments have allowed us to build powerful, profitable businesses with strong leadership positions with CoStar Suite, the Apartments network, CoStar Real Estate Manager, LoopNet, and many others.Because of our exceptional technology, deep understanding of real estate, and the value of our connected commercial real estate communities, we have created transformative value for our clients. We are now attracting 42 million people to our websites monthly, and have earned the business of 150,000 CoStar subscribers. This has enabled us to balance investing back into our business, while still significantly expanding our margins.CoStar Group holds a leadership position in the exciting transformation of a multi-trillion dollar real estate industry, moving from off-line to online. We have positioned the company well for the enormous long-term opportunity that lies ahead of us by building an exceptionally strong balance sheet. We have $1.1 billion in cash, no debt, and $351 million of growing EBITDA to leverage. CoStar Group has acquired dozens of companies and expects to continue acquiring companies that will bring value to our shareholders.CoStar Suite revenue grew 18% in 2018, over 2017. Commercial property and land, which includes the LoopNet.com, as well as our land and business sites, grew 16% year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2018. For the full year of 2018, multi-family revenue grew 45%, versus 2017, as our multi-family revenue increased to $406 million. CoStar Real Estate Manager grew an astounding 124% year-over-year and is already off to a strong start this year. That's right -- 124%.We now have more than $1 billion of visible, high-margin, reoccurring, or subscription revenue. Companywide net new bookings of $50 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 were the best we've ever achieved. That is an increase of 15% year-over-year, and 26% over the fourth quarter of 2018. Remember that the fourth quarter 2017 was an exceptional quarter for us, as one of our long-term competitors filed bankruptcy. For the full year of 2018, we turned in another top performance with $169 million in net new bookings. In a sense, even that number is understated, because it does not include all the work our sales team did in finding tens of millions of dollars of ForRent revenue into Apartments.com contracts.In the fourth quarter 2018, we signed two large brokerage firms to new, multi-year contracts. The contract we signed with CBRE was our first global contract. CBRE has been a great, longtime customer of CoStar, and their users are spending more time on our products than ever before. 2018 CBRE users doubled their time spent working in CoStar over 2016; this is a testament to the growing utility of our products to top industry players.Marcus & Millichap also signed a multi-year contract renewal with us, and they pointed directly to improvements made in research, particularly our tenant data, as a reason for going forward with us, and expanding the volume of services they buy from us. They're also renewing and growing Canadian contracts with us.In 2018, our CoStar field sales force began focusing on selling LoopNet, in addition to CoStar. We did this because it makes good sense, and we feel that our customers prefer one point of contact. As a result, net new year-over-year bookings for LoopNet.com increased by 74%. With two products to sell, the sales force is selling a bit less CoStar, but it's selling much more of the combined services; clearly, this is a good trade-off.Our Apartments.com sales force is doing a great job; the fourth quarter of 2018 was our best sales quarter ever for Apartments.com. Our sales force has essentially completed converting ForRent customers to Apartments.com customers, so they now have more time available to focus on signing new business. Hitting a record Apartments.com sales quarter in the fourth quarter is a remarkable achievement, given the fact that -- historically -- apartment Internet listing services suffered from sharp seasonality, and historically would contract in the fourth quarter -- so setting records in the fourth quarter is great.Our Apartments.com sales force knows the power of client service, and how it leads to more sales; 2018 they conducted 309,000 client meetings, and most of our reps average nearly seven meetings per day. Some are averaging almost ten client meetings a day. An independent group within CoStar follows up many of these meetings by calling and asking the client, on a scale of one to ten, how likely they are to recommend Apartments.com to a friend. On average, our clients give us a 9.64. One of our best reps, Nicole Gagliardi, across 1,000 meetings, scored an outstanding 9.94 -- an A++. I believe this sales team is the best in the industry, and I'm looking forward to another excellent year with them.In 2018, according to ComScore, the Apartments.com network had half-a-billion visits for the full year -- up 33% over 2017. In one month, according to Google Analytics, we saw 57 million visits over the Apartments.com network. We average 17 million unique visitors per month over the course of the year, according to ComScore, which is an increase of 35% compared to 2017. This is by far the most in the industry, as we continue to pull away from RentPath, which only had 208 million visits in 2018, and averaged less than 8.8 million unique visitors per month.Even more impressly, for the full year of 2018, Apartments.com leads were up 43%. With almost 300 million more visits than RentPath and great lead flow, we believe the obvious choice for an advertiser has to be Apartments.com. In 2018, 4,600 properties advertising with RentPath started advertising with Apartments.com. We estimate that there are only 6,000-8,000 that still advertise on RentPath, and do not yet advertise on Apartments.com, and we are focused on capturing that business. In 2018, RentPath got a competitive rest, or a little competitive holiday, while we focused on the ForRent conversion, but in 2019, we'll dramatically increase the competitive intensity.We believe that RentPath may have a ticking time bomb of a pricing problem. We believe that similar apartment properties in the same city are paying wildly different prices for essentially the same advertising levels; this may have happened because they used to have much better share of traffic, and RentPath may be relying on long-term clients to keep paying yesterday's higher prices that might have been justified years ago, when their traffic was good, but now these prices may not make any sense. How will long-term clients react if they find that new clients are paying a fraction of the price for the same product? It used to make sense to pay $3.00 a minute to use a 10-pound mobile bag phone, and you were cool. Today, a cellular provider would not be able to sustain that $3.00 a minute pricing for long in a highly competitive market.We now have over 50,000 properties advertised on our network -- up from 18,000 when we purchased Apartments.com in 2014. In just ten months, we have successfully integrated ForRent, the largest acquisition we've ever made. We are increasing our 2019 apartments marketing budget by 11% year-over-year in an effort to gain more share. We expect to launch our new, bigger 2019 marketing campaign shortly. The campaign will once again feature Jeff Goldblum as Brad Bellflower. The 2019 campaign is called ""Enter the Apartmenternet."" There will be a lot of futuristic technology and special effects that will make the ads fun, and memorable. We hired director Taika Waititi, famous for directing the recent blockbuster smash hit,  to direct our spots, so that the production value and quality will be truly first-class. We just wrapped up filming these neat TV spots. In the series, we emphasize the vast array of alternative futures the renter can potentially have by choosing various apartment alternatives.The aggressive plan calls for over 8,000 television ads, 6 billion digital impressions, 300 million streaming impressions to reach 95% of renters. We expect that the net impact of this investment will be well over 600 million renter visits in 2019 to the Apartments.com network. According to company estimates, there are 14 million apartment units in larger apartment buildings with 100 units or more -- that represents only 31% of the 45 million rental units in the United States. Despite the fact that it represents only 31% of the market, the overwhelming majority of Apartments.com's revenues comes from this upper 31% of the market. 84% of the 540,000 apartment buildings in the US are smaller, and have four units to 100 units. In addition, there are 17 million other units altogether -- that are in condos, townhouses, or properties with less than four units. These smaller properties are owned by what we call Independent Owners, or the IO market.The IO market does not have the scale, and resources of larger players like Greystar, Avalon Bay, Pinnacle, and other large property managers. We believe that without the benefits of scale, independent owners spend more time and money leasing each unit; we further believe that there is far more absolute revenue potential in the independent owner and small apartment building market than there is in the upper end or institutional market. We believe we've done a better job than any other online company at monetizing the upper end of the market. Now, in 2019, monetizing the other 69% of the United States' rental housing market will become our top priority.We have been, and expect to continue to invest very aggressively in building out the software platforms, and products that we believe will enable us to provide compelling online rental solutions that appeal to both renters and independent owners. We want to take many of the traditional off-line, or disparate functions required to lease an apartment, and move them into one, seamless online, easy-to-use solution. It's an exciting project to work on, and we're motivated by the potential to have a very positive impact on tens of millions of renters, and independent owners.Part of that effort includes our November purchase of Cozy Services. They're a leader in the online rental property market, and have nearly 60,000 landlords using their services. There are approximately 150,000 renters making lease payments through Cozy, totaling $1.7 billion in 2018. We believe that Cozy provides a best-in-class solution for one of the key components of the rental process, so we're integrating Cozy into the Apartments.com full rental cycle.We will control the costs associated with selling solutions to a much larger audience at lower price points by relying on e-commerce sales to monetize the higher volume independent owner market, rather than using our field sales force. It's our goal that this new solution will form the foundation of our 2020 marketing campaign. We plan to share more details about our new products, as we get closer to launching them.2019 will be the first full year that LoopNet's position as a pure online marketplace, like Apartments.com, rather than a hybrid information solution and marketing platform. LoopNet has become a vital utility for tens of thousands of commercial real estate professionals seeking to market their properties to the millions of tenants and investors looking for commercial real estate online. LoopNet is the most heavily trafficked commercial real estate marketplace, with approximately 5 million unique visitors in a month. LoopNet generates $127 million of annual revenue on a very high margin. While we've more than tripled LoopNet's marketing revenues since CoStar acquired the company in 2012, we believe that we can further enervate and evolve the LoopNet solution -- and more than triple the revenue again -- with a focused effort, and site relaunch.Early in LoopNet's evolution, it was best suited to marketing smaller properties, often for-sale properties in suburban areas, or tertiary cities. The economics on these smaller properties are a fraction of the economics involved in large office property leasing, or industrial. While CoStar Group has years of experience marketing tens of thousands of major office properties for lease, LoopNet was not originally optimized for marketing and leasing prestigious, brand-conscious office buildings. In 2019, we are investing aggressively to redevelop and relaunch the next generation of LoopNet, so that it better meets the needs of a much broader cross-section of the commercial real estate industry.This effort is very similar to the effort we successfully made to relaunch and reposition the Apartments.com site after we acquired it from Classified Ventures in 2014. This is a comprehensive project, engaging much more than just our software development teams. Similar to the Apartments.com launch, we expect this will engage more than half our company. We're very excited about the opportunity to exploit the potential of a next-generation online marketing platform for commercial real estate.2018 ended with commercial vacancies near all-time lows; prices and rents at all-time highs, and leasing and transaction volume setting new records for the year. The ongoing health of commercial real estate is the result of solid economic growth in 2018, which -- although slowing in the fourth quarter -- accelerated for the year as fiscal stimulus kicked in. Almost 2.7 million jobs were created last year, and the unemployment rate is hovering at, or below 4%. All of that is great for commercial real estate.The industrial market continues to lead all property types, in terms of rent growth, price appreciation, take-up, and new supply. The industrial sector's outperformance results from the ongoing shift to online buying, which has produced strong demand for in-fill and regional bulk distribution centers across all markets. E-commerce has also affected the traditional retail sector; retail rents have trailed the other property types, and developers have delivered little new space; however, well-located retail assets continue to show strong performance, and demand for quality space matched with very little new construction has kept overall retail vacancies at historic lows.In the office sector, vacancies fell into the single digits last year for the first time since the early 2000s, the result of healthy absorption and limited new supply. Rent growth at the national level stayed within a narrow band of around 2% over the last eight quarters, but has weakened in some coastal markets, which are facing higher levels of supply. Many secondary markets, on the other hand, have enjoyed stronger rent growth, as new construction still remains low. For the multi-family sector, absorption reached a cyclical high, as a strong labor market and rising mortgage rates resulted in high demand for rental units. Apartment rent growth accelerated, exceeding 3% for the first time since 2015, and transaction volume and pricing continue to set new records.In summary, 2018 was another remarkable year in the unprecedented streak for commercial real estate. We see no reason that the slow and steady status quo that has defined this cycle won't continue for the foreseeable future; that said, the prospect of rising interest rates, and narrowing spreads appear to have brought an end to nearly a decade of cap rate compression, but cap rates remain very low. Still, construction remains limited, leasing remains healthy across all property types, and rising mortgage rates could safeguard apartment demand.We're proud to have delivered on the financial goals we set for CoStar back in 2014. We are now coming off our best year ever, and we're moving into 2019 in a strong commercial real estate market with great products, great clients, great people, great research, and a phenomenal sales team. We believe that 2019 will be another great year for CoStar Group, and our clients. We told you that upon completing our last five-year financial goal we would set a new goal for 2023. That goal will be to exit 2023 at a $3 billion revenue run rate, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 40% or more for the full year. While we anticipate acquisitions will contribute, we believe that most of our growth will be organic. At this point, I'm gonna turn the call over to the accomplished mountaineer, and our CFO, Scott Wheeler. -- Thank you, Andy. That's a great introduction. I'm feeling very accomplished today. -- Soaring to new heights. -- Here, let me raise my chair a little. There -- I feel better up here. Great -- yeah, 2018 -- what a great year we had for CoStar: very strong growth, we acquired three businesses; we invested for our future, and we expanded our margin over 600 basis points. On top of that, I -- for one -- am happy we can put these old, tired long-term goals behind us, and move on to multi-billion land next.All right, let me start with some insights on our revenue results, which in the full year of 2018 increased 23% over 2017, while our growth rate in the fourth quarter of 2018 was 24%, versus the prior year. Looking at our revenue performance by services, CoStar Suite revenue growth was 18% for the full year 2018, as expected, and 16% in the fourth quarter 2018, coming in slightly above our 15% guidance range. CoStar Suite sales are very good in the fourth quarter, as we continued strong conversion of our LoopNet users to CoStar, and we completed the long-term contract renewals with both CBRE and Marcus & Millichap that Andrew mentioned. As we headed into 2019, we expect the CoStar Suite growth rates to moderate sequentially, as they did in the fourth quarter of 2018, and settle in in the range of 11-13% for the year.There are a couple factors converging here to note: first, we fully lapped the very high revenue growth quarters that followed the LoopNet integration, and the Xceligent bankruptcy. Second, we have a sales substitution effect here, as our CoStar sales force is focused on selling more LoopNet to accelerate the growth of that marketplace. In total, the team is delivering more combined sales -- in fact, 20% more in 2018 than in 2017 -- so we like this increased productivity. We will see some shifting effect from CoStar to LoopNet.Revenue growth in information services was 11% in the fourth quarter of 2018. It's our first quarter of positive growth in two years, when we stopped actively selling the LoopNet information products. Back then, LoopNet information was over 50% of the revenue in information services. All that revenue is effectively gone, and CoStar Real Estate Manager and CoStar Risk Analytics have made up the gap. CoStar Real Estate Manager revenue continued its outstanding growth, increasing 165% in the fourth quarter of 2018 versus the fourth quarter of 2017. We expect total revenue from information services to increase at a rate of 11-13% on a year-over-year basis throughout 2019. It's great to finally put behind us that negative growth rate.We had a very strong quarter in the fourth quarter in multi-family, as revenue increased 45% year-over-year, including the impact for the ForRent acquisition. For the full year 2018, the average number of properties that advertised on our network increased approximately 25%, while the average revenue per property improved 20%. Looking forward, we expect multi-family revenue growth of approximately 20% for the full year of 2019. We expect growth of approximately 30% in the first quarter of 2019, compared to the first quarter of 2018, as we lap the late-February acquisition date of ForRent. Growth rates in the second and third quarter should be in the mid-teens, due to the negative effect of certain duplicative and discontinued revenues from ForRent that was in our 2018 results, that won't be in our 2019 results. The growth rate exiting 2019 is expected to be in line with the 20% full-year outlook for multi-family.Finally, in commercial property and land, revenue grew 17% year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2018. This strong growth reflects the increased sales of LoopNet marketing products by our national CoStar field sales force. Our LoopNet tiered advertising products performed exceptionally well, growing approximately 50% for the year. For 2019, we expect revenue growth in commercial property and land in the 18-020% range.Our gross margin was 77% for the full year 2018, and it came in at 78% in the fourth quarter of 2018, up 200 basis points from the third quarter of 2018, and 130 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2017. We are certainly realizing the benefits of strong operating leverage in our research operations, which we expect to continue as our listing manager tools achieve greater adoption throughout 2019. We expect overall gross margins of 78% for 2019, with margins improving throughout the year, to between 79-80% by the end of 2019.Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of $139 million was approximately $12 million above the midpoint of our guidance range, due to revenue outperformance of approximately $6 million, and lower expenses -- primarily personnel-related. I know we've said it already, but it really never gets old; our adjusted EBITDA margin for the fourth quarter came in at 44%, above our 41% margin guidance, and that long-term goal of 40%.Net income for the full year of 2018 was $238 million, 94% ahead of the prior year, reflecting tremendous operating profit growth, as well as the R&D tax credits we achieved in the second quarter of 2018. Net income was $9 million ahead of the net income expected in our guidance forecast for the fourth quarter.Now, our GAAP net income for the full year of 2018 was $302 million, and includes adjustments for stock base compensation, and acquisition-related expenses. This represents growth of 96%, compared to 2017.Now, let's take a look at some performance metrics for the quarter: at the end of the year, our sales force totaled 741 people, a slight increase from the 733 salespeople we reported at the end of the third quarter of 2018. We anticipate a modest increase in the size of our sales force in 2019, primarily focused on CoStar and LoopNet. The renewal rate on annual contracts for the fourth quarter was broadly in line with the rate achieved in the third quarter of 2018, at 90%, which was down slightly from the 91% we achieved in fourth quarter of 2017. The renewal rate for customers who've been subscribers for five years or longer was 96%, consistent with the third quarter of 2018, and down slightly from the 97% in the fourth quarter of 2017. Subscription revenue on annual contracts accounts for 80.9% of our revenue in the quarter, up from 79.7% this time last year.We're now one full year past the date we acquired ForRent, and we completed the integration. When we announced the deal, we expected to add revenue of approximately $75-85 million, with adjusted EBITDA margins expected to be in the range of 45-55%. I'm happy to say we achieved our financial objectives after only ten months. These results are highly accretive, as you can tell by our profit results, and indicate a post-synergy acquisition price of less than nine times EBITDA, certainly not a bad day's work.So now, we'll discuss our outlook for the full year, and the first quarter of 2019. We expect revenue in the range of $1.37 billion to $1.38 billion for the full year of 2019; this implies an annual growth rate of 15-16% over 2018. We expect revenue for the first quarter of 2019 in the range of $325-329 million; this represents approximately 19-20% growth, compared to the first quarter of last year. As I noted earlier, we booked approximately one month of ForRent revenue in the first quarter of 2018, which is why our consolidated growth for the first quarter of 2019 is stepping down from 24% growth rate in the fourth quarter of 2018. As we pass the anniversary of the ForRent acquisition, we expect revenue growth in the range of 14-15% for the remaining quarters of 2019.We'll focus on a number of important growth investments in 2019, while at the same time growing our profit margins. Our top investments for 2019 include the independent owner software platform, and products that Andy talked about, along with the development and launch of the next-generation of LoopNet. In addition, we're developing product capabilities within CoStar that we believe will take advantage of significant growth opportunities with both owners of commercial properties, and lenders. We'll also continue to build our network of marketplace businesses, including our international operations in Europe and Canada. As a result, we expect total operating costs to increase between 9% and 11% against revenue growth of 14-15% in 2019.As in prior years, our advertising spend is expected to be more heavily weighted in the first half of the year, with the second quarter expected to be our largest marketing quarter. As a result, we expect the second quarter to be the low point for adjusted EBITDA margins for the year, as was the case in 2017 and 2018. We expect adjusted EBITDA in a range of $495 million to $505 million -- that's half a billion dollars -- for the full year of 2019, which represents 20% growth at the midpoint compared to 2018. We expect adjusted EBITDA margins for the year of approximately 36% at the midpoint of our guidance range. For the first quarter, we expect adjusted EBITDA in a range of $120-124 million, up 45% compared to the first quarter of 2018.We expect 2019 non-GAAP net income for diluted share in a range of $9.80-10.00, based on 36.6 million shares. For the first quarter, we expect non-GAAP net income per diluted share in a range of $2.38-2.47, based on 36.5 million shares. These ranges include a revised non-GAAP tax rate of 25%.Overall, I believe we're well positioned in 2019 to deliver strong growth, and margin expansion, while at the same time making significant investments for the future. I'm excited about our long-term goals of $3 billion in run-rate revenue, and 40%-plus of adjusted EBITDA margins in five years. Now, with regards to our margin improvements, keep in mind we have a tendency to avoid doing things in a straight line -- accordingly, our margin trajectory may vary considerably from year to year. I sound like Rich giving a disclaimer on this. It's important that, when we have attractive investment opportunities, we allow the flexibility in our expectations to pursue those opportunities vigorously. All right, that's enough of me talking; let's open up the call for questions.And ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to ask a question, please press *, then 1 on your touch-tone phone. You'll hear a tone indicating you've been placed in the queue, and you can remove yourself from the queue at any time by pressing the # key. If you are using a speakerphone, please pick up the handset before pressing the numbers. Once again, for questions, press *, then 1 at this time; also, it has been requested if you can limit yourself to one question. Our first question from the line of Peter Christiansen with Citi -- please go ahead. --  -- Good afternoon; thanks for the question. Andy, there's been some deal activity in Europe recently, and I don't wanna point to one deal specifically, but -- and there's also some start-up activity in Asia -- similar models as CoStar, which I think is a testament to your financial model, but do things like this -- and I'm not pointing to one deal specifically -- change the calculus, in terms of when and how CoStar is thinking about making international more of an investment priority? -- Well, thank you, Peter. We are putting a significant amount of effort into our international operations. You'll see that -- when you look at our outlook -- we have significant capital going into our European and Canadian operations. We think that some of the deals I believe you're referencing are interesting, but they're not direct parallels to what we're doing, so they don't really shift the competitive picture in any which way. We're watching that, and if something came up that was really interesting, we would participate in that, but we're gonna continue to be aggressive, but measured in our international operations.But to wit, I'll be over there next week, so we're watching it, and continuing to build the operations there. We are -- and I think at this point, we have eight of the top ten firms in Canada as clients, now -- and I think we are nine or ten of the top ten in the United Kingdom, so we're doing well, and Germany's continuing to do well; France and Spain continue to build there, so we're watching it, but not dramatically shifting.Thank you, and we have a question from Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. Please go ahead. --  -- Hey, guys, this is Oscar Turner on for Andrew. -- Hello, Oscar. -- Hi, Oscar. --  -- Hey, guys. My question is on the incremental investments. I was wondering if you could quantify the incremental investment toward a couple of the top initiatives you talked about, and then -- how should we think about the incremental revenue growth that those investments can drive, and the timing of the growth acceleration in LoopNet and Apartments? -- Yeah, let me cover a bit of the investment side, and then we can talk a little bit on the outlook for them. The bigger ones we're gonna be focused on this year are really the marketplace build outs -- both the LoopNet in the US and then the Marketplace in the UK, which is on the back burner of our Realla business. We think we'll probably have between $20-25 million in our investment that'll go into building those platforms out, which includes marketing, and other capabilities. Then we have the independent owners investment that Andy mentioned, which you already have a decent amount of investment going in currently, and I think we'll ramp that up by another $10 million or so next year.And then the build out of the CoStar platform, with owners, lenders -- promoting some of the listing manager work we're doing in software, along with some more marketing in CoStar, we think there's probably another $10-15 million in costs in investments there.When you look at our cost growth, we figure that a little bit less than half of our cost growth really has to do with investments we made in 2018 that annualize in 2019, or labor increases, inflation -- those types of things. So a little less of the cost growth is for year-over-year, and normal business operations and the rest really isn't going into new investments that'll really benefit future years, and future revenue growth.I don't know, Andy, if you wanna talk about the revenue? -- Yeah, I think that the revenue return on LoopNet is a reasonably short cycle. There'll be a pretty aggressive focus on that productary investment on that product over '19 and '20, but we think we'll see results coming from that in the back half of '19, and '20, and then ongoing. And then with the IO market, that's probably -- the more meaningful results there are probably in 2020, and then for the increase in the Apartments.com budget, we think that -- while we are taking share, and leading the market -- we wanna keep the pressure up, and accelerate the -- keeping share to widen the moat and increase the lead.So it's a range of different outlooks on these, and we feel pretty solid about all of them.Our next question from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. --  -- Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. -- Hi, George. --  -- You've outlined goals of reaching $3 billion in run-rate revenues by the end of 2023, which implies at least mid-teens annual revenue growth. Can you discuss how much pricing will contribute to these growth rates, given your previously discussed plans to eliminate discounting in CoStar Suite, and potentially increase rate cards in the multi-family segment? -- Sure, I don't believe the substantial majority of this will be price increases; we think that across Europe and Canada, and the United States, there are a lot of new revenue opportunities -- new customers, and additional modules to be purchased, increased purchasing -- so we think a lot of this is share gain, and share wallet. The pricing increases, on places like LoopNet, you're shifting your priority from selling a basic ad to a broker for $50.00-60.00 to selling something that looks more like an Apartments.com ad, with really impactful presentations -- sort of the top -- with more features, and you're selling it to an owner with a lot of economics at stake, and often, it's gonna be different properties in that mix, and the new price could go from $60.00 up to $6,000.00 a month.So they're sort of shifting the budget, shifting the priority -- you're shifting the target audience, shifting the priority. We don't anticipate getting to $3 billion in revenue by simply increasing the same customers' price for the same product.And we have a question from David Ridley-Lane, with Bank of America; your line is open. --  -- Sure, good afternoon. Can you talk a little bit about the details of the LoopNet site relaunch, and whether or not you considered launching a separate brand to differentiate between the up-market, and the down-market there? Thank you. -- That's a good question, and it'll be a little challenging to go into too much detail on it. We have thought about that, but we don't think we need to do that; we actually are going to initially go to market really focusing on the branding of CoStar Marketing Network, because if you own a, say, a speculative new office building in Washington, D.C. We're actually providing our customers with a whole range of marketing solutions. We enable that owner to reach the professional community by carrying these ads into the CoStar network; we're carrying them into CityFeet, and to Showcase, into CoStar. We also power websites through LoopLink; we also have email marketing campaigns through CDX Direct, our direct email marketing product, and then we've got tactical and analytical support, where we can reduce analysis on the amount of demand and supply for the particular kind of product you're producing, and where you may wanna position the product in pricing, or how you may wanna subdivide it, or what terms you may wanna consider.And then we're also uniquely providing the biggest end-user audience through LoopNet, so we can -- and there's two or three other items, but -- as we put all this together, we're gonna simplify it into a network sale, the way we simplify Apartments.com into a network sale, and LoopNet is just one component of this whole range of very valuable marketing solutions for getting a property leased at the best price, in the shortest time frame, on huge economics. And then we think that -- over time -- as we shift the way LoopNet looks and feels, and it becomes much more polished -- has more breadth of data, has a lot of content articles that de-mystify some of the leasing process, and investing process -- as we shift it from industry jargon to more plain English, as we add in a lot more exciting shopping characteristic stuff, like where the best place is to eat lunch at this particular property, what's your commute gonna look like -- all that kinda stuff -- we think the LoopNet brand itself will be a good brand to carry, because it's already super well-known, and what we're doing is just moving it more up-market, and targeting a slightly different audience, while continuing to target the original audience.So we think we're pretty happy with the CoStar Marketing Network at this point.And our next question, from the line of Brett Huff with Stephens -- your line is open. --  -- Good afternoon, guys. -- Hello, Brett. -- Hello, Brett. You're our first net. -- Yeah, you win. --  -- My question is on the Suite mix in sales. I think one consequence of having Suite salespeople also sell LoopNet was a little bit of extra juice for LoopNet, and a little bit less growth in sales for Suite. We get some questions sometimes about penetration rates of Suite, and, ""Are we getting to a point where those are starting to trickle off?""Can you illuminate kinda -- how do we know that the mix of sales is a result of effort levels being different, versus maybe reaching the harder to reach tam areas of that market? -- Well, when you ask, ""Has CoStar reached a saturation point?"" All I can say is, ""Ha!"" So, yeah -- absolutely not. There are so many different ways that the CoStar product is growing, and adding more value.Like, in preparing for this earnings call last night, I was just curious about some of those apartment stats, and what the mix of units are in different and I was like, ""Well, go into CoStar, and pull some of this data, according to company estimates,"" and man, what a phenomenal product. The ability to actually get good data on the mix of apartment units in different size communities -- it didn't exist in the product a couple years ago; it's invaluable. I can't imagine someone investing in the apartment sector without that information.I've been at this -- as we've mentioned, I guess this went public -- we're approximately 25% compound annual growth rate. At the point where we went public, there was a lot of discussion about the fact that CoStar was saturated, and five years before that, there was discussion around, ""CoStar was saturated,"" I spent my entire career hearing about CoStar's saturated, pretty much from the first or second year we launched CoStar. In my view, not a chance -- not even a chance. Unfortunately, if I work another 20 years like my dad, I will not outlive the potential to saturate the CoStar market, but -- it's just one man's wishy-washy opinion, but -- solidly, no.Our next question from the line of Mayank Tandon, with Needham & Company, please go ahead. --  -- Thank you. Andy or Scott, I just wanted to dig in a little bit on the EBITDA trajectory for 2023. Scott, you said it won't be linear, which is obviously to be expected, but if you could just talk about the various levers that get you to that 40% target, and maybe you could talk about it by segment, in terms of where you think the profitability will come from, across the three different business lines? -- Yeah, so the margin accretion -- clearly, you can throttle it pretty rapidly, as we just showed this last year. We added 600 basis points, and then the year -- for example, in 2017, when we did the research investments, yeah, we slowed it back down, and we had modest margin growth. It's not inconceivable to see 100-200 basis points margin growth a year, pretty simply, and still have room like we have in this plan for 2019, to make significant investments for future growth. So that's all pretty stable, from an organic perspective, and I can see us getting -- if nothing else changes, and you keep driving this organic growth -- you can certainly get over that 40% margin, and the business can capably do that in the five years.The real wild card in some of this is the amount of acquisition we're gonna be doing, the margin profiles of acquisitions that we buy, and how that dilutes over time, and so you heard us be a little bit cautious in saying, ""Okay, it's 40%-plus, and that really depends on what happens with the acquisition path,"" what those look like, and the timing of them, and then how long it takes to move the margins of the businesses we acquire up to our natural margins.When we look at the margins of the different product sectors that we're in, our marketplaces typically run the very highest margins that are 50%-plus margin profiles in the marketplaces, and then, now with CoStar being in that historically 30-40% range, depending on the investments we make, you're gonna see both sides of the business grow pretty substantially. I think you'll see Apartments will obviously outpace CoStar in a couple years, given our current growth trajectories, and so I think you'll get that information in investment side of things coming in those 30-40% margins, and you'll see the marketplaces as they really continue to scale rapidly, moving up in those 40-50%-plus margins.Furthermore, CoStar is not in any way saturated. -- Haven't forgot that question yet, have you? -- I'm sorry. -- Good answer.Now we'll go to Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo; please go ahead. --  -- Good afternoon, everyone. -- Hello, William. --  -- So, I'm a history major, so sometimes I need a little help with my math, so I wanted to run some math by you, and you can tell me what I'm doing wrong. If you look at CoStar Suite, and how that was up about 18% last year, and if you look at -- if you kinda back out $15-20 million of revenue from what you did in the fourth quarter, that would seem to -- which I know you don't specifically break out, but if you assume that, and that would seem to imply something in the upper teens as the organic growth for the quarter -- and then if you look at the net bookings coming about $50 million in Q4, versus a tough comp, and you average that out into 2019, that would be about $200 million for the year, which -- versus $169 million -- would be up about 18%.And I guess what I'm getting at is that the leading indicators on the revenue side seem to be pointing to something closer to 18% -- mid-teens going to the upper teens, and I just wanted to run that math by you, and see if that was the same math you guys were getting. -- Bill, you know, as I do that math, I start to think that Scott is somewhat conservative! -- You have a lot of selling to do this year, people, let's ourselves. -- Or all the climbing he's been doing has been on a mountain of sand, right? Pick up the pace. -- You know, we have the better crystal ball on the quarterly sales numbers, Bill. I mean, you've watched us for so long, you see how they bounce up and down; $5 million swings quarter to quarter isn't unheard of, depending on what we're focused on, what part of the business we're generating, timing of renewals on contracts -- so we always want to make sure we don't get too far ahead of ourselves when we have a lot of plans for the year, and we'll continue to start the year that way, and hopefully, we'll get to the point where you can do our forecasting for us, because your numbers'll be a lot better than mine, I'm sure -- as we keep going.we did have a good quarter in the fourth quarter, but those bounce around between quarters, so we'll give ourselves time to sell out from under those in the first two quarters of this year.And I have a question from Sterling Auty with J.P. Morgan; please go ahead. --  -- Yes, thanks -- hi, guys. I was just wondering if CoStar's opportunity is saturated. -- It's a cycle -- would you like to have a different question? --  -- Yeah, actually, I would, I would. I wondered, actually -- I think the comment in the call around the investment in sales headcount increases -- that they'd be modest in 2019, so I'm curious where the focus of those added heads will go, and when you think about -- you talked about some of the other increases in budgets, and investment -- what's gonna be the focus of it? I imagine in multi-family; you talked about the marketing campaign, but just to wrap our heads around the structure of the investments in 2019. -- Yeah, they run broadly in line with the numbers I gave a bit earlier I think someone asked one of the other questions on how much we're spending in the different investments, and those are broadly people-driven. The marketing side'll be concentrated fairly more on the Apartments and the LoopNet side; that's where the marketplace is set, but we are adding a decent amount of resourcing into LoopNet, into technology, and then -- when we say ""modest"" for sales, I consider that's less than 10%, which is still can be 50-75 people, easily, for a sales force of that size.In our big area of research, we're finding that they're getting so much good productivity, that's one area we don't need to add a lot of people, as our listing manager products are freeing up resources that we then deploy onto owner and lender products, and helping to support LoopNet, so it's not gonna be in the research world. It's gonna be mostly in technology, and the resources going in to building those investments in the international marketplaces, and the independent owner space. -- I have to say that if I were to look at my wish list from the beginning of 2018 on the structural improvements we would like to complete on our sales force, I feel that we have accomplished a lot of those goals. We have one or two things to do, in terms of go-to-market strategy on major accounts in CoStar, but over the years, I don't feel think I've been in a place where I feel like our sales force is more stable than it is now. We've got a good Apartments.com sales team, led by Paige Forrest, who's a very experienced sales professional. We've got Max Linnington doing a fantastic job.What's happening now is really tweaking a strong group, and we're still probably a year out from anything that would be a major structural change driven by a change in our acquisition, or some other significant change, so we're in a pretty stable place.And we have a question from Stephen Sheldon with William Blair; please go ahead. --  -- Hi, good evening. So you talked about building out software platforms to integrate more in the rental leasing process, and moving past leads with Apartments.com, to more of the execution side, which appears to include Cozy. It makes a lot of sense, but I also wanted to ask about how this could impact your ability to extract data from the rental cycle. So beyond just alleviating pain points, is this also about getting, and integrating more, and better data into your core database? -- That's one of the nice things that we love about the marketplaces; the fact that you're in the data business helps you to perform much more effectively in the marketplace, and the fact that you then do well in the marketplace feeds your data business with some really exciting and valuable data, and it keeps your costs lower, overall, than if you were in just one or the other of the markets. So we're able to afford to get data, and content that we otherwise probably couldn't afford, and we can provide consumers with information in marketplaces that we normally would never pay for if we didn't have an offsetting revenue stream in information.So, yes, success in the IO market will generate a massive amount of real-time, and accounting-grade data. It also gives you really interesting data, where you can understand pricing in relationship to credit, and risk, and you also will be, it also could have the potential of generating new sorts of credit information, that's very valuable to independent owners, and the independent owner data, the data that you generate from the independent owner side is equally valuable to the institutional players, because the renters move back and forth between the different markets, and so it's all very interesting to both those groups, and certainly a Greystar property, though it offers a lot in a given market, its pricing is driven by what's happening in the IO market all around it in a neighborhood.There is high substitution between those two segments, so yeah, if you're a data nerd, pretty exciting data coming out of the project on success.And we have a question from Scott Buck with B. Riley FBR; please go ahead. --  -- Hi, guys. I was curious of the $1 billion-plus you have in cash on the balance sheet, what do you actually need to run the day-to-day operations, and -- to the extent that you're carrying a fair amount above that, would that suggest an appetite for doing a larger transaction within the next couple years? Thanks. -- So I'll take that, and flip it around. I'll say that -- highly likely that we would continue to do acquisitions, as we've done successfully for 20 years, and the size of acquisitions we do -- we'd continue to do smaller deals, and mid-size deals, but we keep gradually escalating the scale of some of the deals we do, so we believe it's quite likely that we'll use that buying power to do transactions in a reasonably short time frame.In terms of how much we -- on the cash side, we're gonna get about $400 million of free cash coming out of this next year, so we'll be adding to our cash piles, unless we're doing larger acquisitions. -- We need new carpet. -- New carpet, OK. Well, $399.5 million we'll generate this year . But, yeah, we had $300 million of free cash flow in 2018; it'll go to $400 million next year, so we definitely don't need all that to run the business. We need to get out there, and keep adding new capabilities, and bigger ones, too. -- Well, I think with that, we are done with the Q&A period, and thank you all for joining us, and don't forget: CoStar is not saturated. I am excited about the many tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of additional future clients we have ahead of us. Thank you for joining us.Ladies and gentlemen, this conference call will be made available for replay.

Image source: The Motley Fool.  Q1 2019 , Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the CoStar First Quarter Financial Results Call. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode, and later we will conduct a question-and-answer session with instructions being given at that time. (Operator Instructions) And, as a reminder, today's call is being recorded.I would now like to turn the call over to our host, Rich Simonelli. Please go ahead, sir. -- Thank you very much, operator, and welcome to CoStar Group's first quarter 2019 conference call. Before I turn the call over to Andy Florance, our CEO and Founder; and Scott Wheeler, our CFO, I'd like to share some very interesting and important items that could actually make your day.Certain portions of our discussion today may contain forward-looking statements, which involve many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements. Important factors that can cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to, those stated in CoStar Group's April 23, 2019, press release on our first quarter earnings and our company outlook and in our CoStar filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and our subsequent Q reports on Form 10-Q is under the heading Risk Factors. All forward-looking statements are based on information available to CoStar on the date of this call, and CoStar assumes no obligation to update these statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure to the non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call, including non-GAAP net income, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and forward-looking non-GAAP guidance are shown in detail in our press release issued today along with definitions for those terms, long definitions. The press release is available on our website located at costargroup.com.As a reminder, today's conference call is being broadcast live and in color on our new and vastly improved Investor Relations website. Please refer to our press release today to how to access this call going forward. Remember one question, so make it a good one.And I'll now turn the call over to Andy. -- Thank you, Rich. Well, let's move to this call quickly, so that we can all get to those long definitions of key financial terms in our press release. Thank you for joining us for CoStar Group's first quarter 2019 . It was just eight weeks ago that we reported superb year-end results and we are pleased to be back so soon reporting another strong quarter with solid revenue growth and even stronger profitability growth.In the first quarter of 2019, CoStar Group total revenue was $328 million, up 20% year-over-year. We've generated $55 million more revenue in the past quarter than we did in the same quarter one year ago. Apartments.com led the way with 30% year-over-year revenue growth. LoopNet's revenue increased 17% year-over-year. CoStar Suite revenue grew 13%, which was at the upper-end of our guidance. Our rural lands marketplaces grew 21% and our business for sale marketplace revenue grew 12% year-over-year.CoStar Real Estate Manager continues to be a tour de force and major contributor with 95% year-over-year revenue growth. With high incremental margin on each dollar sold, our strong revenue growth continues to translate into even higher earnings growth. In each of the last two quarters, we've generated the highest quarterly net income in our history.Net income increased to $85 million in the first quarter, up 63% from $52 million in the first quarter of 2018. We've generated $113 million of EBITDA and $125 million of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter. When annualized, that's consistent with our expectations of generating $0.5 billion of adjusted EBITDA in 2019. Our $55 million year-over-year increase in revenue in the quarter generate a $43 million year-over-year increase of EBITDA, effectively $0.78 of every incremental dollar sold translate into EBITDA.In the first quarter of 2019, adjusted EBITDA margin was 38%, an increase of 700 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2018. Companywide net new bookings grew 36% year-over-year to $48 million in the first quarter of 2019. For the second consecutive apart quarter, Apartments.com generate our best bookings quarter ever as our sales force continues its strong momentum with a 40% increase in net new bookings year-over-year.Last year, we communicate that our entire Apartments sales force was investing a significant amount of time and effort into the important job of converting the newly acquired ForRent contracts into Apartments network contracts. That investment yielded great results, but also meant that they had less time available to generate net new sales last year. Now that we have completed the ForRent conversion and have more time, you can clearly see that the Apartments sales forces' productivity is surging. These results are more impressive because of the quality of customer service the Apartments sales force is delivering, while also delivering great sales numbers.During the first quarter of 2019, the Apartments.com sales force conducted 80,000 sales meetings and earned an audited Net Promoter recommendation score of 9.8 out of 10. That is clearly outstanding customer satisfaction.LoopNet net bookings were up 27% in the first quarter of 2019 over Q1 of 2018. In the first quarter of 2018, we achieved record CoStar sales results when thousands of stranded Xceligent clients rapidly migrated to CoStar. Not surprisingly, while CoStar sales were strong this quarter they didn't -- the bookings did not rise over the Q1 2018 exceptional high watermark.We have grown the CoStar sales force by 6% from the fourth quarter of 2018 to the first quarter of 2019. We intend to continue to grow the CoStar sales force by approximately 30% overall from Q4 2018 to Q4 2019. We have a robust product pipeline for CoStar, CoStar Analytics and the LoopNet marketplace, so we want to grow our sales force to meet the scale of our future opportunity.As we add salespeople, they typically have material revenue impact about a year after they join us. We attribute a big part of our Apartments.com sales success to the priority we place on customer service. Our CoStar sales commission plans over the past year now reflect these same values. As a result, our salespeople are spending more face-to-face time with our clients and prospects. CoStar sales meetings were up 43% year-over-year from 30,000 in the first quarter of 2018 to 43,000 in the most recent quarter. On a per salesperson basis, meetings were up 33%. Net Promoter recommendation scores for the CoStar sales force have climbed to 9.02 on a 10-point scale. I believe this is a leading indicator of client retention and future sales growth.Apartments.com continues to increase our industry-leading position among Internet listing services by achieving all-time highs in unique visitors and number of visits, as reported by comScore for both the month of March and the first quarter of 2019. In the first quarter of 2019, the Apartments.com network had 162 million visits, up 35% year-over-year and averaged 20 million unique monthly visitors, an increase of 30% year-over-year.According to comScore, the Apartments.com network hit an all-time high of 61 million visits in March. That's an increase of 18 million visits over March of 2018 and is up 40% year-over-year. We have been the number one most visited Apartment network for the past 41 months. Also according to comScore, as a network, we had twice the number of monthly visits and monthly unique visitors that the RentPath network had in the first quarter of 2019.On a site basis, Apartments.com had 4 times the number of monthly visits that Apartment Guide had. Wow! Apartments.com tracks a list of 10,000 apartment keywords that we believe are important for marketing multifamily communities online. As of today, we hold the number one organic position in Google's core results for 93% of those keywords when compared to other listing sites. Our primary competitor, RentPath, only holds 2% of them. We continue to pull further away from the competition and I believe that in 2019 we will see a strengthening continuation of that trend.We launched our 2019 Apartments.com marketing campaign, which focuses on the reality that the apartments you choose will change the future you. We have four new TV spots of the highest production quality on special effects we've ever produced. Of course, they feature Jeff Goldblum as our spokesperson Brad Bellflower. We've already gotten great feedback from our clients, from renters and the media on the campaign and we're excited that the heaviest portion of our media plan kicks in during the second quarter to support peak rental season.We're also excited to announce that tomorrow we plan to launch a completely redesigned ForRent.com website, just in time for peak rental season. The new site has a completely redefined renter search experience. Key features include a beautiful new design, lightning fast performance and optimization to rank in the top of Google searches. It's the first site in our network of 11 sites that offers renters a more of a focus on the independent or smaller properties by returning them mixed into the very top of our search results, it'll give renters the feeling that this is really a condo small home, small independent owner website, as well as having large institutional properties.We plan to support the new site launch with aggressive levels of marketing support, including paid search, display advertising, social media, email marketing and strong push by our direct sales team. We look forward to the new site delivering even more traffic leads and leases to our advertisers.We have identified a need that some advertisers with properties and lease up low occupancy in highly competitive market environments have to drive additional lease of their communities even beyond our existing top level, prior top level Diamond package. In response, we have introduced a newer, higher tiered advertising level called Diamond+ Plus, we're really creative of that name, which guarantees the advertiser placement in the top three search results in a given sub-market.The Diamond+ Plus ads average approximately $4,050 per month or nearly $2,500 more per month than the old basic Diamond ad. We believe Diamond+ Plus ads will continue to positively impact our net new bookings throughout 2019 and beyond.In March, LoopNet visits grew 23% year-over-year and we had nearly 6 million unique monthly visitors coming to the site. We are steadily rolling out a number of enhancements for LoopNet as we continue to focus on improving the user experience. This is similar to the strategy we successfully deployed with Apartments.com marketplace. We continue to show strong success with sales of higher priced power ads to owners on the LoopNet platform and these remain a major part of our growth strategy. We had nearly 3 million in annualized net new sales of power ads in the first quarter and the highest priced Diamond level ad sales showed the strongest growth at 87% compared to the first quarter of last year.In the Premium Lister product, we continue to focus on raising the quality of the listings, eliminating unlimited listing plans, which were steeply discounted, and increasing prices on many of the older underpriced listing plans. Average price per listing for this product was up 49% compared to the same quarter last year.Realla is our United Kingdom emerging version of LoopNet. I'm very excited about the potential of that product and in fact we have seen a 346% year-over-year growth in unique visitors on Realla. Belbex is our version of LoopNet for Spain and its organic unique visitors are up 163% year-over-year. Right now, we're in investing phase on these sites building out the traffic, but we intend to begin monetizing them later next year.We continue to deliver a steady stream of enhancements to the CoStar products. Dozens of these enhancements are new commercial real estate analytic tools. These include tools for accessing the probability of selling and leasing in various timeframes, animate weather map like time-based market translate over digital markets, maps, market overview videos from our team of analysts and economists, daily rental rate detail, new statistical exports, retail property underwriting reports and a much more soon to be followed by even more enhancements.We've recently announced a strategic relationship with Fort Worth based Buxton. Buxton is an industry leader in retail site analytics. They analyze and model a retailer successful stores, competitive threats and store to store cannibalization among other factors and then determine ideal potential new locations that are likely to achieve above average sales. Now, Buxton clients who are also CoStar clients will be able to search CoStar for properties that are within ideal trade zones Buxton has identified. This combines the best ranks of each company to provide greater convenience and value to our mutual customers. Both firms intend to cross-sell to one another's client basis.In the first quarter of 2019, CoStar Real Estate Manager revenue was up 95% year-over-year. It continued its strong performance with an increase of 15% on net new bookings in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the same strong quarter last year. CoStar Real Estate Manager continues to add Fortune 1000 customers such as HP, Archer Daniels, Campbells Soup, AECOM, Aramark, and many others. CoStar Real Estate Manager has staked out a leadership position in the lease accounting software market and Q1 represent the first quarter reporting under the new ASC 842 standard.Continued opportunity exists with later reporting public companies as well as the full slate of large private companies. We expect to continue to leverage this market leadership position throughout the remainder of 2019.As we continue to add more institutional and analytic services to CoStar Suite, we've begun to enhance our research coverage of REITs, CMBS business institutional investors. In the first quarter, we completed audit reconciliation of more than 12,000 REIT-owned properties, which encompassed 1.6 billion square feet. We added nearly 4,000 true owners to current or formerly owned REIT properties. We've reconciled CMBS filings back to 2015 and stayed current on 2019 filings, adding thousands of new lease comps, rental points and new deals.Brokers using Listing Manager continued to be solid contributors to the database. In the US, more than 40% of our listings are added each month by our users and new users are steadily joining the ranks of Listing Manager. We've plan to market Listing Manager to encourage more use of this service. We believe that Listing Manager functioning of CoStar and LoopNet will help us to deliver higher quality data, more effective marketing benefits, greater convenience to our clients, all at a much lower cost than some of our historical data collection methods.Commercial real estate continues to attract unprecedented levels of interest from investors. Total deal volume has set new records in each of the past few years and pricing continues to rise. The high level of interest in commercial real estate is justified by sound fundamentals, characterized by strong leasing, consistent demand, limited supply and the lowest vacancy rates since 2000. The robust health of this sector has benefit the industry at large, including brokers, appraisers, underwriters, owners and lenders. And the multifamily sector high levels of construction have been boosting advertising revenues for platforms like Apartments.com, which is a near necessity for communities in Lisa (ph). Barring any surprises, the US will set a record -- the US economy will set a record in July 2019 for the longest post-war expansion on record with 102 months of consecutive job gains. We see no obvious imbalance threatening this remarkable streak in the commercial real estate markets and consensus forecast and CoStar's house viewers growth continuing into 2020, albeit at a slower pace. International concerns around Brexit and China may dim growth slightly, but may also perpetuate the flood of international capital that's fueled US asset price gains, including in commercial and multifamily real estate.The slow and steady growth over the past few years has produced consistent demand and rent gains across all property types. Apartment rent growth accelerated last year, posting 3% gains for the first time since 2016, despite increasing supply. But a broad search of housing, especially for sale product has produced unprecedented demand for new rental product and transaction volume continues to set new records as investors clearly believe in the multifamily story.The office market features an enviable fundamentals and limited supply, at least outside of major markets, which are undergoing wholesale reinventions like Hudson Yards in New York, The Boston seaport, Amazon's HQ2 in Crystal City, Lake View Union in Seattle and South of Market in San Francisco, but single digit office vacancies have delivered only mediocre rent growth at just 2% over the past year.Perhaps, the most remarkable feature of the office market is the consistency of rent growth. Eight years of slow, steady increases, a welcome departure from the boom bust cycles of 1999 and 2007, of course throw in there 1986 or 1981, I think that is roughly right.The outlook calls for more steady if modest rent gains, thanks to low vacancy levels, even if demand weakens.Demand for industrial properties remain at historically high levels, driven by the growth -- growing trend toward online purchasing and same day delivery. Still, vacancy rates appear to have bottomed out amid record setting deliveries. Persistent rent growth of more than 5% has drawn a record setting sales volume resulting in price appreciation exceeding 10% year-over-year. The growing economy has yet to reverse lackluster dynamics for retail sector though as structural change in the industry when demand for physical space. While, well located properties continue to perform well, historically low vacancy rates are still mainly a result of limited construction and have yet to fuel significant rent gains.We expect the record levels of interest in commercial and multifamily real estate to continue across all property types at an any economic outcome, CoStar Group offers products and services that are essential to owners, lenders, brokers, investors and property managers alike as they participate in commercial real estates' increasingly competitive ultra high stakes marketplace.It's been a great start to a new year for CoStar and I'm extremely excited about the rest of the year and particularly the coming decade, as we continue to execute on our long term vision. At this point, I'm going to liven up the call by turning it over to our CFO, Scott Wheeler. -- Thank you, Andy. Very flattering introduction. Here comes the lively portion of the call, I'm going to Call+. All right. Well, we did have a great start to 2019, great sales numbers, produced great revenue growth and these both allow our leverage model to give us increased levels of profitability and strong cash generation. So, as Andy mentioned, revenue in the first quarter of 2019 increased 20% over first quarter of 2018, which was near the high-end of our guidance.Looking at revenue performance by services, CoStar Suite revenue growth was 13% in the first quarter of 2019 versus first quarter of 2018. The growth was primarily driven to both brokers and owners and it's evenly balanced between existing clients and new logos. As previously communicated, the revenue growth rate for CoStar Suite is expected to be in the 11% to 13% range for 2019.Revenue in the Information Services Group grew 25% year-over-year in the first quarter, primarily as a result of CoStar Real Estate Manager's revenue growth of 95%. The adoption of the new lease accounting standards created strong demand for our Real Estate Manager product, which we do expect to continue, although slightly moderated throughout the year as we move past the peak adoption date of the new lease standard. Information Services revenue is expected to grow at a rate of 11% to 13% on a year-over-year basis.Multifamily revenue growth for Q1 remained strong at 30% over the first quarter of 2018, which is in line with our expectations. Going forward, the second and third quarters of 2019 are expected to reflect the lower growth rates than the first quarter of 2019 for two reasons, both related to the ForRent acquisition. First, we've now lapped the anniversary date of the ForRent acquisition. Second, there will be a modest negative effect on the 2019 growth rate, because certain products and duplicative revenues were eliminated since the acquisition, but we're in our 2018 base results.The growth rate in the second quarter for 2019 is expected to be in the low-teens increasing to the high-teens by the third quarter.On a pro forma basis, when you include ForRent for all of 2018 and you exclude the discontinued services, the year-over-year multifamily revenue growth would be approximately 20% in both the second and the third quarters of 2019. Multifamily revenue is expected to exit 2019 in line with the 20% full year outlook for multifamily.Last, but certainly not least, Commercial Property and Land revenue grew 17% year-over-year in the first quarter of 2019. This is due to the continued strong sales of LoopNet marketing products, including our tiered advertising products which grew approximately 37% year-over-year in the first quarter. Our Lands business also contributed to strong growth with 21% year-over-year revenue growth. And we continue expect organic growth in the Commercial Property and Land sector in the 18% to 20% range for 2019.Gross margins came in at 78% in the first quarter of 2019, in line with what we saw in the fourth quarter of 2018 and we expect this level of gross margins to continue around 78% for 2019. Operating expenses of $164 million for the first quarter of 2019 is slightly below our expectations, primarily as a result of modest timing delays in our marketing and some G&A expenses.First quarter adjusted EBITDA of $125 million represents a 49% increase compared to adjusted EBITDA of $84 million in the first quarter of 2018. The adjusted EBITDA was approximately $3 million above the midpoint of our guidance range and about $1 million above the high-end of our guidance range. The resulting adjusted EBITDA margin of 38% is 90 basis points above the midpoint of our guidance and 740 basis points above the 31% margin we achieved in the first quarter of 2018.Net income for the first quarter 2019 of $85 million, increased 63% or $33 million compared to first quarter of 2018.Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 13%, reflecting benefits associated with share-based payment transactions.Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter increased 54% to $92 million or $2.53 per diluted share and includes adjustments for stock-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter assumes a tax rate of 25%, which does not include discrete items such as the impact of the share-based payment transaction.Cash and investment balances were approximately $1.2 billion as of March 31, 2019, up $132 million since the end of 2018.Now let's look at some of our performance metrics for the quarter. At the end of the first quarter, our sales force totaled approximately 757 people. The renewal rate on annual contracts for the first quarter was in line with the rate achieved in the fourth quarter of 2018 at 90%. The renewal rate for customers who've been subscribers for five years or longer was 96%, in line with the 96% renewal rate in the fourth quarter of 2018.Subscription revenue on annual contracts now accounts for 82% of our revenue in the first quarter, up from 79% this time last year. The improvements are primarily a result of our successful migration of the ForRent customer base for Apartments.com network and to annual contract.I'll now discuss our outlook for the full year and the second quarter of 2019. Based on first quarter revenue and sales results, our full year 2019 revenue range of $1.37 billion to $1.38 billion remains unchanged. We continue to expect revenue growth for the year between 15% and 16%. We expect revenue for the second quarter of 2019 in the range of $333 million to $337 million, representing top line growth of around 13% at the midpoint. The growth rate expected in the second quarter is negatively impacted by the discontinued ForRent revenues mentioned earlier and the lapping of the anniversary of that acquisition.On a pro forma basis, including ForRent for all of 2018 and excluding discontinued services, our revenue growth rate outlook for the second quarter would be approximately 16%. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $495 million to $505 million for the full year of 2019 in line with our previous outlook. Year-over-year, we expect adjusted EBITDA growth of 20% with adjusted EBITDA margin for the year of approximately 36% at the midpoint of the guidance range.For the second quarter of 2019, we expect adjusted EBITDA in the range of $98 million to $102 million. As in prior years, we expect the second quarter to be the low point for adjusted EBITDA margins for the year, as we increase our marketing spend for the start of the peak apartment rental season. Margins are expected to increase sequentially in the third and fourth quarters.In terms of earnings, our revised range of $9.90 to $10.10 for full year non-GAAP net income per diluted share is an increase of approximately $0.10 at the midpoint compared to our previous outlook. For the second quarter of 2019, we expect non-GAAP net income per share in a range of $1.94 to $2.02, based on 36.7 million shares.So to wrap things up, a great start to the year and a very strong position financially, and I certainly look forward to updating each and every one of you on our progress as we continue throughout the year. Thank you. -- That's definitely a Call+. -- Thank you. Let's open it up for some questions.All right. Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from George Tong of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. -- Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. Your 2Q guidance implies about 120 basis points of year-over-year EBITDA margin expansion at the midpoint, which compares with 740 bps of margin expansion you just delivered and your full year guidance suggestive rate of margin expansion will narrow relative to the first half. Can you discuss the factors that are driving a more conservative back-end margin outlook? -- Yeah. I think what we see George is certainly the timing of investment policy and second quarter is primarily driven by all the marketing that we're spending and we expect that to be our strongest quarter, but still up in third and fourth quarter over the prior years. I think you also see a lot of benefit in the first quarter as we passed. We had the ForRent acquisition annualizing and so all those benefits are now into the numbers as we lap the margin improvements we got last year from ForRent. So those are pretty much the biggest factors I would call off.All right. Thank you. And now to the line of Bill Warmington of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. -- Good afternoon, everyone. -- Welcome, Bill, we've been waiting for you. -- So, is it true that you're handing out free Tesla's to all the sell-side analysts, is that what I'd heard something about that? -- It depends on the nature of the report. -- Okay. -- Those are good questions, Bill. Thank you. -- All right. Okay. Now the real question. -- This is for top performers. -- I was hoping for an update on the LoopNet marketplace in two ways, one being the build out of the LoopNet marketplace site and how that's going? And second is, maybe to talk about some changes in the sales force structure moving to a more of a national account coverage model that might help the sale of that product? -- Sure. So definitely a lot of effort, lot of work going on LoopNet 2.0. And actually it was about there for a week or so -- last year the development -- last week -- two weeks ago, i was with the development team for the week in California going over the product, a very productive meeting, and we hope to make strong releases in the third and fourth quarter around that product area. I picked up a customer service call this morning randomly and the customer was complaining they wanted two major features in LoopNet that we have already put into the new design, so right top of the list. So stronger and easier searching for restaurants and being able to highlight things with broker comments. So feeling good about that where that's going.We're also spent last week with our photography team making sure the right to support the new elements of that product. And you can see that growth began to click up and we remain very excited about it and you also see it beginning -- an effort going on in Spain and in the United Kingdom to match the effort that we're doing here. And so, all in all, it remains on track and we are excited about it.In terms of the major accounts to the national accounts, the sales force, we took the -- we had last year quarters on what the sales force need to sell of LoopNet in order to make the higher commission rates. We've removed that this year, so they could focus on general customer service and set their own allocations and priorities, and the nice thing is the sales results have continue to come in for LoopNet naturally without the commission focuses. So we think that's looking good and we will be structured in the LoopNet major national accounts the same way we structure Apartments.com in the near future. So it's a lot of software work going on and a lot of operating work that needs to be done to position for it, but it's on track and it's a top priority.All right. Thank you. And now to the line of David Ridley-Lane of Bank of America. Please go ahead. -- Sure. Two questions on the -- of the impact of the ForRent product cancellations. One, do you have some sort of quantification for the impact on net bookings in the first quarter? And, two, did I get my sort of the math right around your guidance for the second quarter, that it's about $3 million of revenue that was -- it was canceled for the second quarter. Is that in the ballpark? Thank you. -- No, we don't have a number on the booking side, David. There was -- there's certainly effects running through last year, but we did talk about the -- on the booking side effects. But on the pro forma side, we see the -- I look for the Apartments pro forma for you, I will get it. I know it's here somewhere. So, yeah, we had somewhere between $3 million and $6 million per quarter throughout the year that we're going to -- expect us -- and the biggest effect would have been in the second quarter for 2018. So, hopefully, that will help give you some idea of how big those discontinued revenues are.All right. Thank you. And now to line of Peter Christiansen from Citi. Please go ahead. -- Good afternoon. Thanks for the question. On the 40% bookings growth in multifamily, do you have any sense of what portion of that is coming from competitive takeaways versus just normal wins, new wins? And then my follow-up is, with $1.2 billion going on $1.3 billion in cash on the balance sheet, what's your sense for deploying that capital as we look forward to the next couple of quarters? -- Good questions. So in the first one, I was -- I ran into our Head of Apartment Sales last week down in Richmond and she couldn't wait to tell me about some huge competitive wins we just had. I think she was talking about some community with 135 properties moving over or something or some organization with 135 properties moving over. So my sense is, that there is a lot of competitive shifts going on. We are having some success with the Diamond+ Plus ads as well, but a lot of its competitive shift and the numbers are really quite impressive. Like, when I look at the total of counts, I don't -- I won't recall exactly what the number was last time I looked, but they are very impressive, competitive wins and for good reason as the traffic numbers are so compelling, the lead advantages are so compelling on Apartments.com. And the benefit of having invested well over $1 billion in Apartments.com has resulted in a huge competitive distancing going on there.I also got an email today from Apartments' Regional Sales Manager with someone moving a bunch of properties over and they specifically cited the quality of our customer service. They said the fact that we were in their communities every month or every month and a half briefing them on what was happening in their local market and the fact that they had not seen the competitor in four years was a major factor in shifting all their purchasing over to us. So on hard numbers I've seen in the last two months, I would say major competitive shift and anecdotally in the last two weeks, I'd say, continuation and possible acceleration in competitive shift.In terms of our petty cash of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, we are -- remained active in looking at a number of potential acquisitions, but we remain selective and we devote a significant amount of effort to that ongoing and those things will happen in time, but our track record over the last 20 years of acquiring 30 plus companies, it's sort of hard to imagine that won't continue. And so that -- we would expect that capital would be put to good use in transformative ways and we look forward to that day.Thank you. And now it's the line of Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust. Please go ahead. -- Hi, guys. (multiple speakers) the update today. Andy, what one of the areas that come up over the years is international? And you've kind of mentioned big markets, but maybe not a whole lot of companies with critical mass or maybe different market structures. Sounds like maybe you're getting closer to monetizing that opportunity now. Can you kind of frame that up in what it might mean over the next few years for your growth? -- Sure. So we're -- I mean you're right. There are some acquisition opportunities over there that are midsized that could be interesting, but that -- really what we're focusing on is just organic growth in those markets. So we have been racheting up our investment in the last 18 months in the United Kingdom, where we're in Germany and Spain. We see some exciting -- some good opportunities in France, availability of lower cost digital data, machine learning to harvest data on the Internet, so we're investing period and we saw -- on a small scale, we saw a huge growth in the first quarter in the United Kingdom in our bookings, but still modest by comparison to the United States and we think that we have every expectation that that growth will pay off in the next couple of years. The nice thing is we're now getting a multi-country footprint and I will be -- I think it'll be transformative when we can put three or four European countries into one consistent platform. So that's one of our big goals in the next three years or so, and I think that will move us up to parallel growth rates for the United States.Thank you. And now it's line of Stephen Sheldon from William Blair. Please go ahead. -- Hi, guys. Good evening. -- Good evening, Steve. -- On bookings, it seems like you're continuing to see broad based momentum, but I wanted to ask how bookings activity in the first quarter kind of compare to your expectations, so just excluding the LoopNet run off in the year ago period, $48 million this quarter was down, some relative to the $54 million in the year ago period and $50 million in the fourth quarter. I know there were some seasonality relative to the fourth quarter, but anything else that we should consider when making the sequential and the year-over-year bookings comparisons? -- Not really. I think we were very happy with the bookings, I was upwardly surprised as the Apartments.com bookings were extremely strong and continue to be extremely strong. We're running the business looking nine months, a year or so out, so we're working a lot of things that are not month to month and there is always volatility as you look at the numbers like what land might be doing one quarter, what farms might be doing one quarter. Things shift around, they're all generally really strong, but there is -- since they're real returns and real sales results, there's volatility to them. If they are ever perfectly linear, that'd be a made-off situation, that's not happening. And so they move around, but they're strong. I think we got the pay off from last year's customer service and conversion efforts for the ForRent when you see the surging productivity there, the investment in additional face time with customers, with CoStar will probably pay off in the next two quarters. So, all in all, great quarter, very happy of the results and phenomenal results.Thank you. And now to line of Mayank Tandon from Needham. Please go ahead. -- Thank you. Andy or Scott, Is there a way to think about revenue growth in terms of the pricing uplift you expect this year and over time and the contribution from new clients plus increased penetration from current clients? How should we think about the growth profile if you break it down that way? I do realize it's going to be difficult across different segments, which is maybe for the company overall. -- I'll throw some remarks and then you can deal as well. So lot of the pricing lift we're seeing is, we are not driving aggressive price increases against our core customers for the same products, the exception being on our marketplaces demand is really strong. So with LoopNet, you're seeing super strong demand in markets like Southern California and Southern Florida, so you're getting some saturation on advertisers. So we're eliminating big, big steeply discounted contracts, so someone was getting 60% price breaks or discounts, we're eliminating those consistently and bringing people more up to standard pricing level that looks that gives you that 49% year-over-year price lift on PL. It's not so much we're taking off everybody up, we're eliminating low-end discounts. Then you're getting product transformation, so as we rebuild LoopNet to really effectively showcase mega properties of super high-end properties, those will be sold at dramatically higher price points, but to new customers for new product. So that'll bring the average -- the ASP up dramatically, but not because we're doing across the board increases for the same product, it'll be more incremental prices.The -- this continue as we go into more analytic products for CoStar, you're selling to higher utility institutional clients, you get higher ASPs there as well, but delivering product to the 1% or 2% brokerage shop in Oklahoma City remains just as higher priority and we're not taking those prices up beyond roughly inflation. So, it's a mix. Do you want to? -- Yeah. We track the price volume mix equation into the big groups. And as you just said, the only place where we've really had price increase was in the LoopNet, getting rid of some of those discounts and then as we moved people in the ForRent acquisition to the broader network then you saw this other effect of moving to a broader network contract, which would have higher revenues per property than what we had before. So it's not really a pure price increase, it's a broader package increase and such -- those types of things and the other ones that Andy mentioned that are really driving what we called price, which really is accounting for good half of what our revenue growth is in many quarters, because of those effects.All right. Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And now it's the line of Pat Walravens from IMP Securities (sic-JMP Securities). Please go ahead. -- Hi. This is actually Joe Goodwin on for Pat. Thank you for taking my question. I was just curious (multiple speakers) -- JMP Securities? -- Yeah, JMP Securities. That was a poor mistake there. Yeah. As a former software salesperson myself, I was looking at the Net Promoter Scores that you guys shared earlier and they seem really high and from my experience people don't always love speaking with software sales reps, that's what imply. So I guess just really curious, how do you guys go about calculating those scores? And how and when did you collect that data? -- Yes, so what happens is, there is a independent team that works in a different group from sales based on on Atlanta, Georgia, and each day they look at meetings that occurred 4 to 24 hours prior and they randomly sample the people at those meetings where held with and I won't get the wording exactly right, but they say based on your meeting yesterday and your overall impression of Apartments or CoStar how likely do you recommend CoStar or Apartments.com to a friend or colleague? So it's the recommended question. And that gets us a 9.02 on CoStar and gets us to 9.8 on Apartments.com and there was one woman, sorry, I can't remember her name or where she was, who for the year, last year, scored 9.98. So she is just a little bit of a strongest sales person than you are. But I bowed -- and to her, like, if we get a 9.98, I'll try to get her name for the next earnings call, so I want actually Cassandra to recruit her.You're right that people don't want to talk to -- typically don't want to spend their day with software salespeople, but we try to make sure that we're showing them some new benefit to them. We also talk to them about the general market. I also believe we delivered over 1 million tchotchkes last year...And the cookies and the candies. -- Those cookies, candy, a charger cable, a cozy, we delivered so many little minor gifts. We do have all kinds of strategies for building those relationships and it tends to work.Thank you. And now to line of Sterling Auty from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. -- (technical difficulty) -- Sterling, we're having a hard time hearing you. -- Is the line better? -- That's better. -- Better. -- Okay. I was saying that, in the prepared remarks, you had the commentary obviously on the strength of multifamily, but also the deceleration in commercial real estate, just want to -- from a high level, does that mean that as you look throughout the rest of the year that the focus of the investments will continue to be on the strength in multifamily housing? And just to this quarter, did you invest to the level you thought you would in the commercial real estate part of the business? -- I would think that we did invest in the commercial real estate side the way we'd expect to. And investing, I think the question is reinvesting into the strengths of multifamily. In the prepared remarks, I'd noticed that and I thought, yes, there's a lot of upside in commercial real estate right now as with the whole economy. And yes, the statistics, the market indicators are all as the best I've seen in my career, for sure.I hate to ever admit this, but I also -- we'd note earlier $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion in cash, downturns are good too, because we bought some amazing companies in the downturns and we are not terribly cyclical as a company. We typically are able to grow through downturns and there is actually both a cyclical advantage to strengthen Apartment industry for us as people are building a lot of new developments. They are ready to invest in getting faster lease up on those new buildings. Conversely, when the wheels come off and vacancy rates drop, what they spend on lead generation with Apartments.com is peanuts or any other call for term you want to use compared to the amount of money at risk in these communities.So when someone spending $1,100, $1,200 a month on getting the majority of their lease to keep their $250 million property leased and solvent, they don't cut back on that $1,100 a month. So I think that's one of the nice things about our business as we are pretty -- we've benefited in the up cycle and we're very resilient on the down cycle. But still today, no indicators show in the down cycle.Thank you. We have no one else in queue. Please continue. -- With that. we're going to wrap up the call. Thank you, everyone, for joining us, and thank you Scott for a fantastic Call+, and thank you Rich for a really fascinating read on the risks and the definitions and look forward to hearing you -- hearing -- spending time with you guys again at the end of the second quarter.All right.

"n recent trading, shares of CoStar Group, Inc. (Symbol: CSGP) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $442.00, changing hands for $454.33/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 9 different analyst targets contributing to that average for CoStar Group, Inc., but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $377.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $500.00. The standard deviation is $47.307.But the whole reason to look at the  CSGP price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with CSGP crossing above that average target price of $442.00/share, investors in CSGP have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $442.00 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

"Shares of  (NASDAQ: CSGP) are up about 12% as of 12:30 p.m. EST on Wednesday after the company reported its earnings for the fourth quarter after the market closed on Tuesday.The real estate information and analytics company earned $83.5 million in the fourth quarter, an 89% increase over the year-ago period, on a 24% increase in revenue year over year. It also guided for continued double-digit revenue and profit growth over the course of 2019.CoStar's business can generally be split into two. Its software business is built around CoStar Suite, a product that is to physical real estate what a Bloomberg Terminal is to stocks. In the fourth quarter, revenue from CoStar Suite increased 16% compared to the prior-year period.Image source: Getty Images.It also has a fast-growing advertising-driven business in the form of its ownership of LoopNet, Apartments.com, ForRent.com, and other websites that allow landlords and brokers to list commercial and multifamily properties for sale or rent online.Its online advertising-based businesses are on fire, helped by a boom in multifamily rentals and CoStar's ability to grab a larger share of advertising dollars. On the  , management said that it believes the multifamily business will exit 2019 with revenue growth ""in line with the 20% full-year outlook"" in 2018. Put another way, CoStar sees opportunities for 20% revenue growth in its multifamily business even after the business starts lapping accounting periods in which ForRent.com revenue is included. That acquisition closed in late February 2018.CoStar's commercial marketplaces (LoopNet, primarily) also had an excellent 2018, posting revenue growth of 16% for the full year and 17% in the fourth quarter. On the conference call, Scott Wheeler, CoStar's chief financial officer, said that LoopNet was rolling out more expensive listing options geared toward property owners, not brokers, which will help the business grow as the mix shifts toward costlier options.CoStar's guidance for 2019 is rosy, to say the least. The company expects full-year revenue of $1.37 billion to $1.38 billion, a 15% to 16% improvement over 2018. Meanwhile, it anticipates that total operating expenses will grow at a rate of 9% to 11%, resulting in wider margins as revenue grows at a faster pace than expenses.CoStar doesn't give guidance for GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) net income, though it does offer guidance on a non-GAAP basis, calling for non-GAAP net income of $9.80 to $10 per share, a roughly 20% increase over 2018 at the midpoint. An impressive end to 2018 and healthy guidance for 2019 is sending shares higher today.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Why CoStar Group Shares Are Up 12% Today@2019-02-27@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-costar-group-shares-are-12-today-2019-02-27

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the WisdomTree U.S. Earnings 500 Fund ETF (Symbol: EPS), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $36.00 per unit.With EPS trading at a recent price near $30.59 per unit, that means that analysts see 17.67% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of EPS's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (Symbol: LH), CoStar Group, Inc. (Symbol: CSGP), and Synopsys Inc (Symbol: SNPS). Although LH has traded at a recent price of $143.33/share, the average analyst target is 25.19% higher at $179.43/share. Similarly, CSGP has 24.89% upside from the recent share price of $365.82 if the average analyst target price of $456.89/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting SNPS to reach a target price of $109.83/share, which is 22.79% above the recent price of $89.45.

Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Analysts Anticipate EPS Will Reach $36@2018-12-06@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/analysts-anticipate-eps-will-reach-36-2018-12-06

Later there will be a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.And, I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Rich Simonelli. Please go ahead, sir. -- Thank you, operator. Welcome to CoStar Group third quarter 2018 conference call.Before I turn the call over to Andy Florance, CoStar's CEO and Founder, and Scott Wheeler, our CFO, I'd like to share some interesting and important items that can actually make your day.Certain portions of our discussion today may contain forward-looking statements, which involve many risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to differ materially from such statements.

So please refer to today's press release on how to access the replay of the call. Remember one question, make it a good one.I'll now turn the call over to Andy Florance. Andy? -- Rich, on behalf of all of our shareholders, I want to thank you for those inspirational words. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2018 .We achieved another excellent quarter of solid revenue growth, exceptional margin expansion and continued strong net bookings. Revenue for the third quarter 2018 was $306 million, an increase of 23% compared to revenue of $248 million for the third quarter of 2017.I'm excited to report that we flew past our first $300 million quarter. Our annual revenue run rate now exceeds $1.2 billion. We had strong CoStar Suite revenue growth of 19% in the third quarter of 2018, compared to the same period last year. Some of that growth is attributed to converting LoopNet premium searchers and heavy searchers to CoStar Suite.To date, we've worked through approximately a quarter of the initial 100,000 leads we identified and have seen approximately 11,200 conversions. We have now reached $64 million in annualized revenue from this conversion list.Earlier this quarter, we identified an additional 30,000 commercial real estate professional leads from LoopNet that were previously not on our active lead lists.As we have seen time and again, since the LoopNet acquisition closed in 2012, LoopNet is a great source for identifying and refilling our lead list of commercial real estate professionals that we can sell CoStar Suite to. I still believe that over time we can generate hundreds of millions of incremental annual subscription revenue by upselling LoopNet users to CoStar Suite.Apartments.com grew 45% year-over-year in the third quarter of 2018, as we continue to expand our leadership position in this space. Our multifamily annual revenue run rate is now $420 million and we expect to continue to achieve solid organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter and through all of 2019. I should clarify I mean the fourth quarter of 2018.Our profitability continued to expand in the third quarter of 2018. Net income increased 72% year-over-year in the third quarter to $59 million. We generated our best EBITDA quarter in our history as EBITDA jumped 42% sequentially in the third quarter of 2018 versus the second quarter of this year.Our adjusted EBITDA was $110 million in the quarter, up 29% over the prior quarter, reaching a 36% adjusted EBITDA margin, so close to 40%.We're confidently on our way to surpassing our goal of 40% adjusted EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter 2018. Unless you do not know, about four years ago we set a long-range goal of reaching a $250 million revenue quarter by the fourth quarter of this year and adjusted EBITDA margin of 40%.Clearly, with a $306 million quarter this quarter, we are on track to smash through the revenue goal and with a strong margin expansion, we're showing we're clearly on track to beat our profitability goals.Should we beat our fourth quarter financial target, as we fully expect to, we plan to set brand new equally spectacular inspiring NextGen long range revenue and margin targets designed to delight our investors.Companywide net new bookings were 40 million in the third quarter of 2018, an increase of 16% year-over-year, over the $34 million we generated in the third quarter of 2017. While net new bookings are up 16%, the number understates the true sales productivity achieved in the quarter.During the quarter and for most of the year, our apartments.com sales force, which is about half our sales force, spent most of their time, vast majority of their time, transitioning over 7,100 new ForRent customers the apartments.com network.The large amount of revenue we added when we acquired ForRent, never appeared in our net new sales numbers, but the previously communicated and expected reduction of duplicative spend between the two sites was counted as negative net new sales in this quarter's bookings numbers.So while we're adding a lot of great revenue and picking up humongous strategic advantage this year, the results show up as somewhat misleading slower bookings. We finished the majority of the conversion work. So going forward, we expect the sales booking numbers will reflect true productivity.There's been a significant accomplishment in the CoStar sales organization this year. Historically, our field sales force sold CoStar predominantly in a combination of an inside sales team and a separate field sales team sold LoopNet ads.The clients really expressed their satisfaction with so many different points of contact. There is no good reason for doing it this way. It was just how the go-to-market strategy evolved historically from the merger of LoopNet. It was a huge learning and behavior shift for the traditionally in force sales force, but it's worked out spectacularly.In total, gross LoopNet sales bookings contribution from the CoStar sales force was up $2.8 million for Q3 year-over-year. This is up 216%, I am sorry, 261% year-over-year. On a per rep basis, gross LoopNet sales bookings contribution from the CoStar sales force was 39,000 for Q3. This is up 249% year-over-year. So they are learning some new things, folks and customer service selling LoopNet, but still yielding good productivity and we are aligning the Salesforce where we wanted to be long-term.We announced earlier this month that we had acquired Realla Limited, the UK's largest public portal specializing in commercial property. It's got the largest collection of publicly available property listings in the United Kingdom.Combining Realla with the CoStar information solution is expected to offer the best of tools for marketing properties, valuations and facilitating transactions. Realla's business value focuses on providing brokers a broad range of channels to market their listings. Using Realla, a broker can create a micro-site, generate a PDF to a blast email distribution, syndicate their listings on various sites, report leasing progress to owners and market to millions of potential lessees or buyers on Realla.com.We are very impressed with these tools and Realla's strategy for very cost officially gathering and managing larger volumes of listings. We intend to corporate a significant amount of Realla's technology into CoStar across Europe and North America.Overall, our apartments.com numbers are extremely impressive and getting better. In the third quarter of 2018, we generated our best traffic quarter ever with the most unique visitors and leads in a quarter. Our leads, which have proven to be the highest quality leads in the industry are up 50% year-over-year, which translates into more leases and a better return on investment for our advertisers on the apartments.com network.According to comScore, the average monthly unique visitors year-to-date are up over 37% for the apartments.com network. This excludes the move network from both periods.During that same time period, RentPath average monthly unique visitors are actually down. Let me repeat, their unique visitors are actually down and then one can assume so is the return on investment for their advertisers.As a stand-alone site, apartments.com had more unique visitors than Zillow Rentals in August and September of 2018.Even more impressive apartments.com network year-to-date visits sit at $404 million according to comScore, up 105 million from 2017, again excluding moved network during both time periods. We have increased the apartments.com network visits gap over RentPath by almost an additional 100 million to a gap of 239 million visits for the first three quarters of 2018.On October 5th, Moody's Investor Service downgraded our primary competitor RentPath. It took the rating to CAA one and it's probably a default rating to CAA 1 PD. Moody's also downgraded the company's senior secured first line credit facilities to B3 from B2. The second lien term loan was downgraded to CAA3 from CAA 2.They revised the outlook for RentPath from stable to negative, Moody's said the downgrade reflects a challenging competitive dynamics in the apartment rental market and a material increase in marketing spend required to compete against a larger and better capitalized competitor. I assume and hope Moody's is referring to apartments.com there.They also stated they expected the December 17, 2019 maturity of $15 million in the undrawn revolving credit availability will further pressure the company's financial position as competition remains challenging.In contrast, Apartments.com has exciting and robust plans for next year and beyond. The outlook for Apartments.com is positive and moving to very positive. The profit contribution from Apartments.com continues to gain strength. Incremental direct profit from our apartment business in the third quarter is up 60% year-over-year. We expect total profit contribution from the apartments business to be up approximately 100% year-over-year. This is double the expected year-over-year revenue increase of 40% to 45%.Listing detail views are up 32% year-over-year and each listing is being viewed 69% more times year-over-year. With LoopNet, our primary priority remains building higher impact power add opportunities for clients who have very valuable properties and want to drive more leads or create a stronger brand presence than our basic ads offer.The new power ad placards that drive increased exposure went live in Q3 with significant power add updates ahead in Q4. Typically, these ads are sold to the owners of the properties, who have a much greater stake in economics and are willing to pay a higher price.We have introduced new market-based pricing that correlates pricing to the value of the real estate in a given market and to some extent also the demand for the ad space. You might find a vacancy in Manhattan with a total lease value as high as $0.5 billion. In Toledo, the largest vacancy might be worth 100th of that.Accordingly, a top ad in New York might sell for $6500 a month, while an ad in Toledo might price at $450 a month. Sort of common sense, but we think it will help us optimize revenue.This fall, we plan to roll out market-based pricing as well on Premium Lister, our basic advertising placement. Some markets are oversold or saturated and we want to actively manage our inventory. In fact, in Southern Florida, 82% of all office properties from small to large now advertise.The price per paid listing on LoopNet increased to $46 in Q3 of 2018 versus $31 in Q3 of last year, a 48% increase year-over-year. This has been a result of our proactive price management on LoopNet.CoStar Real Estate Manager continues to be a total force growing revenue 141% in the third quarter 2018 compared to the third quarter of last year. Is that number actually correct Scott, because it seems really high? -- No, it's big. Correct. -- With the continued strong growth and huge potential of Real Estate Manager, the President of Real Estate Manager, Eddy Thomas now reports directly to me. We believe that there are a number of very interesting opportunities to accelerate the momentum of Real Estate Manager and expand the scope of this very impactful and successful business.In August 2018, we completed the closing of our research centers in Glasgow, Scotland and Columbia, Maryland. Our centers in London, Richmond, Washington and San Diego have absorbed the workload and the transition has been very smooth.We continue to see more and more brokers and owners entering quality data directly into CoStar self service listing manager. During the quarter, approximately 36% of the millions of updates made were made directly by the broker or owner listing the property. We estimate this represents more than 100 researchers worth of work saved.This trend has the potential to materially reduce the amount of labor we need to invest in order to keep our databases current. In July, Listing Manager was also released in the UK.Today, most of our revenue from commercial real estate is -- most of our revenues from commercial real estate investors, operators and lenders. Our single largest client is now an owner. It used to be a large brokerage firm. A number of our top 10 clients are now investors or owner-operators. These clients need accurate and timely data with powerful models to help them understand market opportunities and risks.We are completing an important cultural shift at CoStar, improving our approach to best serving this massive opportunity. Historically, a large component of our analytics solutions were consulting based. We would meet one-on-one with large investors or lenders and one-off provide them with analytics.This process engage costly personnel, could not be scaled in any way and was not a material contributor to margin and never would be. We have completely restructured and clarified the leadership admission of our analytics team. Jay Spivey, who has been in leadership with us for 25 years, now leads all of our analytic solutions.We have a clear mission now to devote our best talent to building leverageable digital analytic solutions that serve tens of thousands of clients or millions of clients, rather than just a few. My hope is to see an exponentially growing suite of analytic solutions, providing insights into risk, CMBS, REITs, portfolios, underwriting valuation, peering geospatial trends, benchmarking capital markets and more.We just held a three-day analytics leadership summit at our Richmond research headquarters. About 50 of our best and brightest gathered to plan our potential product roadmap to best serve the industry through innovation. We were focused on solutions that can be delivered during calendar year 2020 or before. Appropriately, we called the session Vision 2020.The participants led 30 presentations focusing on key opportunities for CoStar. I think it would be helpful to share with you some of the wrap-up survey quotes from the survey monkey that our participants did.One said, a lot of confidence that this team of people can make some amazing advances between now and 2020. Another exciting appreciation for a talented team, understanding growth opportunities, path to grow in revenue from $1 billion to $5 billion plus.Another -- the motivation to create and build these products is a full 360-cycle, i.e., owner portfolio, lender analytics, investment transaction platform, property evaluation, there is so much opportunity. The sense that I'm not working for a 30-year-old company, but a new start-up with best year is still in the future.Complete all at the talent across CoStar, we have some of the greatest individuals in commercial real estate. Another noted slightly less hopefully, ""I gained five pounds this week"" and another more productive comment, ""excitement, huge potential for CoStar across many areas in markets, impressed by the quality of the team, happy to be part of the team.""Another quote, ""huge appreciation to the amazing talent we have at CoStar"" and another one, ""enthusiasm, optimism, commitments and energy"". Another one, ""great optimism for the future, we have some amazing talent here.""This was an incredible opportunity to share ideas, check how other groups were working on and build relationships with key stakeholders involved in improving the CoStar product. The passion that everyone brought to the meeting was tangible and infectious and helps reinforce while we're far and away the leader in our field and the best quote, ""now the real work begins.""One update to you on the commercial real estate economy, first, the good news. CoStar has very limited exposure to trade issues with China. 20-foot equivalent units are not an important factor in our business.The third quarter of 2018 ended with commercial vacancies near all time lows. Prices and rents are at all-time highs and leasing and transaction volume setting new records.The ongoing health of the asset class is the result of a durable national economy that 10 years into the third longest post war expansion continues to reliably add 200,000 jobs per month, despite a 3.7% unemployment rate. A low yielding investment environment which is historically low cap rates offer attractive relative value and restrained very importantly, restrained on the part of developers.Recent rate hikes by the Fed have yet to dent commercial real estate's relative value proposition. So CoStar's analysts and clients are closely watching interest rate movements and CoStar data shows some pricing weakness in gateway markets.Industrial continues to outperform other property types in terms of rent growth and price appreciation. Thanks to the national economy and the ongoing shift to consumption patterns toward e-commerce.This disruption consumption patterns has weakened demand someone for traditional retail space and rent growth and retail sectors lag the other property types. However, there is very limited development of new retail space and that's kept retail fundamentals broadly in balance, in fact, really quite healthy.Trends in the multifamily sector have also been positive. Thanks to shift in homeownership patterns, the low trend production of housing units in aggregate and strong employment growth. Apartment rent growth remains above inflation and multifamily product remains in high demand with deal volume set to reach a new record this year, despite really aggressive pricing.With office vacancies at record lows, and rents at record highs, the rate of office absorption has slowed and rent growth has decelerated, particularly in coastal markets. Investors are growing more cautious and are seeking higher yield deals in secondary markets. Still capital is plentiful and despite industry rate increases by the Fed, cap rates have held steady at record lows across all property types.The path of interest rates will likely determine the fate of the cycle. Higher interest rates may erode the relative attractiveness of the asset class, especially for highly priced low cap rate assets in gateway markets. Moreover, tightening by the Fed has always generally, well, always held the end of economic expansions and slower growth at outright recession will reduce demand particularly for office retail and industrial space.For the multifamily sector however, rising mortgage rates will keep many would-be homebuyers out of the home ownership market and in rental units.CoStar base case forecast calls for minor weakness in rent growth and price growth, but still growth, as demand falters and interest rates rise. Barring the capitals markets cataclysm however, we do not anticipate severe rental price losses and we expect commercial real estate to broadly hold its appeal as an alternative asset class.My favorite early warning gauge on market cycles in commercial real estate looks at the thousands of sub markets for the aggregate percentage with increasing vacancy. Above 50% represents a commercial real estate recession and concern.The average value over the last 17 years is 48%. The most recent reading is 41% and that puts us in the lowest-quartile of values in the last 20 years. All major sectors and aggregate numbers are strong. This is surprisingly good data. In fact, it's probably about the best commercial real estate fundamentals I've seen in my career.So in conclusion, I'm really pleased with our financial and operational results for the first three quarters of 2018. I'm excited about getting close to reaching our four-year goal. Our team is committed to constant innovation and deployment of new technology for the commercial real estate industry. We approach the business by putting the needs of our clients and users first and then work hard to service them by continually enhancing our comprehensive platform.The good news is, the most exciting part of the call is about to begin, as I turn it over to our CFO, Scott Wheeler. -- Thank you, Andy. -- You're welcome. -- Quite a nice buildup. Although I must say, talking about the numbers, it just doesn't get any better than this. I'm just the warm up actually, but good to hear that none of the tariffs are affecting our revenue nor our outlook. -- Keep watching those TEUs. -- No-trade war here. All right. So, another strong revenue growth quarter improving profitability and continued solid operational execution in the business and as Andy said, we're entering the fourth quarter, we're increasingly confident that we'll exceed our 40% adjusted EBITDA goal, which we committed to investors four years ago way back in 2014, well before my time.As Andy noted, we delivered a solid sales quarter with $40 million in net new bookings, which were up 16% from the third quarter of 2017. All told, we now have three of the last four quarters in which we've achieved net bookings of $40 million or higher.During both the second and third quarters of this year, a significant amount of our Salesforce time was expanded on converting the ForRent customers to combine Apartments.com contracts, which took our sales team's focus away from new sales.As a result of these conversion efforts, we saw a reduction in net bookings of almost $4 million in the third quarter, which represents net sales erosion upon conversion to the combined contracts. Thankfully, with substantially all our conversion efforts complete, we believe the related drag on net bookings is now behind us.The LoopNet marketplace sales were strong in the quarter, which is a result of our continued efforts to improve the product, to increase our market coverage through the CoStar field sales force and to eliminate historically discounted price levels. As a result, gross sales for the LoopNet marketplace grew 45% in the third quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2017.Overall, as Andy mentioned, when we look at our bookings and our net sales, it's good to see that we don't see any connection to these numbers with the commercial real estate market, which remained strong.Switching over to our revenue results, our growth rate was 23% in the third quarter of 2018 over the third quarter of 2017, coming in at the midpoint of our guidance range. For the year, we expect the consolidated revenue growth to continue at approximately 23%.Looking at revenue by services, CoStar Suite revenue growth was an outstanding 19% in the third quarter of 2018 versus third quarter of 2017. The significant increase from the 14% annual growth rate we reported just a year ago.In the fourth quarter, we expect the CoStar Suite revenue growth rate to moderate to around 15% year-over-year, as we start to lap the accelerated revenue growth period in the fourth quarter of 2017 from the LoopNet conversions and the Xceligent bankruptcy. Accordingly, we expect the growth rate for full year 2018 for CoStar Suite to be approximately 18%.Revenue growth rates in info services were negative 6% in the third quarter of 2018 as expected. This was due to the shutdown of the LoopNet Information Services in the first quarter of this year. Excluding the LoopNet Information Services, our Real Estate Manager and other services in this Group grew a stunning 64% in the third quarter over the third quarter of 2017.With the shutdown of LoopNet Premium Searcher substantially complete and the strong growth in Real Estate Manager, we expect Information Services' revenue in the fourth quarter to be in line with Information Service revenue from the fourth quarter of 2017. In other words, flat. That's an improvement.For the full year 2018, we expect Info Services revenue to decline at a rate of negative 10% to negative 12%, which is a modest improvement from the negative 12% to 15% range we forecast last quarter.Multifamily revenue grew 45% in the third quarter of 2018, including the impact of the ForRent acquisition. Third quarter multifamily revenue of $105 million was essentially unchanged from the revenue of $105 million in the second quarter of 2018, as revenue from the new sales was offset by the planned reduction of certain legacy ForRent services,As Andy mentioned, we made significant progress on both sales and technology integration in the third quarter and now expect to complete this integration by the end of the year. Our expectations for full year growth in multifamily revenue remain in the range of 40% to 45% for the year.Rounding out our services performance, commercial property and land grew 12% year-over-year in the third quarter of 2018, which is consistent with the commercial property and land organic revenue growth rate from the second quarter of this year. We are now more than a year past the acquisition of LandWatch, so the total growth rate and the organic growth rate for commercial property and land are now the same.LoopNet sales remained strong and we expect organic growth in the commercial property and land sector in the 13% to 15% range for 2018.Turning to profits, our gross margin came in at 76% in the third quarter of 2018, broadly in line with last quarter. Gross margins in the fourth quarter of 2018 are expected to improve, following the closures of our Columbia, Maryland and Glasgow, Scotland research facilities in the third quarter. Our outlook also includes some modest savings in facilities and staff cost associated with these closures.Operating expenses of $163 million for the third quarter of 2018 were below our estimates and down from $186 million in the second quarter of 2018, primarily on lower third quarter marketing spending. Net income for the third quarter of 2018 of $59 million increased an impressive 72% compared to Q3 2017. Our effective tax rate in the quarter is 24%.Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $110 million or 36% of revenue. This was approximately $4 million above the top end of our guidance range and 175 basis points above our projected margins. We're pleased we're able to maintain these high level of adjusted EBITDA margins throughout the third quarter.Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter of 2018 increased 70% to $79 million or $2.16 per diluted share and include adjustments for stock-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter assumes a tax rate of 25%.Now we'll take a look at some of the performance metrics for the quarter. At the end of the third quarter of 2018, our sales force totaled 733 people. The decline from the 775 sales people at the end of the second quarter is primarily related to attrition in our multifamily sales team.We expected increased turnover following the integration of the ForRent sales force and are now actively hiring in both the apartments and the CoStar field sales teams. The renewal rate on annual contracts was 90.2% in the third quarter of 2018, slightly below the 91% rate in the third quarter of 2017. The renewal rate for customers who've been subscribers for five years or longer was an impressive 96%.Subscription revenue on annual contracts accounts for 80% of our revenue in the quarter, up from 77% last quarter, as we successfully migrated many of the ForRent customers to annual subscriptions, which we have done with prior acquisitions.I'd like to provide a little more operational color on the ForRent integration. As I noted earlier, we continue to make great progress converting ForRent customers to the Apartments' network service, thereby stabilizing the acquired revenue base. We've converted approximately 7100 customers this year and as expected, we lost some revenue in the process.In addition, we continue to wind down some legacy ForRent services we're no longer selling. While bookings are difficult to project, we expect to see multifamily bookings move back up later this year and into 2019 as we get past the integration to refocus our teams on new sales.In terms of cost synergies, to date we have reduced approximately $30 million in annual costs, which includes staffing reductions of approximately 290 people and elimination of other duplicative operating costs.In addition to cost elimination, we successfully migrated the ForRent customer database and fulfillment systems to CoStar's platform during the quarter. We accomplished this in less time to connect our previous multifamily marketplace acquisitions.Our database of information is now feeding and fulfilling all our multifamily marketplace sites and every one of our sites is feeding critical data like availabilities in rents back into our database. This is a very important step in the integration process and we're thrilled to have completed it so quickly.Back in September of last year when we announced the acquisition of ForRent, we said we expected the acquired revenue to stabilize in a range of $75 million to $85 million with long-term EBITDA margins of approximately 45% to 55%.I'm happy to report that despite having to delay the closing of the acquisition in order to get through the FTC regulatory review, we expect to achieve all of our acquisition objectives at or ahead of schedule.As Alan mentioned, we completed the acquisition of Realla earlier this month, which we expect to be an important strategic addition to our U.K. business. While we have big plans for the platform, we don't expect a meaningful revenue contribution in the fourth quarter.We anticipate we'll add approximately $1 million to $2 million of operating costs in the fourth quarter as we begin some early marketing efforts, all of which are included in our outlooks.I will now discuss our outlook for the full year and the fourth quarter of 2018. Based on strong revenue and sales results through the first three quarters, we're narrowing our revenue guidance range for the full year to 1.183 billion to 1.189 billion. The midpoint of the range is in line with our prior guidance. This revenue range implies an annual revenue growth rate of approximately 23% compared to 2017.We expect revenue in the fourth quarter of 2018 in the range of $307 million to $313 million, representing topline growth of around 22% at the midpoint. In terms of earnings, we're raising our guidance range for the full year of 2018 by $0.14 at the midpoint to a range of approximately $7.95 million to $8.03 for non-GAAP net income per diluted share. This is based on 36.5 million shares.We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $404 million to $408 million for the full year of 2018, an increase of $6 million compared to our previous outlook. The midpoint of the outlook implies an adjusted EBITDA margin of 34% for 2018, which is an impressive increase of 500 basis points compared to 2017.For the fourth quarter to 2018, we expect non-GAAP net income per share in the range of 2.48 to 2.56 and adjusted EBITDA in the range of $125 million to $129 million. Our guidance range implies an adjusted EBITDA margin of 41% for Q4, ahead of our stated 40% goal for the quarter.Overall, I believe the strong results and operational improvements position us well going into the fourth quarter and into 2019.With that, we'll now open up the call for questions.Thank you, (Operator Instructions) And our first question will come from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. Please go ahead. -- Hey guys. Good afternoon. -- Good afternoon, Andrew. -- Appreciate taking the question. Lots of moving parts, pretty much all positive now ForRent's behind you and you made good progress on LoopNet integration and cross-sell. And Andy, appreciate as always the macro comments on the CRE market.Just stepping back maybe big picture given all that, do you think you can give us a sense of what you think the sustainable organic revenue growth is it at CoStar as the business sort of stands today? -- And just to clarify, are we talking long range short range? -- Yeah. I guess through the cycle, recognizing that we're in a bit of an elongated cycle perhaps by historical standards.Yeah, I would say more the same. There is no shortage of people to sell to. There's no shortage of product opportunities. Probably -- we have the capital to support our initiatives. So we aren't seeing any sign of saturation anywhere.So we're just working the levers of growing the sales force, improving product, optimizing our pricing. I think that were to euphemism and so I think it's sustainable more the same and in the 32 years I've been doing this, I think 98.5% of the quarters, we've grown. We anticipate more of the same. Do you want to add something to that say more specific? -- No, the only variability is how fast we can deploy the capital and build the team, grow internationally and then when we get those acquisitions that come in, see those integration and then be able to grow on the backs of those. But those are little more cyclical and lumpy, but we have plenty of opportunities to go after and we just need to keep working it on. -- And then, another thing to just to remind everybody is that when we acquired ForRent, as sat down and had a chance to talk to the President of ForRent, we had really been negotiating with Dominion, not with the leadership of ForRent directly.And I asked the President ForRent, what is it like -- what is it like? I've never been in a cycle running a large IOS and he said what is it like when you are in a negative cycle and he was surprised he said, well Andy, we are in a negative cycle. You just don't see that because you guys are killing it when vacancy rates are low, IOS spending is down, when vacancy rates are high, IOS spending goes up.So there is some degree there could be some cyclicality that's in reverse on the apartment side and especially when you look at the fundamentals, like I'll say Atlanta, Georgia, interest rates coming up the Case-Shiller for Atlanta has housing prices up 76% in five years, like it's going to the multifamily. So we feel really quite good about it with lot of legs to go -- more worried about Black Swan thing you can't anticipate. -- Maybe some counter-cyclicality in multifamily. Thank you.Thank you. Next we'll go to the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. -- Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. You've redirected your CoStar Suite Salesforce to focus more on existing clients rather than focus just on the LoopNet conversion. Can you talk about how you envision LoopNet conversions progressing from 3Q levels and then the flipside of that, your progress with engaging with your existing customers to prime them for a future pricing increase? -- Well, here we are in this public call. So the -- yes, so we have -- it's really just it's not so much dramatic change. It's focusing on some of the fundamentals that worked well for us for a long time.I think the one big change is that we had to make a fundamental decision. We're going to have two different large national Salesforces meeting with exactly the same customers. So the people that buy ads from LoopNet, are commercial real estate brokers and commercial real estate owners.Buying an ad from LoopNet is fairly basic. We generally can hire a new sales person and get them up and running and successfully selling LoopNet the vast majority of the time, within a matter of months.So the clients express to us that really, we don't like being called by 15 different people and it make sense that we just had one point of relationship management. So, we shifted our sales efforts to teach the CoStar Salesforce to sell LoopNet into their CoStar customer base rather than having two different sets of people calling in. The CoStar Salesforce would naturally be in a better position to price more effectively and to sell the higher end ads and the numbers show it's working out well.The other thing is that you're always tweaking. You never want to take your customer base for granted. And when we are in a very strong market, sometimes is a temptation for the Salesforce to just be looking to churn the next piece of business and it's a huge industry, but it's a small industry and it's important that our Salesforce continues to build relationships with our clients. And my experience in the industry is that the sales person that builds relationships long term sells twice as much, net as the person that doesn't.So we're really just sort of optimizing the Salesforce and this positions us for sustained long-term growth and good client satisfaction. We do not run every quarter to how can we get the single highest booking this quarter because I'll be gone next quarter since I've been here for so darn long. I tend to think to next year, the next year and the long-term right answer. So sometimes we do the hard right instead easy wrong. -- Makes sense. And then the LoopNet conversion piece? -- How we're going to proceed with that? Well, we are going to -- I mean the numbers are obviously, spectacular so far, they keep -- I guess where if you take the first and the second round, Rich, would this be about 160 some million of upsell. And as fast as we have sold these things they seem to replenish themselves.So it will -- we've been doing a number of initiatives with our marketing department buildings, some online videos we trying to figure out who we're targeting and then we present value proposition from based on who they are.So we're doing a little more digital selling and preparation. But we'll continue to focus on it and as we stated earlier, I think it is a multi-year effort. I think it's something that we'll be working this LoopNet conversion list for least another three years and then it will move into a long-term sustainability where five million people coming in a given month often and some percentage of them they'll begin their customer journey with us in the LoopNet interface.And then when they keep returning, we can identify the market to them and then migrate them up to CoStar, 99.5% of the people coming to LoopNet never see any upgrade messages any up-sell messages. They don't know there is a CoStar because they're end users. We want to keep it that way and we really are sort of laser targeting the folks we really think are consuming at a level they should move up the professional product. So I hope that answers the question?All right. Thank you. Next, we'll go to the line of David Ridley-Lane with Bank of America. Please go ahead. -- Sure. I was wondering if you could discuss the reasons for this acceleration in the multifamily revenue growth? Maybe if you could quantify the revenue drag from the products you are discontinuing within ForRent, just trying to get a little bit more clarity on that? -- Yes, obviously the -- let's just keep our bearings here. Obviously, the growth is excellent in the multifamily space and continue to be very strong and exceptional, So historically -- all time highs for anyone in the space and we anticipate that we've got a lot of exciting stuff for years to come here.The, as we brought in ForRent, we bring in that revenue slug upfront and does not pass through our sales bookings numbers. We upfront when we acquired them, we never had any expectation that we would retain a 100% of the revenue.Often you'll have someone buying a top paid at top level ad on both sides. And if someone's -- they will, we expect that there'll be some churn off or they won't buy top level ads on two sites from us. We can retain a lot of that, but not all of that.And we've anticipated that and as that burns off you have it comes out in our sales booking. So it goes in silently but it comes out in the sales booking number. So that creates 4 million some drag in the quarter against the multifamily bookings roughly.And then the other thing is that when you're bringing in two Salesforces and taking your message out there, your number one goal is to solidify the revenue and solidify the relationships. You want to get out there and make sure that you are visiting every one of these new customers coming through Apartments.com network and that you have them in there. And I don't have the exact cancellation numbers for rent, but I would imagine they were probably 400% or 500% higher than ours -- -- Definitely higher than ours. Yeah. -- And so we want to take that revenue, bring it in and bring it long-term in to the super low, industry leading cancellation rates are those super high renewal rates we enjoy. So that's what this -- as they do all that, they're not going to simultaneously be out, go into another customer base at the same productivity level.So now we move into the fourth quarter, they've got all that stuff behind them largely. I think there's 200, 300 left at 7,100, but now they'll be focusing back out on the opportunity.And again one of the big opportunities right in front of us is there are still I'm guessing 7,000 some firms that are buying only product from RentPath, which is a huge opportunity for us and then the other thing that these firms have been losing share to us have shown us and that we've learned is that there is a ton of share below 100 units. That's where most of the market is and so we're focusing on that opportunity. So positive outlook feeling good about it.Thank you. Next we'll go to the line of Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. -- Good afternoon, everyone. -- Good afternoon, Bill. We've been expecting you. Since I only get one question I have to make sure I let you know that I'm expecting spectacular inspiring and next-gen answers from you on that question. So, the $40 million bookings, you alluded to $4 million in ForRent revenue that went way for the quarter.I want to make sure that, because I believe that was also one of the offsets in Q2, there was about $4 million in ForRent revenue and about $1 million in LoopNet Premium Searcher cancellations that netted against last quarter's figure. I wanted to just get a sense for whether that $4 million is in this quarter and then if there are any other offsets that are worth highlighting for this quarter? -- Yeah. So Bill you got definitely got the facts straight there. We had about $4 million of this erosion that we saw we're converting each quarter. No other offsets or add backs. The LoopNet info run-off is down a negligible amount. It's not really enough to talk about. So nothing really left for there.I think what you're seeing too is a little bit what we saw last year in Q3, where in the CRE business you come into July and August and you just see it slowdown in activity and slowdown of flow through, which you saw last year in the CoStar and some of the LoopNet bookings. So we saw that again in the third quarter of this year.And when you dig under that and you look at what the sales force is selling to some of the stats Andy gave, we're encouraged that year-over-year the salespeople are selling 35% more this year and in than what they were selling last year in commercial real estate that's CoStar LoopNet combined.We simply need to get some more of them in-house, so we can keep selling more and we did see us as you heard the sales force numbers were down slightly sequentially here lot in apartments, but some in CoStar as well. So we'll need to keep pushing those back into the -- into the sales force and that will help us continue on the good productivity piece that we're seeing, but I think you got the add backs right there.Thank you. Next we'll go to the line of Pete Christiansen with Citi. Please go ahead. -- Hey, guys. Andy, I want to compare kind of your M&A thoughts from two, three quarters ago, it seemed like you thought valuations were a little unjustified and you kind of thought that M&A was going be put off for a while and I know the reality it wasn't that large, but just wanted to see where you are right now in terms of thinking M&A? Are there more opportunities perhaps overseas versus domestic, just a sense would be helpful? -- Sure. It's a good question because probably the temperature is changing a little bit here and so we did the reality and that's an example of a deal that is not a big deal. It's not the size of Apartments.com. It's a much, much smaller deal, but we're interested in there is the technology, the people and the positioning and there are, we probably have 10-12 deals right now that we're very interested in.And so it's probably a little bit more aggressive now than it has been. But if you are in particular, if you're looking at some of these companies that bring technology the we are operating a relatively small basis, but you can leverage into a much bigger platform, the relative value is the issue not where you are in the cycle.So when you do a deal like Realla, it doesn't matter to the top of the cycle above and the cycle -- the cycle is the cycle and it probably where we are in the cycle probably matters more when you're looking at $1 billion deals and there we have to think hard and carefully, but we still consider those.So we are not seeing again to reiterate, there's I look at our younger commercial estate analysts and economists and they talk about rent growth slowing as a disaster unlike you should see it's like when rent growth falls. This is actually really good environment the best I've ever been. So we don't see anything falling off right away. So we could take a look at very aggressively at smaller deals right now and we probably will have news there and probably at a much greater pace than you've seen in the last year.Thank you. Next, we'll go to the line of Brett Huff with Stephens and Corp. Please go ahead. -- Good afternoon, guys. How are you doing? Good. Thanks for taking the call. Bookings question part two, I know a couple have asked about this. General question is one of the reasons I think investors that we use pulled us have told us they really like how things are going.The bookings kind of quarterly annualized net new have just kind of gone up in a pretty steady fashion and that's driven confidence in the future organic growth. Can you articulate us kind of the main five, six or whatever the number is, the reasons you're thinking that net new bookings will be up next year, a year after or whatever it is and that's the main thrust of my question.And the second is, Scott, you mentioned that the, there were 35% more sales going on and I just wanted to meet sure I understood what you meant for that and I'll leave you guys there. Thank you. -- Yes. So I think people sometimes look for obviously this is a great business with a strong track record and continues and has the ability to sustain these high growth rates for a huge period of time. Why, because it is a $50 trillion, $70 trillion global asset class and we're the largest player in that space and we're just at the early days of creating solutions and clearly we've shown that we're able to build compelling products that have a huge advantage that has just a huge advantage over some of the slower competitors.So now we, if we just kept going up every single quarter like clockwork, you might say, hey, are these made off returns, but they're not. There is some volatility and we do things periodically like buying ForRent that create noise in the numbers so on so forth, but the market is strong, our competitive advantage is unquestioned. We have shared some news with you that should be exciting to you on other competitive fronts.I don't want to do schadenfreude but it's reality and then we have a really robust product pipeline. There are a lot of opportunities out there. There's also a lot of M&A opportunities out there and virtually everything we're looking at in M&A is not about picking up the revenue of the company we're buying. It's about building out the platform. It's about picking up one of these companies and building a solution that reaches a much broader audience and also is an interconnected solution, so that the inputs already exists in our system and outputs feed another part of our system.So they're just there's a lot of good stuff here. It's a great company and while bookings sequential stair-step precision in the bookings growth is important, it's not everything. -- And then to your question on the 35% Brett, when we look at it on a per rep basis for the CoStar sales force now that they are selling both CoStar and LoopNet on a year-over-year basis in the third quarter, on a per rep basis, they're selling 35% more in net bookings than they were selling last year.The biggest piece of that growth is LoopNet is where they've been directed in selling a lot more and still growth in CoStar low-double digits on individual productivity and the rest is in LoopNet.Thank you. Next, we'll go to the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. -- Yeah. Thanks. Hi guys. I wanted to circle back to the ForRent item, because I wasn't clear in some of the questions it was referred to as a $4 million hit the bookings. Another question it was a hit to revenue.I just want to clarify, make sure I understand, was it a hit to bookings and revenue in the quarter and if so, did you guys realize there was going to be that magnitude when you gave the guidance coming into the quarter and how do we think about kind of the bounce back as you kind of converted.So in another words is there kind of a de-bounce in that productivity? So we get maybe some tailwind here in the fourth quarter? -- Yeah thanks Sterling. Let me clarify the pieces there. The $4 million drag that we've talked about was a bookings drag. That was in the net new sales bookings number. There is a parallel drag, I'll call it to revenue and that has to do more with the products that were sold by ForRent previously that we chose not to continue.Those, we never count in our bookings at all. Those are revenue that comes with the acquired company that will trade-off over the course of the year and it will offset the growth in our bookings. So that's why when you saw the revenue in the apartments multifamily growth rate flow in Q3 because you picked up a bigger chunk of that in Q2, right after the acquisition and then this sort of non-bookings revenue that we're not selling any more that erodes as people's contracts come up.So that's the revenue drag, which goes parallel to this bookings conversions issue. So hopefully that clears what those two pieces are. And yes, we did expect that to happen really in the quarter. The bookings that came out fairly strongly, we're happy with how the sales force, actually sold a great amount of new product even while they're doing the conversions.So we're pretty happy with how the ForRent and the apartments combined forces are selling together and they are working together in their own individual territories. And now the former ForRent sales folks are ramping up their productivity about 75% to 80% as productive as our historical apartments reps in selling new business. So we're seeing really good progress there. -- Yeah. And it's really important that -- it's real important that people keep their eye on the big picture, which this acquisition has exceeded our expectations and it's difficult to put a precise revenue number on what revenues actually attributable to ForRent today, but our sense is that this deal was a ultimately ends up being a single-digit EBITDA acquisition, multiple of EBITDA acquisition, that has tremendous strategic advantage to the company.So these are the kinds of deals we love and they set the stage for long-term growth for the company. So as we beat the expected burn off revenue numbers, it would be a mistake for people to take those as negative.Thank you. (Operator instructions) We'll go to the line of Mayank Tandon with Needham & Company. Please go ahead. -- Great. Thank you. Andy, does the acquisition in the UK set the stage for more of focuse on the international market? And if so, could you maybe give us a sense of how do you view the expansion? Is it going to be more organic, more M&A, a combination of both and of course so the timeline on any future expansion internationally? -- Sure. So yeah, I think it does show our willingness and our commitment to continue growing the platform. I don't like enter too much detail for competitive reasons on exactly what we plan to do, but we do think that there is opportunity to expand our footprint internationally, pretty quickly using some technology and methods that reduced the initial cost of going into a market and reduced initial risk.So, we think it's possible to take a couple hundred people and add 50 countries with some footprint. So we're looking at that. We're looking at companies that would support that. I do feel that the more in the business, the more you're out there looking at the different players.You do feel that a company that is building up all these different software sets and models and customer bases and interactions between these different components, this is a game of software and software is about scale and its global scale.So, I think the future is providing us at international level. We don't want to be measured about it because our EBITDA growth in the United States is awesome and you want to keep -- you want to keep harvesting your EBITDA in the United States, but then keep our eye on the fact that 10 years from now, we could have half of our EBITDA of being global and we would never want to give that up.It's just very similar to -- when we were making a lot of money in Washington, New York. There was some skepticism about taking it out of the whole country. And the numbers and the United States in the early years, as we expand our New York, Washington were de minimis, but they're not de minimis now.So and we're excited about the technology is changing a little bit, and the market is changing a little bit opening up some new opportunities for us.Thank you. We will go to the line of Stephen Sheldon with William Blair. Please go ahead. -- Yeah. Hi guys, good evening. I wanted to ask about margins by business, you noted, I think that profit in multifamily will likely be up. I think it's close to 100% in 2018, which is pretty significant.So I guess can you help us frame where adjusted EBITDA margins in multifamily could roughly end up this year and how you're thinking about continued margin expansion in that business over the next few years post kind of ForRent integration? -- Sure. We're pretty happy to see the expansion that we're seeing now, especially when you go into a big integration like that and the acquired business was making a little if any margin. And so we took on a big slug of costs and had to rationalize that and keep the revenue at the same time.When you look at the progress through the year, it's really improved obviously as we've taken those out and when you look at the associated average margin for the business in the fourth quarter, you see that multifamily is going to be right there broadly in line with where the total business is going to be in the fourth quarter.Now you can say OK, yeah, but that's your lowest marketing spend, which is true. So that business is still not going to be in the profitable range of the entire business for the year, but I think when you see us at least hitting one quarter now on average, we'll hit more of those as time goes on.We still believe that the margin profile of multifamily can be equivalent to the average margin of the entire business on an overall basis. We got to scale a little bit more. We can take a look at like a LoopNet margin or margin those sorts of margins, they are much higher and that's where this business now -- differences this business does that and goes through $1 billion. -- Yeah, very high scale. -- So hopefully that gives you some clarity. We're happy that the way we're pacing and the business is performing well.Thank you. Next, we go to the line of Pat Walravens with JMP Securities. Please go ahead. -- Great. Thank you. Thanks for the detailed discussions so far, guys. Can I go back to pricing around the CoStar Suite? I'd love to understand better, I heard this concept of waving the escalations and just does that ring a bell by the way? -- We are familiar with all these terms as they -- but it's time to time. We are familiar with all these terms as they -- but it's time to time. If someone waive their escalation, but that does not happen. -- So before this year, how are you thinking about that and what you are doing this year and in 2019 and beyond and how is it going to work? -- Yes. So when we started this back in May, during the end of the first quarter beginning in the second quarter, but we really eliminated the discounting in many forms. Some of it was in bundled discount. Some of it was in just manager discretionary discounts. Some of it was in just selling partial products, which really were resulting in discounts and then some were in annual escalations that we had, which resulted in essentially discounts.So this all happened at the same time in the early second quarter where we said we are done with the discounting programs anymore. All of those go away and now we manage the business to a very, very defined rate card. We have well defined escalations on an annual basis and then now we're starting to take some of the very deepest of the discounts on a combined product basis and go back to those clients.Look at the value proposition and those that have strong value propositions are now signing up for three years escalations of three-year increases to get up to rate card over a multi-year timeframe and we probably get about 30 or so of those deals in the last month and a half to start to get our feet wet on that.So those are all part of this first firm up your pricing, firm up your rate card and now go start to take the deeper discounts historically and move them up to rate card because you're seeing the investment we put in the product with all the analytics, with all the new research centers and all these things over time and we're seeing clients are willing to step up to that as they recognize that value. -- Yes, I just can't help to chime in here. So the word waving escalations is completely foreign to me and I don't understand it. So we went through a phase where you had all these LoopNet folks who were getting a really marginal product and paying very little and you want to bring them over to the CoStar platform and we stretched down in pricing to include them in the business.Then you had Xceligent out there operating for an extended period of time and we estimate that for every dollar they were charging someone they were spending $5 to produce it. So they created this artificial price point out there and again, trying to bring people into the system we extended discounts for a period of time.The reality is our products on the commercial real estate side, provide an owner of broker, an appraiser irreplaceable huge value and they are a major bargain and our renewal rates would instruct any economist that we are under pricing these products and the difference between only a junior sales person who does understand the market sells these lower price things, you have the more senior sales person who comfortably signed a much higher point.So over time, you would expect to see the pricing grow to -- continue to reflect the value we're providing folks and the ROI on investment in our products, of half of our clients is phenomenal, no matter what we do with escalations of a couple points each year or more. So the era of trying to meet Xceligent pre-bankruptcy pricing is behind us. And yeah, enough said, but feel strongly about that one. And let's get Pete in here for a cheating second question, how do you slip back in there?Okay. We'll go back to the line to Pete Christiansen with Citi. Please go ahead. -- Thank you very much. I appreciate that. Very, very, quick question, I promise, I won't hold up anyway much longer, but you talked about headcount going down, attrition and then you're actively hiring. Just generally how's house hiring going? Is it been tougher lately? -- It's a good question because we're always you would expect a 3.7% unemployment you get some problems. I am very grateful that we moved to Richmond with a research center when we did because that's probably where a lot of competition would occur.We went into like the engagement surveys in Richmond show that, that center is working really well. Folks are pretty happy there and I think it's great feel in energy down there. That offsets our huge sort of research hiring needs. I would not want to be hiring in some researchers in some US cities right now.On the sales front, I think our -- I have no indication that our hiring is not going well. It is just a question of we've been really busy and a lot of change and we're not afraid of change. So you put two big competing sales forces together in the apartment industry.We are experienced enough to fully expect churn and reactions that we manage that the best we can and then you just deal with it and keep on hiring. I think we communicated that earlier.The other thing is that I always believe it's good to be real straightforward the sales force about what's the expectations for the job are and it's you know to sell the correct solution to the right people and to maintain a good positive relationship with those customers and we don't yield on that and if that causes 10 people in the CoStar sales force to leave, we'll be better off next year.And so it's on track and I think we probably need to continue to serve it tweak the organization structure to be able to deal with the growth, but it's -- I would say it's going well. And next year is probably easier than this year in terms of the number of changes happening in the sales force, which even with no change occurs one year in a sales force, all sales forces believe lots of changes occurring as it's just different probably.Thank you, Pete and so with that, I think we will conclude the earnings call and please stay tuned. The suspense is palpable, will CoStar reach its 40% margin goal in the adjusted EBITDA margin goal in the fourth quarter. Please stand by and we'll talk to you at the yearend earnings call.

Tech stocks haven't been doing too well recently. Semiconductor stocks have been hit by the China trade war but even the  (NASDAQ:  ), which represents the more broadly tech-oriented NASDAQ 100, is only up 11% year to date.That's the tricky thing about looking at tech stocks now.

But you do want to find quality stocks that have sold off a bit but now represent bargains.These 10 big tech stocks that pack a wallop fall in the latter category. These are great stocks that represent an array of different tech sectors that will continue to grow (if they're growing now) or will rebound quickly once the markets settle down.

And while it has competitors, its platform flexibility and focus are unique advantages.It's up 39% year to date, even after these down days, and there's plenty left in the tank. (NASDAQ:  ) hasn't suffered any of the tech troubles that have hit stocks in this industry largely because it is well placed in the middle of one of strongest long-term growth sectors of any technology.NTAP is a cloud storage provider.If the second wave of the digital revolution has revealed anything, it's how powerful mobility has become with businesses, governments and consumers. The cloud makes all that possible.And NTAP is one of the industry leaders. It's not  (NASDAQ:  ) or  (NASDAQ:  ), but it is very good at what it does. And remember, many enterprise systems use two cloud providers for their data, one as the primary, and the other as a back-up. That gives NTAP two bites at almost every apple.Its $20 billion market cap means its small enough to really benefit from healthy growth and the fact the stock is up 40% year to date, reflects that. (NASDAQ:  ) may not have the most memorable name, but its portfolio of tech companies' encompasses a series of iconic names: Match.com, Tinder, HomeAdvisor, Angie's List, Vimeo, The Daily Beast and Dictionary.com, just to name a few.IAC has built a business that holds some of the biggest names in internet commerce today. Whether it's publishing, video platforms or online dating services, each is a unique stream of income but offers IAC to slice and dice those names and offer them complementary services, growing customer value.This model is unique to the web, since pulling this together in an analog world would be incredibly inefficient. The stock is up 62% year to date and is still selling at a price-to-earnings ratio of 38. That's crazy. (NASDAQ:  ) has combined two of the hottest sectors in the market today into one interesting company - commercial real estate and online services.Started in low-tech 1987, CSGP has been helping people find, manage and purchase commercial property in North America and Western Europe ever since. Now it has become a online platform of resources that not only include traditional commercial real estate but multi-family properties as well.Commercial real estate is still a robust market and as housing prices rise with mortgage rates, multi-family housing demand is also increasing as potential homebuyers wait to see where the markets will land.CSGP is up 29% year to date, even as the real estate markets have been tossed around. Also remember that Europe is also having a lot commercial real estate shuffling as Brexit negotiations continue. (NASDAQ:  ) is a key player in another tech sector that shows little sign of diminishing in the near future - cybersecurity.With a $13 billion market cap, FTNT stock is no small player. And having been around two decades at this point, the company has built a reputation and a book of business around that globe that gives it significant advantage over johnny-come-latelys in this sector.Whatever a company needs to protect, FTNT offers products to help - even a suite of cloud-based security products and crypto-VPN products.It's little surprise that FTNT is up 87% year to date and will continue this growth as we transition to more 'smart' devices and the Internet of Things. (NYSE:  ) is one of those companies that could not exist without the internet. Could you imagine a company that delivers food for restaurants sporting a $10.5 billion market cap in any other time in history?But ours is not to question why, it's to take advantage of a simple idea that scales beautifully with technology - and a smart management team that has expanded from its Chicago roots across the U.S. to London.While there is still plenty of territory left to claim in the U.S., the move to the UK is smart because it gives GRUB a toe in the door to the European markets.Up 62% year to date, a strong economy is wind in this stock's sails (and sales). (NASDAQ:  ) is the leading chipmaker in the world. So, when chip stocks are getting hammered, it makes perfect sense that INTC is going to take some of those blows directly.While the stock is off about 4% year to date, its 2.7% dividend almost brings it back to breakeven. Unfortunately, that isn't exactly the kind of return that gets investors of any stripe excited.But the fact is, INTC has a $200 billion market cap and is still a very competitive force in the industry. It isn't going anywhere.CEO Brian Krzanich was forced to step down in June and the search for a new CEO continues, but he was influential in developing the strategy that moved INTC off its PC-dependent market and into IoT and cloud-based tech. There's still plenty to like when this sector turns around.Microsoft now has an $833 billion market cap. This from the company that help usher in the personal computer with its DOS and Windows operating systems is a far different company than it used to be.While its software is still dominant - now cloud-based subscriptions rather than software-based licenses - MSFT stock has been able to grow its business outside of its one-trick pony.Its laptops are now very much respected as quality, attractive machines that can rival the best in the industry. But its Azure cloud services is where the growth is now.As with its major cloud competitor Amazon Web Services (AWS), Azure is a powerful growth engine for MSFT stock. And Azure is growing even faster than AWS at this point. That trend is in place at least for the near future.Up nearly 27% year to date, MSFT is a big tech company that is a 21st-century blue-chip growth stock. (NYSE:  ) may seem oddly placed in this tech article, but MA deserves its place in this list simply for the fact that it has successfully made the transition from global credit card company into an electronic payments beast.We are not only transitioning to a cashless society and a borderless society, but also a frictionless society when it comes to payments. Buying across borders and currencies is now almost taken for granted.And in emerging markets, where banks aren't known for their stability, having access to cash from online resources is much more secure than the local financial institution. The point is, there is still plenty of growth left MA stock.Its global reputation is something that few competitors can match, either with consumers or commercial customers looking for a reliable partner.Up 35% so far this year, a recovering global economy is one of the best things that can happen for MA. (NASDAQ:  ) has been around since 1982 and was one of the pre-tech companies that had a great niche before computers took over the world.In the early days it struggled with transitioning its business model to one that could keep up with all the changes that were happening in the digital space. But in recent years, ADBE stock has really hit its stride and still has some of the most dominant brands in the digital marketing and media solutions space. Smart packaging of its tools as well as transitioning to cloud-based subscriptions have really helped revenue. And its 3D printing software is testament to its ability to stay on the cutting of design tech.Up 40% this year so far, ADBE's $122 billion market cap is evidence of its power and breadth in this important growth sector.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@10 Big Tech Stocks That Pack a Wallop@2018-10-19@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/10-big-tech-stocks-pack-wallop-2018-10-19
egendary investor Warren Buffett advises to be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful. One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.In trading on Friday, shares of CoStar Group, Inc. (Symbol: CSGP) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 29.3, after changing hands as low as $393.23 per share. By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) is 44.9. A bullish investor could look at CSGP's 29.3 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. The chart below shows the one year performance of CSGP shares:    Looking at the chart above, CSGP's low point in its 52 week range is $272.2738 per share, with $448.35 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $394.92.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@CoStar Group Enters Oversold Territory (CSGP)@2018-10-05@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/costar-group-enters-oversold-territory-csgp-2018-10-05

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the First Trust Large Cap Core AlphaDEX Fund ETF (Symbol: FEX), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $69.18 per unit.With FEX trading at a recent price near $62.41 per unit, that means that analysts see 10.84% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of FEX's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Leidos Holdings Inc (Symbol: LDOS), CoStar Group, Inc. (Symbol: CSGP), and Moody's Corp. (Symbol: MCO). Although LDOS has traded at a recent price of $67.72/share, the average analyst target is 12.86% higher at $76.43/share. Similarly, CSGP has 12.12% upside from the recent share price of $408.90 if the average analyst target price of $458.44/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting MCO to reach a target price of $185.89/share, which is 11.82% above the recent price of $166.24.

Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past.

In the fourth quarter, the company noted that 80% of Enterprise Security segment revenues were ratable. A ratable business model provides better predictability of revenues.Additionally, contract length improved to 18.5 months during the quarter from 18 months in the preceding quarter.

"The markets may be a bit volatile now, especially given the trade war back and forth among the U.S. and China, Europe and Canada, but that doesn't mean there aren't good opportunities out there. It just takes a bit of imagination.For example, tech firms, like the 10 A-rated internet stocks listed below, are in no way going to feel the pinch of any trade war. And most, aren't really that reliant on a rebounding economy, although it helps.The point is, these firms are well placed to take advantage of the rising power of generations (millennials and GenZers) of digital natives. Millions of young people that live on their digital devices.Advertising is moving to the web from television, so free sites (at least initially) that derive revenue from ads are growing rapidly again. And subscription sites are doing well because the economy is improving.Plus, since these are smaller companies, a quickening pace of economic growth will magnify their gains since they can take advantage of opportunities faster and it boosts their top and bottom lines faster as well. (NASDAQ:  ) is basically a tech holding company that owns some of the biggest properties in the business. Most of its divisions are spun off into their own stocks (one is actually featured below) but IAC runs the show.That gives it some diversity among its strategic divisions - dating sites, home site, video and publishing. And when everything is firing on all cylinders, like it has been recently, IAC stock benefits mightily.And with a variety of divisions, it means a weak division will be helped by a cyclically stronger one.This is what has helped IAC stock almost triple the performance of the  year to date. And this kind of performance has been building for almost two years now. (NYSE:  ) is up more than 50% year to date. But its growth says that this isn't overly enthusiastic.Granted, this food delivery service has a nearly $10 billion market cap but is on track for slightly over $1 billion in revenue for the year. That's kind of pricey. But GRUB is making smart partnership deals and has a concept that is easily scalable.What's more, there are still plenty of opportunities out there. And once it can establish a national foothold in significant markets, it's going to be tough to compete.It's in that fast-growth stage now, like the  growth in car services. When GrubHub becomes a verb, you know it's made it. And from there the growth really begins. (NYSE:  ) has been around quite a while and has managed to establish itself as a solid player in the internet space.Its recent earnings have helped keep the good times rolling, growing its numbers across the board by healthy double digits for sequential quarters. And its $12 billion market cap looks pretty good as it delivers about $2.6 billion in revenue annually.The stock was up over 70% in the past 12 months. That has been a strong move reflecting the rising fortunes of the economy. While that pace might not be the norm, half of that wouldn't be surprising moving forward. (NASDAQ:  ) is a spinoff from IAC. While IAC controls of majority of voting shares, MTCH is IAC's independent dating site division.It hosts names such as Match.com, Tinder, PlentyofFish, OKCupid and a number of others. It also has an education segment that supports online tutoring and test preparation.Online dating is becoming increasingly common, not only among younger generations, but older ones, too. Mobile tech has allowed us to seemingly lower the risk of meeting potential mates by using algorithms. And as long as people find this preferable to meeting someone in a bar or the gym, it has huge potential. And it shows in MTCH's numbers - up 37% year to date.And those numbers keep growing. (NASDAQ:  ) has had a very good year so far, up around 40% year to date. Much of this continued success can be attributed to the fact that it is an integrated data provider for the commercial real estate space in the U.S. and in a handful of large European countries.While residential real estate has had its issues given rising rates, low supply and growing demand, commercial real estate has different opportunities.For example, in Europe, many companies are looking to relocate offices in the UK to the continent because of Brexit. In the U.S., companies are also looking to relocate workforces to smaller cities where operations are less expensive and the cost of living is cheaper for employees.This makes for a lot of demand for CSGP services - and this trend is just beginning. (NASDAQ:  ) is a cloud-based marketing automation platform for both businesses and agencies.Basically, that means a business that wants to automate its sales and marketing operations so it can scale faster will look to SHSP to help it with its various suites of products. And if a company is working with a design or marketing agency, they can buy SHSP services to use with their clients.Given the number of small business looking for scalability without adding a lot of fixed labor costs (i.e., employees), this is the perfect solution. And it seems like business is doing well - SHSP stock is up more than 100% year to date.Granted this firm only has a market cap of $76 million, so huge growth is easy in the beginning. However, this kind of demand means it has a solid product, which means bigger firms in the sector could snap it up at a nice premium. (NASDAQ:  ) is a developer and publisher of mobile games. It's relatively new on the scene, yet has garnered some popular titles.The stock tends to be somewhat volatile, given the tastes and trends of the mobile gaming industry, which is still a very dynamic market. And given its size, it's one of the more cyclical plays on the list.But right now, GLUU is doing well - like up 81% year to date well - and this trend should continue.It is also a good buy for some of the more dominant game companies if GLUU adds another popular game or two to its arsenal in coming quarters. (NASDAQ:  ) stock was up nearly 50% year to date a couple days ago. Today, it's up 34% year to date.Why?President Donald Trump expressed a desire to privatize the U.S. Postal Service as part of vision to reorganize the U.S. government.Given the fact that STMP is a digital go-between for business, individuals and others with the USPS, that can be disturbing news, indeed.However, the president is well known for saying something controversial and then doing something completely different, or nothing at all. And unwinding the USPS is not something that could be done by executive order, and certainly not in an election year.That means this quick drop is a good entry point. (NASDAQ:  ) is an integrated internet provider in India.There are two key factors to unpack here. First, India is the second-most-populous country in the world, behind China. And its government is more pro-Western than China. That means there is great opportunity for U.S. investors to take advantage of the opportunities that India presents as it modernizes over the next decade or two.Second, the Indian market has huge growth potential, but it's very difficult for individual investors to directly invest. SIFY is a great chance to invest in India but do so through U.S. markets.The stock is up 12% year to date, but this is a long-term growth buy at a solid valuation. (NASDAQ:  ) is a technology-enabled financial solutions firm that sells its tax and investment solutions to consumers, businesses and tax professionals.The trend here is the digitization of the tax return process on both state and federal levels. Recent court cases have approved the ability of states to make taxpayers file online only.This is just another digitization of major sectors - healthcare, banking, investing, etc. And BCOR is building a very solid reputation in the sector.With a $1.8 billion market cap, it isn't a huge firm, but it's getting noticed. The stock is up almost 75% year to date. And this is a sleepy sector, so that kind of move is significant.Louis Navellier - the investor the  called an ""icon"" - just helped investors make 487% in the booming Chinese stock market … 408% in the medical device sector … 150% in Netflix … all in less than 2 years!Now, Louis is urging investors to get in on what may be the opportunity of a lifetime.

"n recent trading, shares of CoStar Group, Inc. (Symbol: CSGP) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $409.78, changing hands for $410.95/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 9 different analyst targets contributing to that average for CoStar Group, Inc., but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $353.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $450.00. The standard deviation is $30.462.But the whole reason to look at the  CSGP price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with CSGP crossing above that average target price of $409.78/share, investors in CSGP have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $409.78 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover CoStar Group, Inc.:

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time.[Operator instructions].

Please go ahead.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and CoStar Group wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. to learn about these picks! -- Thank you, operator, and welcome to the CoStar Group's second quarter of 2018 conference call. Before I turn the call over to Andy Florance, our CEO and founder, and Scott Wheeler, our CFO, I'd like to share some very interesting and important items that could actually have a positive effect on your life.Certain portions of our discussion today may contain forward-looking statements, which involve many risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to differ materially from such statements. Important factors that can cause actual results to differ include but are not limited to those stated today in our July 24, 2018, press release on our second-quarter results and company's outlook as well as in CoStar's filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and our subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q under the heading Risk Factors.All forward-looking statements are based on information available to CoStar on the date of this call, and we assume no obligation to update these statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure to all of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call, including but not limited to non-GAAP net income, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, and forward-looking non-GAAP guidance are shown in detail on our press release issued earlier. The press release is available on our website located at costargroup.com.As a reminder, today's conference call is being broadcast live and in color on our website, where you can also find CoStar's Investor Relations page. Please refer to the press release on how to access the replay of this call. Remember just one question, so make it a good one.I'll now turn the call over to Andy Florance. Andy? -- Thank you for joining us for our second-quarter 2018 . This month marks CoStar's 20-year anniversary as a public company, making this our 80th . Congratulations to those of you who bought our stock on July 1, 1998, when we listed on NASDAQ at $9 a share. The only thing better than your 4,000% gain is the thrill you enjoyed listening to more than 100 hours of these excellent information-packed CoStar Group earnings calls.On our IPO roadshow in 1998, we had less than $10 million in trailing full-year revenue. Back then many investors expressed some skepticism to our claim that CoStar Group had a $100 million potential total addressable market. In June of 2018, we achieved our first $100 million revenue month and we're now at $1.2 billion revenue run rate. In the second quarter of 2018, our Apartments.com business alone generated its first $100 million revenue quarter.Revenue for the second quarter 2018 was $297 million, an increase of 25% over revenue of $237 million for the second quarter of 2017. Year-over-year net income in the second quarter of 2018 doubled to $44 million and non-GAAP net income, which excludes one-time costs associated with the acquisition of ForRent, was up 114%.I strongly believe we will meet our 40% adjusted EBITDA margin goal for the fourth quarter of 2018. Our strong momentum in sales continues. Bookings in the second quarter of 2018 were very strong, as we generate $45 million, an increase of 23% percent year over year versus the $37 million we achieved in the second quarter of 2017. Just one year ago that $37 million had been the best net new sales quarter we'd ever had.Our commercial property and land marketplaces had their best sales quarter ever in the second quarter of 2018, with a year-over-year revenue increase of 105%. This increase featured significant sales of LoopNet Premium Lister and Power Ads on loopnet.com. With the integration of the CoStar and LoopNet databases, we were able to eliminate LoopNet's information product and focus LoopNet entirely on being the best possible marketing solution for commercial real estate.We're making significant enhancements to the LoopNet marketplace month in and month out, so we can further capitalize on this significant opportunity. Since last year's integration, the number of views per advertised property has doubled.We're shifting our priority to developing and selling our higher-end LoopNet Power Ads, such as our gold-, platinum-, and diamond-level advertising. The diamond ads on LoopNet reach the end-user markets of its tenants and small investors more effectively, with larger ads that soar to the top of relevant search results. They're enhanced with immersive virtual reality walk-throughs, drone shots, videos, and more. They will also appear prominently throughout CoStar in order to make a strong impression on our broker audience as well.As we invest in growing our news service, the diamond ads will reach this audience through our newsletters and news website.Many landlords advertising with us believe that reaching the professional audience of tenant reps within CoStar Suite is equally as important as reaching the tenants themselves, as the vast majority of leased transactions over 5,000 square feet involve tenants represented by professional brokers.We are already beginning to sell diamond ads on LoopNet for as much as $2,200 per month, which is 60 times the $35 per month we currently average on LoopNet. We believe that properties advertised on LoopNet and CoStar are leasing and selling faster, so there is real economic value in return for our clients' advertising investment.Conversely, vacant or unleased space is incredibly expensive for landlords, so reducing that downtime by marketing the space with us provides an immediate and substantial return on investment. We're also now focusing on selling to owners instead of just the brokers; owners typically have 94% of the economic interest at stake in a deal, compared to a listing broker, who has just 1.5% of the economics after they share the commission with other brokers or his or her firm. We believe the return-on-investment argument resonates much more strongly with the owner, who has the most at stake.We believe that our commercial real estate advertising products are countercyclical. When an owner has a leasing crisis in a $250 million property, a one-of-a-kind, $2,200-a-month effective marketing solution is a no-brainer.While the CoStar sales force remains focused on generating strong sales growth for the company, we also have them heavily focused on pricing integrity and relationship development with our existing clients. As we mentioned in the last , we're holding the line our pricing policies and not accepting discounted or under-license contracts. As a result, we've seen an 80% increase in the average price per new broker user-licensed over the past six months.In January of 2018 with discounts incentives, we were licensing new brokerages at $255 per broker, but by July, we're licensing new brokerages at $466 per broker. This increase improves our intermediate and long-term revenue, but does come at a cost of some reduction a short-term contract volume. We averaged 624 total new CoStar contracts per month at the beginning of the second quarter and that dropped to 474 new contracts at the end of the second quarter. So the trade-off is approximately 25% overall lower contract volume, but they're at significantly higher price points.Beginning in March of this year, we felt it was important to incentivize our sales team to visit each of their CoStar customers, provide training, build stronger relationships, and demonstrate the exceptional value of our CoStar Suite service. We are focusing our sales force on relationship development right now for a number of important reasons. We've added tens of thousands of new users in the past 12 months. I feel it's important that these new and existing clients feel that we're in a partnership with them and focused on their success.Working closely with our clients, we expect to gain stronger referrals, lower cancels, better learn our clients' needs, upsell other products, and more accurately license and price our products as contracts renew.It's working: From April to June in the second quarter of 2018, we saw a 75% increase in the number of face-to-face meetings our salespeople had with our clients focused on relationship development. As we do with Apartments.com sales force, we carefully track these meetings and get client feedback. This resulted in an improvement of our Net Promoter Score each month in the second quarter. In June 2018, our Net Promoter Score reached 9.1 on a 10-point scale, very positive referrals.I firmly believe that while this focus does not maximize short-term sales productivity, it does create greater customer satisfaction, and relationships definitely increase intermediate-term and long-term sales results. I believe it also significantly widens our competitive moat.Today we kicked off a multi-day strategy session here at our headquarters with several dozen of Cushman & Wakefield's global leaders building strategies to best leverage CoStar's technologies, information platforms, and marketplaces to fuel the growth of their global platform.We believe it is positive for the industry and our business for the No. 3 commercial real estate brokerage in this space, Cushman & Wakefield, or one of the top three players, to be going public. Cushman is one of only three really large global brokerage firms. They've got almost $7 billion in revenue, 48,000 employees in 70 countries, and an awesome brand that dates back over 100 years.We know the company aims to continue to drive growth by investing in its technology to best serve clients and deliver margin expansion as it drives efficiency with recently acquired businesses.Apartments.com continues to strengthen its lead as the No. 1 apartment internet listings service. We achieved our first $100 million quarter, which is remarkable since we only entered the multifamily marketing business just four years ago with the acquisition of Apartments.com, which at the time only had annual revenue of $85 million.During the second quarter, we once again achieved all-time highs in visitors and traffic. Our SEO performance remains remarkably strong. Measured on May of this year based on Google rankings' list of 10,000 apartments keywords, apartments had 73% of the No. 1 slots.That's 7 times the 7% Zillow has or 25 times -- 24 times the 3% RentPath has.As reported by comScore during the second quarter of 2018, Apartments.com averaged 15.2 million unique monthly visitors, an increase of 37% percent year over year. Apartments.com had 3 times more unique monthly visitors than Apartment Guide, whose 4.9 million unique visitors represent a decrease of 11% during the same period. Excluding traffic from move in both periods, our Apartments.com network averaged 47.6 million visits per month, up 33%.In June of 2018, our entire Apartments.com network had more than double the number of unique visitors -- 112% more, to be precise -- than the RentPath network, according to comScore. We had 2 1/2 times the total number of visits over RentPath in June as well.Our network produced a stunning number of leads. It produced 41% more leads in the second quarter of 2018 than we did a year ago during the same period. Since we believe we have the highest-quality leads in the industry, this should make a listing on Apartments.com network even more valuable.In June of 2018, we announced that we are resuming our partnership with News Corp. subsidiary Move Inc., to power exclusively apartment community listings on Move's websites, Realtor.com and Doorsteps.com. Move had partnered with ApartmentList in the first part of 2018 but that partnership failed quickly.Our partnership with Move significantly broadens the distribution of the apartments listed on Apartments.com. Move's Realtor.com brings us almost 7 million unique potential renters a month. We believe this will result in the most cost-effective use of advertiser dollars, as their listings will enjoy increased exposure and will be available now on up to 11 different apartment websites.In June we delivered our best gross sales month ever for Apartments.com. One of our primary priorities for our Apartments.com team this year has been integrating the legacy Apartments.com sales force with the new sales team additions from ForRent. The ForRent business is being integrated quickly and effectively: We initially set a goal of integrating ForRent's operations, clients, and software within 12 to 24 months. Given the great progress we're making, it looks like we will complete the integration in less than 12 months.Our integrated sales force has been performing really well from the start. They're selling an integrated network and advertising package that we expect further increases exposure for our clients and generates more leads for them. Since the ForRent acquisition closed in February, we have met with all of our ForRent customers multiple times. This has created enormous goodwill and decreased cancellations dramatically.Since we integrated the sales force average monthly ForRent cancels were almost 35% less than the monthly average of ForRent cancels in 2017. We've converted over 4,100 ForRent clients to a bundled Apartments.com network contract, stabilizing and retaining the associated revenue.At the end of the quarter, we had 48,500 apartment communities investing in the Apartments.com network. That is up from approximately 18,000 communities four years ago. We're now very focused on that record-setting 50,000-community milestone.Once again, we had a strong presence at last month's National Apartment Association annual conference in San Diego, resulting in millions of dollars of net new sales. We had enormous interest from property managers from around the United States, which resulted in thousands of booth visitors, leads captured, and demos delivered. We have already generated over $3.2 million in net new sales from NAA conference, with more sales still rolling in.The highlight of the conference for me was the very positive feedback I heard from multiple principals of major clients on the value they received for their partnership with Apartments.com.The CoStar Real Estate Manager solution is now an established leader in facilities project management, lease abstraction, and lease accounting. We continue to add to a strong list of Fortune 1000 companies, as customers including top financial, industrial, healthcare, retail, and service companies join us.Additionally, existing customers continue to expand their use of our services as they seek to meet the new ASC 842 leases standard. Over 350 companies are currently utilizing the service. In fact, a couple of the companies on today's earning calls use it.CoStar Real Estate Manager sales continue to impress with year-over-year revenue growth in the second quarter of 2018 of 118%. This year CoStar Real Estate Manager is expected to exit Q4 2018 at approximately $43 million revenue run rate, with margins approaching 25%. We purchased Real Estate Manager in October of 2011, when it was known as Virtual Premise. You may recall this was right in the middle of the period that our acquisition of LoopNet was under careful, very careful review by the FTC.This shows we're able to do more than one thing successfully at a time.We paid $17 million for Virtual Premise, which had approximately $7 million in revenue, so we paid 2 1/2 times revenue. I think you would agree that assessed business growing profitably through $43 million in revenue at 118% growth rate is now worth a lot more than $17 million we paid for it. The purchase of Real Estate Manager builds our track record of making quality acquisitions that are selective that expand the total addressable markets we operate in, growing revenue and profitability of the company, and strengthening our unique commercial real estate platform. This has ultimately been a major contributor to increasing shareholder value.As we manage our capital and the balance sheet of CoStar and look for our next M&A opportunity, we're careful we do not overpay for businesses or make recklessly risky bets. I'd rather wait and identify quality businesses that have the high potential to integrate into our platform and that can grow or add significant value to our customers and shareholders.This is what leads to a successful M&A like CoStar Real Estate Manager, Apartments.com, LoopNet, and many, many others.I want to update you on our research operations. Our ability to collect and curate valuable commercial real estate content is our primary core competency. Our research operations continue to perform really well. In order to optimize the efficiency and effectiveness of our research process, we're closing two major research centers and consolidating them into other centers.In August 2018, we'll be closing our research center in Glasgow, Scotland, and consolidating it into London. At the same time, we're closing our research center in Columbia, Maryland. Our centers in San Diego, Richmond, and Washington will pick up the Columbia center's workload. Both of the Glasgow and Columbia leases expire this fall.CoStar Listing Manager continues to be very additive to CoStar's research process. Many brokers like to have direct control over when and how their listings are presented. With brokers self-entering quality information, it frees up our researchers to continue to gather even more information as they perform their monthly update cycles.We are not seeing any slowdown to the robust start from broker entry we had in the first six months of CoStar Listing Manager. In June, 23,000 new listings were entered directly into CoStar by brokers, as 38% of all new listings we experienced. In the same month, 36% of all listings, or 297,000, were added directly by brokers and owners using CoStar Listing Manager. We believe as brokers learn more about Listing Manager their participation will increase even more.Our CoStar product development teams have been working hard to deliver a significant update to the core CoStar platform. We expect this will provide a far more intuitive user experience to search, filter, and view results, generate reports, and produce visually stunning analytic charts covering every important measure within the search results.The upcoming release is not just a big leap forward aesthetically, but it's been optimized for serious performance. Searches resulting in tens of thousands of records will typically return in less than a second -- in fact, it's often measured in milliseconds. Yesterday, I ran a series of searches in the updated CoStar and initially thought something was wrong because the screens weren't really changing as I did the queries. Looked more carefully, it turned out it was actually moving so quickly I couldn't see the results coming back.The results just seemed to appear instantly. Clients really like speed in software, so they're really going to like the updated CoStar. They should.So there is one person who's listened to every one of CoStar's 80 earnings calls. It's Frank Carchedi, who was our CFO when we went public until he retired in 2007. Frank is addicted to CoStar, so Frank unretired in 2009 for an extra nine years and has played a valued role in our M&A team. He's also successfully managed a number of our acquired companies.We all want to thank him for making CoStar's incredible journey from $5 million of revenue a year to $100 million a month possible. It would not have happened without him. Frank is going to be retiring this fall and I'm confident that even in retirement, he'll be there for our 100th earnings call, watching over his CoStar shares. I will make sure I speak loudly so he can hear me.This summer, the U.S. economic expansion has entered its 10th year, yet growth seems to be accelerating rather than slowing. Consensus estimates for the 2018 GDP growth are strong and recent job growth has been solid as well, all of which is good for commercial real estate and apartment demand. For investors prospects of rising interest rates have been the primary cause of concern in the commercial real estate industry, as cap rates had compressed to record levels.However, the 10-year treasury reserved its trend after crossing 3% and some of the interest rate fears have eased.Record capital is being raised for real estate investment, and that should support real estate values in the future as well. The investment sales market has been fairly steady over the past 2 1/2 years, with investment sales volume peaking in '15, steady in '16, down a bit in '17 and so far in '18 as well.All four major sectors of commercial real estate have performed well in this economic cycle. Occupancies exceed the best readings of the last cycle and rent growth easily surpassed inflation. This year is turning out to be a bit of an exception. Net absorption, a measure of tenant demand, is slightly down year over year for all property types except multifamily.This is not surprising as industrial has had a tremendous run-up due to e-commerce growth.Retail is on a painful side of the e-commerce coin, as more people opt [Inaudible] delivered to their home. With full employment, the office sector is starting to feel the slowdown in office-job creation that's inevitable, resulting in slightly lower demand growth. On the supply side, the slowdown in completions has been similar across all property types. Deliveries this year are running below last year's totals, making the market fundamentals look as healthy as they were at the beginning of the year.Rent growth among the property types has diverged, with industrial being the clear winner at just under 6% year-over-year growth. Retail is the laggard at 1.4% percent. The apartment sector is worth highlighting, as after strong supply pipeline and weakening fundamentals, the market is recovering once again with rent growth accelerating, up 40 basis points to 3% compared to the end of last year.So the highlights of second quarter include great sales growth, cost reductions, strong margin expansion, successful new product innovation, phenomenal marketplace traffic, strengthening customer relationships, outstanding competitive positioning across multiple products, and all in all a solid economic outlook.I will now turn the call over for everyone's favorite part of the earnings call, to our CFO, Scott Wheeler. -- Why thank you, Andy. Great list of highlights, I don't think I can top that. Yes, we are making great progress against our operating objectives for 2018 and we continue to deliver strong financial results. We certainly remain confident about the trajectory of the business moving forward.As Andy mentioned, we delivered outstanding sales this quarter with $45 million in net bookings, which exceeded our expectations overall, and we're up 23% from the second quarter of 2017. We are particularly encouraged by these results, as there are a number of initiatives currently under way across our sales team.Our commercial real estate sales force continues to convert former LoopNet customers to higher value CoStar and LoopNet marketing contracts at a solid pace. Through the end of the second quarter, we've converted approximately 9,300 LoopNet customers to CoStar and our marketing contracts at an average price of approximately $527 per month.On average these LoopNet users were paying only $54 per month for an average monthly price lift of $473 per month consistent with our results last quarter. At this point, we have generated $53 million in annual incremental contract revenue from the LoopNet conversion.In addition, we initiated our pricing and licensing compliance program in the second quarter, resulting in higher prices per user on new contracts. We expect that this effort along with our focus on client service will result in improved sales and customer value over the long-term. Our focus on LoopNet as a marketing site is certainly paying off. LoopNet sales were particularly strong in the quarter as the commercial real estate field sales team increased their LoopNet advertising sales by over 250% compared to the second quarter of 2017.Our field sales team is becoming increasingly effective in selling power ads in the second quarter, selling 7 times the level that they sold in the second quarter of 2017. Now granted, this is from a small base but the momentum is certainly encouraging.Finally, we had our best month of multifamily growth sales ever in June which is impressive considering our focus on integrating the ForRent and apartment sales forces in the second quarter. The anticipated cancellations of some legacy ForRent clients resulted in lower net bookings for multifamily in total, which we expect will be short lived as we complete customer integration and we continue reducing the ForRent property cancellations.Switching over to revenue, our growth rate was 25% in the second quarter of 2018 over the second quarter of 2017 coming in slightly above the high end of our guidance range. As we indicated last quarter, we are now actively moving existing customers and selling new customers a combined multifamily network product that includes both the Apartments.com and the ForRent family of websites.Accordingly, we're no longer able to effectively calculate an organic growth rate for multifamily or for the company in total. Overall, our revenue growth in our two largest businesses CoStar Suite and multifamily is very strong and we expect consolidated revenue to grow in a range of 22% to 24% for the year a slight improvement over our guidance from the first quarter of 2018.Looking at our revenue performance by services, CoStar Suite revenue growth was an outstanding 18% in the second quarter of 2018 versus the second quarter of 2017, a significant increase from the 13% annual growth rate we reported just a year ago in the second quarter of 2017. We expect CoStar Suite to continue delivering elevated growth levels with the growth rate for full-year 2018 at or near the low end of our 18% to 20% guidance range.Revenue growth rates in information services were negative 14% in the second quarter of 2018 as expected due to the shutdown of the LoopNet information services in the first quarter of this year. Excluding the LoopNet information services, our Real Estate Manager and other services in this group grew a whopping 57% in this quarter over the second quarter of 2017.Real Estate Manager continues to exceed our expectations with growth in excess of 100% in the second quarter of 2018 over the second quarter of 2017. With the shutdown of LoopNet Premium Searcher substantially complete and the strong growth at Real Estate Manager, we expect information services revenue to decline at a rate of negative 12% to negative 15% on a year-over-year basis in 2018, a significant improvement from our last outlook.Multifamily revenue grew 54% in the second quarter of 2018, including the impact of the ForRent acquisition. The integration is progressing ahead of schedule but there's still a lot of work left to do. Accordingly, our revenue expectations remain unchanged, and we expect multifamily revenue growth of 40% to 45% for the year.Rounding out our services performance, commercial property and land grew 16% year over year in the second quarter of 2018. Organic revenue growth, normalizing for the May 2017 acquisition of LandWatch, was 12% in the second quarter of 2018 versus the second quarter of 2017.With strong sales levels in both LoopNet and the Land marketplaces, we expect revenue growth rates to improve through the rest of 2018 and expect organic growth in commercial property and land in the 13% to 15% range for 2018.Our gross margins came in at 77% in the second quarter of 2018, in line with last quarter. Gross margins in the second half of 2018 are expected to remain in line with the second quarter, improving slightly toward the latter part of the year following the closure of our Columbia, Maryland, and Glasgow, Scotland, research facilities. Our outlook includes some severance costs associated with these changes and modest savings in facilities and staff costs in the latter quarters.Operating expenses of $186 million for the second quarter of 2018 were below our estimates as we are laser-focused on delivering our margin goals for the year. Approximately $3 million of our expense favorability in the quarter was associated with lower-than-expected personnel costs.Marketing expenses increased seasonally as expected in the second quarter, although we pushed approximately $3 million of our marketing spend out of the second quarter and into the third quarter of 2018. The balance of the expense favorability related to focused cost management and operating efficiencies across the business including better than planned results in the ForRent integration.Our second-quarter 2018 adjusted EBITDA was $85 million, or 29% of revenue. This was approximately $15 million above the top end of our guidance range and a full 600 basis points above our projected margin. We're very pleased that we were able to maintain this high level of adjusted EBITDA margin in the second quarter, when advertising and marketing costs reached their peak for the year.Net income for the second quarter of 2018 of $44 million increased an impressive 98% compared to the second quarter of 2017. Our effective tax rate in the quarter is 4%, which includes income tax benefits of $6 million for state-level research and development tax credits for the years 2013 through 2017. Along with $3 million of tax benefits associated with share-based payment transactions.Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter of 2018 increased 114% to $60 million, or $1.66 per diluted share, and includes the adjustments for stock-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter assumes a tax rate of 25%, which does not include the tax benefits of share-based payment transaction or the R&D tax credits we took this quarter.Now let's take a look at some of the performance metrics for the quarter. At the end of the second quarter of 2018, our sales force totaled 775 people. The decline from the 905 salespeople at the end of the first quarter relates primarily to the reductions associated with the ForRent integration. The renewal rate on annual contracts was 91% in the second quarter of 2018, up from 90.6% in the second quarter of 2017.The renewal rate for customers who've been subscribers for five years or longer was an impressive 97%. Subscription revenue on annual contract accounts for 77% of our revenue in the quarter, down slightly from 79% last quarter due to a full-quarter impact ForRent, which has a lower percentage of revenue on annual contracts.As with most of our acquisitions, we expect this percentage to start increasing again as we convert more customers to annual Apartments.com full network contracts.Before I get to the outlook, I'd like to give you an update on the ForRent integration. Our efforts to convert ForRent customers to the new Apartments network product is on track and revenue retention is ahead of our expectations so far. Today, we have reduced approximately $20 million to $25 million in annual costs, which include staffing reductions of over 200 people and elimination of other duplicative operating costs.We've incurred $9 million of non-recurring integration costs in the second quarter and $12 million year to date, which are included in our results and added back in our non-GAAP financials. Overall, we're very happy with the pace and execution of the integration and expect to be substantially complete within one year of purchasing ForRent.I'll now discuss our outlook for the full year and the third quarter of 2018. Based on strong year-to-date revenue and sales results, we are raising our 2018 revenue outlook by $4 million, at the midpoint from our previous guidance. Our new 2018 revenue outlook is expected in the range of $1.18 billion to $1.192 billion. This revenue range implies an annual revenue growth rate of 22% to 24% compared to 2017.We expect revenue in the third quarter of 2018 in the range of $304 million of $307 million, representing top-line growth of around 23% at the midpoint.In terms of earnings, we are raising our guidance range for the full year of 2018 by $0.31 at the midpoint to a range of approximately $7.75 to $7.95 for a non-GAAP net income per diluted share and that's based on 36.5 million shares.We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of $395 million to $405 million for the full year of 2018, an increase of $15 million compared to our previous outlook. Year over year, we expect adjusted EBITDA growth of approximately 40% to 45%.For the third quarter of 2018, we expect non-GAAP net income per share in a range of $2.02 to $2.10 and adjusted EBITDA in a range of $102 million to $106 million. We expect adjusted EBITDA margins to increase in the third quarter and again in the fourth quarter as marketing costs decline and we continue to progress with the ForRent integration. We expect to meet or exceed our goal of 40% adjusted EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter of 2018.Overall, I believe the strong results in the first half of 2018 position us to continue our revenue growth trajectory and margin expansion. I look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year.With that, I will now open up the call for questions.Thank you. [Operator instructions]. Our first question is going to come from the line of George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. -- Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. You've converted 9300 LoopNet customers through the end of 2Q. Can you elaborate on the cadence of LoopNet conversions in the second quarter relative to earlier quarters and how you expect future quarters to compare with 2Q with respect to conversion speed, conversion rate, and the amount of pricing lift? -- Well, pricing lift is remaining about the same -- it's constant from Q1 to Q2 and we expect it stay constant Q3 and Q4. We are building out some new marketing initiatives that we have been working on for a while that will be rolling out in Q3, Q4, which might provide some acceleration for the conversion pace. We also have been building software to enhance LoopNet product up-sell experience.And so we expect to continue at a good clip. And as we said before, we think we will be converting at this sort of clip for a little bit better around this area for two years plus out from here. And then even after we've converted a number of the folks who were formerly premium searchers are heavily searched for long rate time, LoopNet will remain a really important pipeline for upselling people to CoStar. So it's a great way to identify folks who need commercial real estate information and do a highly targeted marketing message to them.So it was a good performance and it will, I think, remain strong and steady for quite some time now.The one thing that makes me think about though is, we're feeling really good about some of the product enhancements we've got coming on the marketing side of LoopNet. So we've been investing in making sure the sales force is comfort with fluent in sound and LoopNet marketing solutions across the whole CoStar Group. So there's been a little bit of shift to folks selling the LoopNet marketing solution and that necessitates a little bit less of a focus on doing the information conversions but all in all we're very happy with the result.Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Brett Huff from Stephens Inc. Please go ahead. -- Good afternoon, guys. Congrats on a nice quarter. -- Great. Thank you, Bret. -- On the bookings number of $45 million that's a focus some folks have had. Can you give us, or I think it was Scott may have given us, some kind of context around that vis-à-vis, there is still some LoopNet planned cancellations or shutdown that negatively impacted that. Can you quantify that again for us? And No. 2, can you put a number or a ballpark on the pricing integrity negative impact on that $45 million, cause I think that's a question we'll get a lot of.Thanks. -- Yes. So, Brett, on the components last quarter, we took a large reduction in the LoopNet info -- I think we talked a lot about that. This quarter there's only about a $1 million of negative drag for LoopNet info. The other transition item in this quarter as we do for rent integration that we're seeing somewhere around $4 million or so of cancellations that come through as we work through the customer base and move the clients over to the network contract.So the pace and the revenue conversion ForRent is happening as expected but as you expect there's this couple of quarters where you're going to see the cancellations to really solidify all the revenue there.So that pulls the number down just a little bit more but I think as you look at what we've done really on the CoStar side and we talked about the LoopNet conversions, there are still strong. The CoStar field team is really put in some great effort now selling more of the LoopNet product in fact 25% of their output is now selling LoopNet marketing and it used to be 10% a year ago. So you see a little bit of shifting over to that commercial property and land which we talked a little bit about.And then, on the pricing side, the value increases there on the contract basis, I don't think we have a real slowdown in the quarter to talk through on pricing. I think it's more of the focus on the service initiative, the LoopNet cross-sells, and then continuing the pace following the large discounting that that impacts the sales in the first quarter or the second quarter. So hopefully that gives you some context on the different pieces. -- Yes. And again, the ForRent cancellation number, we are outperforming that number. So when you put together two or three marketplaces, you expect to get very significant cost efficiencies, you expect to have some loss of redundant advertising dollars which we're seeing but we're actually getting a better than expected result on that. So we're really kind of happy with the way it's come out. -- Yes. Our net sales for the quarter came out ahead of what we expected. Obviously, that's what allows us to raise our revenue guidance, it's in a few different buckets and what it may have been in the first quarter but our sales are always volatile quarter to quarter. We're happy that we're in this mid-40s range this year.We're in the mid 30s range most of last year and we're happy with the momentum we have going forward.Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust. Please go ahead. -- Hey guys. Good afternoon. -- Good afternoon, Andrew. -- Like the same day conference call, it's turning into a tradition I guess. -- No extra charge for that. -- Much appreciated. With regard to cross-sell as you've seen this nice success with LoopNet. Any updates in terms of what you think the total cross-sell potential is. I know you've talked about Andy as much as a couple of hundred million dollars.Is that still a good long-term expectation, how can we think about that maybe nuanced or from a timing standpoint too? -- Yes. So I absolutely still believe that number is a multi-hundred-million-dollar number. I consistently believe that to be the case. And as you know there will be two components sort of like that just looking at the number we have right now this quarter, relatively early on it's a pretty solid number for cross-selling but you've got two really solid legs you're working here.One is the selling LoopNet to CoStar customers and the other is selling CoStar to LoopNet users or former customers. And they're both. I feel very optimistic about both. And it will naturally waiver up and down slightly, you will have some volatility from quarter to quarter but it will be a real consistent message line for the next three years.Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Pete Christiansen from Citi. Please go ahead. -- Good afternoon, guys. Nice trends. Andy, can you rank some of the key reinvestment areas that you're looking on again sort of the next 12 months? -- Yes. I mean, just generally, one of the key areas is transformational product initiatives. We're working on at Apartments.com. We look at the apartment industry, it's not just a lead generation opportunity for the institutional great properties are over a hundred units.We think there's a really exciting opportunity for us and generally facilitating the leasing of apartments from the individual unit on up to the 400 unit property. I don't want to get too specific into some of the issues we're working on but we are cranking on some product initiatives that we're pretty excited about and I think they're going to require some investment and they are taking some investment now and there will be something that maturates over the course of 18 months or so but when we are ready to bring this to market in the beginning of '18, we'll talk about them more explicitly. We continue to feel there's an awful a lot of opportunity in the owner lenders segment of our industry. We've got some very exciting products we're working on to enhance CoStar to make it more useful for our many banking clients and try to win deeper penetration there.And we also believe that there is a significant global opportunity so we continue to invest in Spain and we'll be doing some investments in France where you know we already have a footprint. And the United Kingdom will probably begin cash flowing a little bit more, so they'll be priced for transfer investment into Germany. And so those are some of our bigger initiatives. Was there anything I forgot, Scott, that we're thinking about? -- Certainly, the LoopNet marketplace. -- So the LoopNet marketplace and you can see the numbers are really solid there. And you know that is becoming, I think that that has an opportunity, the LoopNet marketing commercials real estate on the internet, I believe is an opportunity on par with marketing apartments on the Internet. So we're going to invest behind that a little bit over the next two years. And then we might also do some additional investment into the businesses-for-sale areas at the tail end of that 12-month horizon.So we're exploring a number of different things there. Obviously, remaining sensitive to achieving our 40% margin goal and beating it the fourth quarter and then remaining consistent with high margin level ongoing in out years. So we're balancing reinvestment in the business with maintaining the high margin levels. There is absolutely no shortage of potential investment initiatives just a question of prioritizing the really exciting ones upfront, working on them in as fast a process as we can responsibly and efficiently run these initiatives.Thank you. Our next question will come from Mayank Tandon from the Needham and Company. Please go ahead. -- Thank you. Good evening. Scott, you touched on some of the pricing lift and obviously that has a lot to do with the LoopNet conversion but could you just maybe parse out the growth rate that you expect going forward for '18, and then, maybe longer term as well as in terms of how it breaks down between increased penetration within the installed base adding new customers. And then, of course, any other pricing uplift beyond the conversion on LoopNet? -- Yes. So the growth rates going forward, we still expect to get about half of our growth from existing accounts and further penetration or broader geographies and we expect to get about half from new business and getting new logos. We're seeing that pretty consistently it doesn't change a whole lot.And the other area now that we're seeing more growth is really not only the pricing in the CoStar side but as we've done more pricing on the LoopNet side for unlimited lister contracts and now on our listing plans we're seeing good upward movement in pricing on the LoopNet side as well but what we haven't called in really into the rest of the years is that the pricing right now has been on new contracts coming in for new customers. We have not begun our program on a scale basis to do repricing an existing contract as they roll. And we expect that will start to work its way into the rest of the year and become a bigger impact into next year. -- And that last point that Scott was making is huge. So on our existing customer base, we have not had in place rigorous processes to evaluate each contract renewing and making sure that it's appropriately priced at the point of renewal. So there is a lot of potential value particularly in firms that might have signed up many years ago have merged and grown about a lot of people have grown their footprint and our enterprise licensing hasn't kept up with that.So one of Scott's primary initiatives is setting up the systems around that to make sure we're capturing that appropriate revenue uplift. And then also making sure that our commission schedules support that but that alone over the next three years could be $100 million in uplift, right pricing those. So we'll continue to see this higher average price point hold I believe. And then, just the mix shift of going from marketing products to brokers in LoopNet to marketing products to owners I think has an enormous net price uplift impact.So it'll be pretty significant for the next three years. -- Thank you.Thank you. Our next question will come from David Ridley-Lane from Bank of America. Please go ahead. -- Good evening. In the past, you have shown the number of advertising multifamily properties, now that ForRent has come online. I wonder if I could get updated on that metric. And then, directionally what portion of those properties are on a premium level package versus a basic package.How much have you found that base already? Thank you. -- Unfortunately, the sheet that was printed on I removed from the conference room to go grab something, I took it from Rich half an hour ago, just before the meeting started. So we are at 42,147 on the Apartments.com before the ForRent came in. And the real impressive growth there is at the upper end with a 55% growth of our highest end ad, the diamond ad, and then, the silver ads only growing at 3% year over year. So the single highest growth category that people are buying is that that premium level ad.So that's good news. And the reason is, we're delivering a lot more leads and a lot more value and more value increase to the advertiser than the price is going up. And then overall it's 48,490 when you combine the ForRent apartments. Again, we will mark when we hit the 50,000 mark because that's like a hugely impressive feat of strength in the apartment marketing industry.Thank you. Our next question will come from Stephen Sheldon from William Blair. Please go ahead. -- Yes. Thanks. Good evening guys. How should we think about the factors that drove the adjusted EBITDA outperformance in the second quarter coming in at $85 million versus guidance, I think $66 million to $70 million? You talked about the $3 million push out of advertising expense but how much of the outperformance was driven by ForRent.What other factors may have driven it. And did you adjust your profit assumptions for ForRent over the remainder of the year? -- Yes. You mentioned the marketing piece which was the part that shifts out the rest of the outperformance was all from a strong cost management and then a few million dollars of extra revenue that we that we had over our expectation. Yes, there's probably $2 million or $3 million of better-than-the-expected cost from the ForRent integration in the quarter. And so we expect that those benefits continue, we flowed the full $15 million of outperformance on EBITDA through to the guidance for the year.So we're confident that the things we're doing outside of the push in the marketing have to do with managing resources tightly as well as accelerating the ForRent integration and watching every other operating costs that we have, which we get a lot of duplicative marketing and other contracts that you find as you go through these integrations and those we were able to get out the door quicker than what we expected. So it's a solid performance managing headcount closely and taking out those duplicative costs gave you that outperformance. -- And Scott overlooks completely the single biggest factor which is we said 100% of all the senior executive teams bonuses for the year on feeding the 40% adjusted EBITDA margin target for the fourth quarter. And I have reminded them at every single executive meeting that it's either make the target or not ... -- That's true. You know that, every meeting.Thank you. Our question will come from the line of Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. -- Good afternoon, everyone. -- Hello Bill. -- So, 100 hours of calls, I can say it only feels like half of that. And also before I forget it, just wanted to wish good luck to Rich on his less than a month left of bachelorhood. -- Thank you. Angela will appreciate your mention. -- My question has to do with one of those figures you threw out in terms of 41% more leads and higher quality better conversion rates. And so my question is, what are you doing to better demonstrate the higher quality to the potential buyers? And also then, what are you doing to better monetize those leads. And in some way use that $1 billion in cash that you're sitting on to somehow accelerate that process? -- Bill, I always appreciate your question. They are very helpful. Yes. So it's interesting one of the ways at NAA, we partnered with two of the major players that provide lead tracking services for the apartment industry.One of them, LeaseHawk has sampled that 10 million incoming leads into apartment communities. That service shows that not only are we producing by far and away with the highest volume of leads but they had the highest conversion rate dramatically higher conversion rates than any of the other lead sources, which is important to our customers because each lead is an opportunity for them but it's also a significant cost item for them they have to process the lead and walk them to the apartment everything else.So we've been making it with these third parties that we're partnering with to communicate this information along with the tracking numbers we provide to our customers and the lead tracking tools we provide to them. They're very aware of the tremendous advantage we're providing them. And we've been hearing from them that they used to require two or three services to keep the lead flow they need. And that today they're getting 100% lead flow they need by just advertising with the Apartments.com network.So we're getting credit for it. I would say that in 30, 40 conversations I had with clients almost all of them told us straight out we measure it, we monitor it and absolutely without a doubt you guys get credit for the most leads and the highest quality lead. So that's a solid story we don't need to really ... I think we're effectively pushing it.However, you would expect that the clients get a great deal right now because while the lead flow and the conversion rate is going up dramatically, I was shocked at how big the lead number was this past quarter. It was huge. And it means that there is a pricing opportunity there and we'll be looking at that and we won't be out of control but we do think there is an opportunity there for some pricing leverage there.So I think that we didn't expect such a tremendous growth in the lead flow as we've seen. So we're seeing this, it holds consistent. We'll probably look for ways to recognize some of that additional value, we'll capture some additional value we're providing to those.In terms of how we use that modest cash balance. We are very actively looking at opportunities in the market. We have a number of different irons in the fire. We are being selective.We are not chasing things that we feel are overvalued in the cycle. And we're looking for reasonably priced assets that we can get a 10 banger on. If we can't get a 10 banger on it, why do it? We aren't forgetting that balance we're aggressively working it but we want to do it the right way.Thank you. We have a question from the line of Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. -- Yes. Thanks. Hi, guys. Just one question on LoopNet conversions, of the 100,000 or so targets that you're going after, what percentage have you now kind of reach to do kind of the meetings and demos at this point to try to convert them? -- I don't have an exact figure in front of me here, so I could only give you a estimate. And I would imagine it is 20% or so but also remember that my experiences over the years have been that often that you'll have a quick sale cycle where you meet with one of those conversions and they close within 30 days. So your initial close might be 50%. Your three-year close rate might be 75%.So you have the first run of it and then those people often reconsider or eventually come around to it. So we have a motto here in our sales organization that eventually they all buy. It's just a question of when they see the light and they are ready to get a fantastic ROI for their investment in CoStar.Thank you. [Operator instructions]. And we have a question from the line of Marc Wiesenberger from B. Riley.Please go ahead. -- Good afternoon. Thank you. Are you seeing any trend in non-traditional users across any of your platforms? And if so does that impact future product releases and/or marketing campaigns? Thank you. -- We've always had a couple of big sea changes like one is the growth of owners, used we are predominantly driven by brokers now overwhelmingly our biggest customers are our owners and that's a growing segment. So that's a big focus for our product releases. We always have a remarkable collection of unexpected users of our products like, you can delve into it, and when you look at 20 brands and you're like why in the world are they buying the product, and then there'll be some explanation about the need to measure the radio transmission blockage of buildings in order to calculate certain things.So there's always something going on like LA school district subscribed to CoStar in order to forecast their budgets and out years since they're funded by commercial property taxes. So there is always something going on there. I actually think that it's not a sort of wild outlier but the banking industry I think is the next big phase for us. So our ability to wrap our customers' loan portfolios with good surveillance and strong underwriting tools I think we can for relatively modest cost, we can invest there and build some really compelling tools to the banking industry.So we have some things in development there.Also, we're providing some tools for CMBS investors, I think are pretty exciting where we're giving CMBS investors advance information on the economics of properties in the portfolio as well before the servicers report that content to the investors. So again, some information arbitrage there, I think those tools have a lot of legs. So we're really more focusing on bigger blocks of opportunities to taking folks who are traditionally 4% of our revenues and saying can we grow them to 10%. And there's probably five or six of those.Thank you. And at this time, we have no further questions in queue. -- [Inaudible] batting cleanup. So thank you very much for joining us for our 80th CoStar earnings call. And we look forward to updating on our progress for the third quarter before long. And again, thank you very much for joining us.[Operator signoff]When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

" started 2018 on a strong note, posting impressive results for the first quarter. The company's Q1 performance indicates that its turnaround efforts, which include shifting the business model to a subscription-based one, are apparently paying off. The main highlights of the quarter were sales beating expectations, strong growth in billings, a narrower loss and an upbeat guidance for the full year. And most importantly, the company expects to turn profitable this year.However, it seemed this was not enough to impress investors, as shares of the cybersecurity company dipped more than 4% during yesterdays' after-hour trading session. Nevertheless, the company's performance, for the past two quarters, makes it quite evident that its turnaround initiatives are on track, and there is a high chance that FireEye might return to the growth trajectory by the end of this year.Notably, shares of FireEye have gained remarkably in the year, so far, with the stock appreciating 30.7%, significantly outperforming 19.1% growth registered by the  .Now, let's discuss the quarterly results in detail.The company's first-quarter revenues of $199.1 million increased 7.7% year over year and outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $194 million, as well as management's guidance of $192-$197 million.The company noted that its quarterly revenues mainly benefited from shift in the business model from product based to subscription based. This apart, improved sales execution, enhanced relationship with channel partners, and growing adoption of the company's Helix, iSIGHT Intelligence and Endpoint security solutions were other key growth drivers.Further, billings climbed 21% year over year to $175.1 million, and came in marginally ahead of management's guidance of $165-$175 million, mainly attributed to all the factors mentioned above.Additionally, FireEye continues to secure large deals. Notably, the company renewed one deal of more than $10 million during the reported quarter. Moreover, it closed 29 transactions, with individual value of more than $1 million. The company also added 230 new customers in the recently-reported quarter.Non-GAAP gross profit increased approximately 7.4% from the year-ago quarter to $147.3 million. Non-GAAP gross margin were almost flat year over year at 74%, which also came in line with management's expectations.Non-GAAP operating expenses increased approximately 6% year over year to $153 million, primarily due to elevated expenses related to payroll taxes and other employee-associated costs, and elevated R&D expenditure in connection with buyouts of ""Email Laundry in Q4 2017 and X15 in Q1 2018.""The company posted non-GAAP operating loss of $5.7 million, significantly lower than the year-ago quarter's loss of $7.3 million. We believe improved operational efficiency and sales productivity are proving conducive to the company's operating results.Non-GAAP net loss for the first quarter narrowed down to approximately $7.5 million from the prior-year quarter's net loss of $9.3 million.On per share basis, FireEye reported non-GAAP loss of 4 cents, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Year over year, quarterly loss were narrower than the year-ago quarter's loss of 5 cents. The quarter's non-GAAP earnings per share also compared favorably with the mid-point of management's guidance range of a loss of 3-6 cents (mid-point 4.5 cents). Notably, this is the tenth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement for the bottom line. | FireEye exited the reported quarter with cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments of approximately $886.4 million, up from $896.8 million posted at the end of the previous quarter. Accounts receivable were $103.1 million compared with $146.3 million witnessed at the end of fourth-quarter 2017. During the quarter, the company generated $9.2 million of cash from operating activities.Buoyed by the impressive first-quarter results, improved operational efficiency and sales productivity, as well as healthy demand for intelligence-led security products, FireEye issued an encouraging outlook for the second quarter and raised its revenue, billings and operating cash flow guidance for the full year.For the second quarter, the company anticipates revenues of $199-$203 million (mid-point: $201 million), which is in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Billings are projected at $180-$195 million. Non-GAAP gross margin is estimated to be approximately 74%, while non-GAAP operating margin is estimated in the band of -2% to +1%.The company forecasts non-GAAP bottom-line results to be between loss per share of 3 and breakeven earnings. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at a loss of a penny. Operating cash flow is likely to lie between zero and a negative of $15 million.For the full year, the company now anticipates revenues of $820-$830 million (mid-point: $825 million), up from the earlier range of $815-$825 million (mid-point: $820 million). The new range is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $819.6 million. Billings are now projected at $815-$835 million, higher than the prior guidance of $810-$830 million.Non-GAAP operating margin is still estimated in the band of 1-2%. The company continues to project reporting non-GAAP earnings in the range of breakeven to 4 cents per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at 2 cents.Operating cash flow is likely to lie between $50 million and $60 million, up from the previously guided range of $45-$55 million. Capital expenditure is still estimated to be between $35 million and $40 million.FireEye's management has been striving to turn around the business through a string of initiatives, which includes product launches, acquisitions and cost optimization. We believe the company's turnaround strategies are paying off as evident from its back-to-back five quarters of splendid results.Additionally, although a shift from product-based to subscription-based business model will have a negative impact on FireEye's near-term results, we believe it will lead to more stable revenues over the long run.However, a shorter contract length is likely to affect the company's near-term top-line performance. Nonetheless, there is an advantage to the shorter-length contracts, as these generally generate higher margins compared with three-year contracts.Currently, FireEye carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are CoStar Group, Inc.  , Dell Technologies Inc.  and Science Applications International Corporation  , all sporting a Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy). You can see  .Long-term expected earnings growth rates for CoStar Group, Dell Technologies and Science Applications International are 16.8%, 9.1% and 5%.Zacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the iShares U.S. Real Estate ETF (Symbol: IYR), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $83.70 per unit.With IYR trading at a recent price near $75.62 per unit, that means that analysts see 10.69% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of IYR's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Four Corners Property Trust Inc (Symbol: FCPT), CoStar Group, Inc. (Symbol: CSGP), and Howard Hughes Corp (Symbol: HHC). Although FCPT has traded at a recent price of $22.66/share, the average analyst target is 11.98% higher at $25.38/share. Similarly, CSGP has 11.76% upside from the recent share price of $366.66 if the average analyst target price of $409.78/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting HHC to reach a target price of $150.00/share, which is 10.86% above the recent price of $135.30. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of FCPT, CSGP, and HHC:Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
  
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past.

Moreover, though revenues marked year-over-year improvement, the bottom line registered a decline.The company posted non-GAAP loss of 3 cents as against earnings of 6 cents reported in the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at earnings of a penny. 3D Systems noted that unfavorable sales mix, along with increased investment in services and on-demand manufacturing, and elevated operating expenses, more than offset the benefit of higher revenues.On a GAAP basis, the company's loss widened to 19 cents per share from 9 cents posted in the first quarter of 2017.This 3D printer maker reported revenues of $165.9 million in the quarter, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 6%. Steady demand for the company's healthcare, software and on-demand manufacturing, along with increased printer unit sales proved conducive for the top line. Moreover, revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $159 million.3D Systems' Healthcare revenues were up 21% to $52.4 million year over year, driven by growth across all categories. Notably, the company's on-demand manufacturing revenues were up 2% to $25.7 million, helped by its investments in facilities, customer experience and technology.Software revenues were up 13% to $23 million. Material revenues remain approximately flat at $42.5 million. Printer revenues increased 24% and came in at $39.1 million. Meanwhile, printer unit sales surged 44%, resulting from increase in both production and professional unit sales.In the reported quarter, non-GAAP gross margin contracted 420 basis points on a year-over-year basis to 48.2%. The decline was mainly due to unfavorable sales mix and increased investment in services, and on-demand manufacturing, which more than offset the cost-reduction benefits achieved from ongoing supply-chain initiatives.In the reported quarter, the company's non-GAAP operating expenses flared up 10% to $79.5 million, as SG&A (up 8%) expenses rose significantly, driven by the company's persistent investment in go-to-market and IT transformation. Non-GAAP R&D expense also escalated 13% in the quarter. | 3D Systems ended the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $126.1 million, down from $136.3 million as of Dec 31, 2017. During the quarter, the company used $1.5 million of cash toward operational activities.3D Systems has a volatile earnings history, oscillating between incredible beats and abysmal misses in the trailing four quarters. Unfavorable macroeconomic factors, such as slowdown, inflation, currency fluctuations and commodity prices impacted the company's performance. This apart, escalating R&D, IT and go-to-market expenses might prove to be a headwind.Nevertheless, the company has been benefiting from favorable 3D printing industry fundamentals, led by rising demand for diverse application of this novel technology across several domains. Going forward, strong demand for production printers, materials and software, as well as healthcare solutions will likely act as major catalysts for growth. We also believe the acquisition of Vertex-Global Holding B.V will unlock multiple opportunities for the company.Currently, 3D Systems carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are CoStar Group, Inc.  , Dell Technologies Inc.  and Science Applications International Corporation  , all sporting a Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy).

" started 2018 on a strong note, reporting better-than-expected results for the first quarter. The company's non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations of 56 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 44 cents. The reported figure also came in ahead of management's guided range of 41-47 cents. On a year-over-year basis, however, the tally remained flat.The company's revenues of $1.52 billion outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.47 billion, as well as came in 2.6% higher year over year.The company's Software revenues, on a reported basis, were up 2% to $460 million. The upswing was primarily due to a 9% and 8% increase in Cloud and Professional Services, which was partially offset by an 18% and 1% decline in Software License and Software Maintenance revenues, respectively.Services revenues climbed 8% to $601 million on a reported basis. This upswing primarily stemmed from the company's ""channel transformation"" initiatives, which resulted in growth of hardware maintenance and implementation services.Hardware revenues, however, slipped 3% year over year, on a reported basis, to $456 million. Segment revenues from ATM, SCO and IPS declined 7%, 24% and 100%, respectively, which negatively impacted the overall hardware revenues. The decline in ATM revenues was due to low backlog at the beginning of the first quarter.However, revenues from POS ascended 19%, which slightly offset the decline of the other three segments. The rise in POS revenues was chiefly attributable to ""store transformation trends"". | Non-GAAP gross profit for the quarter remained flat year over year at $431 million. Nevertheless, non-GAAP gross margin shrunk 80 basis points (bps) to 28.4% as benefits from productivity improvements in Services segment were more than offset by reduced software license revenues and lower Hardware margins.Non-GAAP operating expenses during the quarter came in at $283 million, reflecting an increase from $273 million in the year-ago quarter, mainly due to increased sales investments as part of the company's focus on expansion of its strategic offers.Elevated expenses resulted in a decrease in income from operations, which on a non-GAAP basis, came in at $148 million, down from $158 million reported in the year-ago period. Also, operating margin contracted around 90 bps on a year-over-year basis to 9.8%.Non-GAAP net income from continuing operations was $85 million compared with $87 million in the year-ago quarter.The ATM and POS manufacturer exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $348 million, down from $537 million reported in the previous quarter. Receivables were $1.34 billion.However, NCR has a highly-leveraged balance sheet. The company ended the quarter with $3.04 billion of long-term debt in its book compared with $2.94 billion reported in the previous quarter.In the first quarter, the company used $24 million of cash for operational activities. For the quarter, free cash outflow was $99 million.During the quarter, the company repurchased $165 million of its common stock.The company reaffirmed its outlook for 2018. NCR anticipates revenues to be flat to up 3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $6.65 billion.Non-GAAP earnings per share are expected in the range of $3.30-$3.45. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $3.34.Per the U.S. tax reform, the company expects effective tax rate for 2018 to be 24%. The company expects free cash flow for 2018 to be around 90% of the non-GAAP net income.Coming to the second-quarter outlook, NCR expects revenues in the range of -1% to +1%. The company expects non-GAAP earnings per share for the second-quarter quarter in the range of 60-65 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 74 cents.NCR reported impressive first-quarter results. The company's focus on growth of cloud segment and modernization of services business are proving to be worthy, especially at a time when its ATM segment is not performing well. NCR is also focused on its strategy related to hardware manufacturing, aimed at reducing costs and headwinds from hardware cycles.Moreover, the addition of products, including the likes of ""Picklist Assist"" for identifying fruits and vegetables purchased by a customer, has enriched its solutions portfolio as well.Nonetheless, weakness in the ATM market and escalating costs pertaining to introduction of products, and other sales-related investments continue to be a drag on the company's financials.NCR carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are CoStar Group, Inc.  , Dell Technologies Inc.  and Science Applications International Corporation  , all sporting a Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy).

n Mar 19, we issued an updated research report on  .Information technology firm Unisys has been restructuring business to improve profitability. The restructuring plan includes selling non-core businesses and revamping sales strategy, investing in a few higher-growth areas such as outsourcing. We expect the company to continue with its cost-control initiatives and put greater effort toward sales growth, as it strives to overcome operational weaknesses. Unisys is focusing on building specialized industry skills and resources required to capitalize on industry-specific project opportunities. The company is investing heavily in developing a team dedicated to pursue growth opportunities for application-managed services for both existing and new clients. These application-based managed services capability will enable Unisys to effectively pursue long-term application outsourcing opportunities, associated application modernization and project work implementation.Further, Unisys is focusing its resources and investments in four targeted, high-potential market areas, including security (IT security and physical security), data center transformation and outsourcing services, end-user outsourcing and support services, and applications modernization and outsourcing services. As it seeks to keep pace with the evolution in the IT industry, the company's services unit is poised to take advantage of the growth prospects in higher-margin services. Unisys has secured quite a few contracts in these segments recently that should propel its top-line in the coming quarters.In addition, the information technology industry is presently undergoing a transition phase, forging new disruptive trends in cloud mobility, Big Data, social computing and increasing awareness of cyber security. In order to capitalize on these trends, Unisys is rationalizing its services and solution portfolio by shifting offerings to cloud-based and software-as-a-service delivery models. Unisys continued its transition to a more asset-lite business model, which resulted in reduced CapEx needs and improved cash flow. The company successfully executed its vertical go-to-market strategy, including hiring leaders of key sectors. The company is also concentrating on business opportunities in though fewer but more profitable sectors in the IT marketplace.Unisys stock has returned 40.1%, outperforming the  's 8.5% gain in the last three months. The company reported strong fourth-quarter 2017 results with healthy year-over-year increase in revenues and earnings.

The bottom line comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 18 cents.

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the iShares Russell 1000 Pure U.S. Revenue ETF (Symbol: AMCA), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $29.78 per unit.With AMCA trading at a recent price near $27.17 per unit, that means that analysts see 9.61% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of AMCA's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Zillow Group Inc (Symbol: ZG), CoStar Group, Inc. (Symbol: CSGP), and Host Hotels & Resorts Inc (Symbol: HST). Although ZG has traded at a recent price of $46.56/share, the average analyst target is 9.68% higher at $51.07/share. Similarly, CSGP has 9.65% upside from the recent share price of $353.40 if the average analyst target price of $387.50/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting HST to reach a target price of $20.83/share, which is 9.65% above the recent price of $19.00. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of ZG, CSGP, and HST:Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
  
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past.

"n recent trading, shares of CoStar Group, Inc. (Symbol: CSGP) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $335.14, changing hands for $336.40/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 7 different analyst targets contributing to that average for CoStar Group, Inc., but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $300.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $350.00. The standard deviation is $18.261.But the whole reason to look at the  CSGP price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with CSGP crossing above that average target price of $335.14/share, investors in CSGP have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $335.14 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover CoStar Group, Inc.:

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the PowerShares Dynamic Media Portfolio ETF (Symbol: PBS), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $31.06 per unit.With PBS trading at a recent price near $28.30 per unit, that means that analysts see 9.75% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of PBS's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Viacom Inc (Symbol: VIAB), Gannett Co Inc (Symbol: GCI), and CoStar Group, Inc. (Symbol: CSGP). Although VIAB has traded at a recent price of $27.15/share, the average analyst target is 45.86% higher at $39.60/share. Similarly, GCI has 21.56% upside from the recent share price of $9.46 if the average analyst target price of $11.50/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting CSGP to reach a target price of $310.43/share, which is 12.10% above the recent price of $276.91. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of VIAB, GCI, and CSGP:Combined, VIAB, GCI, and CSGP represent 8.35% of the PowerShares Dynamic Media Portfolio ETF. Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
  
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Add Up The Parts: PBS Could Be Worth $31@2017-10-09@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/add-parts-pbs-could-be-worth-31-2017-10-09

n Sep 22, we updated the research report on business software and services provider,  .Over the years, Amdocs has successfully combined its core billing and rating technology with customer relationship management software to emerge as a leader in the market of business support systems. With strategic acquisitions, the company has further evolved as a unique vendor providing both end-to-end business support solutions and operating support solutions to the carrier marketplace.Amdocs continues to expand its global client base by signing long-term contracts and collaborating with major telecommunication industry players worldwide. The company struck a three-year deal with Roger Communication to enhance operating efficiency of mobile, cable, wireline and broadband Internet services. In addition, Amdocs has signed a deal with AT&T, per which it will operate as an integrator for developers and telecom firms interested in using AT&T's ECOMP (Enhanced Control, Orchestration, Management & Policy) service. Amdocs will assist AT&T in marketing this service worldwide. The company has also been selected by companies such as Telefonica Brazil for its Vivo operations, Global Telecom of Philippines for automated and analytics-driven revenue assurance services, and by Global Fintech's subsidiary Mynt for its financial services offering.Amdocs has introduced a new digital customer management and commerce platform called Optima, which can monetize any product or service and supports the full business lifecycle. The product mainly targets midsized communication businesses and digital firms. Seaborne Networks, which develops and operates submarine fiber optic cable systems, has selected Optima in a seven-year managed services contract. The company also launched Amdocs Omni-Channel Experience integrated with Google's mobile data application program interface. The new products are expected to boost the company's top line.With a diligent execution of operational plans, the company remains on track to deliver non-GAAP fiscal 2017 earnings per share growth of 5.5% to 7.5%. Amdocs also expects revenues to be up 3-5% year over year.However, Amdocs is highly exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk.

Amdocs has underperformed the  with an average year-to-date return of 9.3% compared with 25.2% gain for the latter.Moreover, Amdocs is investing heavily in the emerging markets in order to boost sales, which may lead to a drop in margins.

One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.In trading on Thursday, shares of CoStar Group, Inc.

Consequently, Unisys has to continually invest in new technologies which act as value drivers that could provide a hedge against stiff competition.

he board of  announced a $2 billion share repurchase program a day after the  . This move reflects an initiative to improve stakeholder returns for the Indian software exporter, after heightened tensions between the board and the founders led by ex-Chairman N R Narayana Murthy resulted in Sikka's quitting.Asia's second-largest software services developer plans to repurchase as many as 113 million shares at Rs 1,150 apiece, per an exchange filing. Investors actually lost $3.5 billion as Infosys's market value plunged on Friday in the wake of Sikka's step-down. The repurchase price represents a 25% premium to Friday's closing price.Despite this generous offer, the shareholders' response was lukewarm at best.Sikka's resignation had led to a deep unrest among investors, causing shares to decline 10.8% at one point before paring the losses to end at 7.2% lower. Even now, Infosys shares are continuing their downward trend, having fallen 5.4% in today's  at the time of writing.Simply put, the repurchase price might have appeared more attractive, had Sikka's resignation the previous day not led to the plummet of Infosys shares to historic lows.Infosys's shares have lost 6.4% in the past year versus the  's 17.8% average gain.Experts opine that Infosys faces a major business disruption due to a high-profile CEO's exit, bitter ego battles between top management and a co-founder, plus the reputational damage suffered because of a possible securities fraud charge. These factors could affect new business acquisitions in the key markets and allow rivals to grab the company's existent market share.Also, potential clients may refrain from making deals with Infosys until there is more clarity on who will replace Sikka and what the strategies and vision of the new CEO might be.Sikka had taken over the reins of India's second-largest software and outsourcing company in June 2014. Over time, he had been instrumental in realigning the company's consulting business toward strategy consulting. During his term, Infosys had increased its $100 million clients from 12 to 19. The company's large deal wins rose from $1.9 billion in 2015 to $3.5 billion in FY17.Per news reports, Infosys is struggling with deep rifts formed within the board. Plus, the board's relationship with the company founders has been splintered. Perhaps, it is time for the company to revamp the board completely in order to restore investors' confidence.The road ahead for Infosys looks long and difficult. The company needs to begin anew with recruiting the right CEO and MD, which seems a daunting task in the light of a possible disparity between what the founders expect and what the shareholders probably want to see in their new leader. | Infosys presently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the broader space are Axcelis Technologies, Inc.  , CoStar Group, Inc.  and HP Inc.  , each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

"n a sudden move, Vishal Sikka stepped down as the chief executive officer and managing director of  earlier today, citing conflicts that deteriorated into mudslinging under an anonymous name. The move led to deep unrest among investors, causing shares to plunge 10.8% at one point in  .The surprise move came amid intensifying animosity between the board and the co-founders, led by NR Narayana Murthy. It seems that a seven-month-long confrontation between the company's founders on one hand, and Sikka and the board on the other, culminated into this drastic move. This is the second time that Infosys has plunged into a leadership crisis, after the founding members retired from the top management.Sikka had taken over the reins of India's second largest software and outsourcing company in June 2014.Sikka cited a relentless stream of distractions and disruptions over the recent quarters, which were becoming increasingly personal and negative, as of late, as one of the leading reason for his step. He asserted that the ""very public noise around us"" had created a shaky atmosphere, making it difficult for management to function effectively.Differences had been simmering between Murthy and Sikka for quite some time now, with the former repeatedly disparaging Sikka's policies. | In recent months, Infosys' founders, including Murthy, have criticized the company's leadership, focusing on executive pay packages and alleged lapses in corporate governance. Other issues which the founders took offense to, included allegations of impropriety in the 2015 acquisitions of Panaya and Skava Systems.In an email last week, Murthy reportedly addressed some of his advisers that he had been told by at least three independent directors of Infosys that Sikka was less CEO material and more CTO (chief technology officer) material. He also reportedly condemned the Infosys board for not upholding governance standards.Further, Infosys founders (who still own 12.75% of the company) had questioned Sikka's recent pay raise and the size of severance payouts given to some other executives, including former finance head - Rajiv Bansal.Infosys expressed profound distress by the unfounded personal attacks on the members of the management team, through anonymous letters that surfaced in recent months.When Sikka took over the helm, Infosys was lagging behind industry growth. Under his leadership, Infosys revenues jumped from $2.13 billion in first-quarter 2015 to $2.65 billion in first-quarter 2017, with strong margin performance and sustained cash generation. Sikka's focus on profitable growth delivered an increase in liquid assets (including cash and cash equivalents) from $4.9 billion in June 2014 to $6.1 billion in June 2017.Infosys also rolled out over 25 new services under Sikka, which helped bolster revenues significantly.However, the company's growth has slowed down sharply, after having soared in Sikka's first two years. Consequently, Infosys' share price has also underperformed the industry in recent times. Infosys' shares have inched up 0.2% in the past year, grossly underperforming the  's average gain of 27.1%.The Indian IT bellwether has named U B Pravin Rao as interim chief executive officer and managing director, while Sikka will continue as executive vice-chairman. Rao was the chief operating officer of the company, with overall strategic and operational responsibility for the entire portfolio of Infosys' offerings.In his new role, Sikka will continue to focus on strategic initiatives, key customer relationships and technology development. He will receive an annual salary of $1 during his tenure and will report to the company's board.Infosys presently carries a Zacks rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the broader space include CSRA Inc.  , CoStar Group, Inc.  and HP Inc.  , each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

"nalyst ratings can sometimes be complicated, and we here at  have noticed a bit of a paradox with CoStar Group, Inc. (Symbol: CSGP). The average 12-month price target for CSGP - averaging the work of 7 analysts - reveals an average price target of $273.86/share. That's a whopping -2.65%  where CSGP has been trading recently at $281.32/share. With this kind of downside potential (should CSGP fall to that price target), one might expect to see a high concentration of ""hold"" or even ""sell"" ratings on the stock. Yet, take a look at the bullishness:
  
The average rating presented in the last row of the table above is from 1 to 5, where 1 would be a consensus Strong Buy and 5 would be a consensus Strong Sell. In the middle, 3 would be a Hold. So anything below 3 leans toward Buy as the average analyst sentiment. The average rating of 1.13 for CSGP leans strongly towards the bullish end of the spectrum, yet the CSGP price target paints a different picture. Clearly, there is something more to the story here that is worth investigating for investors looking at CoStar Group, Inc. Of course, the average price target is just that - a mathematical average, and is only one metric. There are analysts with higher targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $310.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as low as $242.00. The standard deviation is $24.34.But the whole reason to look at the  in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes - much like with guessing the number of jelly beans in a jar, where the  guess tends to be very close. And so with CSGP trading so far above that average target price of $273.86/share, the -2.65% downside to that average target does seem to be a paradox against the bullish analyst ratings. Might analysts be behind the curve with their targets and upward adjustments are forthcoming? Or, is it time for some of these analysts to turn bearish and downgrade on valuation? One thing is for sure: this apparent paradox makes for a good ""signal"" to investors in CSGP to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding whether analysts have it right with their sentiment, or have it right with their price target for CoStar Group, Inc.

n May 22, we issued an updated research report on business software & services provider  .Formed in 1982, Amdocs is a leading provider of customer relationship management and billing software to communications service providers. Amdocs performed relatively well in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, with revenues improving on a year-over-year basis due to solid execution across multiple dimensions of its business and continuous project wins. GAAP earnings for the quarter also improved to $112.6 million or 76 cents a share from $107.7 million or 71 cents per share in the year-earlier quarter.For fiscal 2017, Amdocs further updated its guidance on favorable growth dynamics and strength in the business model. The company expects revenues to be up 3-5% year over year compared with the earlier projection of a rise of 1.5-5.5%. The company remains on track to deliver non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 4.5-8.5%. This augurs well for the long-term growth of the company.Amdocs continues to boost shareholders' wealth by continuously repurchasing shares and paying regular dividends to its shareholders. Moreover, the company has increased its quarterly dividend by 12.8% to 22 cents per share. With a diligent execution of operational plans, Amdocs has outperformed the Zacks categorized  industry in the last three months with an average return of 6.1% as against a 1.4% loss for the latter.The company introduced a new digital customer management and commerce platform called Optima which can monetize any product or service and support the full business lifecycle. The product mainly targets midsized communication businesses and digital firms. Seaborne Networks, which develops and operates submarine fiber optic cable systems, has selected Optima in a seven year managed services contract. The company also launched Amdocs Omni-Channel Experience integrated with Google's mobile data application program interface. Moving forward, the innovative products are likely to boost the top-line in the coming quarters.However, Amdocs is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with significant international operations. The company is also investing heavily in the emerging markets in order to boost sales, which may lead to a drop in margins. Even in the developed markets, management has decided to undertake a series of programs including training, knowledge transfer, and productivity enhancement to cope with recessionary situations. All these activities are likely to result in bottom-line shrinkage.Nevertheless, we remain impressed with the inherent growth potential of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock. Other stocks worth reckoning in the industry include EPAM Systems, Inc.  , CoStar Group, Inc.  and MAM Software Group, Inc.  , each carrying a Zacks Rank #2. You can see  .EPAM has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 20%. It topped estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 3.2%.CoStar Group has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 17.5%. It surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 11.3%.MAM Software surpassed estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 92.9%.Before looking into the stocks mentioned above, you may want to get a head start on potential tech IPOs that are popping up on Zacks' radar. Imagine being in the first wave of investors to jump on a company with almost unlimited growth potential?

 recently inked a strategic data agreement with business news provider, Thomson Reuters Corporation  to expand its product portfolio. The collaboration is likely to benefit customers of both the companies.According to the terms of the agreement, S&P  Intelligence (a division of S&P Global) will provide transcript coverage of public as well as private companies to Thomson Reuters' users for enhanced data analysis. This includes complete coverage of firms in the S&P 500 and other leading stock market indices.The transcripts and events data will be delivered in a machine-readable format through its EDA (Event Driven Alerts) platform. In addition, S&P  Intelligence will also deliver final transcript documents and historical events data through Xpressfeed - S&P Global's flagship feed delivery platform. The company will perform extensive quality checks for higher accuracy and timeliness for all transcript data, covering earnings conference calls, guidance/update calls, sales/trading calls, special calls, shareholder/analyst days and annual board meetings.S&P Global started 2017 on an impressive note with impressive top line and bottom-line results. The company has outperformed the  industry over the past three months with an average return of 8.7% compared with a gain of 3.5% for the latter. Maintaining its earnings beat streak for the 22nd straight quarter, S&P Global reported first-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share of $1.62, comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.40. Earnings were also up 35% compared with the year-earlier quarter tally of $1.20.Impressive bottom-line growth came on the back of robust organic revenue growth, diligent expense control measures and strategic share repurchases. Revenues for the quarter were $1,453 million compared with $1,341 million in the year-ago quarter. The top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,388 million. Top-line growth was fuelled by outstanding performance of the company's Global Ratings segment. Also, impressive performance of the S&P Dow Jones Indices business supplemented the growth.We believe that the company's strategic portfolio restructuring and focus on core business will continue to drive growth, going forward. This apart, strategic acquisitions and positive industry trends will likely continue benefiting the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock.A couple of other top stocks in the industry include CoStar Group, Inc.  and EPAM Systems, Inc.  , both carrying a Zacks Rank #2. You can see  .CoStar Group has a healthy long-term earnings growth expectation of 17.5%. It reported a trailing four quarter average positive earnings surprise of 11.3%.EPAM Systems has a solid long-term earnings growth expectation of 20%. It delivered a trailing four quarter average positive earnings surprise of 3.2%.Today's investment ideas are short-term, directly based on our proven 1 to 3 month indicator.

"n recent trading, shares of CoStar Group, Inc. (Symbol: CSGP) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $264.00, changing hands for $266.93/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 8 different analyst targets contributing to that average for CoStar Group, Inc., but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $230.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $300.00. The standard deviation is $22.025.But the whole reason to look at the  CSGP price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with CSGP crossing above that average target price of $264.00/share, investors in CSGP have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $264.00 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover CoStar Group, Inc.:

" (NASDAQ: CSGP) reported first-quarter results on April 26. The provider of commercial real estate analytics and online marketplaces is enjoying record sales of its subscription services as it expands its online empire.Data source: CoStar Group Q1 2017 earnings  .CoStar enjoyed record Q1 bookings of $35 million, representing growth of 18% from the prior quarter.""We had an exceptionally strong first quarter of 2017 as our investments in our sales force, marketing campaigns, technology enhancements and research improvements combined to deliver outstanding sales and revenue results,"" said CoStar Founder and CEO Andrew Florance in a press release.CoStar's revenue rose 13% year over year to $227 million, above its guidance range of $223 million to $225 million. Its growth was broad-based, highlighted by a 13% rise in CoStar Suite revenue and a 22% jump in multifamily revenue.'The first quarter of 2017 was our second best multifamily sales quarter as our newly revamped and vastly improved sales team continues the momentum from last fall,"" Florance said. ""According to comScore, visits and unique visitor traffic in March reached all-time highs for Apartments.com and our multifamily network as we continue to expand our lead over the competition.""EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) -- adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation, acquisition-related costs, and other special items -- increased 11% to $64 million. That was above CoStar's guidance range of $57 million to $60 million. Adjusted (non-GAAP) net income increased 11% year over year to $34 million, or $1.05 per share, which also exceeded CoStar's forecast of $0.92 to $0.97 in non-GAAP EPS.Image source: Getty Images.On April 10, 2017, CoStar agreed to buy LandWatch.com from DataSphere Technologies.

""The acquisition of LandWatch solidifies our position as the number one online network of marketplaces for rural real estate.""Thanks to its strong first-quarter results and the expected positive impact of its LandWatch.com acquisition, CoStar raised its full-year 2017 revenue and earnings outlook. Revenue is now anticipated to be between $945 million and $955 million, up from prior estimates of $935 million to $945 million. And non-GAAP EPS is projected to be in a range of $4.30 to $4.40, up from a previous forecast of $4.18 to $4.28.Looking further ahead, CoStar reiterated its goal to achieve $1 billion in revenue and 40% margin in 2018.""Recent job growth has been strong, which bodes well for commercial leasing activity as well as the apartment household formation that drives the apartment sector, Florance said during a conference call with analysts.

n Jun 22,  was downgraded to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). Going by the Zacks model, companies carrying a Zacks Rank #5 are likely to underperform the broader market in the next one to three months.Revenue concentration, budgetary constraints, uncertainty related to significant contract renewals and leveraged balance sheet are major concerns for CSRA.We note that the National Security Administration's (NSA) Groundbreaker program and the Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) Information Technology Infrastructure program that comprise two crucial government programs (making up about 10% of company revenue) are going up for re-compete this year. Hence, the uncertainty over the renewals of TSA and NSA contracts are potential headwinds to CSRA's industry leading margins, especially as the competition becomes more intense.Additionally, the delay in awarding the C4ISR systems contract and slow ramp up of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) background investigations contract has impacted top-line growth in the last reported quarter. Moreover, we expect sluggishness in award procurement to continue in the near term (over the next two quarters), due to numerous ongoing transitions within the Trump administration.Furthermore, revenue concentration is a major risk for CSRA. In fiscal 2017, 94% of revenues came from sales to the U.S. federal government either as a prime contractor or subcontractor. Due to this massive dependence, any adverse changes in government's IT spending budget could mar the top-line growth.Further, CSRA's leveraged balance sheet adds to the risk of investing in the company. As of Mar 31, 2017, the company had total debt (including the current portion) of $2.58 billion. Meanwhile, it just had $126 million as cash and cash equivalents as of Mar 31, 2017.On May 24, 2017, CSRA reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results wherein earnings of 49 cents beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate while revenues of $1.25 billion missed the same. On a year over year basis, revenues fell 3%. Also, revenues for the full fiscal were down 4% year over year to $4.99 billion.Consequently, the company has been seeing downward estimate revisions. In the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 declined 4.4% (9 cents) to $1.95 per share while that for fiscal 2019 dropped 2.3% (5 cents) to $2.13 a share. | We also note that CSRA's share price movement has been dismal in the past six months. Shares have gained a meager 0.2% compared with the Zacks categorized  industry's increase of 11.2%.Better-ranked stocks in the broader tech space include EPAM Systems, Inc.  , CoStar Group, Inc.  and MAM Software Group, Inc.  . EPAM Systems sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while both CoStar Group and MAM Software Group carry Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see In the trailing four quarters, EPAM Systems, CoStar Group and MAM Software Group delivered average positive earnings surprises of 3.24%, 11.34% and 92.86% respectively.Today's investment ideas are short-term, directly based on our proven 1 to 3 month indicator.

" has been one of the Fund's longest investments. As we described earlier, the stock fell when CoStar's management announced an incremental $20 million investment to target a $200 million, high-margin incremental and recurring revenue opportunity. CoStar's stock reached a high of just under $225 this summer but fell to a low of $180 after this announcement. We thought the market significantly overreacted and decided to ""max out"" (we can buy up to a 5% position at cost) our CoStar investment. Over the 15 years we've been investors in CoStar, we've witnessed first-hand the company's successful track record of investments and believe this latest one will be no different.

Shutterstock photoLegendary investor Warren Buffett advises to be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful. One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.In trading on Thursday, shares of CoStar Group, Inc. (Symbol: CSGP) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 28.3, after changing hands as low as $180.42 per share. By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) is 48.1.

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the First Trust Industrials/Producer Durables AlphaDEX Fund ETF (Symbol: FXR), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $31.29 per unit.With FXR trading at a recent price near $28.40 per unit, that means that analysts see 10.18% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of FXR's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are ITT Inc (Symbol: ITT), CoStar Group, Inc. (Symbol: CSGP), and KBR Inc (Symbol: KBR). Although ITT has traded at a recent price of $31.29/share, the average analyst target is 25.00% higher at $39.11/share. Similarly, CSGP has 17.18% upside from the recent share price of $204.82 if the average analyst target price of $240.00/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting KBR to reach a target price of $17.93/share, which is 16.34% above the recent price of $15.41. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of ITT, CSGP, and KBR:Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
  
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past.

 was a big mover last session, as its shares rose over 5% on the day. The move came on the back of the company's confirmation of the receipt of an unsolicited, non-binding proposal from Donuts Inc. to acquire Rightside's entire registry of generic top-level domains and related assets for $70 million in an all-cash deal. This led to far more shares changing hands than in a normal session. This breaks the recent trend of the company, as the stock is now trading above the volatile price range of $8.96 to $9.39 in the past one-month time frame.None of the estimates for this stock were revised over the past 30 days.

"Chicago, IL - July 27, 2016 - Stocks in this week's article include:  and Given the recent run-up in the market last week, here's a screen I've been using recently for my own stock picking.First, it focuses on the top Zacks Ranked Sectors and Industries. Then it focuses on the Zacks Rank #1s, #2s and #3s, which are Strong Buys, Buys and Holds, respectively. But then it selects the outperforming stocks with the smallest percentage price change over the last 4 weeks.Why would I do something like that?Here's why.You've probably heard the old adage that roughly half of a stock's price movement can be attributed to the group that it's in. And that's true. In fact, oftentimes, even a mediocre stock in a top group will outperform a top stock in a poor group for this very reason.Now, take a look at any top group. You'll see plenty of fantastic stocks with some impressive price gains in there. But not every stock in every group moves in lockstep at the exact same time. Some will move more than others at any given time.So by focusing on the stocks with the smallest percentage price change with fundamentals that are just as good as those making the biggest price change, you might find yourself getting into the stocks ready to make the biggest potential catch-up move.Here's how to set up that screen:• We're screening for only those stocks with the best (lowest) average Zacks Rank. With 16 sectors, the best 8 sectors give us the best 50% of sectors.• Next step is to get only the best Zacks Ranked Industries coming thru. Since there are 264 'X' or expanded industries we look at, the best 132 will give us the best 50% of industries. But note that only the industries that also happen to be in the top sectors will get thru. If an industry is ranked as one of the best but it's outside of the top sector rank, it will not get thru.• Now the screen gets narrowed down even more by looking at only the Zacks Rank #1s, #2s and #3s. No Sells or Strong Sells (Zacks Rank #4s and #5s) allowed.• Only stocks over $5 with at least an average of 100,0000 shares traded daily will be considered.• This means we're screening for only those stocks that have outperformed the market (S&P 500) over the last 4 weeks.• Then finally we're scanning for the bottom 50 stocks with the lowest percentage price change over the last 4 weeks. So while all of these stocks have outperformed the market, they increased in price less than their peers.So each one of these stocks is in a top Sector and top Industry within that Sector. This alone will tip the odds of success in your favor by a great deal when you consider that the best Zacks Ranked groups outperform the worst ones by a factor of 2 to 1.Then by selecting those stocks with the best Zacks Rank along with the best price performance over the last 4 weeks, you now have only a list of winners from which to choose from.And from that list of winners, we're selecting the ones that have gained less than their peers on that list. Remember, these stocks aren't 'dogs' or unresponsive stocks. Quite the contrary; they have all outperformed the market. It just so happens that they increased less than the others on the list.

" wholly owned subsidiary EdgeVerve Systems' prominent banking solution Infosys Finacle has been recently chosen by the largest mobile payments & commerce platform Paytm to support its new payments bank business.Leveraging on the competence of Finacle Core Banking, Paytm plans to launch innovative offerings by boosting its deposit products and payments platform. Infosys asserts that the use of Finacle will allow Paytm to integrate its payments bank services, create comprehensive CaSa (Current Account and Savings) based products and simplify operations. Adoption of banking services necessitates Paytm to comply with multiple industry standards and Finacle is well equipped to handle all such needs.With the help of Finacle, Paytm can enjoy many third-party applications like Anti-Money Laundering and even scale and manage expanding operations. Paytm has chosen Infosys' Finacle over other competitive solutions as it believes it is the perfect choice to create a competent platform for small value and high volume transactions. In a nutshell, Infosys is aiding in the digital transformation of Paytm to venture beyond its wallet business to a full grown payment bank that is currently revolutionizing the Indian banking sector.Payment Banks and Small Banks are Reserve Bank of India's (""RBI"") idea of financial inclusion. These cater to the credit requirements and remittance needs of the country's small businesses, unorganized sectors, low-income households, farmers and migrant work force. Infosys foresees thriving prospects in this space and has introduced Finacle Payments Bank and Finacle Small Finance Bank solutions in Sep 2015 to cash in on the bountiful opportunities.With leading organizations like Reliance Industries and Airtel M Commerce in India vying for licenses from the RBI to set up payment banks, Infosys Finacle will likely witness great demand for use in the process of digital transformation of these companies. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, the EdgeVerve unit had 18 wins and 24 ""go-lives"" for both the Finacle and Edge suites that will likely boost profits. These contract wins are expected to drive the top line in the upcoming quarters.According to a Business Standard article, Infosys expects EdgeVerve, its wholly owned subsidiary, which is also the parent company of Finacle, to contribute at least 10% to its overall revenue growth over the next 3-5 years. With 70% of the top 40 banks in India using the platform, Fincale is not only EdgeVerve's most successful offering but is also a primary growth driver for the company.Infosys currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the industry include CoStar Group Inc.  , EarthLink Holdings Corp.  and RELX NV  . While CoStar Group and EarthLink Holdings sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), RELX NV holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

 , a leading provider of IT Services, recently announced that it has collaborated with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to help conserve energy usage in commercial and industrial buildings. This initiative on part of the company will help firms to foster environment-friendly business practices. CoStar intends to display building energy information in its Property database.Energy conservation has become a prime focus for state and local governments across the world. The government agencies are currently implementing policies per which companies are liable to disclose their energy usage information. Once this information is received by the government agencies, it will be uploaded in CoStar's database. The first two cities that will have this data service are Washington, DC and Chicago.For over 30 years CoStar has provided its technical expertise to professionals involved in every aspect of multifamily and commercial real estate. The company had earlier collaborated with the Environmental Protection Agency to exhibit ENERGY STAR ratings, and worked with the U.S. Green Building Council to display Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certified buildings in its database. Currently the company has over 15,000 ENERGY STAR-labeled and LEED-certified properties in its database.The updated information is expected to make brokers, owners, investors and lenders aware of energy usage in various properties across the country. This database will help customers reduce energy wastage and in turn lower their electricity bill.Awareness about energy efficiency has become important as buildings generally account for 80% of carbon emissions within cities. Residents and businesses also incur hundreds of millions of dollars in total energy costs. Increased transparency will help reduce pollution and improve the country's environmental health. City governments in Atlanta, Boston, Boulder, Chicago, Kansas City, New York, Philadelphia, Portland, Seattle, and the District of Columbia are currently actively working on gathering such information to improve energy usage.Headquartered in Washington, DC, CoStar has its offices across the U.S., Europe and Canada. The company has approximately 2,600 employees worldwide. CoStar is the industry's largest professional research organization.CoStar carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Some other stocks worth a glance include EarthLink Holdings Corp.  , RELX NV  and Science Applications International Corporation  .

 is looking like an interesting pick from a technical perspective, as the company is seeing favorable trends on the moving average crossover front. Recently, the 50 Day Moving Average for CSGP broke out above the 200 Day Simple Moving Average, suggesting a short-term bullish trend.This has already started to take place, as the stock has moved higher by 10% in the past four weeks. Plus, the company currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) suggesting that now could definitely be the time for this breakout candidate.More bullishness may especially be the case, when investors consider what has been happening for CSGP on the earnings estimate revision front lately. No estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 3 higher, while the consensus estimate has also moved higher too.So given this move in estimates, and the positive technical factors, investors may want to watch this breakout candidate closely for more gains in the near future.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"Chicago, IL - June 03, 2016 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include  and Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.  .In the stock market, finding a win-win strategy is easier said than done. In the current highly volatile market, it is difficult for even an ardent investor to come up with a foolproof approach.One could take resort to the commonly used techniques to find beaten down stocks that have the potential to recover faster than others. But this bears the risk of disappointment asone could fall into the value trap if the selected stock's hidden weakness is not identified.In the stock game, winning means reaching a higher price. So, how about looking for the current winners that have the potential to gain further?Sounds a good idea? Here is how to execute it:One should primarily look for stocks that have recently witnessed a price increase. Actually, stocks that have recently seen price strength have high chances of carrying the momentum forward.If a stock is continuously moving higher, there must be a good reason for the rise or else it probably would have fallen like the losers.So, looking at those that have already won the game and are capable of beating the benchmark that they have set for themselves sounds rational.Nevertheless, recent price strength alone cannot do the trick. Club together other relevant parameters in your game plan to get the optimum return on your investment.Here's how you should create the screen to shortlist the current as well as the potential winners. This criterion shows that the stock has moved higher in the last four weeks. This indicates that the stock has seen momentum over the last three months. This lowers the risk of choosing stocks that may have drawn attention due to the overwhelming performance of the overall market in a very short period. No matter whether the market conditions are good or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) have a proven history of outperformance.

"remium business consulting and information technology provider  recently won a five-year contract from Germany's Commerzbank. Under this, Infosys will enhance the bank's services based on its Design Thinking and AiKiDo framework. The financial terms of the contract have been kept under wraps.As per the agreement, Infosys will be in charge of restructuring critical IT processes of the bank, including investment banking architecture and evaluation of Post-Trade Processing Utility. Following this, Commerzbank will be able to combine diverse trade processing platforms of different product types, simplifying its operations to a great extent. Also, Infosys will help the bank set up a Center of Competence to better serve Commerzbank's Corporates and Markets segments.In addition, Infosys create an exclusive online and physical academy for the bank's employees to foster a continuous learning environment and consolidate existing IT applications for enhanced performance. It is believed that the ""middle and back office"" utilities will form the cornerstone of further digitization of the financial services industry. Meanwhile, Commerzbank believes that the adoption of Infosys' services will help it fend off cut-throat competition in the industry through the exploration of new business models.Innovation is the key to Infosys' success apart from initiatives like the empowerment of employees through the Zero Distance Program and improvement of next-generation services with offerings like AiKiDo. The company's AiKiDo offerings, the acronym for Artificial Intelligence, Knowledge-based IT and Design thinking, which were introduced during the second quarter of fiscal 2016, are rapidly gaining traction and look set to boost profits in the quarters ahead.During the fourth quarter, these services gained solid traction after major clients like Bank Leumi (UK) PLC, Al Ahli Bank in Kuwait and Albaraka, one of Morocco's leading microfinance institutions, adopted it. We believe that the intense competition prevailing in the banking industry are compelling more financial institutions to streamline their IT infrastructure, which in turn is propelling demand for Infosys.Infosys currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the industry include CoStar Group Inc.  , EarthLink Holdings Corp.  and RELX NV  .

" reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2016 earnings per American Depositary Share (ADS) of 23 cents, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate, rising 7% on a year-over-year basis.The bottom-line performance largely benefited from strong revenue growth. Also, a considerable reduction in cost of sales aided the earnings improvement. However, foreign currency volatility and expected seasonality were major headwinds.For fiscal 2016, Infosys reported earnings per ADS of 90 cents, which reflected year-over-year growth of 1.9%.Revenues increased 13.3% year over year to $2,446 million, but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,451 million by a whisker. Moreover, in terms of constant currency, revenues were up 15%.For fiscal 2016, Infosys reported revenues of $9,501 million, up 9.1% from the prior year figures.Top-line growth was largely driven by lucrative contract wins, higher volume growth and enhanced operational efficiency. Improvement in client relationships, stable attrition rate and better employee engagement also contributed to the overall quarterly performance.Infosys' operating profit climbed 12.6% year over year to $625 million. Management believes that strong focus on operational improvement boosted the company's operating profits in fourth-quarter fiscal 2016.The company witnessed growth in all four regions where it operates. Fourth-quarter sales in India, Rest of the World and Europe rose about 9.1%, 4% and 2.4% sequentially, respectively. Meanwhile, sales in North America improved marginally (0.5%).Three of the four reporting segments witnessed modest growth. Energy, Utilities, Communications & Services and Retail & Life Sciences emerged as the biggest gainers, wherein revenues rose 4.6% and 2.4% on a sequential basis, respectively. Revenues in the Manufacturing & Hi-Tech division improved 1% sequentially, while Banking & Financial division contracted 0.3% on a sequential basis.Infosys ended the year with an impressive quarter, having signed major deals with the likes of North America's dominant packaged food company ConAgra Foods, Inc., and utilities giant Welsh Water.Apart from this, the company's strategic collaborations with leading technology providers in the industry and complementary acquisition plans added to its growth. The quarter saw Infosys partnering with technology behemoth Microsoft Corp. to aid the digital transformation of health institutions through the deployment of smart analytics solutions. Also, Infosys teamed up with Hershey Company to build predictive analytics capability using open source information platform on Amazon Web Services.Moreover, most of Infosys' businesses including Panaya, Skava & Edge software product have recorded solid growth in the quarter that benefited both the top and the bottom line. In a bid to solidify its market position and focus more on customers, the company came up with three distinguished offerings, namely, Artificial Intelligence, Knowledge-based IT and Design thinking during the second quarter fiscal 2016. During the fourth quarter, these services continued to gain solid traction after being adopted by major clients like Bank Leumi (UK) PLC, Al Ahli Bank in Kuwait and Albaraka, one of Morocco's leading microfinance institutions.Further, Infosys' ""Zero Distance"" program, which aims to foster innovation in every project undertaken by it, witnessed steady progress during the quarter. Infosys' Zero Distance program contributed to employee improvement which, in turn, drove the company's overall performance. Infosys has significantly improved its content, thanks to the Zero Distance program.The company's recent acquisitions, including the information management consulting services firm Noah Consulting, LLC, Delaware-based start-up, WHOOP, and an Israeli-based company CloudEndure, boosted its operations. These investments are a part of Infosys' $500 million innovation fund - an integral part of its New and Renew strategy - intended to capitalize on the growth potential of disruptive technologies. While investment in WHOOP is expected to strengthen its foothold in new-age wearable technologies, the CloudEndure venture is likely to fortify its footprint in the cloud business.As of Mar 31, 2016, Infosys had cash & cash equivalents of $4,935 million, reflecting an improvement from $4,859 million recorded as of Mar 31, 2015.Concurrent with the strong financial performance, Infosys gave robust guidance for the fiscal year ending Mar 31, 2017. Incorporating the impact of currency translation, the company now expects revenues to rise in the range of 11.8% to 13.8% year over year.Infosys reported steady results despite formidable market headwinds like a strong U.S. dollar, sluggish macroeconomic growth and intensifying competition. However, Infosys' strong commitment toward constant innovation, business realignment to attain better operational efficiency and major contract wins are likely to support growth for the rest of the fiscal. Apart from this, the rapid traction of AiKiDo offerings and strategic alliances also bode well for future growth.Infosys currently holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Other stocks in the industry include CoStar Group Inc.  , EarthLink Holdings Corp.  and GTT Communications, Inc.  , each holding the same rank as Infosys.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"mage source: CoStar Group. reported first-quarter results on April 27. The provider of commercial real estate information, analytics, and online marketplaces exceeded its own expectations for revenue and EPS, leading management to raise its guidance for 2016.
  
Data source: CoStar Group Q1 2016 earnings  . Revenue jumped 26% year over year to $200 million, surpassing CoStar's guidance for first-quarter sales of approximately $196 million to $198 million.Helping to drive that growth was a 100% increase in CoStar's multifamily marketplace revenue -- which comprises about 25% of the company's total sales -- as Apartments.com expanded its lead in unique visitors and consumer engagement versus its rivals.Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) soared 234% to $48 million. Adjusted EBITDA -- which excludes stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, acquisition-related costs, and other special items -- likewise surged 142% to $58 million.""We had an excellent first quarter with strong revenue growth and margin expansion,"" said CEO Andrew Florance in a press release. ""We continue to deliver strong sales as net bookings in the first quarter of 2016 were $30 million, up 47% compared to first quarter of 2015.""All told, adjusted net income leaped 185% to $31 million. And adjusted earnings per share increased 179% to $0.95, far exceeding CoStar's guidance for non-GAAP EPS of approximately $0.66 to $0.70.Those strong results led management to boost CoStar's full-year 2016 outlook. Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $834 million to $840 million, an increase of $2 million at the midpoint from CoStar's prior guidance. And the company's updated projections for non-GAAP net income per share are $4.00 to $4.10 (up from its previous estimates of $3.62 to $3.72), representing an increase of approximately 100% at the mid-point over 2015's results.For the second quarter, Costar expects revenue of approximately $204 million to $206 million and non-GAAP net income per share between $0.80 and $0.84.""Our strong sales growth and focus on controlling costs were evident in our first quarter 2016 results,"" said CFO Scott Wheeler.

nvestors eyeing a purchase of CoStar Group, Inc. (Symbol: CSGP) stock, but tentative about paying the going market price of $183.14/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the October put at the $170 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $9.50. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 5.6% return against the $170 commitment, or a 11% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to CSGP's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $170 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless CoStar Group, Inc. sees its shares fall 7.2% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $160.50 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $9.50 from $170), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 11% annualized rate of return.

n Mar 28, Zacks  updated the research report on diversified electronics manufacturer  .Amphenol designs and manufactures connectors and interconnecting systems that are used primarily to transmit electrical and optical signals for a wide range of sophisticated electronic applications.The company remains encouraged by its expanding presence in the fast-growing commercial aerospace market and is well positioned to capitalize on the proliferation of electronics content on next generation planes. These advanced electronic systems also require new higher technology interconnect solutions to enhance fuel efficiency and improve passenger experience, all of which create excellent opportunities for Amphenol.In order to fuel further growth, Amphenol aims to acquire on a global basis in the high-growth segments that have complementary capabilities from a product, customer and/or geographic standpoint. During fourth-quarter 2015, Amphenol completed the acquisition of FCI Asia Pte Ltd for $1.275 billion. This takeover is expected to be accretive to Amphenol's earnings from the first year of its integration and provide synergistic benefits with advanced technological support and an experienced management team. We remain impressed by the company's activity on the acquisition front and expect it to be accretive in the long term with improvement in operating income margin and strong operating discipline.Furthermore, Amphenol's top-line growth is benefiting from improved end-market demand, new product rollouts, and market share gains. Demand continues to be strong in automotive industrial and mobile networks and military markets.

" North America-based subsidiary Infosys Public Services Inc. (""IPS"") and Canada's Ministry of Transportation Ontario (MTO) pioneered the implementation of a state-of-the-art carrier registration, licensing and performance monitoring system for supporting more than 9 million people in Ontario.Powered by Oracle software products, the latest Registration and Licensing System of Ontario (RLSO) has been designed as an enterprise services-based platform to replace MTO's 40-year-old legacy licensing and registration system. IPS resorted to a three-ponged strategy to materialize this transformation through improved business performance, technology and business modernization.More than 80% of the total business functionality including services like motor vehicle inspection stations, carrier registration and carrier performance monitoring are being handled by the new system. Going forward, RSLO plans to extend its services to areas like audit program, stock management and online services for carrier clients.Precisely, this whole initiative is part of MTO's Road User Modernization Program that aims at creating a client-friendly solution which can eliminate cumbersome paper-based processes in favor of an automated ""one client / one record"" integrated driver, vehicle, and carrier system. With IPS' aid, Ontario, which is also the most populous province housing 37% residents, became the first jurisdiction in North America to adopt a comprehensive carrier registration and performance monitoring solution that will fundamentally alter its public infrastructure.Infosys is upbeat about the initiatives which are being implemented by the Motor Vehicle Departments and Ministries of Transportation are will likely unlock new business opportunities for the company. As a matter of fact, Infosys has been successfully boosting its financials through the winning of multiple clients and signing of major deals.During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, the company added 47 new clients and signed six large deals worth $757 million. Apart from the implementation of the carrier registration, licensing and performance monitoring system, the company's American business is witnessing bright prospects with two major deals signed in financial services in the Americas.Infosys currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the industry include Barracuda Networks, Inc.  , CoStar Group Inc.  and EarthLink Holdings Corp.  .

nformation technology firm,  , recently announced that the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is utilizing its biometric identity solution at the Otay Mesa border crossing in San Diego to gather biometric parameters of non-U.S. citizens leaving the country.This new biometric solution will assist CBP to identify visa overstays and persons of interest, as well as improve reporting and analysis of international visitors. The innovative biometric device by Unisys will enhance the national security of the country as well as improve efficiency in the security process.Unisys has had a long history with CBP in providing security solutions to the government organization. Last year, on Jun 18, 2015, Unisys developed a facial recognition system for the Dulles International Airport, VA, to help CBP identify imposters trying to enter the country with fraudulent passports. On Jan 25, 2016 Unisys improved the facial recognition technology used to match travelers' faces to the biometric data on their ePassports.Alongside these collaborations, Unisys recently won a two-year extension of its existing service contract from the Australian Department of Defence, worth approximately AUD$74 million (US$54 million).Over 300 government organizations worldwide use Unisys solutions.

"Image source: CoStar Group.In  's fourth-quarter results on Feb. 24, the leading provider of commercial real estate information, analytics, and online marketplaces showed that it is successfully integrating its online apartments sites -- and that is delivering significant cost savings and sizable profits.
  
Data source: CoStar Group Q4 2015 earnings  . CoStar Group spent much of 2015 ""building the premier marketplace for renting an apartment in the United States,"" said Founder and CEO Andrew Florance in a press release. CoStar appears to have done just that, as Apartments.com enjoyed more visitor traffic in 2015 than any other apartment rental website, according to comScore. In addition, revenue from Apartments.com jumped 30% year over year in the fourth quarter.The company is also investing heavily to integrate CoStar, Apartments.com, and Apartment Finder. Those investments are beginning to bear fruit, with fourth-quarter EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) rising to $55 million, a 29% year-over-year increase and a nearly 150% sequential increase from the third quarter of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA -- which excludes stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, acquisition-related costs, and other special items -- also rose 20% year over year to $65 million.All told, adjusted (non-GAAP) net income grew 17% to $35 million, and adjusted earnings per share increased 18% to $1.10. For the first quarter, Costar expects revenue of approximately $196 million to $198 million and non-GAAP net income per share between $0.66 and $0.70.Management also anticipates full-year 2016 revenue of $830 million to $840 million, and non-GAAP net income per share in a range of $3.62 to $3.72 -- an increase of approximately 80% at the midpoint over 2015.""We believe our investments in Apartments.com and Apartment Finder in 2015 provide a strong platform for future revenue growth, and are additive to the consistent double-digit revenue growth contribution from our core business,"" said CFO Scott Wheeler. ""We expect the success of our integration and cost management efforts will deliver continued profit improvements in 2016.""Looking even further ahead, management reiterated its long-term revenue and margin guidance.""EBITDA more than doubled from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of 2015 while EBITDA margin for the fourth quarter of 2015 expanded to 29%,"" said Florance. ""We believe these strong results plainly demonstrate that we are on target to achieve our goal of $1 billion in revenue and 40% margin exiting 2018.""The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.In trading on Wednesday, shares of CoStar Group, Inc.

"Source: CoStar reported second quarter results after the market close today. The commercial real estate information provider delivered solid top-line growth and earnings that topped Wall Street's expectations, and also raised its revenue and profit outlook for 2015.Second-quarter revenue rose 16% year over year to $170.7 million.""Our strategic investments in the Apartments.com relaunch, our national advertising campaign and the National Apartment Association exposition in June have clearly paid off by fueling a dramatic acceleration of sales in the second quarter 2015,"" said Founder and CEO Andrew Florance in a press release.Yet EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, amortization, and depreciation) declined to a loss of $1.5 million in the second quarter, compared to a $37.6 million gain in the year ago period, as CoStar continues to invest heavily in marketing Apartments.com.Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes share-based compensation as well as certain acquisition-related and restructuring costs, declined 75% to $11.3 million. Adjusted net income also fell, declining to $2.4 million, or $0.08 per share, compared to $23.5 million, or $0.80 per share, in the second quarter of 2014. The $0.08 of EPS was, however, better than the $0.04 Wall Street was expecting.Fortunately, these investments appear to be paying off, with Apartments.com sales growing at an annualized pace of 58% over the last four months. In addition, Apartments.com experienced a 70% year-over-year increase in unique visitors during the second quarter, making it the most visited apartment listings site during that time by a wide margin. In fact, for the month of June, Apartments.com had more than three times the number of page views and 50% higher total time spent on its site than its next closest apartment site competitor.CoStar's  of Apartment Finder is also helping to widen its lead in multifamily listings.""We have already increased visits to that site by 135% year-over-year according to comScore,"" stated Florance in the earnings release. ""Apartment Finder is benefiting from our Apartments.com advertising campaign as we retarget Apartments.com visitors to ApartmentFinder.com, initiate aggressive digital marketing, and cross-sell our apartment listing sites -- Apartments.com, ApartmentFinder.com and ApartmentHomeLiving.com -- along with our information service CoStar Market Analytics.""On a company-wide basis, net bookings in the second quarter surged to $34 million, up 66% compared to first quarter of 2015 and 95% from the year-ago period. Management expects adjusted earnings per share of approximately $0.42 to $0.45 for the third quarter and $0.79 to $0.84 for the fourth quarter of 2015. That compares to analysts' estimates for $0.49 in Q3 and $0.78 in Q4, as per S&P Capital IQ.More importantly, CoStar raised its full-year revenue and earnings guidance. 2015 revenue is now expected to be in the range of $707 million to $712 million, with the top end of the range now $52 million higher than management's initial 2015 guidance forecast. And adjusted earnings per share are now projected to be in a range of $1.62 to $1.70, an increase of $0.03 at the midpoint compared to the CoStar's prior guidance.One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World Wide Web to bed.

"oStar Realty Information, Inc., a subsidiary of real estate research giant  , is suing Austin-based listings website and sharing platform RealMassive. The lawsuit alleges copyright infringement by the real estate listings company concerning CoStar's intellectual property.CoStar is seeking millions of dollars in damages and a permanent injunction against RealMassive and its senior executives, claiming that the company features CoStar's copyrighted photographs in listings posted on its site. The research firm has also submitted concrete evidence of the national-scale copyright violations to the court, including photos showed on RealMassive.com with the CoStar logo or watermark still on them.RealMassive has also used CoStar's photographs in its marketing materials, such as a print brochure and an online presentation. CoStar found over a 100 photographs that violated copyright laws within a span of just a few days. In all probability, RealMassive's alleged systematic theft has been conducted on a much larger scale, and the discovery process will shed light on the actual extent of the same.RealMassive launched an aggressive public relations and marketing program, exhibiting itself as a ""sharing"" platform, in which commercial property owners willingly share data about their properties with users of the site for free. However, a quick assessment of the site and its content reveals a platform of stolen content. In fact, in the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Austin, CoStar asserts that RealMassive is driven by a strategy built upon infringing proprietary content.RealMassive's founder and president, who is also the primary principal implicated in the lawsuit, Joshua McClure, has had a history of litigations. His previous company, Troopal Strategies, Inc. was sued in 2009 by Craigslist, which alleged that Troopal's software was designed to explicitly spam users and violate the terms of use of Craigslist. Subsequently, Troopal was held liable for $8.2 million in damages, and a permanent injunction was issued against the company and McClure.In April 2014, CoStar had filed a similar lawsuit against CompStak, alleging that some of CompStak's users had unlawfully shared and published CoStar's proprietary data. Subsequently, a judge ordered CompStak to disclose the identities of those users. After some time, CoStar dropped the case and did not take any further legal action.CoStar currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Other stocks that look promising and are worth considering now include IMS Health Holdings, Inc.  , Computer Task Group Inc.  and Barracuda Networks, Inc.  , all of which carry the same rank as CoStar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

ommercial real estate powerhouse  (  ) has decided to pump over $1 billion in aggregate over the next few years into its recently revamped rental site Apartments.com.The residential real estate space can potentially generate $550 million in annual revenue for CoStar in 10 years, and the company aims to dominate the rental portal space and build up interest in Apartments.com.CoStar, which owns the popular commercial listing site LoopNet, acquired Apartments.com for about $585 million last March. Since then, CoStar has invested about $80 million to update the site's technology. In its attempt to create a new-generation Internet listing service, CoStar has had over 400,000 rental properties researched and photographed, and has even chartered airplanes to review cities in search of information on new construction.The company has earmarked $100 million for an aggressive consumer marketing campaign for the site that will be unveiled next month. The campaign will star actor Jeff Goldblum as a quirky Silicon Valley executive publicizing the new Apartments.com as a game-changer for the space.CoStar's move is well timed as recent data shows that the share of U.S. citizens who rent rather than own property has steadily been increasing. Consequently, landlords are coughing up more dollars to advertise their property online. Per Kip Cassino of Borrell Associates Inc., a firm that tracks advertising spend, landlords will shell out around $1.5 billion for advertising online this year, compared with just $630 million last year.Sure enough, competition is intensifying in the fragmented industry as rental sites scramble to rake in the marketing dollars. Apartments.com will have to conquer sites like ForRent.com, Apartment Guide, Rent.com, ApartmentFinder.com, and Seattle-based Zillow, a fast-growing competitor. Zillow is also eyeing the top spot in the space, as evidenced by its recent acquisition of Trulia, further boosting its growing rentals business.However, whether Apartments.com can generate enough revenues to justify CoStar's heavy spending on the site remains a matter of concern for investors. Apart from competition, there are substantial risks inherent in executing the company's strategies, which could potentially impair CoStar's profitability. CoStar will release its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2014 today, after the market closes. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter currently stands at 73 cents per share.CoStar presently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). Some better-ranked stocks in the information technology space include CDK Global, Inc. (  ), CDW Corp. (  ) and Fair Isaac Corp.

 (  ) was a big mover last session, as the company saw its shares rise around 6% on the day. The upside came after the company reported first-quarter loss of 3 cents per share, excluding non-recurring items, 2 cents narrower than analyst estimates of 5 cents. The news led to far more shares changing hands than in a normal session resulting in solid volume. This reverses the recent trend of the company, as the stock is now trading above the volatile price range of $4.60 to $5.39 in the past one-month time frame.The company has seen one positive revision in the past one month, while its Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the same time frame. Yesterday's price action is encouraging though, so make sure to keep a close watch on this firm in the near future.EarthLink Holdings currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Another favorably-placed stock in the same industry is CoStar Group Inc.

hares of  plunged nearly 6% in yesterday's after-hours trade following the company reported wider-than-expected loss for the first quarter of 2015. The company's adjusted loss per share of 18 cents was wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 15 cents loss. Moreover, it compared unfavorably with the year-ago quarter's breakeven results.On a GAAP-basis, the company posted a net loss per share of 27 cents compared with a loss of 4 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.The company's first-quarter revenues of $20.1 million were marginally higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20 million. However, it surged nearly 20 times year over year from revenues of $0.9 million reported in the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year growth was mainly driven by the acquisitions of Overland Storage and V3 Systems along with strategic alliances and higher number of deal wins.The company's non-GAAP gross profit increased to $6.6 million from $0.5 million in the year-ago quarter, mainly driven by strong top-line growth. However, as a percentage of revenues, non-GAAP gross profit decreased to 32.7% from 56.9% in the year-ago quarter.Operating expenses came in at $13.6 million versus $1.3 million in the first quarter of 2014. The company posted adjusted loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $6.1 million as against earnings of $0.04 million reported in the year-ago quarter.Sphere 3D ended the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $4.4 million compared with $4.3 million in the previous quarter. The company has a long-term debt obligation of $19.5 million at quarter-end.Sphere 3D started 2015 on a soft note incurring wider-than-expected loss in the first quarter. However, we are encouraged with the company's robust top line which gained from acquisitions, strategic alliances and higher number of deal wins.We believe that the company's strategy of growing through acquisitions will drive its revenues. Moreover, its sustained focus on product innovation and strategic alliances will continue to help it in winning more deals.Nonetheless, increased investment may impact the company's near-term profitability.Currently, Sphere 3D carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Apart from Sphere 3D, other stocks worth considering in the technology sector are Barracuda Networks Inc.  , Computer Task Group Inc.  and CoStar Group Inc.  .

"oStar Realty Information, Inc., a subsidiary of real estate research giant  , is suing Austin-based listings website and sharing platform RealMassive. The lawsuit alleges copyright infringement by the real estate listings company concerning CoStar's intellectual property.CoStar is seeking millions of dollars in damages and a permanent injunction against RealMassive and its senior executives, claiming that the company features CoStar's copyrighted photographs in listings posted on its site. The research firm has also submitted concrete evidence of the national-scale copyright violations to the court, including photos showed on RealMassive.com with the CoStar logo or watermark still on them.RealMassive has also used CoStar's photographs in its marketing materials, such as a print brochure and an online presentation. CoStar found over a 100 photographs that violated copyright laws within a span of just a few days. In all probability, RealMassive's alleged systematic theft has been conducted on a much larger scale, and the discovery process will shed light on the actual extent of the same.RealMassive launched an aggressive public relations and marketing program, exhibiting itself as a ""sharing"" platform, in which commercial property owners willingly share data about their properties with users of the site for free. However, a quick assessment of the site and its content reveals a platform of stolen content. In fact, in the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Austin, CoStar asserts that RealMassive is driven by a strategy built upon infringing proprietary content.RealMassive's founder and president, who is also the primary principal implicated in the lawsuit, Joshua McClure, has had a history of litigations. His previous company, Troopal Strategies, Inc. was sued in 2009 by Craigslist, which alleged that Troopal's software was designed to explicitly spam users and violate the terms of use of Craigslist. Subsequently, Troopal was held liable for $8.2 million in damages, and a permanent injunction was issued against the company and McClure.CoStar currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

"oStar's big marketing push for its Apartments.com website is paying dividends. Image: Apartments.com.Online real-estate information has been a hot niche in e-commerce recently, and  has become one of the key providers of data, analytical tools, and marketplace tools in the industry. With its having started a huge marketing campaign earlier this year, CoStar Group investors were already prepared coming into Wednesday afternoon's first-quarter financial report to see the company's earnings plunge from year-ago levels. Yet the rewards of higher revenue proved to be worth the cost in many investors' eyes, as the company exceeded the hefty sales growth that shareholders had hoped to see. Let's take a closer look at CoStar Group and what the rest of 2015 might bring for the company. CoStar Group proved the concept behind its Apartments.com launch and marketing campaign with a big jump in sales related to the service. Overall, revenue jumped 34% to $159 million, exceeding the ambitious targets that investors had set for the company. The cost of the marketing efforts that drove those sales gains ate into profits, however, with adjusted net income falling 45% and earnings coming in at just $0.34 per share, down by half from last year's first quarter. Nevertheless, the results were more than a dime per share  than investors had expected, as CoStar had made its strategic vision clear well in advance of its report.Digging into more detail, CoStar's numbers reflected the success of its recent campaign. Net sales of subscription services on annual contracts jumped 10%, and sales of core CoStar services climbed at a 20% pace. Companywide, net bookings soared 50% to $21 million, with Apartments.com seeing nine times the bookings it did this time last year and producing almost two-thirds more leads. Traffic levels to Apartments.com more than doubled to 15 million visits and 7 million unique visitors, sending the site to the top spot among apartment-listing websites and vaulting its mobile application into the lead as well.CEO Andrew Florance couldn't have been happier with the early results of the Apartments.com rollout, pointing to the success in the first month following the launch of the new site and marketing campaign as well as the positive results on the rest of its business. ""We are having great success selling CoStar information nand analytics combined with marketing on Apartments.com to property managers and owners,"" Florance said, and ""we sold more net property additions in March 2015 than all of the preceding year.""Source: CoStar Group. Interestingly, after having applied pressure to the rest of the industry, CoStar made a big acquisition of a rival in the space. Along with its latest report, CoStar said today that it would buy the parent company of Apartment Finder for $170 million in cash, with the net effect of adding to the company's exposure to multifamily residential property. Putting ApartmentFinder.com together with Apartments.com could add to CoStar's lead-generation capabilities, and Florance touted the low valuation on Apartment Finder as making the deal even more attractive.All the positive news on the corporate front led CoStar to boost its guidance for the full year. CoStar now expects to see revenue of $688 million to $698 million, with $30 million to $35 million of that coming from Apartment Finder. The company also boosted its earnings guidance by $0.03 per share to a range of $1.98 to $2.08 per share, with CoStar expecting investment in Apartment Finder to offset any added income from the purchase.What investors need to watch out for, though, is the expectation of lower earnings for the second quarter. CFO Brian Radecki explained that most of the reason earnings exceeded expectations in the first quarter is that a portion of the expected costs of its marketing campaign got pushed into the second quarter. With the primary moving season for apartments coming this quarter, investors shouldn't be surprised to see weak results in the hopes of a bigger payoff down the road.CoStar has aggressively gone after growth opportunities in the market, and at least so far, those efforts appear to be having a positive impact on its business. The coming months will be critical for CoStar to establish itself as the predominant player in the important apartment-information business and to prove that it can monetize its leadership position to justify the money it has invested toward that end.

 (  ) reported lackluster third-quarter fiscal 2015 results with GAAP earnings of $4.2 million or 5 cents per share, down from $15.1 million or 20 cents per share in the year-ago period. The year-over-year decrease in earnings was primarily due to the relatively poor performance of the IT Infrastructure Management business and other expenses.The company reported adjusted earnings of 23 cents per share versus 27 cents in the year-ago quarter. The recurring earnings (with stock-based compensation adjustments) were 16 cents per share missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 24 cents.Total revenue for third-quarter fiscal 2015 came in at $260.4 million, down 3.1% year over year due to a decline in IT Infrastructure Management revenues. Revenues for the reported quarter well exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $254 million.By segments, sales from the Marketing and Data Services segment increased 1% year over year to $208.2 million. IT Infrastructure Management Services segment revenues were down 16% to $52.2 million.Operating income for the reported quarter declined to $5.2 million from $19.3 million in the prior-year quarter due to expenses associated with business separation and transformation activities, non-cash compensation, acquired intangible asset amortization, and lower IT Infrastructure Management revenue.Acxiom signed 25 new Audience Operating Systems (AOS) and Live Ramp agreements during the quarter, bringing its client roster tally to approximately 195 at quarter end. On a combined basis, AOS and LiveRamp revenue was $21 million in the reported quarter. Gross media spend enabled by the AOS platform was $73 million, up 265% from the year-ago period.LiveRamp also expanded its strategic partnership with Datalogix, which runs through the end of 2017.During the quarter, Acxiom inked several marketing and data services agreements as well as renewals with a major telecommunications company and a leading insurance firm.Acxiom ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $126.9 million and long-term debt of $262.8 million.Net cash provided by operating activities aggregated $42.7 million during the quarter compared with $63.8 million in the prior-year period. Free cash flow to equity stood at $1 million for the trailing 12-month period compared with $103 million in the prior-year period due to changes in working capital, cash restructuring and other business expenditure.During the reported quarter, Acxiom did not repurchase any shares. Since Aug 2011, the company has repurchased 12.9 million shares or about 16% of the outstanding stock for $202 million under the share repurchase program.For fiscal 2015 Axciom reiterated its guidance. Revenues are expected to be down approximately 4% year over year, driven by the impact of lost IT infrastructure management customers and the exit of analog paper survey business in Europe. The company expects AOS and Live Ramp to generate approximately $60 million in revenues in fiscal 2015.Earning per share are expected in the range of 73 cents to 78 cents. This guidance includes the impact of the LiveRamp acquisition but excludes the impact of unusual items, non-cash compensation and acquired intangible asset amortization.Acxiom currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

" reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2015 earnings per ADS from continuing operations of 44 cents, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate but 2.3% above 43 cents earned in the year-ago quarter.The rise in the bottom line is mainly attributable to the company's profitable Renew-New strategy that has knowledge-based learning at its core. Moreover, the company's relentless investments in innovation have contributed toward improving relationships with client as well as strengthening its capabilities.For fiscal 2015, the company's earnings per ADS came in at $1.76 reflecting a 15% increase compared with the year-ago tally of $1.53.Total revenue for the reported quarter came in at $2,159 million, up 3.2% year over year. However, it fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,248 million.On a sequential basis, healthy performance of Finacle and Edge suite acted as major drivers of revenue growth. Also, the company's improved operating efficiency supplemented the revenues.However, increased commoditization of the outsourcing business proved to be a headwind for the company, adversely affecting the pricing levels. This, in turn, hurt the top-line growth. Moreover, sluggish revenue growth was mainly the result of weak performance of the service business.For fiscal 2015, revenues came in at $8,711 million, up 5.6% from fiscal 2014.Infosys recorded an operating profit of $555 million compared with $534 million in the prior-year quarter, an increase of 3.9%. Also, operating margin for fourth-quarter fiscal 2015 increased 20 basis points (bps) to 25.7% from 25.5% in the year-ago quarter. Net profit after tax deductions came in at $498 million, up 2.3% year over year.For fiscal 2015, Infosys recorded an operating profit of $2,258 million compared with $1,979 million in fiscal 2014. Meanwhile, operating margin expanded 190 bps to 25.8% from 23.9% a year ago.Infosys reported strong growth in regions like North America, where fourth-quarter fiscal 2015 sales rose 3% over the year-ago tally. Though Europe accounted for 23.1% of sales in the quarter, the figure inched down 0.9% from the year-ago tally.Other two geographic segments, India and 'Rest of the World,' experienced both sequential and yearly declines. While India's revenues in fourth-quarter fiscal 2015 edged down 0.1%, that from the Rest of the World fell 0.8% from the prior-year tally.Revenues in the Insurance, Banking and Financial services (""FSI"") segment grew 0.1% sequentially, while that in the Manufacturing segment (""MFG"") division improved 0.8%. However, revenues in the Retail and Life Sciences (""RCL"") and Energy, Utilities, Communications & Services (""ECS"") divisions declined 0.3% and 0.6% year over year, respectively.Infosys maintained a strong liquidity position with cash & cash equivalents of $4,859 million as of Mar 31, 2015, versus $4,331 million a year ago.Ushering in good news for investors, Infosys increased its dividend payout ratio to 50% of post-tax profits, likely to be effective from fiscal 2016. Initially, the dividend payout ratio was 40% of post-tax profits.Infosys provided revenue guidance for fiscal 2016 in the range of 10-12% on a constant currency basis. However, considering the impact of currency change, revenues are anticipated to grow in the range of 6.2-8.2%.Infosys experienced a challenging quarter in terms of foreign currency fluctuations and increasing commoditization of outsourcing business. Nevertheless, despite these challenges, the company remains confident that the Panaya acquisition will help it enhance market share in the cloud business.Also, the company has signed an agreement to acquire Kallidus Inc., apart from being in talks to buy Airviz, which will help it strengthen its position in retail and personal health monitoring markets, respectively. At the same time, Infosys holds a strong commitment toward improving its corporate social responsibility, which, we believe will help it obtain a competitive edge over its peers.Infosys currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks include CoStar Group Inc.  , EPAM Systems, Inc.  and Fair Isaac Corp.  . All three stocks hold a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

hares of  (  ), the leading provider of information and marketing services to the commercial real estate industry, contributed to performance in the fourth quarter. We attribute this to continued robust financial performance, early synergy generation from the acquisition of Apartments.com, and better relative performance from higher multiple growth stocks over the ownership period.

 (  ), a leading provider of commercial real estate information, analytics and marketing services, re-launched its website Apartments.com in a new avatar, in an attempt to carve a niche for itself in the online apartment industry. The re-launched website assures radical improvement for renters who search for apartments, condos and rental homes online.The new website provides detailed information on apartments, along with actual availabilities and rents, and covers more apartments than any othe similar website. The site also boasts innovative software tools that will aid renters in finding the apartments that are optimally suited for their needs.The re-launch follows comprehensive research on the apartment industry in the U.S. and will capitalize on CoStar's massive multi-family database that spans over 450,000 apartment properties. Proprietary software will constantly update site data by scouring around 40,000 apartment websites daily for the latest information. Also, the website will have direct access to inventory systems of property management companies.Market research shows that current generation websites that offer apartment search facility fall far behind in meeting consumers' needs. They have very limited information and make the process of finding a suitable apartment very cumbersome for renters. With its vast pool of in-depth data on apartment buildings, condos, townhouses and single family home, the rejuvenated Apartments.com is well poised to capture a considerable chunk of the prospective market.The re-launch is CoStar's effort to exploit the huge opportunities presented by the Multifamily asset class, which is estimated to be worth over $3 trillion. CoStar is also planning to launch an aggressive, wide-ranging marketing campaign this year, which is expected to reach 95% of consumers within the 18-49 age group. The campaign, which will cost $75 million over and above Apartments.com's 2014 annualized marketing spend, will lead to substantial brand awareness and generate sizeable site traffic.With Apartments.com, CoStar expects to reach its target of generating over $550 million in sales and $250 million in adjusted EBITDA annually within the next ten years. It also reiterated its overall target of generating $1 billion in revenue with adjusted EBITDA margin of 40% in 2018.CoStar acquired Apartments.com in Apr 2014. The company has several sites catering to the commercial property market and rural land and farm properties, including LoopNet, CityFeet, BizBuySell and LandsofAmerica. Adding Apartment.com to its portfolio, designated CoStar as a comprehensive commercial real estate solutions company.CoStar is scheduled to release its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2014 on Feb 25, 2015. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter currently stands at 73 cents per share.CoStar presently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

"ource: CoStar Group.The Internet has transformed every aspect of modern life, and even the most well-established industries have found ways to adapt their business models to online possibilities. Real estate is one of those areas, and  has built its business around providing commercial real-estate information, analytics, and marketplaces using online tools and technology. Coming into Wednesday evening's fourth-quarter financial report, CoStar Group investors were increasingly optimistic about the company's future prospects, having bid shares back up toward their early 2014 highs. In its report, CoStar Group posted exceptionally strong growth that came as a surprise even to the most optimistic of investors. Moreover, with a key new initiative just having taken place, CoStar Group has positioned itself for even more growth in 2015. Let's look at CoStar Group's results with an eye toward seeing how it plans to move forward this year and beyond. CoStar Group's main results were unequivocally positive. Sales for the fourth quarter jumped 35% to $156.1 million, surpassing even the expectations among investors for 33% revenue growth. More of those sales also made it to the bottom line, with adjusted net income climbing 34% and producing adjusted earnings of $0.93 per share, a nickel more than those following the stock had projected.Looking more closely at CoStar's numbers, the company saw solid results on several fronts. The company's expanded sales force helped it hit a new record for net new sales at a rate of $17.3 million on an annualized basis during the fourth quarter. For the CoStar information services segment, annualized net new sales climbed 26% from the year-ago quarter. Meanwhile, the company's LoopNet core online marketplace also posted considerable growth, with revenue climbing 20% year over year.Source: CoStar Group.For the most part, CoStar remains focused on its core domestic market, getting all but about 4% of its revenue from its North American operations. Yet the international business also grew during the quarter, with revenue gains of almost 8% helping to push full-year international sales up by 16%.CEO Andrew Florance was happy about the results, terming 2014 ""an exceptional year for CoStar Group"" and citing its gains in revenue and operating income. Florance attributed much of the company's success to its sales force, which has benefited from the money that CoStar spent to expand its ranks. Yet the real news that CoStar seems most excited about is its launch earlier this month of its newly revamped Apartments.com website. CoStar reported seeing big gains in organic traffic as a result of the new site, which has better search tools and considerably more available listings for users to look at. At the same time, CoStar spent a lot of time working to optimize the new site so that search engines would list its offerings among top results. As Florance noted, CoStar now has ""a total of 1,407 keywords in the top five organic positions [on Google], or 47% more than our second closest competitor."" Strength in SEO should help drive traffic and make Apartments.com a more useful site for prospective renters and property owners alike. Moreover, the company has high hopes for the website, with projections of as much as $550 million in annual revenue and $250 million in adjusted operating earnings from Apartments.com within the next decade.Source: CoStar Group.With CoStar having given guidance for 2015 just last week, the financial report only had to reaffirm its previous numbers. CoStar expects to bring in sales of $655 million to $660 million in 2015, with adjusted earnings per share of $1.95 to $2.05. Those figures represent a considerable drop in adjusted net income, but that stems from the massive $75 million investment that CoStar expects to make in promoting and marketing Apartments.com. The company said that those expenditures alone would cost the company about $1.45 per share in earnings, but Florance believes that ""this investment will generate massive brand awareness and site traffic for Apartments.com and quickly position [it] as the #1 destination for renters.""Looking forward, CoStar Group clearly has a broad-based strategy for expanding its reach to incorporate both commercial and residential real-estate information and related services. With such a huge potential market, CoStar will inevitably face strong competition. Yet the rewards of success could be so large that investors can't help but be excited about the prospects for CoStar Group realizing its full potential.

fter doubling in 2013, real estate information and marketing services provider CoStar Group, Inc. (  ) gave back gains in the second quarter. CoStar shares were negatively impacted by sudden and significant multiple compression in high growth, highly valued stocks, which sold off acutely early in the quarter. CoStar also completed an equity offering in the quarter, which we expect will be used to finance accretive M&A over the next six months. We continue to maintain our conviction in CoStar. (Neal Rosenberg)The Fund added to its position in CoStar Group, Inc.,the leading provider of information and marketing services to the $50 trillion commercial real estate (CRE) industry. The company has spent 25 years building a proprietary CRE database, which has grown to include information on over four million properties and nine billion square feet of listings. The company monetizes its data through subscriptions to analytical tools, which are deeply integrated into clients' workflows. Ongoing investments in R&D and a doubling of the sales force should allow CoStar to sell an expanded array of tools to new and existing customers. Additionally, the acquisitions of LoopNet and Apartments.com extend CoStar's reach into marketing services and multi- family lead generation, creating vast new opportunities and offering the company dramatic revenue and cost synergies. Finally, the company's high fixed cost base creates significant operating leverage, which we believe should help drive margins to above 40%.

Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Noteworthy ETF Outflows: IWO, ATHN, AYI, CSGP@2014-04-08@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/noteworthy-etf-outflows-iwo-athn-ayi-csgp-2014-04-08

ooking today at week-over-week shares outstanding changes among the universe of ETFs covered at  , one standout is the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (Symbol: IWM) where we have detected an approximate $1.2 billion dollar inflow -- that's a 5.0% increase week over week in outstanding units (from 212,600,000 to 223,300,000). Among the largest underlying components of IWM, in trading today CoStar Group, Inc. (Symbol: CSGP) is down about 0.2%, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc (Symbol: ALNY) is off about 2.5%, and Middleby Corp. (Symbol: MIDD) is lower by about 0.9%. The chart below shows the one year price performance of IWM, versus its 200 day moving average:Looking at the chart above, IWM's low point in its 52 week range is $88.79 per share, with $117.37 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $113.83. Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@iShares Russell 2000 ETF Experiences Big Inflow@2014-02-14@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ishares-russell-2000-etf-experiences-big-inflow-2014-02-14

" -  is one of the newest gurus introduced to the exclusive list of investment gurus followed by GuruFocus. Gordon founded Daruma Capital Management in 1995, after having worked with Valenzuela Capital Management as well as the small-cap guru  and his fund, Royce & Associates. Currently  is the CEO and CIO of her fund Daruma Asset Management.Mariko Gordon started Daruma in 1995 with absolutely no assets under management, but as she called it, ""a clear goal."" Her goal was to build an investment firm where the business of money management would never interfere with her calling as a portfolio manager.Daruma Capital Management is named after a fifth-century monk who reached China after a treacherous three years at sea and continued on to become the founder of Ch'an (Zen) Buddhism. Gordon explains that her fund is named this because Zen Buddhism and the successful investing draw many parallels including the importance of ""separating illusion from reality, nonattachment to emotions and ideas, self-discipline and embracing impermanence.""Daruma Asset Management only runs concentrated portfolios with no less than 25 and no more than 35 stocks. The fund focuses on this range because they believe that if they don't own enough stocks the positions become supersized and their portfolio becomes too volatile. They also believe that if they own too many stocks, then their returns can be mediocre at best. Follow the attached link to read more about Daruma's portfolio attributes.Daruma is completely owned by the company's employees, so they note that their own personal gains and successes rely on the long-term investment results. In 2010 the fund closed their small-cap product at $1.5 billion in assets and opened their SMid-cap portfolio in April 2010.The fund's website also highlights nine promises to its clients concerning their management style:1. We will not sacrifice performance on the altar of asset growth.2. We live and die by our stock picks.3. We will strive constantly to improve our investment and business practices.4. We will adhere to strict rules of stock selection and portfolio construction that limit downside risk.5. We will monitor every holding against a written thesis with milestones and risk factors.6. We will act with the courage of our convictions, yet will change our minds quickly when the facts dictate.7. We will maintain the same intensity and hunger for excess return over time.8. We will share profits and equity with our colleagues to foster stable returns over the long term.9. We will be available to explain investment performance in depth.Daruma describes its investing philosophy the best on its website: ""The best time to buy is not just when a stock offers good value, but when we can clearly define what will drive the price higher-in most cases better-than-expected sales, earnings or cash flow growth."" While this is the philosophy they focus on, Gordon and Daruma also note the importance of a concentrated portfolio. The firm's website highlights in multiple places that the Daruma team will invest in any market in which they can find 25 to 35 stocks that hold a strong potential to outperform.The fund which invests in high-conviction Small- and SMid-cap portfolios manages $2.3 billion for public and corporate pension plans, endowments, foundations and individual.

[ Enlarge Image ]In Up and Down Markets:As of Sept. 30, 2013, in the months which the Russell 2000 was up 5% or more, the fund's valuation discipline meant that Daruma lagged roughly 63% of the time. On average, the fund trailed by 68 basis points and outpaced the Russell 2000 only 18 out of 48 months since its inception on July 28, 1995.Also as of Sept. 30, Daruma shows its ability to do exceedingly well in the big down markets. The fund outpaced the Russell 2000 in 28 of the 35 months that the Russell was down 5% or more, meaning that the fund outpaced the index 80% of the time.

e reiterate our long-term Neutral recommendation on  (  ). The company reported mixed financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. While earnings per share were exactly in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate, revenues slightly fell below.Amdocs is well positioned in the market as carriers sell bundled and converged IP-based network solutions to their subscribers. These services include video, wireless, fixed-mobile converged and high-speed broadband Internet access solutions. Amdocs offers integrated customer management systems, which are essential for carriers to prevent customer churn. Huge opportunities exist for Amdocs as more telecom companies started deploying 3G/4G networks.The company has the largest customer base and the broadest product line in the industry, including a full suite of end-to-end solutions for both Business Support Systems (BSS) and Operations Support Systems (OSS). Business in North America was comparatively strong. Alongside, the emerging Asia Pacific markets are witnessing nearly double-digit revenue growth.Nevertheless, Amdocs is exposed to the global economic downturn, particularly those events that affect the telecommunications industry. The macroeconomic scenario is yet to recover completely. In addition, delay in business transformation on the part of the carriers may reduce capital spending. Economic and political uncertainty in Europe may jeopardize the company's financials, going forward. Furthermore, as the company is operating globally, it is also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk.Amdocs currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

AOL has been trending higher since October of 2012, pausing towards the end of the year to consolidate around before continuing its march higher in early February. While it hasn't had the upward thrust of some of its competitors like CoStar Group () or ValueClick Inc (), AOL is still a positive technical setup.Currently, the stock is sitting comfortably on its 50-day moving average at .15. There is resistance overhead around , which AOL failed to break out of in mid-February, late-March, and again in the second week of April. While this isn't great for its long-term prospects, a target for a short term trade is still +4.85% from current prices, which is not too shabby a gain. With some support here, and a nice cushion on the 50-day moving average, AOL looks poised to make a run back to very soon. So, at current prices, we would be buyers of AOL for a short term trade with an immediate +4.85% upside.At the current price (~.15).AOL Inc.

nformation technology services provider  's (  ) second-quarter fiscal 2014 adjusted earnings of 20 cents per share marginally missed the year-ago tally and the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.Net income for the reported quarter dropped significantly to $9.8 million or 13 cents per share compared with $16.5 million or 21 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year decline in reported earnings was primarily attributable to high operating expenses.Total revenue for second quarter fiscal 2014 came in at $276.3 million, down 0.4% year over year owing to dismal performances in two of the three segments.By segments, the  segment sales improved 1.2% year over year to $201.0 million in the reported quarter. IT Infrastructure  segment revenues dipped 4.7% to $66.8 million. Revenues from  segment decreased 3.4% year over year to $8.5 million in the reported quarter.Operating margin for the reported quarter dropped to 7.1% from 10.9% in the year-ago quarter due to lower margin from Marketing and Data Services segment, which accounts for bulk of the revenues. With reduced margin levels, Acxiom intends to trim its operating costs by approximately $20 million to $30 million within the next 6-12 months. However, this would not entail any reduction in ongoing investments for innovative products and services.Marketing and Data Services operating margin was 8.0% compared with 11.2% in the previous-year quarter. The IT Infrastructure Management segment reported an operating margin of 17.9%, up from 12.2% in the year-ago quarter, while the respective figures for the Other Services segment were 2.6% and (6.2%).During the reported quarter, the company launched a new Acxiom AOS (Audience Operating System) - the first of its kind cloud-based platform that delivers data and insights at marketers' fingertips for a one-to-one marketing at scale and revolutionizes customer experiences.At the same time, Acxiom introduced AboutTheData.com - the first online consumer portal that allows individuals to view and update core data elements that are part of the information Acxiom makes available to advertisers for digital marketing.Acxiom ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $216.6 million. Long-term debt came in at $230.7 million.Net cash provided by operating activities aggregated $40.5 million during the reported quarter compared with $39.2 million in the prior-year period. Operating cash flow was $170 million for the trailing twelve-month period, compared with $176 million in the year-ago period. Free cash flow to equity stood at $69 million for the trailing twelve-month period, compared with $159 million for the prior-year period.Subsequent to the quarter-end, Acxiom refinanced its $300 million term loan and a $300 million undrawn revolving credit facility, both maturing in Oct 2018. The proceeds of the term loan were used to repay debt under its existing $215 million term loan and for other general corporate purposes.In the reported quarter, Acxiom repurchased 900,000 shares for $22.7 million. Since Aug 2011, the company has repurchased 12 million shares for $179 million. Acxiom's total share repurchase authorization is worth $200 million.Concurrent with the earnings release, management slightly modified its guidance for fiscal 2014. For fiscal 2014, management expects revenues to dip marginally (versus flat projections earlier) and earnings to remain flat (unchanged from before). Management opined that fiscal 2013 was a transition period for the company, wherein it invested considerably for new product innovation and strengthening its client base. Acxiom expects to continue with these initiatives in fiscal 2014, thereby reaping synergistic benefits in future.Acxiom currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Other stocks in the industry such as  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ), each with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), are worth considering at the moment.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Acxiom's Q2 Adj.

ast week,  (  ) received a contract from The National Institutes of Health (NIH) to compete with another 53 companies for task orders. This contract was awarded by The NIH under the Chief Information Officers-Solutions and Partners 3 (CIO-SP3) contract vehicle.This indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract awarded to the 54 companies including Unisys is expected to be worth $20 billion over a period of 10 years. The ten categories of task orders Unisys can compete for include federal health mission IT support services, federal CIO office IT support services, services for supporting collection etc.The CIO-SP3 deal was not the first award offered by The NIH to Unisys. Its previous CIO-SP3 agreement expired recently. Hence, the present superseding CIO-SP3 contract avers that The NIH affirms a lot of faith and confidence in Unisys' solutions through such long-term ventures.Such continual contract wins have become a major growth driver for boosting sales incipiently for the company. On April 24, 2012, Unisys declared financial results of its first quarter in 2012, whereby total revenue surged almost 2% annually to reach $928.4 million. We believe that the company needs these major panegyrics in the form of contract wins and extensions in order to post even stronger results in its upcoming quarters.Unisys should also keep a wary eye out for competitor advances in the industry. Big players in this regard include  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ).The company currently retains a Zacks #3 Rank, which translates into a short-term 'Hold' rating.

 (  ) has seen consensus estimates fall meaningfully lower for both 2013 and 2014 following a rare earnings miss on February 27. It is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Despite the negative earnings momentum, shares still trade at a premium on a forward price to earnings and price to cash flow basis. This doesn't bode well for shares over the next several weeks.CoStar Group provides information, analytics and marketing services for the commercial real estate market.CoStar reported fourth quarter results on February 27. Adjusted earnings per share came in at 33 cents, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 cents. Revenue rose 51% to $100.1 million, but this was driven in large part by an acquisition.Following the Q4 earnings miss, analysts revised their estimates meaningfully lower for both 2013 and 2014. This sent the stock to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). The 2013 Zacks Consensus Estimate is now $1.71, down from $1.80 thirty days ago. And the 2014 consensus is now $2.28, down from $2.57. You can see this sharp decline in the company's 'Price & Consensus' chart:Despite the negative earnings momentum, shares of CoStar still trade at a frothy 56x 12-month forward earnings, which is a significant premium to the industry median of 17x. Its price to cash flow ratio of 63 is also above its the peer group median of 13.CoStar Group also carries a long-term 'Underperform' Zacks Recommendation.With negative earnings momentum and premium valuation, investors may want to consider avoiding CoStar Group for now.

ast week,  ( ACXM) announced that it has stepped up its share repurchase plan to $150 million now. This was done with the clear intent of bolstering investor returns. Acxiom's share repurchase program which started in August 2011, has bought back about 6.1 million shares since then for around $72 million. This accounts for nearly 7% of its total shares outstanding in the market.The company's incipient proactive advances towards returning value to investors accrues from its strong cash flow generation ability. Cash flow from operating activities came in at around $229.4 million for the fiscal year 2012 and Acxiom spent around $66 million to repurchase a total of 5.6 million shares during that time.Looking ahead, management projects its earnings per share (EPS) to be within 55 cents to 65 cents for fiscal 2013. Strong product innovations, investment plans and management restructuring are expected to be the major highlights of the upcoming fiscal year for Acxiom.However, there are big players prevalent in the industry that the company should always remain wary of. Ominous rivals in this regard include  ( UIS),  ( CSGP) and  (  ).The Zacks Consensus Estimates for the first quarter and fiscal 2013 stand at 10 cents per share and 61 cents per share, respectively. We currently have a long-term recommendation of 'Neutral' for the company's stock.

e reiterate our Neutral recommendation on  (  ). The company's continuous contract wins and incipient buy-back activities are likely to partially neutralize the effects of the weak economic condition and tough competition prevailing in the industry.The company's diversified product offerings such as AbiliTec Digital, InfoBase-X, Customer Data Integration (CDI) services and customer recognition software provide a competitive edge in this industry, which includes big players such as  (  ),  (  ), and  (  ).The company has taken several strategic initiatives to improve its core competency areas through heavy investments and product launches, which are perceived to be its key growth drivers. The company's recent prestigious contract win from Mindshare and its association with Yahoo!7 are expected to boost business going forward.The company is continuously expanding its operations across many regions including Brazil, South Korea and Norway for enhancing its long-term margins. Going forward, it is likely to be highly benefited by the well-diversified business portfolio in terms of geographies, products and markets.Acxiom repurchased a total of 2.4 million shares worth $33 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2013. Additionally, since August, 2011, it bought back 8.1 million shares worth approximately $100 million. The buying back of common shares is likely to be one of the best strategic moves, which will help enhance investor confidence.Although Acxiom's intent and advances towards meeting long-term goals are impressive, we are, however, concerned about the overall economic turmoil and inflationary pressures, which might have detrimental effects on the company. As the company earned a huge portion of revenue from the financial sector, the current slowdown in the financial services is expected to adversely impact its overall performances.Acxiom highly depends on its AbiliTec software technology. Consequently, the company has to advance its technological services in order to compete in the industry, which appears to be costly.We observed quite a few changes in Acxiom's top-level management. Such management shifts may have a pervasive impact on the company's overall functioning. It takes time for a company to stabilize after such important changes and, therefore, it would be advisable for investors at this point not to purchase its shares before assessing the performance of the company.The company projects earnings per share (EPS) to lie within a range of 60 cents - 65 cents bearing onuses of product innovation strategies for the upcoming fiscal 2013. The company also anticipates that its revenue from continuing operations will either remain flat or decline marginally during the fiscal 2013. Revenues are also projected to be down by 5% in the second quarter of fiscal 2013 owing to the low yields in Acxiom's IT Infrastructure Management and Other Services segments.Hence, until the situation improves, we consider it wise to remain on the sidelines. In the short run, the stock bears a Zacks #2 Rank, which translates, into a short-term 'Buy' rating.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Acxiom Retains Neutral Rec - Analyst Blog@2012-09-17@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/acxiom-retains-neutral-rec-analyst-blog-2012-09-17
arlier this week,  (  ) declared that after three months of hard work, it has finally launched the first ever home-printed baggage tag solutions at Billund Airport in Denmark for international passengers. The solution is designed to render the passenger check-in process simpler and more convenient.The Internet check-in application and local check-in assistant program had been previously installed successfully by Unisys through its passenger facilitation solution program started in 2007 at Billund Airport. With the implementation of this bag tag solution, the company demonstrates its continued interest towards ameliorating overall standards of performance enhancing customer experiences.In today's world, time is money. Everyone is looking for means and ways to reduce even the slightest time lags at any juncture. Gone are those days when passengers would wait in queues to first avail paper tags, then tie them to their baggage items and then go for the final drop off at a bag drop counter. With the implementation of this new system, baggage tags can be printed by passengers even before setting foot at the airport.The system has been designed to operate smoothly with a separate line for pre-tagged baggage items at the airport. The printed boarding pass contains the number of items for check-in, which shall be presented at the counter along with the printed bag tag which would go inside a plastic bag tag holder provided at the airport itself. With this system, passengers can save valuable time at the airport, an aspect of burgeoning importance globally.There still exist companies, however, which threaten Unisys' formidable industry position at all times. These include big players such as  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ).The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter of 2012 and for fiscal 2012 is 48 cents per share and $2.90 per share, respectively.

e reiterate our Neutral recommendation on  (  ). A proactive stance on advancing the company's core competency areas and incipient buy-back activities are likely to partially neutralize the effects of the weak economic condition and ominous competition prevailing in the industry.Acxiom has achieved a formidable position in the field of marketing services and technology. The company's diversified product offerings such as AbiliTec Digital, InfoBase-X, Customer Data Integration (CDI) services and customer recognition software provide Acxiom a high competitive edge in this industry which includes big players such as  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ).One aspect which has forever been an integral part of Acxiom's total approach is its desire to return optimum value to its shareholders through buy back activities. The company has already repurchased 6.1 million shares at nearly $71 million till now in its fiscal year 2012. In addition, Acxiom has also recently declared that it has raised the amount pertaining to its share repurchase plan to a total of $150 million. Hence, on the basis of the company's existing trends we can expect similar moves on the part of it in the upcoming quarters as well.The company has taken several initiatives for emphasizing its core competency areas more with heavy investments and product launches which are perceived to be the growth drivers in the coming quarters for Acxiom. The company's recent prestigious contract wins from Horizon Healthcare Services Inc. and Mindshare are also expected to positively influence Acxiom's upcoming financial performances.Although Acxiom's intent and advances towards meeting long-term goals are remarkable, we are, however, concerned about the clouded fiscal scenario prevalent in the world today which may negatively affect the company. Acxiom is very much vulnerable to several factors such as adverse foreign exchange movements and inflationary pressures which can be detrimental to the company's earnings and margins.We recently observed quite a few changes in the company's top-level management. The first of these changes was the appointment of Scott Howe as the new CEO and President. Second, Warren Jenson was also appointed as an Executive Vice President in the company. Such management shifts may have a pervasive impact on Acxiom's overall functioning, goals and investor perception. Moreover, the company's increasing focus on its core areas required high investments, due to which management declined its EPS projections for the upcoming fiscal year 2013 to a range of $0.55 - $0.65.Hence, until the situation ameliorates and a brighter picture appears on the scene, we consider it wise to maintain a sideline stance on Acxiom. In the short run, we have a Zacks #3 Rank on the stock which translates into a short-term 'Hold' rating.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Acxiom Maintained at Neutral - Analyst Blog@2012-07-12@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/acxiom-maintained-at-neutral-analyst-blog-2012-07-12
n Nov 13, we reaffirmed our Underperform recommendation on  (  ) due to its subdued fiscal 2014 second-quarter performance. Acxiom carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).On Nov 7, 2013, Acxiom, a major player in the field of marketing services and technology, announced second-quarter fiscal 2014 adjusted earnings of 20 cents per share, missing the year-ago tally by 4.8% and the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.Net income for the reported quarter dropped significantly by around 40% to $9.8 million or 13 cents per share. The year-over-year decline in reported earnings was primarily attributable to high operating and other expenses.Total revenue for second-quarter fiscal 2014 came in at $276.3 million, down 0.4% year over year owing to dismal performance in two of the three segments, namely, the IT Infrastructure Management Services and the Other Services segments.Moreover, operating margin declined to 7.1% from 10.9% in the year-ago quarter due to lower margin from the Marketing and Data Services segment, which accounted for the bulk of the revenues (around 73 %).Management also lowered its revenue guidance for fiscal 2014. Management now projects revenues to dip marginally versus the earlier projection of flat revenues. However, earnings are still expected to remain flat.In the future, Axciom intends to focus on its core areas of competency, which include database marketing and services. These new objectives are likely to involve high investments, which may adversely affect the company's profits, going forward.Following the unimpressive fiscal second-quarter results and soft outlook for the year, estimates were mostly revised downwards. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015 decreased marginally by a cent to 75 cents, over the last 30 days.Based on the poor results, bleak guidance by the management and increased price competition, we have a negative stance on the company.Stocks worth looking at in the industry are  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ).

Further, the company stated that by means of the new service, the clients will be able to optimize the use of its device information storage in a cost efficient way.In addition, the application provides a range of information about storage issues which is expected to facilitate the users to strategically use their resources for expanding their businesses. Moreover, the users can avail the application for free from the  (  ) play and  (  ) Application Store.Earlier, Unisys reported revenues of $928 million in the first quarter of 2012, up 2% from the year-ago quarter. The rise was mostly due to the high revenue in the company's U.S. Federal business, driven by continued growth in IT outsourcing and systems integration revenue. We can be hopeful of similar yields from the coming quarters accruing from such technological advancements implemented by Unisys.However, the turbulent condition prevalent in the economy may hinder the growth of Unisys in future.
