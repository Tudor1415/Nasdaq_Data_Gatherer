Our primary business is to purchase and\r\nservice retail automobile contracts originated primarily by franchised\r\nautomobile dealers and select independent dealers in the United States in the\r\nsale of new and used automobiles, light trucks and passenger vans. Through our\r\nautomobile contract purchases, we provide indirect financing to the customers of\r\ndealers who have limited credit histories or past credit problems, who we refer\r\nto as sub-prime customers. We serve as an alternative source of financing for\r\ndealers, facilitating sales to customers who otherwise might not be able to\r\nobtain financing from traditional sources, such as commercial banks, credit\r\nunions and the captive finance companies affiliated with major automobile\r\nmanufacturers. In addition to purchasing installment purchase contracts directly\r\nfrom dealers, we have also acquired installment purchase contracts in four\r\nmerger and acquisition transactions.&nbsp;&nbsp;... <a href=\"http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/edgar_conv_html%2f2020%2f03%2f16%2f0001683168-20-000831.html#FIS_BUSINESS\" target=\"_blank\">More</a> ...&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n", "KeyExecutives": [{"name": "Charles E.
