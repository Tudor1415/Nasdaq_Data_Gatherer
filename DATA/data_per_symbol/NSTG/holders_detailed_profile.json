Morgan & Co. partners Henry Sturgis Morgan (grandson of J.P. Morgan), Harold Stanley, and others, came into existence on September 16, 1935, in response to the Glass\u2013Steagall Act that required the splitting of commercial and investment banking businesses. In its first year, the company operated with a 24% market share (US$1.1 billion) in public offerings and private placements.\nThe current Morgan Stanley is the result of merger of the original Morgan Stanley with Dean Witter Discover & Co. in 1997.
