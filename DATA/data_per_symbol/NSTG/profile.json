Our core technology is a unique, proprietary optical barcoding\r\nchemistry that enables the labeling and counting of single molecules. This\r\nproprietary chemistry may reduce the number of steps required to conduct certain\r\ntypes of scientific experiments and allow for multiple experiments to be\r\nconducted at once. As a result, we are able to develop tools that are easier for\r\nresearchers to use and that may generate faster and more consistent scientific\r\nresults.\r\nWe use our technology to develop tools for scientific and clinical research,\r\nprimarily in the fields of genomics and proteomics. We currently have two\r\ncommercially available product platforms, our nCounter Analysis System and our\r\nGeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling, or DSP, system, both of which include\r\ninstruments and related consumables.&nbsp;&nbsp;... <a href=\"http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/edgar_conv_html%2f2020%2f03%2f02%2f0001401708-20-000039.html#FIS_BUSINESS\" target=\"_blank\">More</a> ...&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n", "KeyExecutives": [{"name": "Joseph M.
