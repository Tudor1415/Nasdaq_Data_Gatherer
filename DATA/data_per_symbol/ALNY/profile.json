(also referred to as Alnylam, we, our or us) is a\r\nglobal commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics\r\nbased on RNA interference, or RNAi. RNAi is a naturally occurring biological\r\npathway within cells for sequence-specific silencing and regulation of gene\r\nexpression. By harnessing the RNAi pathway, we have developed a new class of\r\ninnovative medicines, known as RNAi therapeutics. RNAi therapeutics are\r\ncomprised of small interfering RNA, or siRNA, and function upstream of\r\nconventional medicines by potently silencing messenger RNA, or mRNA, that encode\r\nfor proteins implicated in causing disease, thus preventing them from being\r\nmade. We believe this is a revolutionary approach with the potential to\r\ntransform the care of patients with genetic and other diseases.&nbsp;&nbsp;... <a href=\"http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/edgar_conv_html%2f2020%2f02%2f13%2f0001178670-20-000004.html#FIS_BUSINESS\" target=\"_blank\">More</a> ...&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n", "KeyExecutives": [{"name": "Akshay K.
