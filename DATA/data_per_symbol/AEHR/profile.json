We\r\ndevelop, manufacture and sell systems that are designed to reduce the cost of\r\ntesting and to perform reliability screening and stress testing, burn-in or\r\ncycling, of homogeneous and heterogenous logic and memory integrated circuits\r\n(ICs), sensors and optical devices. These systems can be used to simultaneously\r\nperform parallel testing and burn-in of packaged ICs, singulated bare die or ICs\r\nstill in wafer form. The expanding automotive, mobility, networking, and\r\ntelecommunications markets require ICs that meet increased quality and\r\nreliability specifications. To meet these needs, IC manufacturers are increasing\r\ncapacity and performing additional testing and burn-in of their products,\r\ncreating opportunities for Aehr Test products in package and wafer-level\r\ntesting.&nbsp;&nbsp;... <a href=\"http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/edgar_conv_html%2f2019%2f08%2f28%2f0001654954-19-010095.html#FIS_BUSINESS\" target=\"_blank\">More</a> ...&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n", "KeyExecutives": [{"name": "David L.
